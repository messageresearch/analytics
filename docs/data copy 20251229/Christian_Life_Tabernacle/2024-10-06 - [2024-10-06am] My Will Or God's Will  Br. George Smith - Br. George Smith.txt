we're always happy to have them with us we're going to dedicate William you know I'm kind of getting afraid to hold these kids nowadays they just squirm so uh but I'm going to ask and we're going to ask Gary to pray but I I found I wanted to read a little scripture over William in my heart and and trust that this will be U um always in his heart it's Psalms 92 and it says it is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord and to sing praises unto the name oh most high to showeth forth loving kindness in the morning and thy faithfulness every evening and I pray that that's his portion that's his place that's his spirit that he'll be a real blessing and praise the Lord with all of his heart and and to show forth loving kindness in the morning in faithfulness every night and we just pray that would be his place so at this time we all [Applause] job is to look after me you don't think okay here we go his job is to look after me and and we know that's a big job like Roger said it's hard to be brother David's friend so uh we know how that is but uh God makes us the way he makes us and he made William here just the way that he wanted him to be he put every attribute in him that he wants to show forth and as he grows into the statue that God has for him to be uh we pray that he's a Shining Light so Brother Gary if you would dedicate him uh first and then we'll all pray together

Christ we pray amen hallelujah God bless you so much praise the Lord dear amen happy to be in the house of the Lord amen amen I'm I'm just so happy to to see the good things of the Lord the Lord's good I wanted to be with you Wednesday night I I went to the dentist I called the dentist and I said I have to preach Wednesday night she says well come on in she said uh you you have your appointment at 3 o'clock they said uh everything will be wore off in just two hours I can't get you know well that's when my appointment was of course the dentist don't get to you for 45 minutes later you know the nurse plays with you and get text at your blood pressure and then so he gave me a shot you know I didn't even think I was going to get a shot and he put this Nitric I thought it was nitrous acid or whatever it is but but anyway he said just breathe this I'm breathing that he gives me a shot and then he says uh does your tongue feel numb yet and in your or is it tingling and I said no I I don't uh I don't sense anything he says well I better give you a little more well the reason I couldn't know my tum I couldn't feel the thing and so now I'm double doed and uh um and he's grinding in there you know what I mean and I didn't I didn't know what I was in finally I called Billy I said Billy I wanted to play this portion of tape but I didn't sound like that and uh so I I felt real bad that I couldn't make it but uh uh a service was still wonderful amen this book uh how can I overcome has meant a lot to me and and of course we know this is our cosin's last Sunday um with us you know so I know there's some sadness but uh um you know we have a promise that our sadness will be turned to Joy and so we we want cosmin to know that uh he'll always have a place to return When the work is done and to a people that love him and that he has served well so uh cosbin when the Lord's done with you in Romania you know where to come amen we'll receive you back like the prodal son and we'll kill the fatted calf for you my brother so we want you to know that that we certainly love you um Amen brother BR makes this statement and out of the message how can I overcome he says notice overcome the god that's in you is greater than the one that's in him the god of the world is not as great as the god of Heaven which is in you no more than Darkness can stand in the presence of light that's now dark Ness cannot stand in the presence of light I don't care how dark it is light will put it out hallelu it can't stand Glory but you take as much Darkness you want to and try to stand against light one time see what happened amen amen this morning all of our Lives as hard as we try we sometimes seem to have dark spots or we go through dark times and I and the our messenger said how do you overcome he said take that darkness and put it up against the light and watch what happens you take your trial this morning you take what what you're going through you even take the sin that so easily beset you and the failures you've made the disappointment that you have in yourself maybe a life situation a job a a a marriage trouble a family trouble it doesn't matter what it is if you take that darkness and you place it in the in the light of God's word amen watch what happen and the gospel is the light Jesus says I am the light of the world we believe that I am the way the truth the life those are all the great promises that we have this morning in hearing the word of God in the word of God is life this morning the word of God is your answer so whatever God's put on brother George's heart we know it's the word of God and we know that word of God can be light and the beautifulness of the word of God is that the presence of the holy spirit is with his word and no matter what it is what what what gospel scripture it is the great Holy Spirit has the great ability to take that word and mold it and and fit it to your ear and your heart to to feed you and to meet your word we would say oh what he's going to say is it is is just like a fact no it's not a fact it's more than a fact it's eternal life Hallelujah and it's a life that can reach the every spot Amen in every corner and and and and drive out Darkness this morning right so okay you know I I just thought this morning when brother George first came and I first met brother George him and his wife uh came to see us and I never could figure why they would even come by Fort Worth but Lord let them by Fort word and brother George our church was no bigger than this platform the whole church I'm serious it was 11 ft wide that's how long it was and it was probably about from that to that where the pulpit was and we just had 9ft Rose coming off one side of the wall and and brother George came then and and I told him this morning I said you know you you've you've seen me and stuck with us for Hallelujah 46 years now Lord and uh and I believe God had a purpose in it because he knew that you would be here to morning and that he could minister to you through our brother so let the word of God reach out to your life this morning know I don't care what it is on your mind you might think it's hopeless but remember the light of God's word will defeat Darkness Hallelujah every time and the Lord Jesus welcomes you he doesn't want to lose a one of you he's knocking the hold the sin against you because he paid for it he wants you to accept him this morning and accept his word so let us stand together this morning as I hope I can say this that I invite my friend someone who's been faithful to our body here and we certainly uh trust that his goodness is with us and he just didn't come in the good times I want you to know that he just didn't show up when things were good he was here with us when there was nothing and so he he just shares a part in that and he shares a part and I'd like to sing that song as he comes there is a blood amen how many believe that this morning yes sir there is a [Music] my is when it flow down from the cross my sins were G my sins for God there is hallelujah this precious BL that me but in three days he bring the Hallelujah and Rose to stand in Mighty F so I come to tell you he's a lie to tell you that it's right every the fall so I come to tell you that he SA to shout and to Proclaim that is coming back for you there is a that the it heals us the it has the power to fre the my has chain [Music] of above the ground so Hallelujah to C my soul oh and let it liqu Oh Glory Glory oh because he to make me I oh my life I oh my heart so I come tell you he alive tell that he Dr [Music] amen and amen do you all believe that it's not just a song it's reality there's a Risen Savior and that's why we're here today let's turn our Bible to Proverbs Chapter 12 it's good to be here I first time I've ministered in the new church and I'm glad that everybody's got a seat nobody's stuck in another room looking at a monitor I can see you all amen thank Brother David for the confidence he's got the will only speak the word Proverbs 12 verse verse uh let's see 12 where we at Proverbs 14 and 12 yeah 1412 is where we're going there's a way which seeth right unto a man but the end thereof or the ways of death the title is my will or God's will now turn over here about 100 Pages or more to Jonah it's one of the last books of the Old test Testament Jonah is our brother he's waiting for us in glory and he had an interesting life today Sunday we're going to have Sunday school so pay attention Jonah chapter 1 and verse one now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Amita saying arise get up go over to Nineveh that great City and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your mercy to us today we thank you Lord that you gave each one of us the desire to be in the house of the Lord we could be a lot of places but your spirit brought us here Lord you've given me some words that I want to share with your people but only your spirit can drive it into the human heart and make it real to them your Prophet told us very clearly that the job of the minister is to make Christ real to the people he had his way brother David's got a way I've got a way the Lord we want to make you real to your people bless each Soul help us together we ask in jesus' name amen you may be seated want to congratulate you on the new building and how God has blessed and brought more people in and brother David's wondering where we going to put everybody God has a way yes sir preach hard some will leave the church the church is like a hospital now there's nobody out there at the door uh I'll see your papers and see your P of card no everybody's welcome but the word going forth will decide who stays and who leaves you don't have to worry about that God Will Make A Way okay our scene today is our brother Jonah he was an Israelite from a small town called goer which is north of Nazareth up in Galilee and he was the first foreign missionary okay he was comfortable here but God spoke to him in very clear language there was no praying there was no fasting you go there and so a missionary is an apostle now I didn't write the Bible but in the Bible Paul putting things together he says first is the missionary the Apostle then the prophet so forth so brother brother brandom even said it's the high highest calling amongst the ministerial gifts brother brandom also says I believe that every Christian that's everyone here all you watching online every Christian is obligated not so much that you have to go over to the old country and preach but if you cannot go you can help send somebody else everybody is not called right some are called to sit still and help send the one that is going everybody should hear the gospel at least once I want to do my part and there's something about missionary work that I just love it he says just to know that what you're doing you're doing God's will when you're giving to missions I didn't write that either you want to say what he says fine I've been at this over 50 years let's say what he says am okay so m AR work isn't only traveling to some hot disgusting humid place no where they haven't even heard of air conditioners yet I've been to those places you're sleeping on a board you know the man is only that thick but um you know some places where they don't speak your language don't eat your same food missionary work is living for others right here in Dallas when you walk out those doors you're are displaying something either disgust because Brother David didn't shake your hand oh yeah there's people like that or some bad attitude or glory to God we heard from God he spoke to me directly and you're out there sharing the gospel with others just by showing up you know and you know everybody wants eternal life if you sat over here at the corner and stopped everybody do you want everybody wants their eternal life everybody would like to go to heaven they don't want to go today huh maybe tomorrow or next week after I go to the beach or whatever that's the way people think but you know the scripture says in Proverbs 29:18 without a vision the people perish that's right when you're just going around and you're a little circle driving your nice car and coming to church that's good but are you living for others so we have many missionary projects you all been very good in helping us and we're trying to equip believer witnessing material something they can share I had a man helping me with my house years ago when we were building our house and he was electrician and he knew the Believers in the area and he said now George they tell me that your father-in-law was the prophet of God yeah do you have something I can understand now these guys they gave me a seal book I don't understand that you don't start with the Seven Seals no you start with the five comings of Elijah it's in everybody's Bible oh yeah let's start there so we're trying to help others share their faith now maybe you don't know this but you know English is not the predominant language of the world Hindi over in India that's number one language of the world people speak it Mandarin in China That's number two millions of people speak that language it doesn't even not even close to English English is only spoken by 17% of the people on the planet third most spoken language Spanish is 8% the fourth most SP spoken language so there's a lot to do now the reason we have a Bible is because some people have died for this Bible that's right it didn't just float in one day no people have died getting in it into your language now this Bible was important because it was written over a period of 1500 years by 40 different authors writers in three continents three languages and the whole thing points to Jesus Christ it is very important there's nothing like it in the whole world so brother Ram says over here on that day on Calvary he was just one man the perfect man he gave his life made an example for you now what must we do now the first thing I want to say Jes Jesus never lived for himself we live for oursel we got to have the finest we got have the best our car has to be polished but Jesus didn't live for himself his life was spent for others that is perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and do good things that's fine but when you just live your life to yourself that is not eternal life eternal life is living for others I trust you've heard some of these things before but you're going to hear it maybe a little differently today so all you got to do is pi attention now I didn't bring my level but would you poke that guy he's going to sleep already yeah we have ways it proved when he came as the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he didn't he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day on Calvary and you don't live to yourself anymore but you live for others okay so let's let's get back to Jonah this is all going to make sense eventually but you got to pay attention so Jonah had a direct commission from God God spoke to his Prophet directly he didn't have to guess he didn't have to pray go preach to the enemy their wickedness has come up before me I can't stand it anymore go preach repentance but there was one simple problem Jonah was Jewish and the people in Nineveh were not Jewish they were Gentiles very serious segregation okay and so things were out of balance so Nineveh at that time was the capital of Assyria currently Northern Iraq okay they were very Wicked sinful people very cruel violent city of over 120,000 people it's a large city it took 3 days to walk around it and so these Assyrians were constantly tormenting and oppressing the Israelites this didn't happen just in these last 50 years those 3,000 years ago they've constantly been tormenting God's people and they never have learned God is with these people this week they sent 1,800 expensive Rockets into a little bitty Israel and only one person died and he was a bad boy that was out on the street in Jericho when he should have been hiding there's many miracles have happened in this last year during this war am we'll read about it someday but anyway this started way back there so God is sending his Prophet right into the jaws of danger to face the enemy go cry against it it was time for repentance warning before judgment God always warns before judgment just like when you raise your children don't do that because this is going to happen but kids you know they tried it anyway then they get the whiping you were warned God always warns before judgment when he was here in the flesh in Israel preached everywhere but there was three towns that just couldn't get with the program and he condemned them they had plenty of warning had plenty of Miracles beida cim and capernium blasted them life went on sun came up the next day 60 years later came the earthquake and it all went to rocks you know and so God always remembers his word that's right and today Israel they have rebuilt every place everything's you know according to scripture but those three little places viida corim and capernium nothing it's a pile of rocks because it was condemned you know brother Brandon preached a long time ago exactly 59 years ago ago in Los Angeles the message called choosing of a bride yeah brother David's very familiar today there's big chunks falling off expensive homes falling into the ocean brother brand said it' be a chunk 3 to 400 miles wide 1500 miles long FEMA or nobody else can solve that no sir no it's going to be bad but it's going to happen yes sir that's right I know people that live over there please come visit us well maybe if I can get the next flight out but I have no business over there so why is this important to us in 2024 well the scripture says in 1 Corinthians all these things happen back there for examples and they're written for our admonition for our learning who upon whom the ends of the world are come when Paul wrote that that was 2,000 years ago but we are living in the time when it is very important we are the end time generation the end of the everything is at the door the world is falling apart now maybe you lived under a rock and you Haven noticed that but it's falling apart now what we need is a strong shaking to shake off the shackles of sin shake off the attitude of no concern who cares we don't just need a trimming we need a cutting away of the idol no interest attitudes and the idolatry yeah look that up on your smartphone one day brother R has a lot to say about idolatry it's not just over there at the Catholic church with with the image up here no it's everywhere we got people burning candles to William rand's picture right now we got people burning candles to the tapes what is this Catholic Spirit again they let it in how do we get it out so it's far beyond the time of aspirin or alco celer or pat on the back you won't be a okay we need major surgery we need the truth we can't afford to go on playing church it's high time to seek the presence of God in your individual lives Brother David can't do everything he's doing good keep himself standing up and preaching the gospel but he can't run your life you've got to seek God you see so we want to know God's will for our individual lives that's what we really want 1 John 4:20 says if a man says I love God oh yes I love God but he hates his brother because brother did something he's a liar right I'm a liar for how can he love uh for he that loveth not his brother whom he can see how can he love God whom he hasn't seen so however we treat each other okay believer to believer that's how we treat God everybody's nice to Brother David everybody's nice to brother Billy what about each other amen what about inviting somebody out to lunch that you you don't really like or you don't know real well it's okay these are brothers and sisters you know so God is watching our reaction to every test you see God put everything in order he could put the right person in the white house he could put everything in order in the next two hours no he lets it go and go and go when are you going to figure this out Lord he lets it Go and he's watching reactions of the people you see so um Jonah was God's man of the hour okay he had a clear-cut decision from God go cry against their sin and their corruption I know about the segregation I know about your fears your doubts go anyway okay he had it very clear and so that's what happened in verse two go preach to that City but the verse three says but Jonah you see when we start this sentence with but we know there's a problem right he's not willing to just get with the program but Jonah now he wasn't just anybody this is God's man of the hour he's God's Prophet he's God's mouthpiece but Jonah rose up to obey God that's not what it says to flee unto Tarsus from the presence of the Lord underline and went down to the coast where the boats are he found a ship that's going to tarus so he paid the fair yeah he got in his pocket got some tithe money out paid the fair yeah I'm going to go as a tourist and he went into the boat to go with them to tarus and for the second time if you weren't paying attention from the presence of the Lord is serious yes sir now I've studied this up on the map okay so we're in Dallas so God says I want you to go to St Louis and preach to these people I've had it with them you go preach so Jonah oh but Lord you know he goes to El Paso instead 180° obviously not what God Said from the presence of the Lord it's looking bad so it didn't break the relationship it only broke the fellowship he's still God's man you're still God's child but if you go on a detour there'll be a price to pay that's right it might feel good for a while you might have you know 5,000 in the bank whatever there'll be a price to pay you know so um our Prophet says and you can go look it up anointed prophets make wrong decisions they're human that's right they're not Divine they don't want candles burned to them they're very human so here's Jonah he goes and he pays the you know the tourist Fair he gets on the boat and he goes down gets in his bunk ah this is nice yeah nice now these Merchants these aren't cruise ships like we have today this is a merchant ship and they're carrying grain from the Middle East over to Rome and other places this could be a a 100 ft long or whatever you know a big wooden ship and they could carry up to 100 or 200 tons of grain they have a purpose there's people waiting for the Grain and here's this tourist okay so they go along now they watch for the for the climate you can study it there's only certain months of the year that they could go they didn't have a they didn't have a motor they're waiting on the on wind you know and so there's certain months that they don't go at all but this is time when they normally can go so they're watching the weather well they get out there uh to the about the end of the first day and here's this huge storm they weren't expecting and um so remember we got God's Prophet down here asleep big storm boat starts rocking they start throwing stuff out because they don't want to sink the ship and they're praying to their gods nothing happens and so they said where is that tourist that we let on oh yeah let's go find him so they go get this tourist up here now he didn't have his Prophet suit on okay he was trying to sneak in like I'm I'm just one of the guys you know one of the brothers and so he he sneaks in so they get him wow storm yeah pray to your God I don't need to pray I already know what the problem is I'm the problem you know now God knows all the details of your individual lives amen even for little kids older people he knows the details so God had this special fish we're not going to worry about what his name is the special fish is swimming right alongside the boat cuz he knows God knows I got to have him near the boat cuz he's going to swallow the prophet here in a few minutes so Jonah um he confesses throw me overboard now the scripture says they tied his hands and his feet so he's not going anywhere he can't even swim throw him into the water he barely got wet because the fish was right there now he's inside the fish now he didn't know he thought he was going to drown he thought this is end of me poor me no bad you because you made a wrong decision but uh now he's inside the fish well um you know he was like Peter warming at the fire trying to pretend like he's one of the guys no he's God's Prophet he's somebody special so God had this fish it says in verse 17 a great fish to swallow up Jonah so you see with our God there's no surprises he's got it all mapped out he knows where you're going to have lunch he knows that the kids are going to make a mess somebody's going to knock over the Pepsi God got all this figured out it's for your patience you know God puts hard-headed people in some Churches you know why for the Perfection of the pastor everybody's not a nice sheep like you are but there's some people that they come along and they just just an aggravation sometimes but that's for his Perfection see well anyway so back to our story here um so now Jonah's in the fish and there's no light the miracle is that there was oxygen he could stay alive now he doesn't know how long he's going to be there he's in there there's no light can't see a thing all he can do is feel it's pretty soft over here pretty soft you know and he's he's up to probably up to his waist in in fish vomit yeah you got to be honest with reality and um well this isn't part of the bargain now he doesn't know it's only going to be three days I mean you can hold your breath for a while but um but he's in this mess and uh he couldn't see you know symptoms were everywhere and so um the next time you think you have it bad because your $50,000 RV won't won't start up or you have two flat tires tomorrow morning or whatever your problem is you got nothing compared to Jonah he didn't have a cell phone he didn't have a v he didn't have an iPad he had nothing okay and so he had plenty of time to reflect on his actions you know back here in verse three but Jonah arose to flee yeah 180 degrees different it wasn't just 10 miles no 180 de he had seaweed all around his neck and um fish belly everywhere things were looking good it's very dark and so uh he he didn't matter if his eyes were open or closed he couldn't see anything anyway and he said these symptoms are all lying vanities he was at the bottom of the sea inside the fish's belly up to his waist and vomit yeah you can't get much lower than that these are all lying vanities he was very much alive he could touch he could taste so TI I'll show you know couldn't see he could hear he could smell but God supplied the oxygen he he he could praise God you know because this wasn't part of the bargain you know you know I thought things would be different you know according to my calculations and what I figured out hey over these 46 years that I've known David we have known people that have figured a lot of things out but they came to a certain place and they went right off the edge it didn't work out the way they thought you know so Solomon said all is Vanity it'll all come to zero so the symptoms were very real he had to ignore the present reality and focus his mind on the word of God that he had stored in his mind your Prophet said read your Bible and pray because there might come a day like Jonah when you can't read your Bible when you don't have your iPad you don't have your $1 thousand phone to go check things out you might be totally like some of my friends over in North Carolina in Tennessee right now they're cut off no electricity no or no phone or nothing it's coming so he had no prophetic transcript didn't have no pictures he had nothing he got real serious about praying but he didn't know it was only going to be three days he thought this was the end you know Prophet says Devils Tremble When the weakest of saints goes to their knees what a power and a privilege has been given to the Church of the Living God when you fall to your knees in prayer even the devil's tremble the weakest of the Christian that do that the devil's tremble in another place the weakest Christian here tonight can defeat Satan anywhere any place any time under any conditions with thus sayith the Lord but you better be sure it's thus sayith the Lord and not thus sayith Grandma cuz her words ain't going to carry much weight you got to know that you know that you know okay so why is Jonah in this situation why is he in this pickle okay apparently you know just on the surface it looked like he shered away he evaded his duty he ran from responsibility he ran from the presence of God twice in one verse ran from the will of God he opted for his own will yeah God said St Louis but you know over here in El Paso they speak my language a little better and I think I can do better over there Lord all due respect but I think I'll go that way instead watch out you know only the fellowship was broken not the relationship and every one of you had to make a choice today you know people on virtual they can click the button right now and go to somebody else they go they go see some real preachers but God's got them locked in you know so people can stay in bed they can stay on the couch with their favorite remote control because we got three kinds of Believers everywhere there's three kinds of Believers sitting here and so if you look this way you're going to see some yeah okay we you look this well that's don't don't worry about them who are you which one are you that's God will seek you out okay so Jonah had to make a choice he was willing to pay the price and go his own way remember our title my will or God's will he just didn't have any idea how high the price is going to be you see he chose to go in the opposite direction and he probably thought well there's probably a lot of sinful people over in Tarsus I'll go preach to them not so much hassle not so much opposition and God would have blessed his word yeah you preach the word whether it's here or out on the street or wherever God will bless the word see but obedience is far better than sacrifice and I'm sure we could come up with a lot of testimonies because you know if we put the microscope on the Catholic church or all the Baptists in Dallas or any of these groups um they're using the same Bible it's not a different Bible I mean from here to South Carolina they'll fight you for a King James Bible you know they know the Bible many are being blessed there's healing there's Miracles they believe they're approaching God God honors faith brother brand says God ignores your Doctrine we know people given their life for their Doctrine they'll fight and kill that's why all the wars over religion God ignores your Doctrine but he gave the Holy Ghost to those who obey him okay uh message thirsting for life and this great Pillar of Fire the angel of God the lcos that went out from God that led the children of Israel through the Wilderness when it came amongst the people it separated itself and great looks of fire came down on each one as a pillar of fire began to break up God dividing himself among his people that ought to tear the heart out of anybody God tearing himself apart that he might divide himself a little bit with each one of us now we appreciate it but the fact that God you know is separating himself for us he says can you see now why I'm standing for the unity of every church that's not the end of the sentence that would be very charismatic can you see why I'm standing for the unity of every church every Full Gospel Church every believer we have to be of one heart one mind one Accord no matter how much we differ in the scriptures or our favorite quotations or our favorite preacher whatever he says that that might be one might see it this way other see it that way has nothing to do with it but in principle we ought to stand as one Mighty Army of God marching on because each one of you in your peculiarity now look I've been working with brother R's words for over 50 years putting it English into Spanish it's not easy putting Kentucky English into readle Spanish and when a new word comes up like peculiarity it's obvious so he says um because each one of you in your pecularity God has proved that he's ignoring your Doctrine because he gave you the Holy Ghost and the Bible said he gave the Holy Ghost to them that obey him acts 532 now if I obey him in my peculiar way and you obey him in your peculiar way he gave us both the Holy Ghost so we ought to be Christian and Brethren and sister enough to arm up and March together for one great purpose the gospel say what he said so but you see unto us that have been called to this glorious gospel he has revealed the mysteries of the Kingdom he has a plan the Bible is in portions we're in the seventh age we receive the fullness and God has not he doesn't hold those people out there accountable for what you know there's many things that we believe it's not even for them there's things brother Brandon preaches like in the 70 weeks in the Feast of trumpets that's for Israel he's just painting the picture we're not going to be a part of that but he's giving you the full counsel okay so God has a perfect will and a permissive will for each one of us okay get that straight does God change his mind we try to work on God's permissive will and he will permit it but also if we take his permissive will though it's not exactly right he will make his permissive will work out to together to glorify his perfect will he does care his word will come to pass and you are not going to thwart his program I don't care who you are there is a price and it'll be much higher than you can imagine there God changed his mind 1965 we must submit ourselves to his will and to his word don't question it just believe it don't try to find a way around it just take it the way it is so many wants to go around go go some other way and when you do you find yourself going on you find God blessing you but you're working in his permissive will and not in his perfect will he will let you do it so the question is I've been many countries how can we know for sure which is God's perfect will okay God's word is his will but this is a a lot of verses it's a lot of chapters how are you going to know well here's something you can write down see if it works for you God's word God's spirit and God's will always run in parallel they don't cross not one going one way no they always run in parallel you see they agree the word the will and the spirit run in harmony we got some fantastic musicians over here but if one shows up one day well I've had enough of this stuff I'm going to play the way I really want to let's see how that works out doesn't work no in Harmony in parallel some people have a portion of the word memorized to the very letter and if you don't line up out of here you know but their wires are crossed and they display a contrary Spirit even when they're quoting the very word you see so there's no harmony with the rest of the word produces bad fruit and the results are contrary to the word in John chapter 4 when Jesus is dealing with the woman at the well which is one of the examples Brother Brad mentions almost on every tape Jesus said to the woman at the well you remember we don't even know her name do we yes she's very famous amongst us and he said to her now look honey God is searching for those that will worship Him in spirit and in truth not all Spirit not all truth it's got to be balanced that's how they built this place here with the level it's got to be balanced the sound's got to be balanced the Lightning's got to be balanced it's all about balance you know okay so how do we know which is God's perfect will they asked brother R the same question 1961 how do you feel is the best way to find God the Lord's perfect will in some important matters good question all of our matters are important aren't they I tell you dear friend the best way to find the will of God in some important matters is prayer yes and immediately we think of non yeah now non I know you're dirty so you go in the river Lord I took a bath this morning so people say prayer well I'm always praying okay so there's one here's the way I do it I take it before the Lord it's always been my strength what prayer I wait upon the Lord to see what he says so we got prayer and we got wait and I just let myself be new neutral to it well that neutral part is very difficult when you want the red Tesla but your your economy gives you a a three-year-old Ford pickup it's it's and you're supposed to be neutral but you're supposed to pray and um be patient you know wait on him and be neutral okay don't take either side so if I was in your place it didn't have these Visions so he didn't have a handicap you know I would just wait on the Lord and say now Lord you show me what's the decision to make and then the way you feel led do it no wait a little bit and wait what's this waiting business hey if there's four cars at the GU you know coffee I'll go cross the street and get something different we don't wait we want it now wait a little while longer see which way a father in my heart you know it doesn't matter I want to know what you want to do about it if you all you young people would would even take half of that and apply it to your life you'd be a lot happier I can give you a list of people I heard of one case just just this week Preacher's Daughter thought she really loved this guy well the dad could see a little bit farther than she could that's always the case and she was probably beautiful etc etc but the dad could see this is this is bad news he offered her just before before the wedding he offered her here here's a check $20,000 walk away nope going through within the year she was beat up with a 2x4 sad sad sad case pray do what the prophet says so with Jonah God did make his permissive will turn around to accomplish his perfect will amen yeah he uh he's in the he's in the fish and verse 10 here of chapter two and the Lord spoke to the fish now if you don't believe in the Supernatural you're in the wrong Church to begin with amen God spoke to the fish that he created and His prophets inside that's right and what the fish do after God spoke to him vomited Jonah upon on dry land now if you ever made a long trip with little kids and they got too much coke or too much sugar things can happen right well here's Jonah he is totally totally covered in fish vomit and because of what the fish heard from God okay sir so he turns towards dry land which he's in the water he don't know where dry land okay there's dry land like a missile and he hits the dry sand starts rolling he is a mess the only solution is take this guy down to the car was and put him through there right so okay so he goes and gets cleaned up gets some clean clothes Gets a Haircut verse one of chapter 3 and the word of the Lord came again came into Jonah the second time okay you might not have the luxury of a second opportunity let me give you a little story a long time ago 1950 5 um the movie came out the Ten Commandments we've all seen most of it or all of it four hours and some people at the Tabernacle in Jeffersonville had snuck over to new alany and seen the film and so they come back and told Brother Brown oh it's great film you got to see it so he you know got his family together which is him and his wife and uh been nine-year-old Rebecca so they go down to the theater and um so they they're watching the film and it's a small theater I've been there it's like a third of this right here it's a very small place this 55 and so when the when the pillar of fire comes on the screen they were inspired so perfectly brother Brown thought it was a real thing he jumps up took his hat off oh it's a film okay so sits back down okay so they watched the whole thing and now they're on the way back to the house after 4-Hour film and Rebecca being very sensitive she was crying crying well dear what what's the matter you know Daddy just took you to the movies we don't ever do this but you know well she thought it was like a newsreel you know she didn't think of Hollywood and so she says but Dad didn't you see Moses said now all you on the Lord's Side come with me so pronouncing those words we're all watching them well she was watching these people back here they were you know holding back a little bit and she was feeling sorry for them so he stopped the car he said okay now I want you to pay attention you saw those people waiting you might not have a second chance when God speaks you do it the first time now you know so Jonah got himself together and he went and preached under a very powerful anointing chapter 3 5-10 records the reaction of the people to the preaching of the word of God greatest Revival in recorded history entire city of 120,000 people turned to God and kept back the wrath of God they had a choice repent or perish with the unbeliever right but guess what happened about 150 years later the entire city departed from what happened back there with grma 150 years ago they forgot about the mercy and the Forgiveness of God and God permitted the Babylonians to come in the year 621 BC and utterly destroy the city and so devastating was that destruction that the ruins were not even discovered until just over a 100 years ago they didn't have bulldozers they didn't have Dynamite I don't know what they did but it was you know 2500 years nobody knew where it was they had such a hatred to destroy and it's on your phone and on your TV every night what's going on over there right now hatred to destroy you would think if people had any Common Sense okay we've got 1,00 Rockets we sent in we didn't kill anybody what's going on and yet we can send you know Israel can send one rocket and take out their main man wouldn't you think okay there's something going on here why don't we just go back home and take care of the garden leave those people alone no hatred to destroy even scoffield says such is the way of God light rejected brings destruction but see first you have to reject then God okay so brother Bram said in 1956 this year will be decisive either America will decide to stay with God or depart and of course they departed and we've lived long enough now to see the results of those decisions it's Insanity because in 1964 he said right here in Dallas I believe it was he said if things go on the way they are right now in 50 Years it'll be Total Insanity that Circle was closed in 2014 we've been 10 years in Total Insanity look at it so God always warns first we're seeing the prophecy fulfilled so Jonah was in fact a very crucial part of a larger picture so much so that was repeated in the New Testament by our Lord in Matthew chap 12 so here's the lesson when you don't fully understand an issue whether it's in your family whether it's in the pastor's family whatever when you don't fully understand an issue be careful amen scripture says I'm God you're not he still I got it figured out whatever you're seeing could be part of a much larger picture you see and God allows scenes to play out oh that doesn't look right don't worry he lets it play out watching for reactions along the way so uh God has not called me or you to straighten things up out all the items that I think are out of order if it was up to me I told my brother-in-law Billy years ago I said you know if I was God I'd wipe this thing clean right now but I'm not God I don't have the patience of God you know it would seem that God's man God's prophet of the age his anointed messenger it looks like he was backsliding and stepped out of the will of God it would seem that way because we as Mortals with a little Canary brain and I know there's people here with great education great SUV etc etc etc okay but we all have a canary brain we're small creatures and we don't have all the facts now we would like to control things so we have all the facts but it doesn't happen forget it we make need your reactions and judgments with only a little bit of the information and we're wrong you see very few people in any given generation recognize the value of the message of God during their day that they live we look back and uh we can look perfectly backwards but we miss what's going on right now I mean when you consider the gospel has been um uh preached for 2,000 years the fact that we have a perfect Bible that's already translated into 750 languages why didn't everybody believe why do we still have missionaries in Haiti in Philippines they should have had them all baptized by now because we're fighting against evil spirits you see so it would seem that this man was backsliding because we as Mortals don't have all the facts we make these judgments and very few people recognize what God is doing in present day okay Simeon lived near the temple in other words he lived right next door to the church back then and he was old and God spoke to him and son I know you're old but you're not going to die until you see my provision for Israel and so God gave him some kind of sign we don't know what it was so every time that there was baby dedication let's say on Thursday or whatever he'd go out and he'd look no no sign today well one day he's out there he saw the sign that God showed him he walked up to Mary Mary was dressed like everybody else no no gold chains no nothing and um can I hold the baby well sure so only Simeon and Mary and Joseph knew what was going on nobody else and he took the baby and he said my eyes have seen thy salvation let thy servant depart in peace thousands of people okay but only a few saw what was really going on and so he was very ridiculed but he knew what he was talking about okay questions and answers 57 this city Jeffersonville at the day of the judgment will answer a great price someday there have been hundreds and hundreds outstanding healings done right here signs and wonders the appearing of the Angel over at the river and the paper blasted it forth and everything and still people don't believe why is it now someday I'm going to leave here I'm 48 years old right now why didn't the world recognize that picture right there why didn't they catch these things quickly why don't they catch these other things why don't they catch these prophecies and things you know they can't do it now but one day I'm going to leave this world and when I leave they'll recognize some of you young people will see that after I'm gone this day that scripture is being fulfilled the message is around the world in over 40 languages to the english- speaking world there's no excuse whatsoever a couple things I want to share Harvest Time 1964 but what did the lutherans do after the death of Martin Luther they met Satan and made a denomination and died never done anything else just to become a great mass of people two tapes and I've mentioned this before but there's people that forgotten new people two tapes you need to listen to soon are the two tapes from April of 1963 they're the messages immediately after the seals he's over in Albuquerque one of them is world falling apart he says you might not believe what I've just said but this is taped listen to it a few years from today if there is such and then you'll know whether it is true or not one day when the evening lights are breaking and it's too late then you'll say that man could have been right but it's too late then just exactly like Jesus said when he was here on Earth quote God sent you prophets down Through the Ages Every time the world system you know falling apart and what did you do with each one God sent you the prophet you all killed them put him in the grave and then in about another generation you wake up and realize oh that was a prophet and then what do you do you garnish the tomb oh yeah what do you do you make a tradition of his life and people that is what has happened today with William brandham now I'm one of the few eyewitnesses left I knew the man I talked to him I have memories but people have made a tradition of his life that is exactly what Israel done with Moses they made a tradition of his life for for thousands of years every Saturday yesterday they meet around the world in synagogues see there's only one Temple it's destroyed so they meet in synagogues around the world and they read a portion of their little spoken word book Moses said Moses said now they have a calendar that you can get and it shows you what portion to read for that Saturday that's called organized religion that's not called Unity of spirit they made a tradition of his life and that's the way we do with Martin Luther John Wesley and other men huh wonder who that'd be yeah William Brandon right always looking back making a tradition of their life garnishing the tombs and their message was for another day by the time you wake up that day's lived on and we're in another day the whole system has worked that way since the beginning man-made systems we're in that wake up get in the word the whole promise of Malachi I'm going to send you Elijah he going to bring you back to the original but we're so busy burning candles to William brandom said no back to the Bible over 200 times back to the word so may God help us when we don't have all the facts be careful so Jonah was God's Prophet but as human he looked for the easy way just like we do if you go to Papados after a while and they say it'll be 20 minutes forget that we'll go over here there thousand restaurants when you know in two miles from here so um he was human he looked for the easy way no pressure he wanted people to agree with him he wanted pat on the back many times God will indicate his will then we go and we discuss it with the relatives we discuss it with the people in church friends we're looking for consensus we want somebody to agree with us you know and we look for the easy way brother Brandon says you have to struggle to do the will of God sometimes it's not always easy but it does produce the best fruits so we have many people today that um we want to call a message Believers but after you're around them 30 minutes they're only book carriers or tablet carriers now Believers act a little different but they're willfully by their own will they're climbing onto boats that look like the ship of Zion it says you know end time whatever and yeah people dress right and they look pretty good and people girls have long hair but eventually it's going somewhere else yeah it's not sticking with the with the gospel it's not balanced so friends you can have a leading you can have a Doctrine right out of the pages of the Bible bible promises out of the Bible but if it's not in the proper season flowing in the economy and the plan of God for the hour you will be fighting the will of God you be fleeing from the presence of the Living God thinking and believing you're right you'll be choosing your will not God's will you haven't rightfully divided the word of Truth and there will be a price to pay okay Revelation chapter 4 nowadays well we don't believe in saying hell in the Pulpit we need men of God men who won't hold back we got to speak the truth regardless we're not here to make everybody happy we're not here to pass out you know candy bars no this is church he says here now everybody can't be a preacher but you've got a voice if you're if you're a preacher you're called to the P to preach if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people a sermon let your sermon be lived and it's the voice of God that'll bring a reproach to them who reject it just live your sermon when your ladies go to Walmart and you have your hair you got your dress many people will come oh God bless you okay they just signed their ticket you know make it easier to heaven but the ones that laugh at you they're going the other way and you didn't have to say a word just just show up the preacher called to preach his sermon and live it also if you can't live it then stop preaching but just supposed to live your sermons how we need in Jeffersonville and Dallas thousands of lived voices God on display let's say the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness Holiness Purity undefiled lives walking around the earth without a blemish real Christians that's the Thunder against the enemy the devil doesn't care how loud you can holler the devil doesn't care how high you can jump how much you can do that or the other What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything you want to him call him anything he's just as sweet as can be moves right on that throws him that's the Thunder that shakes the devil your individual Christian Life not because you know or you heard no your life so if we turn our back on the word of God and we've seen people do it maybe not openly just by indifference by a bad attitude I'm going this way instead fleeing from the presence of God and they're following an antichrist spirit and Antichrist Doctrine and soon they will be Anointed with arrogance selfishness self-righteous respective persons if we deviate one degree off a center we won't hit the target you got to stay perfectly balanced well I think I don't care what you think over here is truth and don't go the other way it's got to stay balanced if we deviate one degree okay Jonah was 180° off God worked it around but he had to pay a price don't you know he never never ate fish after that he wanted to stay so far away from fish so we got to see what God wants us to do don't deviate you know when Mary and Joseph went down to Jerusalem it's about 60 miles from Nazareth down to Jerusalem they went down every year for the feast and things and okay so it's a big family deal so now they're on their way back home and they're they're getting ready to set up camp the first night and Mary says to Joseph uh Joseph where's the boy I don't know thought it was your turn to watch him the boy wasn't with them they walked off and and left the promise of God how in the world well they thought it was with the Rel he's over there he wasn't there don't you know they had a not a very peaceful night that night so that's day one okay day two oh and they finally found him back there where they left him now if you'll notice the scripture a a normal Jewish mother you know in that predicament would have said oh dear have have you had anything to eat here let me get you some orange juice no she was so arrogant Jesus why did you do this I look bad you know I look terrible why didn't you stick with us she blamed him it's right there in the Bible so they left behind the promise of God and the same thing today thinking God is with them better balance things out be careful okay we're looking a few other things here before we before we quit but um the thing is you need look around be sensitive discern your surroundings be sure that he's with you check up our life our Doctrine our experience has to match God's word not brother David's opinion not no God's word you see God's word of the hour not match your imagination or your explanations we can't afford to live in the glare we've got to live today prepare for tomorrow we're on a journey we have have a destination the Gate of the resurrection and so in this day you know many Born Again Christians all all the people in Dallas they carrying a Bible they can't see correct baptism for some reason it's right there in their Bible you know well we've got a track you probably have it back here it's all about history and scripture brother Bram didn't invent acts 238 no he just repeated it so this this track shows Christian baptism you know so we don't want to be like religious tourists you know accumulating getting a little rock from here a little rock from there and a little flag and a little sticker no we want the life you see amen okay he says over here and standing at the door well that's the way it is today with people who call themselves Christians you say oh I belong to the church yeah there on on Central Avenue yeah that's good but you see the reason there's so much trouble in the church the reason there's so much confusion in the church so much discontent in the church is not that Jesus isn't there it's because Jesus can't gain access to the places he wants to go we have those little compartments oh don't touch that come in that's far enough I'll join the church I'll be there for every you know special occasion otherwise let me run my own business Jesus wants to be supreme ruler of your being and the only way that he can bless you is when he becomes your lord lord is rulership ownership who made you who has the right to replace in your heart the Creator Have No Secrets before him and when Jesus comes in he wants to be welcom well we've got little secret doors little bitty doors in our heart and we don't want Jesus in over to the right side of the human heart now you might know what he's talking about I mean this is the man that talked to the angel you know so leave it alone over in the right hand side of the human heart after Jesus gets in is a little bitty door called Pride oh I'll receive him as Savior but don't try to tell me how to run my how I should dress what I have to do if I have to have let my hair grow stop smoking quit going to the pool room I don't want nothing to do with it don't worry he won't stay too long no don't worry about it pride very very dangerous so so you cannot expect God to fix what you don't hand over to him you hold all this stuff to yourself he can't fix that you got to be open yes Lord I'm yours whatever you say so if he's not Lord of all and he is calling you today if he said anything to Your Heart during all of this then you must yield to him you see just let it go we can pray for you and this can be a turning point in your life you don't have to go on carrying that load got you all bound down so if the musicians would like to come please we'll try to wind this up we want you to leave here in peace don't leave burdened and feeling bad at somebody you can receive pardon he can change your will he can change your desires and put you on the right road to fulfill his will you see the word of God says in 1 Corinthians 2 but it is written I has not seen Ear Has Not Heard neither has entered into the heart of man the things which God ha prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit we are a special people we have seen the glory of God let's stand together let's sing that song um Jesus be the Lord of all youall know that so good to be with you you don't fail to come back tonight communion is not just a tradition no it's part of God's word [Music] amen Jesus be the Lord of all oh Jesus be the Lord of all oh Jesus be the Lord of all the kingdoms of my heart oh Jesus I surrender all Jesus I surrender all Jesus I surrender all the kingdoms of my heart may God bless you [Music] the Lord of [Music] allus you know God has just so many marvelous ways of doing things but one thing God always does he always provides an opportunity he doesn't he doesn't leave you without the opportunity to change and what a word just to Simply say that we all ought to stop for a moment and just look at our lives and say am I am I in the will of the Lord and you know God's faithful you know and just like he said it the the message so beautiful you know if if you seek the kingdom of God and and you you you you you seek his will and you knock he's faithful to open you know if if you're up against something you know if you have a fear that's shackling your life you can't go forward in a relationship you you you it just seems like there's a great wall in front of you then he gives you the opportunity he'll make a way for you he'll he'll give a word to you he'll speak to you the scripture really says that he seeks you out you know and he puts a conviction on your heart he sews a seed in your your mind and your heart and and and he's he's reaches out to you to provide to you an opportunity and and he doesn't do that because he's he's he's not going to uh uh answer you you know he doesn't put put a conviction in your life about Sin if he's not prepared to forgive you for it amen you see he's not that kind of God right he doesn't come convict your heart and and and and make you feel oh I shouldn't have done that I uh you know uh if if he's not going to say i' I've done that to forgive you he's not going to challenge you to examine your life to see if you're in the will of God or not if he's not prepared to show you what his will is you see that that's what you've got to understand he he hasn't forsaken us he says I'll not forsake you nor leave you but I'll be with you even in you till the end so it when when you hear the word of God and it it the word of God is asking you to stop stop and look at yourself you know you may be smoking I don't care you can be a secret smoker you know what I mean but if he convicts you of it it's because he wants to deliver you of it he's not the kind of God that just wants to send you to hell thank you Lord oh you're a smoker I'm I'm I'm putting you under conviction cuz I want you to feel miserable that's not why he went to Calvary that's not why he he he took those stripes he took those stripes because he wants to heal you if you got things in your life that aren't right and you know they're not right the word of God comes along and says don't don't cover it up don't don't put on a religious covering you know but just be honest and you could say my life is not lining up to the word of God God is not telling you that just to let you know what he knows he's not saying I know your life isn't lined up to the word of God he doesn't have to show us that he's God Amen he created Heaven and Earth that's right he's trying to show you that if he tells you your life's not lined up he's really saying I want to line your life up I want to give you that Deliverance I want to do for you exceedingly and abundantly above what you can even ask or think you might even think of your deliverance I thought as he told that story of of of Jonah I wondered how many times Jonah rehearsed in his mind what he was going to say to Nineveh and finally he looked at it and he said I don't got nothing to say I'm out of here but God just took it and brought it around and made Jonah more successful than he would have ever been so maybe you've tried a hundred times maybe you've looked at your life over and over again and you don't think that there's one thing you can do if the Lord convicted you this morning it's not because he's that kind of God he's he's the kind of God to say I put you under conviction so I can show you the way and anybody that's ever been saved has got to the place where they didn't know what in the world am I going to do I cannot go on the way I'm going on I cannot continue this way something has got to happen in my life and they finally lifted their hands in desperation and said God help me God help me I don't know what I am but I'm not this I'm not someone that wants to be bitter I'm not one someone that wants to live in fear I'm not somebody that wants my past to rule over me that's a great kind of God he is he cares and if if you wait on him he promised that he'd renew knew your strength if you're sincere with him about your life and your life's Direction and the decisions you're making he will answer you and you know what the Zeal of this age is how many knows what the Zeal of this age is the Zeal of this age is to repent say I'm sorry I've been not going the right way and if you're willing to do [Music] that if you're willing to do it he'll answer you I don't I don't have the [Music] answer I am thankful though and I I I it's amazing I I I I said to brother George George when he come visit me he said Brother David now I want you to know no matter matter what we talk about the bread's already been sliced know as that means I have my sermon I'm going to preach what I'm going to preach and nothing's going to change it but we were fellowship and I and I think some of the brothers were with us and I said you know one of the greatest things brother Bram ever said was that he works his permissive will to his perfect will that gives me a lot of comfort amen so this morning ask yourself if there's things in your life that are permissive you ask for perfect if you have questions ask for answers if you have trouble ask for deliverance he said come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and I'll give you rest and in no wise will I cast you out do you believe that this morning he's here you say well I don't feel him he's here because he said he would be here amen and he can do exceedingly and abundantly above what we can ask or think because he said he can do exceedingly and abundantly and I just want to ask him my my life I just simply say Lord not my will but your will be done maybe we could sing that little song search me Lord I don't know exactly how you have a mic brother Billy you can help me sing it oh [Music] search me oh [Music] God and try my heart to [Music] oh saor and my thoughts I oh I see [Music] there [Music] be [Music] some oh I BL me from every s [Music] and me amen is that your heart's desire this morning if you can say that in the bottom of your heart Lord you know you know where I stand and I'm just here this morning to give my life Lord to you and you have your way maybe we think could just bow our heads and softly softly softly [Music] play if you just turn your heart to him this morning and be honest Lord I'm I'm not doing very good but I'm going to lift my hand Lord I'm doing it right here in front of all these people saying Lord I'm lifting my hand I want your perfect will in my life I want the hardness of my heart I want to have your spirit of compassion and love Lord I I I'm lifting my hands to you this morning the most important thing in my life father is to be right and to be in your will if you'd like to lift your hands maybe you're so you're perfect it's not about me Examining you it's about examining yourself and you'd say father I have a choice my will or your [Music] will my will or your will Lord and where I am this morning I I don't know I don't know whether I'm in my will or your will that question's not answered in my heart but I'm willing to be honest with myself and lift my hand and say Lord I don't know where I'm at and I'm putting my hand up that you'll give me that answer he'll see that hand he'll see that heart and he's faithful and if you ask him a sincere question he'll give you a sincere answer if you ask him for sincere leadership he will lead you yes and not forsake you so we just want to give you that opportunity this morning to pose the question to him and say Lord am I in your will am I in your will and if I'm not father don't let me be stubborn don't let me hang on just let me be honest Lord I got habits I need deliverance from I've got bitterness I've got malice Lord I'm being honest with you today I can't make it without you please answer me I think of our great messenger he wrote a note and he nailed it on a [Music] tree father may we write you from our heart this morning and look With all sincerity Above All Things father I want to be in your will not my will but thy will be done and may father every sincere heart that truly Place themselves to hear you hear ye him I know that you will answer and I have confidence father that the word went out this morning so each of us in our own individual lives could challenge ourselves my will or his will we ask that you grant these things to us in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen you know what the perfect will of the Lord leads to it leads to a Rapture how many want to go on the rap Rapture amen the translation the change of the body Rapture is not the word itself isn't in the Bible but to be caught up well let me tell you

Rapture oh my goodness I I just think what's going to happen to this world on the verge of a woman president amen everybody thinks this other guy's better you know what I mean I don't care what suit Satan puts on if it ain't God's word it's the devil right in this country given God away a long time ago yes sir so every morning I want to wake up and say these words in my heart I am thinking of the
