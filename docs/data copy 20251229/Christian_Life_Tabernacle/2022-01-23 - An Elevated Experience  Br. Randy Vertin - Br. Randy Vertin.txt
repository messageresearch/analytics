[Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] crazy [Music] yes [Music] is [Music] may god bless you this evening i appreciate the word of the lord and appreciate being in the presence of the lord and amongst believers if we'll just turn in our bibles to second peter chapter one you know there's certainly something to be said for going second on a day like sunday because you kind of it's like cheating on a test almost in a way you're gonna get to glean a lot from you know what the lord's inspiration is bringing and i was certainly blessed this morning by the words that were spoken and very encouraging and it's so uh powerful to me how the word of god you know it's so eternal and it's a paradox how it can the lord can both uplift you and challenge you at the same time with the same word you know and with it's uh with one hand the lord's kind of giving you a spanking and yet at the same time with the other hand he's he's you can feel him pulling you closer to himself and i certainly felt that way this morning we're just going to read verses 1 through 11 here and it says simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are giving unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these he might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience into patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness into brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall need neither be barren nor fruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ and we're just going to turn to one more scripture quickly john chapter 20 just one very short scripture here john chapter 20 and we'll read verse 21 and jesus said then jesus said to them again uh actually we're going to go up just a little bit i'm sorry we'll read verses 19 through 21 then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you and when he had so said he showed unto them his hands and his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the lord then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so send i you let's just bow our heads in the word of prayer heavenly father as we just come before your word this evening oh god we just pray that oh lord you would break the bread of life to us once again lord that you would draw us closer to you lord jesus lord our desire lord is not to leave here the same as we came in o god but to draw closer unto you lord we know the hour has grown late father we're truly at the end of all things father and we see that time approaching swiftly we just pray o god that you would get glory unto yourself and lord you would speak to your bride this evening father and may you just give her another portion of that rapturing faith that you're building us up to father that you're making us more and more into the thine image oh god we just pray that you would get glory and honor in all things and that your perfect will would be done in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated i've just uh really been meditating you know on a few different things and i just trust the lord will help me to get across the thought the way he gave it to me i didn't really have a title necessarily for the service this evening but i guess the the only little phrase that kind of kept coming to me was just that two words uh three words i guess you'd say but if i was to title it i would i would call it an elevated experience because though you know i think many times because as we heard this morning because of the trials and tribulations that we face all of us being in the flesh the way that we are and so many times it's uh i i believe you probably all agree with me so many times it's hard to look past the mirror in the carnal sense because the the the wonderful revelations we've been given and understanding what the what god has required we're crying of his people and true holiness and and and the perfection as we heard this morning of moving beyond the basics but coming up to a perfection or a completion we could even call it god finishing the work he's begun the good work in you and he's now he's going to be faithful to complete it but so many times we get caught in the in the carnal mind of not being able to look past our own faults and our failures and those different things but when we realize what god's word says about us you know from the very beginning satan's goal has only been one thing and one thing only and that is to get the people of god to disbelieve the word of god that's the only goal he can have because the word of god is life itself he is his word and the word only operates by faith we understand without faith it is impossible that means it's not possible to please god without faith it's not it doesn't take the works that you've accomplished to please god it doesn't take the the perfection with the way you maybe you feel that you've walked over a certain period of time in your life according to the word no but it's the faith in that word of god that is what pleases him and if satan can do anything in your life what he would try to do is make you disbelieve any part of that word because if he could get you to just remember we're going back to a garden of eden condition and if that be the case then satan only needs to get you to disbelieve one portion of that word but the problem is we know that god does not change his mind about his word when he's spoken any one thing that very thing has to come to pass now it may not come to pass in the manner or the time or the the the identification or so that our conroll minds could comprehend or conjure up but god interprets his word by what bringing it to pass even now he's bringing it to pass we can see it all around us i believe we're seeing it in our own lives the battles the trials the tribulations that we're going through and you know it's it's one of those things where because we're trapped in this carnal flesh that we live in that that veil is always dangled before you the the devil is very quick and it's very easy for him to magnify all of the ways that you cannot cope up or uh come to the the place of being lined up with this very word of god because we fall short every day you know even the prophet would tell us that he backslid every day in in the sense that he fell short in things that he didn't want to fall short in we we look at backsliding as as oh that person's just out in the world doing whatever it is no a backslidden condition is just being not living up and not coming to a full acceptance of the word of god for you because when you're in that state where you can't accept the word of god and what he's spoken about you the devil has you right there because we know we have too much revelation to i believe really convince ourselves that we can do it ourselves but if the devil can pull that that veil over your eyes that would tell you that that word that he spoke because i believe the lord has brought us all i believe all of us too far to say to to not believe that god is true or that god does what he says he'll do because we've seen it done we i believe each one of us have testimonies that we can say that god fulfills his word but what the devil what does he try to do he doesn't necessarily try to get you to disbelieve the word in its entirety but what he tries to do is he he tries to pull you out of the picture and say well that's all fine and good but that's not for you how many of you have had that experience you it's easy so many times to believe for someone else i can say maybe brother jackson has a need and it's very easy for me to get down on my knees and say lord i believe for brother jackson but now flip the script and put yourself in the position of need where the trials are pressing upon you where the pressure is building where where time is of the essence and it seems like there's nowhere you can go well then it might be easy for someone on the outside to have the faith in that word but at that moment all of your faults are magnified all of the reasons why it can't apply to you become magnified and the devil says oh yeah god is absolutely true no doubt i mean the devils believe and they tremble but it's not for you you see you you're not part of that bride no that we understand the your prophet told you that that's that's eagle's food but but you're not an eagle so i'm sorry that just doesn't apply to you isn't that you know i want to i want to shine a light on what the devil does to the people of god because we've come too far to completely just say well god isn't real that that's not true it's not true but he'd say well it's not true for me you know what those those nights when you're pleading for a loved one or pleading for a need in your life and the devil's right there and say oh yeah you know that may be true but just it's not for you because of this and he'll give you all the reasons why that could be the case but what god see the more i've been meditating on the word and thinking about things in the word of god the more you start to realize that when christ came he didn't hoard the blessings of god to himself if i could say it that way it wasn't the lord jesus didn't come and say that this blessing is just for me and me alone because only i'd lived a perfect life to attain to it and therefore i hold it unto myself but we understand he's actually shared it with his people what really struck me is is i started to to think it may be just a little bit different type of a service that maybe just more of a talking in a sense just talking these things through as the scripture says come let us reason together you know let's let our reasoning stand upon the word of god and not upon anything that you've accomplished nothing that you've tried to do or failed to do or thought you could do or wanted to do and wish you could do because we all have desires to serve god you know did we not even hear this morning how david had this desire to build a house to the lord it was a good desire it wasn't a bad desire but it wasn't for him to do that and it was it was his humility to the word of god that would allow him to to fulfill the promise of god by coming underneath the umbrella of the word for his time to fulfill that word and that's why while the world would say to our sisters oh you know and the way the world preaches now about what we they call equality and well you know the the women are the same as men and they should be able to do exactly the same things a man can do and all these different things and in the world would look at the way the scripture speaks about it and say well they're trying to hold you down and do these things and you know how the world does has has that kind of those ideas but when you find that you're humbled to the word of god to the promise of god you find that there's an elevated experience to be had when you come to a realization that if i can rest in the promise of god there is nothing that i and myself need to accomplish to bring these things to pass because god will lay he's already done it all for you it's already been done when we read in the in first peter let's just turn back there real quickly and maybe go through a a little bit of this here see the devil likes to make make you think that there's something that you need to accomplish in order to bring about the promise of god but you see when faith anchors when faith truly anchors in the heart it brings forth of itself because it is a very life that brings it forth it isn't it isn't being pushed through that pipe it isn't being forced to happen but life just it just life just happens you know my wife is getting more and more into into horticulture and she's really liking plants and and it really amazes me how you can you can prune a plant or you can plant a seed and for for days or weeks it seems like nothing's there it would seem but as long as that atmosphere was right everything that needs to produce life is already present in the seed to bring forth and while it may seem you know we have these little we have this little thing they call an aerogarden now where it has it has like the little pods with different seeds and herbs in it and it grows in the water and it's got a little light and everything so you can have a little herb garden in your house and that's what we've been doing and and it would seem for a little while after we started you put this little pods in there and it starts to water and you put the plant food on it and the lights shining on it and for days it seems like nothing's happening and then you look down and you're kind of trying to look down in the little the little hole in the where the seed was and after a while you see the little the little the tiniest little thing just this little bit of green and all that brown that and what is it that's life it doesn't look like much to the natural eye but you see if you could get on the other side if we could start to i believe i remember our pastor was talking how if you could step away from the book and start to look at it from the other side you remember when brother david preached that about how if you could step away and look at it from the other side if we could see with the eyes that god sees with see his desire is to give you those same vision that he's got see because when when you know i marvel even in the natural at people who you know there are people who develop property and develop land and there will be a person that we were actually talking about this at work and it struck me they were talking about ross perot i guess he had owned like hundreds and hundreds of acres up there by alliance what they call the alliance town center now and he and he owned all these acres and and he started what he started to do was build up certain things in the area and then he actually invited people to come and move there and give him i think tax breaks and different things and and to try to why because it seemed like nonsense at the time but in the natural he had a vision that in a certain period of time over the course of time of what this would build up into and what it would become and now it's one of the fastest growing places in the metroplex they're building things left and right sprouting up like crazy and but what was it there it was a and this is just the cardinal portion a man that could see a bare bit of ground and has a vision in his mind of what that would become and this was many years ago when this happened and yet he would build these things and how much more god see when you we might look at someone in the natural and see nothing but a barren bit of dirt a barren bit of ground that has no life to it whatsoever but if we could see with the eyes of god to see the end of the thing even before the beginning and see the potential in a seed that might lay there to see that oh it may look like a bare bit of ground now but at the end of the thing it could be a great tree bringing forth fruits unto god and so is it even within ourselves see it's not about our own potential but it's about the potential of the word lived through a vessel that is fully surrendered to the word of god because it's not about the vessel it never was about the vessel because if it was about the vessel then we would have a lot to worry about in keeping this flesh clean in our in our own way to make it look just a certain way to the word that's what the world does they dress up the flesh they dress up their churches they dress up their pulpits they dress up they even dress up their experiences they give them now the the big bands and the big musics and the the educated preachers and the educated speakers to tickle the natural ears to to assault the natural senses even so much with the catholic church that's what draws people in is because remember there is a there's a desire in a man that knows that there is a god to be worshipped that they they know deep down inside that there is a breach that needs to be bridged that there is a gulf that needs to be spanned to get back in fellowship and because satan being that that deceiving angel that he is that that covering cherub that he was so beautiful in his ways he knows how to tease the senses he knows how to tease the eyes and tease the ears and and all those so much so the catholic church people get drawn in because of the pomp and the ceremony i mean we went just recently a little while ago to my grandmother's funeral that happened to be in a catholic church it's the first time i'd ever been in a catholic church that i could remember i think i had probably been in one as a child or something and they went through the whole thing and the stand-ups and the sit-downs and the say something and go sit down and then the people sang and then he got up and did it again and and and to be perfectly honest with you it was kind of i i hate this word maybe seems crude but it was kind of creepy it's very creepy to it was very it was unsettling to see because you can see having tasted of the true word you can see how how people could be drawn in by by a beautiful ceremony the church was just immaculate all this dark stained wood and and just beautiful but there's no life in it it's just a dead letter it's just a dead temple it's a it's a it's a worship experience with no shekinah glory in it no holy ghost to come in and quicken a life but see if we could have the vision of god to see it's so easy to see someone on the street and just bypass it and say well they just they're just a barren bit of dirt it doesn't matter anyhow but if we can have see the scripture said because iniquity would abound the love of many would wax cold and we're seeing that in our day the natural affection between man is is almost gone people won't even wouldn't even stop to help someone on the side of the road because they're afraid they get shot or they're afraid as they're trying to help that person someone else would come and run them over you know we were in our neighborhood i think it was just yesterday i was cleaning out my garage a little bit me and my my father-in-law in there and we're getting and we're just doing some stuff and all of a sudden you hear we're just in a subdivision just a regular subdivision and you hear this what and down the road here comes two four-wheelers just absolutely screaming down the road and my father-in-law uncle tries to go out the sidelines trying to get him to slow down i'm like you gonna get him to slow down because there's no natural affection there's no there's no uh uh uh natural care for for the affairs of others well but the life of christ produces the opposite where he said he said don't look every man upon your own things but upon the things of others that i care how you are i care about the state of my brothers and sisters not even so much that but i care about the state of the unbeliever did we not hear this morning where our even our lord jesus admonished him and said what does it matter you if you love if you love each other the publicans can do that that's a natural affection that should come easy to you which goes to show sometimes when we lack love one for another even within the body that there's really something wrong because if the lord he said if you can't love your brother who you do see how can you love your heavenly father whom you have not seen i don't know how i got there but we got there but now let's just read in in second peter chapter 1 and let's start at verse 3. it says according as his divine power will give unto us all things that pertain to life and godliness no i purposely misquoted that because so many times we're under the assumption that we're waiting for something a future event to happen but the scripture says here that his divine power hath already given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue so the work's already done it's so simple brothers and sisters if we could see what god has spoken about you what he's spoken about me and just actually for once really just sit back and accept it truly accept it regardless of what you think you are regardless of where you think you are but accept what the word of god has said about you that you are an overcomer he said i've already overcome the world he says now you get to overcome the world he's just uh we've heard that it's just a toothless lion he goes out he goes about as a roaring lion but he's a toothless lion the lord's already taken the stinger out of death he's taken the threat out of the devil it's like when joshua first began to conquer and they took those kings and he took the heads of the tribes of the children of israel and had him each step on the necks of those kings and said do you see this situation here so will it be to all of your enemies and so has it already been to all of our enemies when christ rose from the grave he put his foot on the neck of the enemy he put his foot on the neck of the enemy he's already defeated him and now he's actually inviting you and saying come put your foot on the neck of the enemy i've already won the battle now i want you to put your foot on the neck of the enemy because your footsteps is your possession you can possess the gate of your enemy it doesn't matter what the enemy is if you step onto that land it is now yours it could be you know the lost family members we talk about all the time each one of us have those then you step on that enemy and you don't let him up too many times we step on it feels good for a little while but sometimes he takes a while to die that enemy struggles and he's not going to give up without a fight but you stand there on the promise of god because the promise is sure he said it is by faith that it might be by grace to the end that the promise would be sure to all the seed and i want you to notice the progression it's by faith it's believing in something accepting what god said about it because true faith faiths final resting places where in the word so when you it's by faith so when you can rest your faith on the word where there's no question because it comes to a point as simple as because god said it i can't accept it now that faith now he says because it's by faith now it's by grace so now that faith comes in grace can take hold and now all the excuses that you he used to have i fell short it doesn't matter because faith goes back to the word and says he paid the debt well i made a mistake faith goes back to the word and says well he already conquered my mistakes it's in the sea of forgetfulness so now grace can take hold and once grace take hold now the promise is sure that means it's sealed up it's all done it's finished he said to all the seed it's so simple but the devil gets us off track by trying to complicate and what when we think about oh we must move on past repentance from dead works and all these things remember it's not like brother billy preached this morning it's not about moving past that we throw it away but we can stand upon that foundation repentance from dead works and and move on in the new and living way to the maturity of the fact that now no matter what comes my way that word is my absolute the the the word that i've received in this hour that told me that i could be just like him correction to that that i will be just like him correction even to that that i am already just like him it's just god is waiting upon us to catch up to him he's at the finish line already waiting he's he's your biggest cheerleader telling you the work's already finished he that endureth unto the end endure hardness is a good soldier just keep pressing the battle keep walking the walk because he's already given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness all of it it's already been provided and even what's more than that it's already in you he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world not he that is out there somewhere but he that is in you now in verse 4 in second peter chapter 1 verse 4 says whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature have you ever really thought of just that little phrase that you could be a partaker of divine nature if i could put it into layman's terms just our simple english that literally would mean you could you can be a part of god himself the experience of god if i could say it in that way that's the way my brain i guess comprehends it you know to be a partaker of divine you know who else was a partaker of divine nature the lord jesus christ who being fashioned as a man thought it not robbery to be equal with god he partook of divine nature another one we know our prophet partaker of divine nature and expressed it in creation in a spoken word power in a third pool ministry in the opening of the word but see that's not just for them but it is for you to be a partaker of divine nature god has if we could see the calling that god has called us to he has called us to be just like him he didn't call us to be some cheap facsimile to be some cheap knockoff no because god can't hybrid with anything when god reproduces himself it is god it's god in nature it's the same nature it's the same potential it's the same power it's the same authority it's the same life it's the same experience he doesn't cheat see the devil tries to trick the people of god into thinking that because maybe you're not a preacher or because maybe you're not a pastor or you don't do this or you don't do that that god has somehow cheated you out of an experience with him that somehow he's cheated you of a greater portion of himself that couldn't be further from the truth god has given to you the opportunity each and every one to partake of the very life and nature of god himself you know why because christ this is what i've been meditating on it has a roundabout way of getting to it but when you think about how the attributes god attributes to himself he attributes to his people he said why do you say that we read in john chapter 20 he says as the father sent me now i send you you see you start to see how the lord jesus even and throughout the scripture he starts to he's elevating his people up to a place of adoption because what was the whole point of adoption adoption the whole point of adoption was so that the father could step back and the son could walk forward with the same authority in life that the father possessed before him nothing less not not a knockoff not a deluded form but the very same authority the very same power the very same life that the father possessed is now being granted to the son if i can say now it's being granted to the bride he said as the father sent me so send i you you know it may come across as almost blasphemous to many but when he says that he's putting you on equal footing with himself as the father sent me what did he say he did are you all the things that you can attribute to christ he said as the father sent me so send i you now before you could run off and say well that means a sister can preach because jesus preached no because he's the word and it'll manifest according to the word the problem is you don't realize sisters that you preach every day and whether you're a preacher and a pulpit or not you preach every day that be brother or sister you're a preacher you're written epistles right of all men and i think about just some of the and this was just the scripture that really stood out to me jesus says in john 8 12 let's just turn there i hope i'm making sense see the lord is not calling us to have a diluted secondhand experience that is somehow inferior to what the prophet had somehow inferior to what your pastor has or what you know i say preachers because because too many the world the way the world looks at it is a ministers or some idols to be worshipped or some rock stars that's the way the world does it and and i've seen elements of that even within the message oh boy this preacher's coming we better get hyped up about it now we ought to be getting hyped up about the world regardless of who brings it why because it could be the little is no-name preacher but if your expectation is that god will come down god will come down now that's not to say that the lord gives certain gifts to different ones to you know maybe be a a special blessing in one area or another that could happen too but we there's a such a fine line to walk so john 8 i say that because it's not about it's not about one greater than the other this experience is greater than this because if it doesn't line up with the word it means nothing anyway if it's not reflected in this word if it's not it's reflected in the message that we've received which is nothing but the the expression of the word that's all it is we try people we try to separate the two but the message is nothing but the interpretation of the word for our day just as much as christ's life was the interpretation for his day just as much as noah's life was the interpretation for his day moses's life the interpretation for his day and now god has called you the bride of christ to literally become that interpretation for this day it just so happens we already know what the climax is going to be when a body change comes and takes us out we know what it is now it's just a matter of sticking if i can say it this way sticking to the script we don't want to ad-lib we don't want to improvise i want to stick with the script i want to stick with the word that we received in this hour to live according to that because i know if i could it just we talked with uh our prophet taught us about the blueprints if you're gonna build it build it according to the blueprint i don't care how much that that builder building your house might have an inspiration and say you know what instead of this nice archway i'm going to put a vaulted ceiling here and when you turn the key to your house and walk in and he expects you to be overjoyed that you put a vaulted ceiling and instead of a nice archway you're like well i'm going to get a refund you didn't build it the way i wanted it so how much so god we don't need to ad-lib anything he's already laid it out for us which is wonderful because the planning the architectural that's the hard part if you could just read the blueprint and put a nail in there we're good to go that's what god is requiring now it's just laborers to labor to build the house he's built he and even then he's building the house he just wants willing vessels that'll be there to accept it john chapter 8 verse 12 he says jesus again jesus spake then speak jesus again unto them i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life and we also know we don't have to necessarily turn there but john 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god the word was made flesh we understand it says in him was life and that life was the light right but then i want you to think about how god see the lord doesn't leave you out he's not oh i'm going to go over here i hope you can make it no john 5 14. he has neither he says john 5 14 ye are the light of the world amen ye are the light so in one place he says i am the light of the world but now he turns around and says ye are the light of the world. so what is what is the lord trying to impress upon us being a partaker of the divine nature it's not again i will reference what we've been hearing it's not about being a spectator and just basking in the light of it but see the lord has tagged you into the game he says it's time for you to get on the field see that was the problem with with israel in the wilderness is they wandered and wandered and wandered and when the time came to get tagged into the game so to speak where the lord says okay let's go over it's time to really get serious let's go into that promised land and they said we can't do it and the lord says all right then i'm scrapping this team i'll keep a couple captains and we'll build a new one see and that's not going to be so with the bride no matter what the devil says because we've already had a vision by a prophet who saw a bride who saw a procession of the bride a preview and though she may have gotten a little bit out of step he didn't say they ripped the pot and ripped those two out of there and threw some new ones in there no they he yelled at him to get back in line so he can't replace you why because god doesn't change his mind about his word are you his word is his seed in you then you're part of the word so he can't change his mind about you he can't do it he cannot do it and remain god because he can't change his word because he is his word so he says i am the light of the world and now he comes along and says now ye are the light of the world so what is it it is the lord trying to bring us to a place of realizing what he's called us to we're not going to go too much longer here you know we hear we know the scripture says ye are the temple of the living god know ye not that you're the temple of lord well when when a person would go to a temple what are they expecting to receive or do when they get there they're expecting to hear from god they are expecting to receive something from god and see see so the lord makes us without excuse because you are the temple of god you know i had the quote here i'll just read this here said from be not afraid he says now he don't have no hands tonight but my hands and your hands he has eyes in mine and yours that's what he's using he is the vine we are the branches is that right brethren the ministers say amen and the vine doesn't bear fruit the branches bears fruit energized by the vine and if that first branch that came out of the pentecostal vine wrote a book of hacks if that tree ever puts forth another branch it'll write another book of acts because it won't put forth a pumpkin and then a watermelon and then a pomegranate see it's not a diluted form it's not going to produce one thing in william branham and then produce something lacking in you i'm so sorry god is indivisible no matter how much they want to try to split them into oneness two and his threeness all these little variations they have he is indivisible the same god will give the same experience he will give the same life he will give the same power and authority to overcome the devil the question we have now is can we accept it in the face of all of your faults in the face of all of your failures in the face of all the pressure that is out there now i mean you see what they do to people that even talk about we know the vaccines and all the different things that are going on in the political realm that's only expressing a little portion of what's happening right now in the spiritual and it's just you know that that devil is just chomping at the bit to unleash everything he can hell hath enlarged herself it's satan's eating for real and we see you know i was talking with brother cosman last night just talking about these volcanoes you probably saw the tonga volcano that exploded they said they could feel they could supposedly you could feel the shock wave in alaska and california they had tsunamis in california and i just think about how brother branham talked about that honeycomb and i just think oh they oh it didn't look like much maybe a little flooding here and there what happened underneath the surface with that shockwave boom hitting that thing just weaken it a little bit more just waiting for that day when she just breaks off and goes into the sea see we're at the time right now nature's declaring it the whole world's declaring it i believe all of our spirits can feel it we can feel the urgency but there's a roadblock and that roadblock is simply our sometimes refusal to just accept what god has said about us if your sickness by his stripes i'm healed there's no question i'm not telling you to do any certain thing or whatnot but in your heart it should be settled that regardless of what happens from here on out i am healed the work is done you need you need the lord to fulfill a need over here he'll provide for what you have need of he's jehovah gyra it should settle right there regardless of the circumstance you set your face as a flinch and you walk forward easier said than done in this day and age where everything is nothing but a billboard of disbelief everywhere you look everywhere you think everything you hear it's nothing but negativity and disbelief the very remember it's darkness is upon the face of the earth and gross darkness the people even so much so to realize though that ye are the temple of god ye are the light of the world there's a reason why your co-workers may come talk to you sometime maybe not even about the lord in that instance but if you could see what the responsibility god has placed upon us to express him to take him at his word to to give ourselves to him because as we're going to read this quote brother branham talks you you may be the only light you will be the only light many people ever see you will be the only light to be and you say well the lord will do something for them he did by sending you the lord maybe he'll do something for him down the line but you're there right now he has no hands with your hands he has no feet but yours no mouth but yours no eyes but yours we have such a great responsibility with what we've been given but we get paralyzed because we don't fully accept what he's actually said about us that you are the light of the world that you are an overcomer that you are in him we'll just read there's a little bit of a lengthy quote here but we're going to read it's from shalom in 1964. he said and that's when he made that wonderful quotation that we have in scripture he that heareth he that believeth on me hath everlasting life shall not come into the judgment but is passed from death unto life i am the resurrection in life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die see never die there's no there's really no death to a christian death means eternal separation and now as we as when we are when we die like in the physical body as we are now we are separated from one another but it's really this body is the only thing that identifies us to each other because we are bound in five senses see taste feel smell in here and as long as we can see or feel one another why we have the evidence that we're here if you're blind and you can can't see then you can feel one another and we or you can hear one another and the earthly senses declare one another but really frankly we have never seen each other did you know that we have never seen one another you hear something speaking out of a body here that impersonates whatever it's on the inside so then when we talk to each other we're really not talking to the body it's the spirit inside but the body is the thing that identifies the spirit that's on the inside and therefore when we speak to each other we are quickly can understand right away whether we are christians or not because there's a fellowship in the spirit that we talk from you see that it vibrates to one another that whether we are christians or not therefore we have never seen each other now you just think about that you ever you ever you ever actually just sat there and thought about the fact that you really are just a a soul a spiritual being living in a house you know when you really actually think about it and you're aware of the fact that i know scientifically that light goes into my eyes and and that kind of gives my brain a picture but there's something that goes beyond what science can explain that that you know that there's you the real you that's looking out the windows of these eyes to see the world and to hear the world and when you start to really see what that is you start to understand why it's so important that that you are the light of the world because we only know each other naturally according to this flesh but you know when you speak to somebody that maybe there's a tug there and you can feel the pull you can see a thirst or a hunger that you can't see with the natural eyes but the real you is contacting the real them and there's a communion that can happen without anyone a carnal mind would go right over the top of it could you imagine walking in and seeing jesus and the woman at the well they just appeared to be having a really awkward conversation to the natural mind oh they're talking about water and drawing deep in the well and and all these things oh you know are you greater than our father or abraham or our father that dug this well and all these that just seem to have a really strange conversation and that it takes a real twist when the man starts saying you know we've had these husbands and all these different things to the natural mind it seems so odd but if you could see the supernatural you would see there's a communion taking place there was a bridge being there's a gulf being bridged right there but from death and life that was connecting her to the source of all life and how are we to know that that next person that you talk to see so many times the devil tries to get you in a place where if they don't end up coming to our church and they don't end up they don't end up getting baptized in the name of the lord jesus and and receiving the holy ghost and making a rapture it was all for naught you don't know how many people that you will save just by expressing to them the love of christ that that will maybe just something you said or did or or something that they even did to you remember a cup of cold water in my name won't be forgotten that might be the difference between life and death to that person yeah it may be in a white throne judgment but i don't think that they're gonna care at that time where it's at they're only gonna care that life has been received maybe because there was something that you might have said in a witnessing or just something you told him hey watch out you know you may never be a believer maybe you don't believe what i believe but you better watch out for this council of churches coming and you stay away from anything having to do with that don't join up you might that might be the difference between life and death to someone at the end you just don't know that's why we we plant the seeds that's why we shine the light you don't hold it to yourself you don't hold it under a bushel and just keep it you don't know who out there is lost and groping in the darkness could see that light and and and take hope and take hold of something why because it's so easy because we want we want to sow we want to sow we want to nurse it and we want to reap it remember he said one planet one water then another reaps but it's god that gives the increase and it's such a stage now where if we don't see someone oh you know because maybe our experience i don't for me my experience was that the lord came across the path with the word that the message and it was just it was like a atomic bomb went off but i've seen others that it took years it was you know a slow burn to burn away that veil that was before their eyes but boy you know what when it happened they got exactly what i got and they had ta man it seemed like it took them a little longer but they you know what whether you run whether you jog whether you walk or crawl as long as you get to the destination that's what matters that's why you don't give up on your family you don't give up on that loved one or the friend that that you've just you there's a burden you know how it is there's certain people in your life that the lord just it's something that hits you like a rock that it just sinks down in your soul and there's a burden for that person or those people or whoever it might be in no matter what it looks like you just can't let it go why because that's christ in you standing in the gap just like moses see christ is trying to bring you to that place where he says now i can step back and now my bride she can walk forward and you know what they're and it's not going to be anything different they're going to see the same jesus christ that was standing there before that's the beauty of the adoption it's the same character it's the same life it's the same very same in in it it just the vessel looks a little bit different maybe from the carnal mind i'm just going to continue reading here as we close jesus said no man has seen god at any time but the only begotten of the father has declared him see in other words god was identified the person of god was identified in the body the lord jesus christ so he was the expressed image of god or god expressing himself through an image see through an image man god expressed himself to us and he was god not a third person or second person he was the person god he was god himself identifying himself so we could feel him first timothy 3 16 without controversy that's argument great is the mystery of godliness for god was manifested or made known in the flesh isn't that wonderful god and we could never understand god as he moved through a pillar of fire and so forth as he did but we understood him when he became one of us see when he become man then he could talk to us and we could feel him handle him touch him and everything and as the scripture plainly says that we have handled god see with our hands touched him with our hands god is in man and he's identifying himself today in his church in the born-again christian god identifies himself that he remains god see that's what we don't we fail to realize it's not it's not brother billy and bowie expressing himself to someone it's jesus christ in billy expressing jesus christ to somebody and if you that's the problem the devil oh well you are this and you are that no because if it doesn't matter i know people that led people to this message when they were in a backslidden state living with other people in adultery because whether or not they look great on the outside when the word comes forth through and and that and i know those people and god has even restored them and brought them back to a wonderful place but it just goes to show that when that seed of god is present and the word comes forth out of a vessel and expresses not their themselves but expresses christ it will produce life because life produces life and i only say that as a testimony to the power of god why those things happen or you know what we put ourselves in those positions because we get too stubborn and we kick against the pricks and it hurts because he said it's hard to kick against the pricks it's painful but i say that because it's not about you never has been about you god is bringing us to an elevated experience to where we understand and when you have a full revelation of who you are expressing oh then you start to line up a little bit better because now you realize just like the the slave that was the son of a king you're not representing yourself but you're representing him and when that love that divine love is there it causes you to walk in his ways it causes you to line up with the word he said god is in man and he's identifying himself in the church in the born-again christian god identifies himself that he remains god and the outside world will only know god as they see god in you and i that's the only way that they'll know god is when we are written epistles epistle of the scripture we are read of all men and the life that we live reflects what's on the inside of us a man see that's where we can't get out of it oh you say oh they could do this he may have been of excellent condition but you know what praise god the lord didn't let him stay there you know i notice that people think oh that just means you can go do whatever you want it'll happen well maybe maybe so in a you know if it's predestinated the lord will bring you around but you're going to suffer brother branham had to learn those lessons the hard way i believe each and every one of us have learned our hard lessons of the lord telling don't don't go there we say lord surely i can do it says okay and then when you come crawling back and you say lord why did that happen he says well i told you and you know what you get yourself up you dust yourself off why because though a righteous man falls he gets back up because the grace of god is sufficient we don't glory in our in our failures i glory in the fact that the grace of god can cover them praise the lord jesus for that he says the life we live reflects what's living on the inside of us a man is identified by the works that he does so our works should be good see always good because we are representing our lord jesus christ what a calling what a calling you've been made kings and priests of the temple of god the temple of god you are a king and a priest of the temple of god and when when the lord brings different ones across your path to receive of that light because he's made you the light of the world him in you being the light of the world then it what is it it's up to the priest to usher that person into the presence of god what a calling what a great calling that we have sisters with children when they come to you and say mama what about this what about that you're a you're a priest in the temple of god to now usher your children into the presence of god to bring them to that truth to bring them to that light that is in you my that's to me it's powerful what what a privilege what a responsibility it all it i feel it has but if it hasn't it should sober you because what what a responsibility when you look at the responsibility and the the requirements and the the the expectation from the old testament priest of how they had to live they had to live right they had to walk right they had to do these things and that for them without grace but law but now for us we have those expectations as brother branham says here the life you're living expresses what's inside he said so you should always do right but by the grace of god even when you don't praise the lord there's grace that doesn't give us excuse but it ought to give you hope because every day the devil's just right there to try to whisper in you how bad you are and how everything how everything is just upside down that's all right that's all right because when he's weak i am strong his strength is made perfect in weakness if if he if he only needed strong strong people i would have to think that most of us probably wouldn't be here it's those that can't remember the uh our prophet even said he said man god helps those who help themselves he said god helps those who can't help themselves and i count myself among them that couldn't help themselves but when he reached down his hand for me oh it looked all well and good when peter was walking on the water but then when he started to sink all he had to do is say cry lord help me and the hand reached down that's all he's looking for but now it's your hand that sometimes needs to reach down when someone's crying out there in the world or someone even in the amongst the bodies crying out he's you're his hand to reach down and to pull them back up again we put it all in the pasture we put it all in the ministry we put it all on on jesus christ but our prophet stood in the pulpit and said if christ was here right now he could do nothing for you but what he's already done if it be so then it'd be so that way now the only difference is now you are the vessel that he's using or that he desires to use to usher people into that presence he's made you a king and a priest of the temple of the living god that's why and i i don't want to go too off course here but that's why if you look at the old testament they had to dress a certain way they had to smell a certain way that's the prayers that's the incense the prayers of the saints they had to dress a certain way that's our what's our dress where the word of god the message of the hour being being clothed in it the robes of his righteousness if they had to walk a certain way talk a certain way do a certain thing to exercise their priestly duties so is it with us let's cope up with this word so we can express the priestly duties he's given to us the key you want to you want to have authorities a king or a queen that he's brought us to because he's promised it to you then we need to walk worthy of the vocation where you've been called walk worthy of the calling that you've been called to and you can't do it yourself and that's all right he's provided a lamb he's provided a sacrifice but you know what you can do is get in that prayer closet that's where the lacking is really coming in brother billy spoke about it this morning all the time he said by the time you wake up and you get done with work and you eat dinner you're waking up again the next morning and you don't know what happened how many of you had that experience i have had that experience been having that experience at different times but i believe i can't remember john wesley or one of those old powerful saints would say he said i found that the more i had to do the more i had to pray because i knew i found if i prayed when i did the things i needed to do i could get the right result but if i didn't i'd just waste time and that's what we ought to do the devil says oh you got this on your plate and that on your plate and this on your plate and that on your plate it may be true then get before the lord put it before him and you'll find that he'll he'll make the time if you'll make time for him he'll make the time for you he's the god of time he's outside of time translate a person from here to that in an instant and we think he can't make time to you got to write that check for that gas bill so you can't pray for five minutes oh the lord can provide all that you have need of if you give it to him he says what a wonderful thing that is we're closing here just got a another little paragraph and a half what a wonderful thing that is especially when an old man like me stand here and think of the life that is fading away that's gone in the past and we're facing a future of an eternity and knowing if this life only is what i had hopes in i would be a most miserable person this morning but knowing that this life has only been a shadow of what we had to come it's a reflection because it cannot be the perfect thing that god made god doesn't make anything that perishes see god is eternal and therefore this life that we now live in is only reflecting what's ahead of us the real one that cannot die the body that cannot perish the life that cannot be taken and therefore the scriptures is right when it says that we have everlasting life we have eternal life we shall never die see because you become when you're born again you become a part of god see you are forever for eternity never to fail you're a part of god because you're his son can we just accept that just accept it that's what made the faith of abraham so powerful is he just accepted he didn't think that you just know the devil was there saying like you were you were a baal worshiper an idol worshiper over there in irv for all those years and now you had this vision and saying you're going to go here and have a child and all these different there's so many things he could point to of why it shouldn't be but the only thing he knew is god promised me he says now i might take another name and say my name is some other name i might take my mother's name harvey which would be the closest to me in the world my mother was a harvey and then i might take the name of harvey but still the blood would prove that i'm a branham see because i'm part of my father and as long as i got blood in me i'll still be a part of my father see that's right and when i'm born of the spirit of god i am a part of god that's all think about that i am identified with him see that he is my father then my life should reflect him as my life reflects my earthly father in the image that he was in they say i look a whole lot like my father so then therefore it's his image reflected in me and your father reflected in you and your parents and so god our father is reflected in us when we're born and conformed here to his image amen let's all stand we heard this morning little portions of the scripture and we know the scripture where it declares he says now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face we've seen the word face to face he's revealed himself to you in this hour through the message of the hour he's unveiled himself and now there's not see god's not recalling for a distorted reflection that's for the denominations to do that if i could say it this way without sounding too sacrilegious their reflection of christ is like a fun house mirror it's twisted and distorted it has it has a shadow of the thing that was to be reflected but they put their own twists on it they put their own spin on it but here we're looking directly into the mirror of the word and all we want to see is jesus christ reflected in it we want to see him reflected in us he's called you to be a priest for the temple of god maybe we should be trying to usher some more people into his presence by having that presence with us by welcoming his presence with us every single day how many of you want that i want that i want to have his presence with me every single day i don't want to grieve him i don't want to push him away at all but from the time i wake up to the time i go to bed oh it may seem so many times in the flesh like i'm running to and fro and it feels so hectic but if you would just make time for him he will make he will literally make time for you the lord knows you have things that need to be done according to the earthly things even paul went and wrought and made tents and did those things but that wasn't what he lived for we i think sometimes about that story brother branham would tell about the man that wrote rose hogs he said everything you'd talk about with that man was hawks the time he woke up hog hog song and said life is more than harms life is more than that job you've got life is more than that class you think you got to get to at school because that education is going to fail anyway the money that you're earning at your job it's all failing as we speak it's all going down it's all going to be burned what does it profit you to gain the whole world and lose the soul and if i can say it this way what would it profit for you to also gain the whole world while others are losing their souls when god's called you to be a king and priest to be he said i am the light and then he comes and says and ye are the light let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer heavenly father [Music] lord jesus our desire lord i believe of everyone here this evening is to see your very life reflected in themselves lord i know i want to see your life reflected in me lord i don't want to have any smudges on that that mirror i don't want to have any blemishes on that mirror i don't want to have any of my own twists and turns to it to try to conform it to an image i think it should be lord but i want to have your pure unadulterated life flowing in mine reflected in me lord lord that your scripture said let all that you do in word or deed be done in the name of the lord jesus christ lord that when we look back on our days that we go through and have to go to work and rub shoulders with the world the people that we talk to and the experiences that we have that lord when we get done with the day we could look back lord and we could see that we were doing our best everything that we had in us to to reflect you lord lord not to put a spin on anything oh god but to let your life shine in this vessel in this temple lord may you just take these each one of these temples that's here this evening lord may they be consecrated afresh to you lord lord as it was even in the old testament at the dedication of the temple in the tabernacle may it be with the sprinkling of the blood of the lord jesus that cleanses from all unrighteousness lord may it be as the at the prayer of solomon's temple lord when he finished dedicating it that the cloud came down that the shekinah glory came down so thick that they couldn't even minister lord may your glory come down in each and every one here lord and fill each temple that's here lord so that is these temples go forth these images lord that you've formed in natural clay lord go out they can express a supernatural life [Music] lord that lord whether they even know it or not that that life would be expressed and that it would take take effect in a life lord we don't want to get glory to ourselves or bring ourselves any kind of stature lord but we want to see you exalted

together lord we can't do it one without the other lord because you made us that way lord you've called us lively stones to be built into a perfect building for you lord lord may we just express that life now we just rededicate ourselves to you lord pray oh god that you would have the preeminence in our lives lord that our that you wouldn't let our love grow cold with all the iniquity that abounds in the world [Music] but lord that we would be just lit on fire with the fire of the holy ghost we must commit them into your hands lord be with each and every one as we depart our separate ways be with our pastors they're traveling may your angels just be encamped about them father may they also be a light where they are may you get glory lord in all things oh god we just dedicated to you in
