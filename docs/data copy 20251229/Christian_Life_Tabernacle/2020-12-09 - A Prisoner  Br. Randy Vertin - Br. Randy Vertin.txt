words come up there so i didn't mean to stop us from singing but amen aren't you glad you he loves you and he made a way for you and and nothing can pluck you out of the palm of his hands you know brother billy made a statement last sunday night that just been thrilling me he said that god created his own believers amen i thought that's just exactly what god has done he does the work and he creates the people there to believe it aren't you glad you're one of them this evening amen just gonna just thrilled we we had a wonderful prayer meeting uh last evening and uh just a good spirit a good turnout real excited for that and we just want to encourage you to uh remember that the first of the tuesday after communion we have a prayer meeting here at the church once a month and we're looking for that we have a young people's christmas dinner coming up on i believe it's the 17th is that correct is that the day friday the 17th i think it's one of those days coming up here if it's not 18th it's the 18th so you'd be eating on thursday so it's the 18th and we want to keep that in mind and and just the other things that are are going on and i think we ought to just let the joy bells bring ring in in our life and people see what it what is it that makes you so happy it's your sins are washed away amen i'm excited to hear what uh brother randy has on his heart for us tonight and i'm expecting the lord to uh to uh really uh move on on that behalf and are you gonna sing a song for us before you preach i mean you know somebody's got two gifts he's gotta use it he's gotta use them both so i'll i won't i'll just let brother randy go with the service with however he wants and uh i'm just excited for the goodness of the lord amen i just know god loves us and nothing can pluck us out of the palm of his hand so brother randy whatever you choose to do to preach or sing or just god be with you i guess we could uh just sing a congregational song if maybe before we get into the word here we'll just sing that song i surrender all i believe that's the hour we're living in is it's a surrendering hour as we heard our brother matthew just talking about dying to ourselves the last wednesday i believe we're in that hour of a gethsemane time for the for the bride where she's trying to lay it all down so let's just sing maybe a couple verses this song we'll get into the word by his [Music] grace i will never love and trust him [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] surrendered [Music] is [Music] take me down i [Music] surrendered [Music] [Applause] [Music] surrender [Music] make it a prayer tonight [Music] we please that thou [Music] art [Music] my last verse [Music] oh [Music] we praise the name of jesus i surrender i surrendered [Music] amen that's our desire this evening we want to surrender all to him amen amen everybody feel happy this evening you should because you're in the presence of the lord and the scripture says that in his presence his fullness of joy so you're going to fulfill the word amen and we're going to be full of joy this evening let's turn in the scripture if we could to first corinthians chapter 7. i'm going to read a couple of uh three different verses here first corinthians chapter 7 and then we're going to go to matthew chapter 6 after that and we're going to read first corinthians chapter 7 verses 32 to 34. verse 32 says but i would have you without carefulness he that is unmarried care for the things that belong to the lord how may be how he may please the lord but he that is married careth for the things that that are of the world how he may please his wife there is difference also between a wife and a virgin the unmarried woman careth for the things of the lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit but she that is married care for the things of the world how she may please her husband amen let's turn to matthew chapter six and then the last verse we're going to go to is the book of philemon matthew chapter 6. verse 24 no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon and then the book of philemon if you're looking for it because it's so tiny it's the book directly before hebrews and we'll just read the first two verses paul a prisoner of jesus christ and timothy our brother unto philemon our dearly beloved and fellow laborer and to our beloved affia and archips or archipus our fellow soldier and to the church in thy house we'll just read verse three as well grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ amen let's just power our heads in a prayer heavenly father lord as we just opened your word this evening lord we can open up the the natural pages lord but it takes the holy ghost lord your very life to reveal it to the to the soul of a man or a person lord and we just ask right now that your spirit would just be amongst your people this evening to speak to the hearts of the believers lord may you draw us closer to you lord may you anoint your people anoint the service by your grace lord that your perfect will be done and that you get glory to yourself we just lift up the name of the lord jesus this evening and we do it all according to you by your grace and and your will we ask it lord in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated maybe a couple of verses that maybe seem a little discordant in the way they kind of go together but i just trust the way the lord put it on my heart i trust you know he'll make a way to open it to you the way he revealed it uh to me um when in the the book of philemon there in the first verse i was really taken by the message brother branham preached on a prisoner and uh i guess if you want to title it that's kind of what i would title it you know what uh the age that we're living in we understand we're in that end of the laodicean age and you know we we use all the terms that we like to use but we talk about that transitioning period we've been smitten out of that age we're in a bright age now and yet we're still living in a layout to see an age we're definitely in that blending over time and the thing that really just strikes my heart about it is the lord doesn't show it us any of these things without a purpose and we understand the age that we live in laodicea uh brother branham typed it as that was a woman it's a woman's name and and we understand it's definitely a woman's age we see the the age of the woman and and what they call women's liberty or the different the feminist movement and all the things that they're doing and but we also understand that the very meaning of that word was people's rights and if there's any hour that we're seeing it more and more manifest the how the natural man can become twisted in their if they're trying the blind leading the blind won't they all fall into the ditch and we're seeing it to be perfectly honest we're seeing it on all sides you know and i can't help you know we have to maybe make reference as much as we don't like to make reference to the political realm of things going on because we're living in the world we're living in the world where we're not of the world we're from above by the grace of god thank you brother sorry and the world that we live in is certainly possessed by that spirit i'm sorry brother i was probably juking you out a little bit i apologize this is going i don't even know didn't even know i was doing it but i appreciate that brother um but we're in that age of people's rights and and we understand that it's a spirit that is completely taken over the age and so much that if you really were to actually boil down on a natural scale the two sides of the argument we see now between what we call conservative or liberal or whatever they want to name names they want to give themselves we find one they would both boil down to the same idea they want their rights just just goes to show you that a natural man with a natural mind in a natural world with a natural spirit is gonna lead them straight into a ditch because on one side we have one that says well i wanna i'm gonna do everything i can for our what we call our constitutional rights and no doubt to an extent that's a wonderful thing we're grateful for it and the freedoms we still have and on the other side they say well i want to have my rights to call myself whatever i want to call myself to behave however i want to behave and i'm just putting that nicely but we understand what these things are in this age but we see they both boil down to what they want their rights i want to be able to do what i want to do i want to be able to live the way i want to live i want to be able to act the way i want to act but this the bride of jesus christ has been called to something greater than to be caught up in all the little things that are going on in this world it's a whirlwind brothers and sisters that's going on right now no doubt i was i talked to people at work in different ones it's like can you believe it in just a couple short months it's already going to be a year since all this madness began it was march of this year when they started locking everything down i told my wife lindsey i said i remember it's one of those odd things you know they said back you know back in the day they said do you remember where you were when jfk was assassinated do you remember where you were with 9 11. i remember exactly where i was when i was listening on the radio interested in what was going on and i heard california and locked down i was sitting i was in the kitchen making dinner cutting up some peppers or something like that i remember where i was why because the the whirlwind and the things that are happening the the world and that's it's moving we're living in prophetic times we are living in the fulfillment of the word of god in this age we're seeing these things come to pass and if we're not careful the bride has been called to be so much higher than all these little things that we so many times concern ourselves with we worry about oh what about my retirement plan oh i work people worry about well what about my job i would people worry about these things and those things and i think we ministered it before but worry is such an evil thing it's it's a virtue sucker there's no virtue in worry it's a perversion of love the devil tries to get people to think that you care by worrying the devil's always chirping in the ears of the people oh you don't care for that person because you're not worrying about them well it's because i do care that i don't have to worry because i can bring my prayers before a loving heavenly father and knows he hears my prayers he knows what's best for me he knows what's coming down the line i don't have to fear anything because you know we know what lies ahead for us we're given an expected end i don't know we worry so much about the in between all i know is that he that begun a good work in me is faithful to complete it and i know that the end of the work that he's began in me is a come up hither is it a moment in the twinkling of an eye how is it going to happen i don't know quite frankly i don't care as long as i'll be there and i know i'll be there because he promised i would be so we see the world so caught up in an idea everybody's fighting for their rights but in this day god has called a people to give up their rights the whole rest of the world is fighting for what's mine well this is mine i have a right to this job i have a right to this standard of living i have a right to have this and i have a right to have that left up to our own devices the only right that the p that a man has is a one-way ticket to hell because they came into this world speaking lies born and shaped in iniquity and without the grace of the lord jesus christ to cleanse us from unrighteousness that's the only right that you have in the natural everybody wants to fight for those rights the only right i want to fight for is my right to serve my god and i'm not going to even fight for it necessarily naturally i'm looking because i i'm above we are above those things brothers and sisters these if we're looking at we're looking for a city whose builder and maker is gone we're not looking to live up for ourselves treasure here we're not looking to build a kingdom on this side but i want to be a prisoner of jesus christ i really started thinking about this idea of a prisoner what is what is a prisoner and i started going through and and i and i noticed when i wrote it down and then i went and listened to that message of prisoner it was like the lord had put me right in sync with what the with the holy ghost was speaking because the first thing i wrote down is when you go to prison what's the first thing that happens you are stripped of everything that was yours they take all your clothes they take all your possessions they take all of your things that would have identified you as you on the outside you become a prisoner and you're given a jumpsuit whatever it might be most of the time they're gonna cut your hair they're going to buzz all the hair off for the you know the guys and everything and they're going to what are they doing they're taking away that identity of who you are and they're putting you into a place they're stripping away everything that you were because you're a prisoner you're a prisoner they bring you in there they say get rid of your you got to get rid of everything you're wearing you got to take your keys out of your pocket you got to throw your wallet over here it doesn't matter that doesn't belong to you anymore you forfeited that right and now you're a prisoner i want you to think spiritually because and so many times brother branham said it i didn't get all the quotes written down but you can listen to it as a short message you can listen to it he said so we don't people don't want to be stripped of who they are they don't want to be stripped of their own ideas they don't want to be stripped of their own devices their own desires they don't we don't so many times we don't want to be stripped of our own our own wants and what we think that we need and what did it come back it circles all the way back to what we've been ministering on about those channels that get clogged up why because we clog it up here for a desire to hold on to maybe a memory of what we used to be we we hold on to a taste of something we used to like when we were in the world we hold on to some kind of affection when jesus said set your affections on things that are above not the things that are here in the world we're called to be a prisoner to take away that doesn't mean look according to the natural we're all different god's got a variety this isn't what so many people would say is a cult to to to the extent where we're all going to sit here and we're going to wear the exact same colors and all these different because we're not looking at the natural we're looking at the spiritual brothers and sisters it's a time for the people of god to come into conformance not with a man's ideas but to come in conformance with the word of god because the people of god are a prisoner to the world we can't do anything outside of that when you go into a prison you got bars you got walls what is that i'm not going to go beyond this word you don't have to you don't have to go there but in the book of numbers chapter 35 it talks about the cities of refuge and when a man would be guilty of an accidental manslaughter we caught it was an accident he didn't mean to do it and he goes and flees into the city he could be free in that city of refuge and safe as long as he remained in the city but if the moment he left that city that slayer of blood would be waiting for him ready to strike at any moment ready to kill him and take him down why because he said he wasn't content to dwell in the place that god had provided for him i wonder how many times we get discontented with what the bars that god has set up for us did we not hear the prophet saying they say the song says we let down the bars we let down the bars we stopped we stopped fighting against sin we let down the bars the sheep got out but how did the goats get in he said why you let down the bars see the world looks at you and thinks that you're a prisoner to some kind of cultish mental conception but they don't even know just like the johnny crow that they're the ones that could be set free but refuse to live in the liberty of jesus christ the rest of the world i tell you it's just like going to a zoo forgive me for using it this expression but it's the way simplest way that's the being the believer it's like having the freedom to go to the zoo and you look at the lion and you say wow look at that lion but you don't dare go in there because they'll kill you and that lion looking at you and you'd say oh poor lion he's confined to that area and it's just the people of the world look at you like the lion looking out and like in santa they're saying oh poor human they're so confined to to their out there whatever it is because they can't without a revelation you can't even have a concept of the liberty of jesus christ for the believer the freedom from sin where i don't have to stress about where i'm going i don't have to stress about what my life and we stress because we don't believe we stress because our lack of faith we worry because lack of love remember love is a perversion of worry you worry because love is not perfected yet because if love was perfected how could you worry god hold jesus christ holds all things in his hands we sang that song as little children he's got the whole world our faith ought to go back to that place where we could say he's got the whole world in his hands it's so it becomes such a simple thing that we over complicate by mental conceptions and a desire really going it has to be this way because if we avoid and forgive me for explaining in a natural way but this is how my mind works i visualize things i've always looked at it like the way god has done things it was like that we called it that loop right we're in this loop of time that broke out of eternity and we broke out in the garden of eden they broke out let's go downwards because it was a downward spiral going down towards hell and then jesus christ came and we're back on an upward spiral an upward spiral going into eternity and in order to do that we're re-treading these grounds we're fighting old deal i was talking with brother brother david in the back talking about those two hundred thousand thousand demons out of euphrates brother branham said those were ancient demons and to deluvian devils what was it we've got to come face to face with exactly what eve struck in the garden of eden only this bride will defeat it and it's not because i am anything it's not even because the bride's anything because i will keep all the praise of the lord jesus christ and it isn't even because of william branham he brought the message to show us that the truth of jesus christ in this word has already finished the work he pointed away i don't cling just to the signpost but i follow it i follow onward when he said behold the lamb of god that taketh away the sin of the world i believed it do i understand it no i don't understand all of it couldn't explain it if i could it's no longer faith if i could brother i brought believe brother matthew was preaching that very same if you could explain it it's not faith i think brother brother billy said the same thing if you could explain it see but that what is that that's that demon that's that devil it's satan himself that eve fought in the garden brother branham said i believe it was satan's eden it was satan's eating their souls that imprisoned one of those but he talked about eve he said what happened he said she lusted for knowledge and that's what the bride is struggling with right now because we're looking at ourselves and we see failure we're looking at our churches and we see failure we're looking at our own lives we're looking at our families and we're seeing destruction we're seeing devastation we're seeing failure we're seeing no way out and the devil's whispering how's it going to happen he said it would but how he said it would but you got to understand how it's going to happen i don't got to understand anything except he said it would happen abraham and sarah didn't have to understand one bit except he promised a son through sarah and he promised a son jesus christ to be part of this bride in this hour so quit trying to figure it out i believe paul said or peter talking about those things he said and paul i think it was peter because he's talking about paul he said these things have been spoken hard to be understood he said and they that wrestle with wrestle it to their own destruction try to figure it out try to try to understand it all that is a look i have no problem with understanding the scripture says get to the understanding we want understanding we want spiritual understanding we want supernatural understanding you're telling me that that there were disciples who saw this crazy man on the on the on the bank of the river jordan screaming out to another man who was supposedly illegitimately born behold the lamb of god and he's the only one that saw the dove he's the only one that saw it and we're talking about angels and pillars of fire and cloud that was for him anyway for the most part i i was te and forgive me for even saying it this way i am grateful for the ministry of brother branham and the miracles and those things i believe all of them i believe it but i didn't live back then i have believed and yet not seen so there's a greater blessing first of all that was a condemnation to that generation because it was right in front of them could you imagine if it was right in front of them now i mean they already think you're nuts it's okay but that was for that was for that i believe it but there's a reason why we don't get videotapes to see all the miracles because i was called to believe the word i believe the miracles absolutely but i don't believe this message because of anything else other than the word of god that was quicken in my heart and that's all i'm going to say on that matter only because i i'm that's not my that's not my intention i just know that it's by faith it's not by sight praise the lord he the lord wants a bride that is completely surrendered given up all the rights remember that brother brandon always typed that land that lamb just gives up its rights it just gives just it can't do anything else oh you're just uh you're just a dumb message believer person thing whatever they want that's great that's fine i don't want to be smart anyway because not many wives not many powerful not many wealthy according to the flesh are called so i don't mind being in the group that that's a little simpler that can that can have the faith of a child and say you know what i don't understand all the other stuff but i believe the word of god can i explain it no you know what a theologian probably wrapped me in knots about certain things you know what and and you know what that why would that move me god doesn't play for anybody oh well the lord surely would come down and give give you what you need to say to tie that guy in a knot well not necessarily i mean just might not be the hour who are you who are you to judge how many times how many times have all of us wanted to be able to stand up and see the power of god come down to prove somebody wrong and not for our even our own selfish desires but just because we're tired of seeing our lord jesus trodden under feet and say lord how we wish sometimes i wish i could say lord something you know you would will it to happen because our desire is to uplift jesus christ and to show he is alive but it wouldn't work anyway because if they're not called to believe they won't we're in a gleaming time brothers and sisters we are in a gleaning time few and far between and it's only preparing us for preaching to the lost you think it's bad now when witness witness witness witness and one comes in every 10 years wait till you know that everything's done and everyone you witness to can't take it i'll take divine love then it'll take absolute divine love but people don't want to be stripped when they go into this prison of everything that they are it's the only way to come into christ paul said i had to forget everything i knew everything that i was i count is dumb garbage trash that i might win christ and so many times we're holding on to little things here little things there little things here little things there when it's time to examine ourselves and realize this is this is the hour this is a gethsemane time this is a try this is a pressing time our sins we want our sins to go before throw them out there lord i you know i tell you what i listen my uh lindsay and i listen to this audiobook that a brother told me from ohio on uh charles chinoquie called 50 years in the church of rome if you never heard of it i would suggest listening to it because i tell you what is an eye-opener to show on just the you see the perversion the lord allowed a man to literally stay in that church for 50 years from the time he was a child a priest for like 25 or 26 years and always had a poll that the word that's what so encouraged me is this man lived in the time of wesley the wesleyan age but there was something burning in his heart that it was the word of god he said he would always look around throughout the entire book it would always come down to why do i see these things in the word and yet this church is pressing so hard against it he said should we not cherish the word of god to see that same spirit in someone that many hundred a hundred something years ago it's so encouraging but the lord delivered him from that and what happened he became a prisoner of not a church but of jesus christ and that's what we have a lot of is we have so many prisoners to other things other than jesus christ you know and it's only natural you know anybody that would amount to anything in something that they love has to become a prisoner to it you think lebron james you know what great is one of the greatest basketball players ever grew up basketball in his hand all the time what was he he's a prisoner to the game of basketball he you know why you know what he does with the game of basketball he wakes up and he thinks about basketball then he goes and does a practice about basketball he eats meals specifically designed to help him to play basketball he trains in such a way specifically for the game of basketball then he goes to film study sessions to understand better the game of basketball that's just a natural thing even paul said does not if you strive for the masteries in timothy he said he said no man entangleth that's called to be a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of the world so that he can please him who has called him to be a soldier and i look at someone like a lebron james or all these different great what the world would call great people and they're great at what they do no doubt and what is it they've they've forsaken all the other things while the rest of the you know you think about i remember because lebron james is almost exactly like my age i think born like a year or two later or something so when i was just coming out of high school i think he was like a year or two behind because he came out right after that and he was right down the road like three hours away in akron ohio and i thought now i look back i think that guy was in high school and he was so committed to what he was doing he was such a prisoner to the idea of being the best basketball player that his entire life revolved around that one goal when he was in high school when i was in high school i was just wanting to be done this guy was so focused but you see what it will produce when someone will sell out everything they got and put their entire life around it so what happens when you go into a prison what happens they take everything away from you and then what starts happening you get the standard issue prison garment then what do you do you eat the same meals you all get the same food you all live in the same place you dwell in the same place oh i love it kind of sounds almost like a wedding supper doesn't it but see the world looks at you like you're crazy like the lion looking out feeling sorry for the human see because we have to go beyond what a natural prison is see we may the world looks at us like we're in this confined little space according to the flesh and we are because i want to confine this flesh to a box six feet underground every day right dying to this flesh every day i want to be confined according to the flesh every day for the lord jesus i want to sell all that stuff out because it profits nothing and i want to be sold out in the spirit what are they doing they're all eating the same food they're all wearing the same thing and i like this too i said they got they have guards they have wardens the scripture might call them watchmen upon the towers always just call them out if they start to wander outside the outside the gates and try to get out and make it make an escape the watchman's right there get back in get back in line but we one thing they're always looking for that holy ghost is always going through looking for is a contraband in the prison kind of like aiken took a babylonious garment little gold wedge maybe you're holding on to that little that little uh animosity that you had for someone over there maybe you're holding on to these little i know brother matthew's been preaching on it a lot and it's sure enough the truth about those cell phones and the games and all the little things that seem okay and then they just it becomes more and more it's a little fox and it's gonna spoil the vine it's the world that we live in you might as well get used to it i was discussing it with uh with a guy i worked a midnight shift last night actually i worked until about 6 30 in the morning this morning and i was talking with him we were just kind of got a discussion about having children because he's been he just got married a few months ago and we were talking about that i said you know i i'd have a hard time even giving my children a cell phone and i was trying to think of an age and i was like ever i i i just i and he looked at me like i was like i was like really think about it i told i said i grew up and it's really to the young people especially because i can't even fathom i grew up in the era right when the internet was coming in i was in the weird kind of day where if you use the internet the phone didn't work anymore and the evil that was accessible then and now they put it right at your fingertips a hundred hundred thousand times more powerful than what sent people to the moon in the fingertips can access information from anywhere it is literally a tree of knowledge of good and evil in the palm of your hand and people think that it's not dangerous it's you ever heard the story of the they say it's like the little old wives tale of the frozen serpent the woman that found the serpent and it was frozen and she picked it up and she said oh poor serpent you're frozen and he says please help me so she holds it to her bosom and starts warming and says i'll help you because i care about nature i want to help so then she's warming up the serpent she goes home and the serpent bites her after it wakes up out of this little frozen thing and she looks at the serpent says why'd you bite me he looks at her like are you crazy you knew i was a serpent when you picked me up that's my nature and we walk around and we understand these things we've been preaching i've heard brother david preach and i've heard brother matthew brother billy and everybody else we know the nature of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and yet we invite it into our lives and then we wonder why we get bitten did not the lord say if your eye offend you pluck it out if your hand offends you cut it off i think we got to do a lot more cutting and plucking you yeah you say you look crazy you know i would rather look crazy trying to invite the lord into my life and not have any obstacles there because then he say would it not be better for you to go into glory halt or lame or blind than to enter fully into the into hell so which is better i'll leave the question to you we've got to start cutting brothers and sisters we've got to start if we want to see the spirit of god manifested in our lives we got to start cutting i think about joshua joshua lost one battle and he called a halt to everything and he said hold up a second my god doesn't lose and if you lose it if we lose it has nothing to do with him because he's perfect he never lost a battle so if we're losing somewhere there's something wrong here it's me oh lord it's me o lord standing in the need of prayer that doesn't mean we start cold pointing fingers because what's the next verse in the song not my brother not my sister but it's me oh lord standing in the need of prayer see it sounds simple sounds childish but if we don't have the faith of a child that's how we're going to enter in how do you think brother branham did it it looked insane to get off that plane in memphis and just started walking looked crazy you're going to miss your plane well the lord told me i just he had that child-like faith he had a child-like attitude when it came to the things of god why because he trusted him he'd been through the ringer we're all going through the ringer and we're going to come out like gold because you are gold you just don't know it yet it's there you're a gold nugget that the lord's just polishing he's just polishing sometimes he's got to take the hammer sometimes he's got to take the heat sometimes he's got to take the sandpaper sometimes it's rough sometimes it's smooth but he's just polishing that nugget getting ready to put it in the treasury and you got a nugget you will be here if that wasn't there but he's calling it right now i don't want to keep us too much longer but you know we've got to be into a place you know i i guess just we'll just tie it in here and we'll just close with this because i don't want to keep us late that verse in in corinthians paul says the the man that is unmarried careth for the things of the lord how he please the lord he that is married careth for the things of the world how he pleases his wife now i want you to take that anti-type to the spiritual because so many times we find ourselves caring about the things of the world when we ought to be married to christ and caring about the things that would please him see paul's talking about the natural but we can take that into the spiritual could we not say he that is married to christ careth not for the things of the world but how he may please the lord jesus but he that isn't married he may they may care a little bit more for the things of the world how many how many they might get their career a little bit better how might they get a little better standing at their job how how might they look better to the people that they're around every day how they maybe they'll move up in the church oh i want to do this or i want to do that looking to the natural things maybe maybe we got to be more married to christ and and i i really enjoyed how brother billy put it on sunday how if we're married to christ like that let's be like the woman at simon's house and concern ourselves with the things that would please our lord washing his feet worship prayer all these things that the world would look at you and say you're crazy yeah but you don't see i'm married i'm married to him so i don't concern myself with the things of the world anymore i concern myself with how i may please my husband and my husband isn't a natural husband he's a spiritual husband the scripture says that the government when it's speaking of christ in the old testament says the government would be upon his shoulders you know that comes from the old jewish marriage where when they would be married the woman would take off her veil and wrap it around the shoulders of the man and what was it it was indicating she has given headship unto her husband and she is coming underneath that headship that's what christ wants from us to be underneath the headship of jesus christ who is the word the world looks at you like you're crazy but but paul said i'm a prisoner of jesus christ and when he would want to do things he said we we wanted to go into this place but the spirit did not suffer us so i didn't go he didn't do a balaam and kept going lord can i please go lord can i please go lord can i please go we saw what would happen brother branham even showed us what would happen in africa we said lord can i go he said yeah you can go but you're going to suffer i'm you know i'm great and we've we could be a witness to that how many of you have suffered maybe for pushing against the door a few too many times and the lord was trying to hold it closed and he said lord i really want to go through the door and you would fall right off the ledge the lord said i told you not to go through the door see it's it seems simple but it's the hardest thing because what is it it's dying to this flesh it's putting this flesh see you got to put the flesh in the prison box put it under the ground so that your soul can live in liberty to jesus christ and that's the only way your greatest enemy is yourself so lock them in a prison there's you're gonna be a prisoner no matter what let's turn to the book of romans chapter oh i didn't write down i'll find it uh i i i i'm not very good at remembering chapters and i only wrote down the verses so uh if any of you find it before me it would be the scripture where he speaks of not being uh you'll be servants to them who you yield yourselves to obey and i i'm not very good with remembering chapters i remember verse is okay but forgive me six praise the lord thank you thanks so thank the lord so we'll just read verse 12 through 23 i want you to listen to this we'll start at verse 11. likewise reckon ye you also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it and listen to the words he's using that you should obey it in the luster of what what did james say he said every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own lusts and many times we don't want to look that in the mirror and realize that when there's something pulling it's expressing the lord's using it as an opportunity to expose the devil when you look into the mirror of the word and you see something that isn't right the lord is giving you an opportunity to expose that devil and lay the axe to the root so we get so worried or we get so we get so prideful i guess maybe the word or we just want to be willfully ignorant oh well i'm okay this and that well i'm just chosen yeah you are chosen i believe that but we've got to get down to a point of reality of lord if there's something wrong is this pulling me i see this thing pulling because i can't the lord doesn't tempt you he's not putting that there that's the devil so especially you young people are going through changing to life and different things in the world that we're in that i couldn't even fathom now when you see things pulling recognize that the lord is giving you an opportunity to expose the devil because the devil he's not good at hiding when when you start shining the light of the word oh that devil can't hide he can't hide when you're honest with yourself he can't hide he's going to try but brother the reason brother branham preached that message door door and the door door to the heart all these little doors this time you know what it's time for a spring cleaning time to go through start flinging open the door say lord clean it all out he says he says verse 13 neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god amen amen i want you to understand this do you hear any words of god just shoving you forward no he's saying yield yourself it is it's a free moral agency you've got to be willing to place it out there the lord will help you but you've got to be willing to put it on the altar and say lord take this from me lord i'm struggling with this i'm struggling with with uh with drunkenness or i'm struggling with with cigarettes or whatever it might be or gambling all these things that we talk about lust or all the things in the world that are out there today put it on the altar call of sin out and say lord i want to yield myself as an instrument of righteousness i want to come underneath your headship i want to come underneath this word he said for sin shall not have dominion over you yes sir that's a promise right there sin shall not have dominion over you i don't know if you listen to the election stuff i've listened to some of you here they talk about the dominion election systems there's a reason why these words get thrown out there because we're seeing what's happening in this world i'm just telling you i'm looking at it spiritually naturally the lord sets up kings he taketh down kings he does what he will you go through the old testament and see how the lord will raise up a righteous one raise up an evil one raise up a righteous one raise up and eat why he's got his purpose i don't i don't have to worry about it the lord's got that in control he didn't thank the lord he didn't call me to be a politician or something like that i always heard a joke i shouldn't joke but they said politicians you know a math poly a polygon poly means many and ticks are blood sucking little creatures politics lots of little blood sucking little creatures you got to be careful so for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace so praise the lord for grace thank the lord for a capstone that came with a double portion crying grace grace i'm in need of a double portion brothers and sisters because the scripture says with much knowledge comes much sorrow and you know what when that gospel light of this word that we received in this day came shining down and even to this day shines down in my life you see just how short you come every day every day thank the lord for a double portion of grace because i need it if you don't need it i'll take your portion that's all right because i know i need it said what then shall we sin because we are under the law but under grace god forbid no ye not now listen that to whom you yield yourself servants to obey his servants ye are to whom you obey so you're gonna be a servant to something that's the kind of the crux of the whole matter this evening if i could boil it down because what do we say in the beginning all the sides in the natural are crying out people's rights i want a right to do this i want a right to do that i have this right i have that right they don't even realize that they're all serving something every single one of them everybody oh i was i was free i would i am free man i have this freedom and this and that and what what not you know paul said one time when he was taken in custody and they beat him and he said and the lord gave him wisdom and he said he said you're beating a roman and that soldier stopped he said wait a second i thought you're a jew he said no i'm a i'm a roman he said with a great price i achieved this freedom and i liked what paul said said yeah but i was freeborn i was born free yes sir i was born free in the name of jesus he christ but you're free they all think that they're free according to the flesh but yeah they may be free according to the flesh because they'll just let those lusts of the flesh do whatever they want to do but in the spiritual they're chained brother branham called them souls that are in prison now don't even know they're in prison just like the lion caged up oh poor human if only they knew how much freedom i had in this in this little cage world that i got i got to hold 30 feet to go back and forth the people come in every day and give me all the meat that i want to eat i don't have to worry about anything that's what the devil tricks the people with because those guys in the zoo they don't have to worry about nothing they're just giving everything they need they're just we're giving everything we need too the lord just lets it look a little bit lumpier sometimes because we live by faith not by sight but they'll just live this nice easy life the lord the lord jesus said verily verily they have their reward they have their reward but we want to live in obedience to the lord jesus he says know ye not verse 16 know ye not that to whom you yield yourself servants to obey his servants ye are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness but god be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart oh amen thank the lord for a seed that could be awoken thank the lord for a light that could shine down it only takes an instant it only takes an instant for that light to strike the seed and then no matter what is in front of that seed it's going to grow it's going to go it's got to as someone who just bought a house a few years ago i could testify and see that grass that grows up the side of the concrete it grows up there it doesn't matter just like the lily oh it just needs a little bit of light to hit the seed and that lily's going to push its way up but you bebade from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to you being then made free from sin you became the servants of righteousness see this is what i love it's because when you have a revelation oh well you're just you just live according to all these rules no i'm a love slave i'm bound the scripture says i i i i want to say it was hosea maybe he called it he said i drew you with bands of love i i'm i'm wrapped in bands of love that's what i want to be i'm a love slave for the lord jesus now i don't care about my own ideas you know the world makes looking at it like a marriage because we understand the world makes marriage now i remember growing up when i was watching tv when i was a child and they had all the sitcoms and all the television shows and they always made marriage look like the most burdensome horrible thing oh i gotta go what are you doing tonight jim oh i gotta go out with the wife again i gotta hang out with the family you know and everybody would laugh and it would be all hilarious and what what has it done it's sowed seeds and now we see a world that couldn't care less about family couldn't care less about raising children according to any moral compass let alone the scripture we know that's true we see the insanity in the world but they make it look so burdensome why because from the very beginning marriage was the natural pinnacle of expression of what god wanted to have as a relationship with his people and from the very beginning satan weaseled his way in there and destroyed the very first marriage and he's been working at it ever since but what is it god's called us i don't when i live with sister lindsey i when i go home i'm grateful to go home to to see my wife i'm grateful to to be able to spend time with her and and to be able to eat dinner with her and and we have coffee most every mornings and different things that's and how much more god the lord jesus wants to fellowship with his bride how much more does he want you to to love coming to the house of god to love getting in that prayer closet to love to think about him and just if we could get back to the joy of our salvation when that band a predestination was put on there and that first that betrayal of the holy ghost giving you the down payment just led you so in love with him you hear it all the time in the natural oh i wish we could get back to the honeymoon phase we can in jesus christ live in the spirit if you find the love waxing a little cold you got to stoke the fires fall in love with the lord jesus again remember how he brought you out of sin start remember if you can't even think of anything how'd that fire get lit where did you come from where are you going what is he making you don't look it right now look at what he's done for you how far he's brought you what he's delivered you from already and if he's done it before he'll do it again there's a psalm that says he'll do it again for you he'll do it again he'll do it again we've seen that song all the time that uh that i would not be denied satan said my lord was gone and would not hear my prayer see you can't take it away from me now devil praise the lord the work is done it's already done you can't take once you realize a revelation is so powerful once everything is revealed it can't be unrevealed and they it and it shows in this age because they have the saying that goes around they said once you see they have the little things that pop up say once you've seen it you can't unsee it you ever seen those little things they do little catch phrases like it'll be like maybe an optical illusion let's say once you see it you can't unsee it why it's a carnal version of a revelation because once the veil is torn between you and your god between you and your husband and you see jesus christ in you there's nothing that could take that away can't take it away you can't tell me that this bible isn't black you could come and torture me you could threaten me you could do literally everything you wanted and i may even in the natural say it's blue you know in the natural kind of i just want the pain to end whatever but a real revelation you could never they could never be anything else but black because it is what it is so is it for the bride of jesus christ it's been revealed to you and just like they proved throughout the dark ages just like they proved today no manner of of tribulation no manner of trial can wrench a revelation from the heart of a believer it cannot be done go read fox's book of martyrs a little bit and see how much it can't be done and think in the spiritual you're going through worse than that even in this day every day the devil just pounded away trying to trying to rip it away and we see the shakings going on even now but praise be to god it's anchored deep it's anchored on revelation that's why that's the rock because you can't take it away it can't be taken away being then made free from sin you became the servants of righteousness i speak after the manner of men because of the affirmative your flesh for as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness and holiness for when you were the servants of sin you are free from righteousness wow that's an interesting way to put it i was free from righteousness when i was in the world that sounds like a horrible thing i was free from holiness i was you you know when you were in the world you were free from peace you were free from healing oh man wouldn't you like to be freed from healing no i want to be bound up in healing i want to be bound up in peace if that's what being a prisoner is is being at peace is being in righteousness it's being in holiness i want to be a prisoner to those things i want to be locked up in it so much that it's inseparable amen thank the lord amen but now being made free from sin and become servants to god you have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord amen let's just all stand i've always enjoyed that scripture romans 6 23 the wages of sin is death but the gift of god there's such a contrast there because what's the difference between wages and a gift you got to work for one of them thought it was a simple thing when brother branham said a man has to fight his way to hell but you have to fight the grace of god paul that's why paul would say i don't frustrate the grace of god i don't want to frustrate the grace of god i don't want to fight against these things lord help us to be submissive we're getting married the marriage supper of the lamb the marriage between the bride of jesus christ and the bridegroom we got to put the government on his shoulders for our lives we've got to become submissive to him in all things the world's gonna look at you crazy it's all right they already do you know what sometimes the people around you look crazy you know they agrippa said paul much learning doth make me mad i said no i'm not crazy i'm just a prisoner i'm just a prisoner to jesus christ i i can only speak for myself but knowing what i've been through since the lord revealed this word to me this message in the hour that we've come to receive and the the truth of the the word of god and the absolute perfection of jesus christ in his word there have been times i've tried to run away unsuccessfully because no matter where i would go there's a witness that would always cry out because it was anchored i couldn't you can't unreveal it you can't do it moses tried to run and you know he did he only ran right into the plan of god in the end he only ran right where god needed him to be at the moment that abraham he tried this and he tried that he only got himself right where he needed to be jacob tried doing this tried doing that only got himself right where he needed to be so maybe as we just don't bow our heads this evening i'm just going to raise my hands if you want to raise your hands you can just say lord i want to be a prisoner to you lord jesus maybe you've been running from the lord jesus maybe you've been maybe there's something in your heart that's crying out this word is the truth i believe it but i just i don't know if i could be a prisoner you can be a prisoner you can be a prisoner if you just lay it all down he said if you just yield yourselves remember yield your members unto him yield yourself unto the lord jesus it may not happen everything overnight the way the natural mind would see but that's where the devil would get you is trying to make you to understand it lord how is it going to work how is this going to happen but just like he told the children of israel when it came to the promised land he said little by little you'll possess the land little by little you'll take it you're going to get little by little you'll see these things fall you'll see this other thing fall maybe you've been looking at this this problem that you've had for so long and you've been so focused on that you didn't even see that the lord got rid of that temper that you used to hold on to because the devil's got you focused over here but just let the lord have his perfect work in your life i just want to raise my hand say lord i want to be a prisoner to you i want to i want to give up all of my rights lord i want to put on the wedding garment i want to eat the food that you supply me lord i want to i want to live the way you would have me to live i want to surrender myself to you let's just have a word of prayer lord jesus lord i believe the cry of everyone's heart this evening oh god is to be completely surrendered unto you lord jesus to come under the headship of our bridegroom to come under the headship of our husband lord we don't want to be carried about by the cares of the world or but we want to be married to you and only caring about the things that would please our husband lord and everything that we would say and do our attitudes the way we act and think the way we treat our brothers and sisters the way we treat those around us oh god may it be in such a way that we could say lord it was pleasing to you because i seen it in your word that you gave divine love in our hearts to love those that don't love us lord that we could love the unlovable lord because lord no doubt that sometimes we looked at ourselves and we thought we were unlovable oh god but your love came down and scooped us up out of the pit of hell and lord you've raised us into the joyous presence lord of of your son the lord jesus we just thank you o god for your grace and mercy lord if there be any barriers any hindrances i pray o god that your anointing would go and break the yoke of the enemy lord that the holy ghost would minister to your people this evening lord you are worthy of all praise you're worthy of all glory and honor we lift up the name of jesus christ this evening oh god our husband are all in all the apple of our eye [Music] lord we can't explain things in the natural the lord is because it's by faith and we can't explain the supernatural lord but we're walking by faith we're trusting you lord that you've begun a good work in us and that you're faithful to complete it we're looking to that our lord even now may we just surrender more of ourselves to you lord may we be more consecrated more sincere in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen [Music] do you know that song living by faith i care not today the lord i know [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] i'm [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh for the show amen amen story need prayer we're going to pray for our sister lord you know tonight i would just like to ask as you heard the gospel go forth and i don't think it was a gospel of condemnation at all i felt it was a gospel of invite to just come up a little higher and i'm sure that as the gospels preach certain things in your life came to mind certain things in my life came to mind that i need to work on that or i need to go do it let those things that that were quickened to you go out and bring them to pass in your life by by addressing them and and you know maybe you sat there and said you know i don't read my bible as much as i should that then then you know just don't be hearers of the word but make a positive action and you know take the seed of the word and plant it in your life and then watch the fruit of it grow and and we do it for the lord but remember he said if they'll know you are my disciples if you're loved you have one for another and and we were told that jesus would rather have us love one another then love him so remember the life that you start dedicating to christ is also for everybody in this room that all of us can move up higher and i just think it's a beautiful gospel just to dedicate our lives move up a little higher get a little bit more of the world out take it step by step and see if we can rise up and then if we do that when someone comes in our midst and has a prayer request or a need then we're ready to step up aren't we so we're going to pray brother billy and take the service down [Music] obscuring the brightness of night oh i'm naval alarm at the overcast car the pastor looks on me first [Music] oh and i'm trusting confined [Music] it is sheltering [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] from all i'm saying in a sheltering home
