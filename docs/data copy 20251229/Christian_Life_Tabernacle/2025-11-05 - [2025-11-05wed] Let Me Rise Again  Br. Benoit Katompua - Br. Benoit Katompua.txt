Oh, [music] and my life is in your hands. [music] Hallelujah. Let's go before him in prayer. Gracious heavenly father, we so thank you and love you, Lord. Surely Lord, without you, Father, we can't make it, Lord. But with you, Lord, what obstacle can stand [music] before? What trial can come against? Lord Jesus, [snorts] with Jesus, all things are [music] possible. Father, Father, you've seen the sacrifice your children have made to come into your house, Lord Jesus. They didn't come to hear from a man, but they came to hear from you, Lord Jesus. If but one [music] thing could be said to them, Lord, that would bless them and they can say it was good to be in the house of the Lord. Father, we ask that you have [music] the preeminence, Lord. Use this vessel, Lord Jesus. Set me aside, Father. [music] You speak to your children, Father. I've got no plan, Lord Jesus. All I've got is your word, Lord [music] Jesus. Father, it's the only weapon you gave us, Lord Jesus. and you made sure that you used it and you showed us, Father, that the same weapon you used, [music] placed in our hands will produce the same results. Lord Jesus, have your way in the service. Father, bless the people, [music] Lord. Again, remember our pastor, Lord Jesus. Be with him and [music] sister Leslie. Father, and all those that are out, Father, we thank you, Lord, [music] asking these things in the wonderful, precious, mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ. calm my nerves, Lord Jesus. I thank [music] you and I ask this in Jesus name. Amen. Hallelujah. I trust we're all happy to be in the house of the Lord. Thank you, musicians. As you're standing, we'll just turn to uh Micah chapter 7. We're going to read uh just 7 through8 and then you may be seated. It reads therefore I will look unto the Lord. I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me. Rejoice not against me, oh mine enemy. When I fall, I shall rise. When I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me. Hallelujah. You may be seated. May the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word. I'm going to start my timer, but I'm not going to say what time I put. So, basically how this works is you pull, I get out of here faster. You don't pull, we'll be here a bit longer. Nevertheless, the word's being preached, so we're excited. I got to just title this uh small thought that I have. Um just following along the same path our pastor's been preaching and the sermon he preached on Sunday really touched me preaching about children of the prophecy and then our fireball preacher. Man, I tell you what, that [snorts] was something else. I enjoyed that. Brother Sergio, I don't know if he's here tonight, but that was good. You know, I I I just I love that we're all different. I love that God uses everybody the way that he's made you. Man, I I can get excited with somebody that's just being who they are. That was awesome. And just on thinking on that thought of child uh children of the prophecy, uh I I had like while studying three or four different sermon thoughts that come to mind. And you know, the struggle is finding the mind of God, man. like, well, Lord, I could go this way. I could go that way. I could do this. I could do that. And then I think while I was here, um, the Lord kind of gave me a title. So, I'm title this small portion of time was spent, let me rise again. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; It it it struck me, right? You know, we're the children of prophecy, &gt;&gt; which means something's been spoken over us, &gt;&gt; which means it's rigged. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There's there's absolutely no way for you to see yourself being the children of prophecy and yet say, "I can't make it." &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; It doesn't work. &gt;&gt; Because his word says one thing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Your story says another thing. Now we know our prophet taught us that the right attitude, the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of God will bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; So we know we've have prophecy that's been spoken over us. Then the question then becomes, what's our attitude towards those things which he said of us? &gt;&gt; And you know I all you can really do is look at yourself. And looking at myself, I said, "Man, you know, if there's one thing Ben is really good at, it's questioning what God said of him." I I I I'd almost say I have a PhD in questioning what he says of me. &gt;&gt; He says I'm an overcomer. I say the trial's too great. &gt;&gt; He says I'm victorious. I said, "Do you see the giants?" &gt;&gt; But it's it's not that I want to say that. My flesh sees a different story from my spirit. &gt;&gt; In my soul, something cries and says, "I'm more than able." &gt;&gt; But in my flesh, I say, "Man, these giants are great. &gt;&gt; This this trial is is is is too big for me. &gt;&gt; Thank be to God, he doesn't look at my flesh. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful when he sees me, he sees his word. &gt;&gt; Because he spoke over me." And if Jesus believed everything that was said of him, how much more we, his bride, believe everything that was said of us. &gt;&gt; Then it then it got it got me thinking. Brother Brandon would talk about a soldier. He talks about a good soldier. And he says, "A good soldier doesn't lay down, but he gets back up." &gt;&gt; With the amount of punches the devil tries to throw at us on a daily basis. I was talking to brother Matthew in the back there. I had no, you know, my my throat was okay and I had no problems. But the moment it got close to when Billy says, you know, now we're inviting Brother Ben out, all of a sudden my voice and my throat starts to say, "Hey, hey, dude, relax." But I didn't have an issue before. &gt;&gt; But the devil's very slick. He always comes, sometimes he messes up the mic. Sometimes it's somebody said something to you while you were coming to church and you just get into church and you're all you're angry. you're you're flustered and your mind's thinking about what just happened rather than what's about to happen and then you sit there and the words going forth and and you're completely in a different place. &gt;&gt; And I I I just remembered my prophet saying and I'll read it to you. Brother Brandham says the devil tried to give me a cold a while ago so I gave it back to him. He said then he gave it to me again so then I gave it back to him again. He said we went like that for 4 days until finally it was gone. See, sometimes it's as simple as the devil puts a thought in your mind. &gt;&gt; Like, I God's in control. The devil puts a thought in your mind and you receive the thought that he gives you because the mind you have is just a receiver. &gt;&gt; You ain't got a thought coming. There's no thought of Ben, thought of you. It's God's thoughts and the devil's thoughts. Then it becomes whose thoughts you entertain, whose thoughts you accept, whose thoughts you receive. All you do is receive. &gt;&gt; So therefore, why would I receive a thought that's not beneficial to what I'm wanting to do? &gt;&gt; If I want to serve God, I'm not going to receive a thought that calls me a sinner. &gt;&gt; Why would I do such a thing? I ought to stop thinking those thoughts that put me in that state of mind and think on his thoughts. &gt;&gt; That's the admonition that he gives us. And I remember I believe it was a Tuesday and I I you know you always know when you're about to be called upon. You're all you always know when you're about to be called upon. If you preach, you know this. Something just says something's coming. You know when brother Billy texts you or Brother David and it's a message like God bless you my precious brother. You say ah there's ulterior motives here. He said, "God bless you, precious brother." He says, "How have you been?" And I said, "You've been sent on a mission." He said, "I'm just a messenger." Right? But that's just the way God does things. But that morning when I woke up, the devil put in my mind, "You're going to be depressed today." This is the first thought that came to my mind. You're going to be depressed today. You're going to be sad today. You're going to be in your feelings today. And I said, "Man, what a day this will be." And I just said, "You know what? Whatever you say, devil, whatever thought you put in my mind, this is what I'm going to be today." There's no such thing as I woke up in a bad mood. There's no such thing as I woke up in a bad mood. &gt;&gt; You accepted a bad mood. &gt;&gt; When you wake up, &gt;&gt; you have two options. You can wake up, feel the devil pressing on you a bad mood, and you say, "I'm not going to go this way. I'm going to go a different way." So, when he said, "You're going to be depressed today," I said, "Okay, let's get into the word. Let's see what God has to say about it." And it was really hard for me to stay in a depressed state while feeding on the things of God. God is very simple. &gt;&gt; The devil puts one thought, &gt;&gt; if it's not the word, give it the word. This is the battleground. You're constantly being sent things in your mind. Right now, as you're sitting, you're constantly being sent things in your mind. Why do I have to listen to this person? &gt;&gt; What does he know? How old is he? &gt;&gt; He didn't know nothing. He ain't been in this message long enough. &gt;&gt; But the word's the same, is it not? &gt;&gt; If a child came up here and read to you in the beginning, God said, "Is that not the word?" Nevertheless, look past the vessel, but look at the word that's being spoken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I, you know, I I started to feed on the word and I got out of that mindset of depression that the devil was trying to put me under. Then it struck me even a son and daughter of God, even after you've been you've received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you know, brother Brandham says that's the land that was promised to you to the children of Israel. It was a holy land. But to us, the Holy Ghost is our land. &gt;&gt; And when they got in their land, remember, they were told to fight for every inch of ground. &gt;&gt; So, it's not just, oh, I've received the Holy Ghost. That means I've completely possessed the land. You may have the earnest of that land. You may have the title deed of that land. But don't think you're just going to do nothing. There's a fight that has to take place every single day with the land he's given you. It is your land, right? It is your Holy Spirit, right? Therefore, when something comes against you that doesn't match the land he's given you, you got a right to fight with the land he's given you. It's yours. Brother Brandham says, "I got lots of respects for a man. When he does make a mistake, he's got courage enough to rise and try again." &gt;&gt; This is in faith once delivered to the saints. He says, "But a soldier is not one who will lay down when he's knocked down, but will rise up again." We used to sing a little song, "Let me rise again and try again." And I like that. For I have made many mistakes in my life, as we all have. But I've always been thankful to God for grace to let me rise and try again. I believe the song is entitled, "Forgive me, Lord, and try me one more time." I think that's it. I'll be yours if you'll be mine. If I fall or if I sin, let me rise again. Try me back and try me one more time. This I love that. That's why I'm trusting that God will do this great body of Christ here on earth tonight. who was we all are guilty of doing things wrong. &gt;&gt; Every single one of us is guilty of doing things wrong. &gt;&gt; This is what he says. But may we who are gathered here tonight, there's a blessing for you that are here tonight along with the rest of the great visible body of Christ on earth. May we rise again and try again. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, the devil likes to put you a son and daughter of God in a condition where you think because you had an experience with God that something took place with you that you make one mistake and all of a sudden you're no longer the child of prophecy. &gt;&gt; It's it's not because you made the mistake that took you off because it wasn't your perfection that put you on. &gt;&gt; It's the mere fact that he elected you. He chose you. He didn't do it with what what you would do in terms of sin in mind. In fact, you'll hear a bit later our prophet will say God knew your weaknesses. He knew everything, your habits, your nature. And after looking throughout the all the universe, he turns around and says, "I choose you." &gt;&gt; It's all man. &gt;&gt; But then we sit there and say, and we're always beating oursel up time and time again because you fall and you make mistakes. You're constantly beating yourself up and God looks at you like did not choose you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What are you doing? &gt;&gt; I chose you. You didn't choose me. &gt;&gt; I chose you. I elected you. In fact, I put everything you would have need of in you. &gt;&gt; But somehow we forget that prophecy that was spoken over us &gt;&gt; and we just every time we fall, you just beat yourself up. constantly thinking, constantly thinking there's a work to be done. &gt;&gt; A child of prophecy &gt;&gt; is one who his life has been spoken over. &gt;&gt; Remember, David was anointed, &gt;&gt; but he didn't get anointed and then automatically become king. &gt;&gt; There was a process that took place before he then became king. So you are a child of prophecy. You will come to the maturity which the word says you will. But there is a process. &gt;&gt; There is a training ground you have to go through before you reach that stature of maturity. &gt;&gt; But if we're not careful, we we get the attitude of of of Balum. Does God change his mind about his word? God will anoint you for something. You know, you're a child of prophecy and automatically you want to go work. &gt;&gt; Rather than waiting, &gt;&gt; being patient, saying, "Lord, is this the time? &gt;&gt; I know you've called me. I know you want me to do this, but right now, is this the time for that to be done?" We get ahead of God's plan. But if you're a son and you're a daughter and you know what the word says of you, you can remain still in the place that you're at trusting that that promise which he spoke will come to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I got to say it cuz it comes to mind. Often times what happens with a lot of young girls and even young boys is your mind gets so wrapped up in finding a mate when you're young and you have no business thinking about finding a mate. Yet that's all that encompasses your mind. It's God's promise to you. He said after salvation, the greatest gift he could give a man was a wife. So therefore, you receive salvation, feed, and stay in the word. He brings the bride. It's his gift to you. But if you get out of order, you get one experience with God. I had an experience when I was 13 and I found my boyfriend. Huh? But this is what happens. I know I was there. This is what takes place. You think you've done something with God now and all of a sudden I that can't be my alarm. We still got 30 hours left. So that that can't be my circumstance. But this is what happens in our mind. There's an appointed time for everything. &gt;&gt; Don't rush the plan of God. &gt;&gt; The prophecy that's been spoken over you will be fulfilled &gt;&gt; in the time he planned for it to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; You can rejoice when you're single. You can rejoice when you're by yourself. &gt;&gt; There is a joy in that. Seek God. Stay with him. It's just you and him. Dwell there. &gt;&gt; Somebody who's married could be able to echo that even greater than I. But then in my little revelation understanding that I have, all I know is there's something about just you and God. &gt;&gt; And then when he sends you the right mate, there's such a union. It still becomes you and God because the both of you become one &gt;&gt; and you keep him at the center. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says and the only thing you have to do to know he is here is get yourself out the way. This is just once more. Lord see as long as you're in the way then God cannot do nothing for you. When you think your thoughts then God's thoughts don't have a chance. Yeah, &gt;&gt; the verbiage in which what God uses is interesting because if you think your thoughts, &gt;&gt; God's thoughts don't have a chance. &gt;&gt; A man asked brother Brandham the question, brother Brandham, I want to know how to separate between my thought, God thoughts, and the devil's thoughts. Brother Brandham tells him, well, God's thoughts are the word. Anything contrary to that is the devil's thoughts. That was the answer. He said, well, what about my thoughts? You ain't got one coming. There is no your thoughts. What the devil makes you think is that those thoughts that come into your mind that you know ain't God's thoughts is your thoughts. He tries to blur the line and say you thought of that. &gt;&gt; That was you. But we heard on Sunday you didn't want to go that way. You were tricked into that. &gt;&gt; We all heard the same sermon Sunday, did we not? &gt;&gt; This is what our prophet said. So what am I to identify with? Am I going to identify with the thoughts that come into my mind that aren't God's thoughts? Or will I identify with the thoughts of God? Regardless of what takes place, regardless of what he tries to throw at you, you have to remember you were not the failure, but you are what he said of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It struck me. Let us rise again. &gt;&gt; You weren't made to be laid down for all time. There's a work to do. You can't work and sleep. You got to get out of bed. &gt;&gt; But some of us get too comfortable laying down. They say, "Well, I'm just beat up. The devil's just been telling me this. Devil been whatever circumstance, man. I've been praying for this thing. You don't understand, brother Ben, this healing. I've been desiring this healing and it just hasn't been coming. I've been wanting this and this hasn't been coming. Man, I done pray. I had this person pray for me. I've been seeking for a baby. I've been wanting this thing for so long. This minister prayed. That minister prayed. This minister prayed. That minister prayed. You could have 10 million ministers pray for you. For God to give you a child. Understand one thing. There is appointed time for it. If he did it with Abraham and there was an appointed time for him. There is an appointed time for you. Regardless of how long it takes for the fulfillment of that prophecy that he gave you, it's his business to bring it to pass. He says, "I I I loved it." He said, "What? What about that, brother Mike? Isn't that wonderful?" He loved you. He loved you before there was a world. He knowed your nature. He knowed your weakness. He knowed your habits. He knowed all about you, what you was going to be. And then he looked all over the great universe as it was. He said, "I choose you." And when he did that, before there ever was a speck of light, when you're eternal with God, when you receive the Holy Ghost, then you become eternal because you have you're with God. You're a part of God. Can you see what I mean? You are as eternal as God is. &gt;&gt; Come on. You what that'll do to somebody. I'm as eternal as God is. That means I had no beginning. Therefore, in my mind, when I go back, man, the first sin I ever committed, nope, that's not first. Go all the way back to your real beginning. Because it wasn't that sin that started your beginning. It was when he thought of you in the beginning. And as as I was reading this, I said, "Oh, man, that's so good." It got me thinking of the farmer that that that went to the uh the farm to go find himself a bride. And there was a bunch of a bunch of uh sisters there, and he wanted one. They showed him this one. They showed him that one. and showed him this one. He said, "Oh man, h he went out. He saw one that was cleaning. Saw one that was just doing her chores. He says, "I'll be back for you in a year." And it didn't matter. She now she's telling them he he he said he'd be back for me. He said he chose me. In fact, he said he chose me. And everybody's, "Oh, he couldn't have chose you when I'm an option. Why would God pick you? Why would you be the one God wants to use? This is what your flesh tells you every day. If you get real with yourself, this is what it tells you. Why would God use you? Why would you be the one to fulfill that? What can you do? You don't see all your faults, all your mistakes, all all your everything that you've ever done. You don't see the sin you just committed yesterday. You don't see the kind of person all this stuff the flesh just points and throws at you. Yet he said, "I'd be back for you." &gt;&gt; And she every single day from that point was getting ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Preparing to meet him. She took him at his word. &gt;&gt; If she could do that, &gt;&gt; how much more we take him at his word? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he says this bride will do the greater works. &gt;&gt; That's his prophecy. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what you see. It's his business. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now if if faith cometh by hearing of the word," this is in a blind a blind Barnameus. He said uh preached in 54 I believe 540402. Now if faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word and he knew that Jesus came by he couldn't say now wait I might see him another day I'll try tomorrow night at the next meeting. He didn't have that opportunity. I begin to remember the condition that I was in. When you go to service after service after service you come here on Wednesday. You come here on Sunday. You go to camp services and constantly your heart and this is the condition people are actually in. Your heart says I want to surrender. &gt;&gt; Everything in you cries I want to surrender. &gt;&gt; But right when you say that something else says but I can't. &gt;&gt; I've tried. &gt;&gt; And it hasn't worked. &gt;&gt; And then you the next service comes around. You get so charged up, you're like, "Oh, yes. I want to surrender, Lord. I want to surrender." Then right when you get out of that atmosphere, that voice comes right back again, "But I can't because I've tried." And time and time again, you're just trying and trying and trying and trying, and God just sits back. You know, Brother Brandham says, "God waits for you to exhaust your efforts, &gt;&gt; then he comes on the scene, &gt;&gt; and the devil's just sitting there. You're not doing enough. &gt;&gt; You've tried this many times and it hasn't worked." What's to say it's going to work? Now, who's to say any of your efforts are going to be valid? How many times have you tried? How many times you've come to the altar and you cried and you prayed? How many times did you do those things? I made the effort. I stood up. I walked over there and I still didn't get it. This is the devil in your mind constantly. See what what he's forgetting is the scripture says pray without ceasing. &gt;&gt; If all your effort is just coming up, don't stop coming up. &gt;&gt; Keep coming up. &gt;&gt; But at some point, you got to get to the point where you say, "This is the last time. &gt;&gt; I'm not leaving here till I get what I came for." And until you get that, you will come time and time and time and time again trying. &gt;&gt; It won't work. You have to really come to a place where you say, "Lord, I cannot do this. I don't have the ability to." &gt;&gt; This is blind Barnameus. He's blind. &gt;&gt; He can't see. But all he hears there's is there there's a man. Who's that? Who's that? Who's that? Oh, it's Jesus of Nazareth. And he he says, "Oh, all I can do is cry out. All I've got is one last cry. If I've ever cried before, this will be the moment. Lord, I need you to hear me." I I I can't say it like our prophet. I'll read it to you. He says, "He didn't have that opportunity. That was his first and last opportunity. The only opportunity he ever had or ever would have to ever receive his sight. So he had to do something. He raised and screamed to the top of his voice, "Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have mercy on me. There Jesus facing up the road. A road that you and I tonight, all of us are guilty of sending him up that road. Oh, how the devil loves guilt. You're the reason he died. It's your iniquities. You just constantly can't. You know, somebody will get into such a place. They'll say, "I've given God everything, but this one thing, I just don't know how to give it to him. I can't seem to surrender. this one thing. That's an honest heart that'll say, "Brother, I've given him everything, but this one thing, I don't know how to surrender it." You know, I I I'd like to believe all of us have that same one thing. It's human ability. You We can't seem to give up human ability. We always want something to do. &gt;&gt; We always want a part to play. There's just something I have to do. &gt;&gt; But we have to master human ability. &gt;&gt; You know, God said he put Moses on the backside so he could lose all his human ability. &gt;&gt; When he finally got to that place, he's stuttering. He doesn't think of himself as an educated person anymore. After God uninstalled everything he had learned, then God said, "Now I can use you." You know, I don't like swimming because I can't swim. This is a very interesting thing. They say get in the water and just let yourself float. I don't know about that one. What do you mean let yourself float? You mean I have to give up control to stay above the waves? You mean I have to give up control in order to float through the trials? &gt;&gt; You mean I have to give up control so I can make it through? It's like, yeah, you love control. We're all control freaks. &gt;&gt; I want something to do with it. And I I couldn't tell you. I you I went to school, college, all of it. Every time you see this pool is, "Oh man, you know how to swim?" Like, "No, do you want to learn?" I I sure do want to learn. I had one problem though, water's involved. If I can learn without water, we're all in good hands. But I can't. Is it just let go? Just surrender. I can't fathom in my mind letting go and letting the water do what it does. What does water do? And why do I put my trust in water when all I've seen people drown? Somebody fighting. And I I will never forget it. I was I was that kid. My dad's here tonight. It's the first time he's hearing this story. I snuck out the house one time in elementary school. Went to the pool. Shouldn't have been there. And I was pushing people in the pool because that's the kind of kid that I was. Everybody had to taste the water except the one that couldn't swim till finally I got pushed in the water in the deep end. And I said, "Lord, if this is the way I go, this ain't right." In my in my little finite mind, well, your body naturally goes up for air two times. I don't know where I got that from, but my body went up two times naturally for air. I hadn't I didn't do nothing. I'm fighting the water. You ever see someone trying to climb stairs in the water? I'm trying to get out of the water as fast as I can. But every effort I'm making is just sinking me. I can imagine now with the way that I am now structured how that would look like even now getting into a body of water. That would be a very interesting scene. So, I'm wise. I stay away from things that I I'm not getting in water that I can't stand in. But see, you didn't have a choice. You were thrown into the deep end. &gt;&gt; And God said, "Just surrender. &gt;&gt; Just give it to me. I'll help you through." And all we keep thinking about is how deep the water is, what's in the water, all the animals, all the things that could kill us, the dangers and everything. God says, "Just surrender. Just give it to me. I'll set you through. You'll walk with me. I'll be the And and you God's just telling you time and time again, give it to me. No, but you don't understand. Lord, I'm in the ocean. I'm in the depths, the Mariana Trench, the deepest place I know. I don't know how to get out. God just says, "Oh yes, come on. Surrender." You said, "No, Lord. If I was in the kiddie pool, I'd be better at surrendering." No. If you was in the kitty pool, you'd try to get out yourself. That's why you're not in the kiddie pool. This world we live in is the deep end. &gt;&gt; This is the ocean and you're thrown in it. Survive. I you I see those videos. They throw those babies in the water and they get to swim. I'm what? That's that's murder to me. But but the kid knows how to for some reason they're just and they're staying above the water. But I get in there do the same motions and I'm sinking. didn't make no sense. Then Jesus facing the road, he said, "We put him on there." On that road, he knowed he was going to Gethsemane. He was going to a Pilate's judgment hall. He was to be beaten, mocked, and then his great gifts of God was to be put at a trial, going to put a rag around his head and smack him on the head and say, "Now, if you know all what's in the people's hearts and minds, tell me who hit you." All those things faced him, a quivering, bittering death. There he had to face. He knew also hanging in his mind that he was going up to have his hands placed around a pole, his clothes stripped off of him, and lashes that would burn plum into the bone was going around him, and his blood would bathe his sides, and a cruel thorn crown would be placed on his head, and he'd be nailed to a cross and hang there, bleeding, bleeding, dying as the most bloody sacrifice was ever offered in the You see, when our prophet begins to describe what it was Jesus went through and when he was doing it, you were in mind, &gt;&gt; I was in mind. It makes you feel this big because you you realize at what cost it really came at, but yet this is his attitude knowing what's about to happen. Sometimes we we we're in a trial and there's a need that comes up and we're so fixated on the trial we're in, we can't even attend to the need that's just come up because brother, I can't help you. I'm going through this trial. Sister, I can't I'm going through this. This is our Lord and Savior. But look what our prophet says about him and all of that confronting him and he's walking. I can see him in his air of quietness as he walked straight and the disciples going on putting the people off the road. And to think what little chance with all of that hanging before him did this poor unseen unthought of blind beggar clutched against the wall. when businessmen come by half, one half, not even a speck of authority to the size of this would pass by him without giving him a penny. But yet, how's he going to attract that man? With one thing, thou son of David, have mercy on me. And to think with all that, he says, with all that hanging in front of Jesus, that blind beggar's cry stopped him still in his tracks. &gt;&gt; He stopped. &gt;&gt; Oh friend, his love and compassion for the sick was so great till no matter what the task was ahead of him, he is always willing to minister to those in need. It stopped him still. A cry from an unprivileged, from a blind beggar, an old ragged beggar standing by the side of the wall. Stop the son of God still in his journey. I begin to look at myself honestly and say, "Do I have the same character he has?" Sometimes you really have to look inward. Say, "Man, Father, I I I need more of you. If if I'm honest, I don't know what I would do. I don't I don't think I I don't think I'd have the same attitude with all that's about to happen and all that going over your mind." See, that that's why I'm so glad God didn't tell us what we'd have to go through. Because if we did, we wouldn't choose this life. If you're really honest with yourself, you would not choose this life. If God told you everything you would have to go through, you'd count your costs. You'd say, "Man, this is just the flesh man, because he doesn't count the inheritance of God for any value. The spirit man does." But the flesh man says, "You mean I'm going to be beaten, stricken, embarrassed, pierced, whipped, bloody, &gt;&gt; all that for a people that had given every chance they could would sin against me." That's us. Iniquity, you know, you shouldn't be doing that. You know that sin that's holding you, you know you got no business doing it, but yet you keep doing it. &gt;&gt; You only give it as much power. It only has as much power as you give it, &gt;&gt; but you keep holding on to that thing. Brothers, I sisters, I that's piercing that that hits the soul. Would we say, "I'm still going to die for you. &gt;&gt; You need me. I'm still going to die for you." He looked at you and I. He said, "Though I know tomorrow, you'll still sin. I love you. I'm choosing you because I know the end of the matter. &gt;&gt; I know the end of the matter. You mean my son, my daughter that's disrespectful, that doesn't listen, does everything that I say not to do, &gt;&gt; is run away with that boy, run away with that girl, smoking and drinking, living a life that's unclean. You mean that that child of mine? Yeah, I know the end of the matter. &gt;&gt; No, but you don't understand, God. I I I'm getting sick thinking about my boy. I'm getting sick thinking about my daughter. It's troubling me to know that they're living that kind of a life when we've been given such a promise. I can't sleep at night. I don't know what they're doing. I don't know how they're living. Yeah, I know the end of the matter. &gt;&gt; Lord, it's too much for me. This is us. Our little peanut brains only sees the trial, only sees the problem. But if we could just stop for a moment and say, "God, I'm not going to think about the problem. I'm going to think about the solution giver." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's you. You're in the problem. As long as Christ is there, you have a promise. This is what makes a child of prophecy. No matter what goes on, no matter what takes place, you know where you're resting, &gt;&gt; what you're standing on, it's none other than Christ the word himself. &gt;&gt; And when he says something, it always comes to pass. &gt;&gt; I know the end of the matter. But &gt;&gt; Lord, my soul believes everything you're saying. But what do I do about this text I just got? He's insulting me. I I gave them to you. I prayed. I don't know why I'm here. I prayed for that boy. I prayed for that girl. I I dedicated her to you. And this is where she Lord, I I know you said you got it. I know you said you know the end of the matter. But Father, I it seems too big. There's no way this is going to I ah Lord, I don't want to say nothing's impossible to you, Lord, but this is really what happens to us. You know what the word says. This is just an example. Put your situation in there. You know what the word says about it, but every other thought except what he said about it comes into your mind as constantly flooding to make you question and reason and doubt. Did he not say he'd give you your children? &gt;&gt; That's a prophecy, is it not? It's a promise, it will come to pass. &gt;&gt; Did he not say the barren shall have children? I think he said it. If it's a promise, it'll come to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did he not say the prodigals would come home? I believe he said it. The lame would walk. Yes, they will. The blind shall see. Yes, they shall. &gt;&gt; These are his promises. &gt;&gt; But we we get so fixated on the wrong thoughts &gt;&gt; that don't give you the hope and the faith to know it's a finished work &gt;&gt; that you still But there's just something I have to do. It it it gets to the point you will go to anybody. Hey, talk to my boy. Talk to my daughter. Send them a text, something. Don't tell them I told you what they're going through. I know they're questioning this message. They don't know if this message teaches you how to live daytoday. Man, these other nominal churches, they really help you on the day-to-day living. Oh, when their eyes get open like blind Barameus, when that sight gets fixed, they'll realize the world might teach you how to live daily here, but this message teaches you how to get out of here. It's completely different. We're not trying to dwell here and stay here. We're trying to leave here. &gt;&gt; They might preach a good sermon. They might have preach it in more sincerity than us at times. But you're a child of prophecy. &gt;&gt; He said something about you. &gt;&gt; There's a promise about you. He says, "The son of God still in his journey." Brother Brandham says, "Your cry tonight will stop him. He's passing through here tonight. Your cry will stop him." Every time we come to church, if this isn't our attitude, we're missing the purpose of church. Amen. &gt;&gt; I come to meet him. &gt;&gt; I come to have fellowship with him. &gt;&gt; I come to be endued with something I can live by. Our prophet tells us your cry. If you've got a need in your heart for something, he's speaking to you. Your cry will stop him tonight. &gt;&gt; My problem's too little. He didn't ask how big the problem was. He said, "Your cry will stop him tonight. &gt;&gt; My problem's too big. It has this, this, this." He didn't ask how big the problem was. Your cry will stop him tonight. &gt;&gt; Church, what's the cry? &gt;&gt; Stop him. &gt;&gt; You want the Holy Ghost, stop him. &gt;&gt; You want the doubt to be removed, stop him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God will give it to you &gt;&gt; and the devil will make you doubt it &gt;&gt; and then you lose the joy of what he gave you &gt;&gt; and you start questioning whether you have it and you're seeking after something he already gave you. &gt;&gt; There's more to be done. Don't just stop there. Brother Brandham admonishes us. He said the Pentecostals got excited at the gifts and they stopped &gt;&gt; when they were supposed to press on to maturity &gt;&gt; to perfection. That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't do away with the gift. &gt;&gt; Press on to perfection. &gt;&gt; Let God take control of the gift. &gt;&gt; Let him take control of the all of them. They're all blessings for the church. &gt;&gt; But press on towards perfection. &gt;&gt; Don't dwell. [snorts] &gt;&gt; He says, "Your cry will stop him." He said, "What? Bring him here to me? I just love those small statements like when Jesus says, "I have need to go by Samaria." He had a need. &gt;&gt; Really, his need was hers. &gt;&gt; She needed something she didn't know she needed. &gt;&gt; And when she met that thing, she was never the same. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's the same thing with us. if we only really knew what we needed and how much more he needs it for us more than we. &gt;&gt; He wants to see you be that way. &gt;&gt; He [snorts] cares more about you living a Holy Ghost sold out perfect life than you care about overcoming those things you struggle. He wants to see it more for you. Father, if I can just take that thought that says you want to see it more for me than I and I think on that thought, what'll happen in my life when I start thinking like you think? &gt;&gt; Oh, this trial, my God's greater. &gt;&gt; Oh, this circumstance, my God's greater. &gt;&gt; He says, "Bring him here to me." And they brought and and they brought when they my Now I want you to notice another dramatic thing here. Wish we had time to go into it. Something come to mind. Now notice he didn't know he was going to find him. The only thing he knowed he sat in a dark world he'd never seen. But there he raised up throwed aside his old ragged coat. It had been an hour before that if he'd have lost that coat or if he'd have to lay it down, he'd fold it neatly and laid it to one side because he knowed he couldn't find it anymore. He was blind and hardly anybody would help him. But now faith takes a hold. Faith springs on what? I've attracted the attention of the son of God and he's bid me come. Every one of you here tonight got the same bidding. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Whosoever will, let him come. &gt;&gt; I've attracted his attention. He's called me now. I won't need the coat anymore as long as I obey him. &gt;&gt; He would have never give me the invitation if he didn't mean to GIVE ME HELP. WHAT THAT DOES when you know God couldn't have even called you &gt;&gt; unless he meant to help you. &gt;&gt; But how that devil comes so slick and he says remember that call you felt that wouldn't God &gt;&gt; and you lose it like this because you believe that lie. But my prophet said he meant to call you so he could help you. &gt;&gt; You do not have to remain the same way again. That's right. &gt;&gt; So if the soul's crying for a perfection, there is a God to grant it. &gt;&gt; If you want to overcome that sin, what's crying? &gt;&gt; There wouldn't be a deep crying unless there was a deep to respond. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; you've got his attention now. He said, "Whosoever will come, I've attracted his attention. He's called me. Now one won't need the code anymore as long as I obey him. He would have never give me the invitation if he didn't mean to give me help. And he'd never been wounded for your trans transgression if he hadn't have meant to take them away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you read stuff like this, &gt;&gt; what it does to you? &gt;&gt; He took it all away. All the pain, all the hurt, &gt;&gt; all the trials, all the doubts, the questions, HE TOOK IT all &gt;&gt; because he meant to. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If he hadn't have meant to take them away, he'd have never been stripped for your healing unless he meant to take it away from you. &gt;&gt; You've got his attention. Now, &gt;&gt; what did he do? Here's faith going in action. &gt;&gt; Throws aside the garment. &gt;&gt; I won't need it anymore. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be a new creature from now on. Hallelujah. He throwed aside his garment. How can he see out in his dark black world where he couldn't see nothing? He spread forth his ragged sleeves like that and his bony arm sticking through it. He made a way to find Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, sometimes how it feels like you're just trying to figure out where to go and you really flying blind. You're like, I don't know, but I the voice is speaking here, so I'm just going to go towards that voice. Whatever that voice is that's calling me. I'm just going to make a move there. It might look out of order, &gt;&gt; but Brother Brandham said, "Get out of order long enough. You will get saved." So, it might look out of order. You trying to get there, but don't worry about the order. Get to the promise. &gt;&gt; That's what's important. Getting to the promise. I don't care how you get there. Get there. &gt;&gt; He said [snorts] he spread his forth his ragged sleeves that his bony arm sticking through it. He made a way to find Jesus. No matter what condition he was in, he had his attention. He didn't know which way he was going. He knowed it come from that direction. So there he goes with his arms stretched out, his ragged sleeves are hanging down, tears running from the place where the eyes should be running to him. Didn't know how he was going to find him. But the word said come &gt;&gt; and he was going there's the main thing. &gt;&gt; You know sometime God says just come my child &gt;&gt; I'll take it away. You're like Lord I don't know how but somehow your steps just start walking in a certain manner. You start saying the certain thing. You start confessing. You're like, "Man, why am I?" Because the action that called for you to come has the power to make the right action to receive it. &gt;&gt; He says come, then puts in you how to come. &gt;&gt; No matter how sick you are, how bad you are, how many trials you've had, when he said, "Whosoever will, let him come." But Abraham says he meant you. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How am I going to get to it? Brother Brandham, the doctor said I can't get well. Throw it aside. &gt;&gt; Let go. We've got his attention tonight. &gt;&gt; He's passing this away. He's been here every night this week. &gt;&gt; He's here. You see the importance of going to church every week. &gt;&gt; He's been here. He said every day this week, &gt;&gt; but we just throw away church. &gt;&gt; Wednesday is just a Wednesday. Sunday night's just a Sunday night as if God doesn't come on the scene every service. &gt;&gt; Are we significantly impressed with him in our midst? &gt;&gt; Do we want to be in his midst every chance we get? I &gt;&gt; It's a It's a sad place to be when you don't create the atmosphere at home &gt;&gt; and you only come on a Sunday morning. &gt;&gt; You're starving. &gt;&gt; You can't live like that. You need more than a Sunday morning. &gt;&gt; You need more than a Wednesday night. You need more than a Sunday night. You need the person of Jesus Christ every single day. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "If Paul had to die daily, &gt;&gt; you and I must die daily." &gt;&gt; He didn't just say that to say it. Paul was in a battle. &gt;&gt; He says, He's been here every night this week. He's here now. He'll be anywhere where two or three are gathered in his name. I'll be in their midst. Whatever they agree upon and ask, they shall receive it. We've got his attention now. He's moving through the building. Now raise your hands of faith to him and say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; that I might receive my sight." He said, &gt;&gt; "Oh, &gt;&gt; if you've got something &gt;&gt; you want to receive from God, &gt;&gt; you heard our prophet, raise your hand to him." &gt;&gt; And say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; I receive it. Father, &gt;&gt; the sight I need for the trial that I am in. Lord, I receive it." &gt;&gt; He will grant you the sight. &gt;&gt; It's his promise. He wouldn't make the call. Oh, that that GETS ME SO EXCITED. He wouldn't make the call unless he was able to produce it. &gt;&gt; He doesn't tell you he's the God that moves mountains and then you have need for a mountain to be moved and the mountain don't move. &gt;&gt; That's not my God. If he if he says something &gt;&gt; and that circumstance comes to be, you can jump as high as you can &gt;&gt; because there is an assurance on the inside that says, "I know where I can find that in the word." He said it right here. And if God moved in the word, then for that circumstance, you come in the same way that the person before came, &gt;&gt; he must move &gt;&gt; again. There's h there's there's there's too much to to to get through here. Um I'm going to try to Where's my time? Well, my timer rang without me knowing. I'm going to work towards a close here. Brother Brandham says this [snorts] and thou son of David have mercy on me. One second. Let me find it. He says, "I say now just commit them to God. That's all you have to do." Paragraph 44. Don't you put your hands on it anymore. Let God have it. If you're going to do something about it, then God will stand back and let you go ahead till you get finished. But when you commit it to God and let him have it, then he will do it. You just believe him. Just stand back. Don't work, but believe. That's where grace is imputed for righteousness to believe that God will. &gt;&gt; Trying to find this Oh Lord, help me. Oh, if these musicians would come, I I just want to close with this. This this struck me so much we could all stand. He says in paragraph 123, I got a letter back from a little woman in Germany not long ago. Why? She'd been crippled about 15 years with arthritis. Couldn't move. I sent her a handkerchief. We sent thousands of them a month out. And so she got his this little letter and we got a prayer chain around the world. So she read this and she said, 'N now it says on here, if your pastor isn't there or if he's an unbeliever, don't call him. See, but if there's a neighbor somewhere that is a believer, call the believer. Confess all your faults. Ask God to forgive you of everything you've done. Get everything right, then pray. I want to pause here for a moment because we know obedience is better than sacrifice. So, just like when Elisha told the uh the prophet, I'm I'm forgetting the story, but tells he tells the man to go dip in the water seven times. It wasn't the water, but it was the obedience to what a prophet said. &gt;&gt; And this is the same thing that's taking place here. And I want you to see the attitude she has after having done everything right. She says, "Put the handkerchief on your underneath garment over your heart, then believe." So she met all the requirements that was sent to her. And when she did, she put her hand over her heart. She said, "Now, old man, devil, you've been in me long enough. Get out." &gt;&gt; Here she come walking through. That's just that simple. &gt;&gt; It's just that simple to believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you've done everything &gt;&gt; according to what the word says, &gt;&gt; you've repented, &gt;&gt; you've made things right, whatever circumstance it is, if it's not your the salvation of your soul, whatever it is, if you've come the right way, it's as simple as now, old man, devil, you've been in this situation too long. Get out. &gt;&gt; And at that point, it's no longer your words that's speaking. It's his &gt;&gt; because my prophet said she knows what he wants done with the word. &gt;&gt; Just speak. &gt;&gt; Don't get found laying down. &gt;&gt; Get up. Rise again. Let's bow our heads and pray. Gracious heavenly father. Lord, you knew before the foundation of the world all that would be gathered here tonight. Lord, Father, you knew how the burdens and what each one came with into your house. Father, I feel so little before your word. But Lord, I am your word. You told me to have the right attitude towards myself [music] because I am a divine promise that must come to pass. Lord, you see all your children in the house tonight. You see the attitudes they have towards themselves. They [music] are the children of prophecy. Father, if their attitude towards themselves is wrong, [music] Lord, correct it. Because unless we get placed in the right position, how can we have faith? Lord, I was blessed. Father, I pray something was said to your children, Lord Jesus. If there's one soul that's in here that feels like blind Barameus that says, "Lord, [music] everybody looks over me. Nobody comes my way. Nobody wants to greet me. Nobody pays me no mind. I'm struggling. I'm alone. Father, you're my only hope or the way your prophet would tell it. [music] Blind Brotheras had two turtle doves. Daughter got sick and she was dying. And he said, "Lord, I'll sacrifice these doves [music] if you heal my daughter." And she was healed. Then his wife got sick. [music] And he had a lamb that would lead the blind because at the time dogs were filth and he said to you, "Lord, [music] I'll sacrifice this lamb if you save my wife." You healed his [music] wife. And as he was going to make the sacrifice, that old devil came to him [music] and said, "Blind Barnameus, where are you going with that lamb?" He said, "I'm going to sacrifice [music] the lamb." He said, "Oh, why would you do such a thing as that? Here, let me give you money that's worth the value of that [music] lamb and go get you another one." Blind Barnameus said, "I didn't promise God that I would sacrifice a lamb. I told him I'd sacrifice this lamb." [snorts] How often, Lord Jesus, [music] we tell you, God, that we'll give of oursel as a sacrifice to you. But rather than truly giving ourselves, [music] we give you other things, Lord Jesus. But what you want is us, Lord Jesus. You want our lives to be a sacrifice. Father, we need you more now than we've ever needed you before, Lord. [music] We'll need you more tomorrow and the next day, more than the previous day. Help us, Lord Jesus. Help us to walk faithfully according to your word. [music] Lord, I don't have the words. You showed me who I was. Lord, I got nothing else [music] to do but to believe what you said. Lord Jesus, I am more than able. I am an overcomer. I will do the greater works. I will achieve that maturity. [music] &gt;&gt; Those are all things you said of us, Lord Jesus. I won't be caught laying down. I'll rise again. If a punch comes and it knocks me down, I'll [music] get back up again and I'll keep pressing on. [music] For it's not the one that fails, but it's the one that quits. Lord, we don't want to be found quitters. Help us, [music] Lord Jesus. If there be one in the house tonight [music] that this sermon really spoke to you, lift up your hands to him. You could come to the altar. You could lift it where you're at. It's all dependent on what you need for faith. and let God come by your way. As we heard our prophet say, he's here tonight. And he's here because he wants to help you. Whatever it is that's holding you back, [snorts] you know, [music] he's here to help you. I thank you, Lord. [music] Jesus name I pray Lord. Amen. I sing then. Amen. Oh, they say this mountain [music and singing] can't be moved. Oh, they say this chains will never break. [music] Oh, but they don't know you like me do. Oh, [music] there is power [singing] in your name. [music] Oh, [singing] I have so much power in your [music] name. Worthy of the Lord. [music] &gt;&gt; Great. [singing] Oh, and God [music] we believe God [singing] we believe [music] from the [singing] impossible [music] God we believe [singing] God [music] we believe [singing] for Oh, and [singing and music] we heard them. Let's give her love. [music] Oh, [singing] for there is still a grave. Oh, [music and singing] and God we no matter what. [singing] Oh, [music] there is power. Hallelujah. Oh, [music] so much [singing] power in you. [music] Lord, great. [music and singing] God we believe. [music] God we believe [singing] for the impossible [music] will see [singing] a miracle. [music] God, God for me. [music] Oh, [singing] you say, "Oh, and I &gt;&gt; just sit back. Just worship it." [music] &gt;&gt; Just lift your hands. Say, "Lord, I receive your word tonight." [music] &gt;&gt; Lord, I will receive my sight tonight. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; You said I believe [music] [music] [singing] [music] and great. Oh God [singing] we believe. God we [music] believe for it from the [singing] impossible or see God we believe. [music] God be [singing] for you. Oh, [music] you say just worship him tonight.
