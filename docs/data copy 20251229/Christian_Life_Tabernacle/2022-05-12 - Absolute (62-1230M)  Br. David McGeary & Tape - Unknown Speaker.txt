in your presence we're not worthy to handle your word father our only place that we can meet you is under the shed blood which forgives us and cleanses us from all unrighteousness and father takes our failures and throws him into the sea of forgetfulness to be remembered no more lifts us up out of the mirey clay and lord that's where our faith and our trust is tonight and just want to have a time of fellowship with you we ask you to bless each of those that have come out this evening father may you be their portion in jesus name we pray amen amen if you have your bibles tonight let's just turn to one quick scripture and and we'll read it and then we're going to play a small portion tonight of a sermon and just fellowship around god's word i had a wonderful trip with my mother and i'm just grateful to have her and you know i began to think so many of my friends they don't have their parents anymore and very rarely do i ever meet anybody that i went to high school with or i went to school with that has their parents still with them but i'm fortunate still to have my mother so i wanted to thank the lord for that hebrews the 11th chapter verse 1. i bet you everybody in here has that memorized you just don't know where it is but let's just read it this evening now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gift and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him heavenly father we ask you to bless your word in jesus precious name we pray amen you may be seated i'd like just to share my heart with you just a little bit and the uh struggles that that i suffer in my mind as a pastor in the battles that that we all go through we know the battles in the mind and and so you find out that we just read the scriptures by faith the elders obtained a good report and if i could substitute the word faith i'd like to put the word absolute by having an absolute at faith is based on having an absolute and and i like how paul sums it up he said uh faith must believe that god is in other words that god's my absolute that god is and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so we know that if we seek his face that we shall find it that by faith by having an absolute that's what pleases god and you know one of the great uh struggles that i we face a lot of times as a pastor is you know as a shepherd you and a pastor it's like a title that you that people place upon you that you know you don't deserve you haven't done anything to achieve it or you haven't you don't have any qualifications to carry it because gifts and callings are without repentance it just seems that god places you in a situation and one of the things we all know that a shepherd does is that he and i'm talking about a natural shepherd and which we know is a type of of uh as a spiritual shepherd is that you're always trying to keep things from coming in and you're always trying to keep things out so you're always trying to get ideas not coming in you're always trying to keep spirits from going gossiping to uh to going on you know and and and you you try to you know have everybody love everything and it seems like you you know you're you're you're taking care of the things that are all the things that are going on you know you don't want the wolves to come and take any sheep away so you're always looking for wolves and and that you know you don't want the sheep to be biting each other you know what i mean forming clicks and and you know i know we got all kinds of little girly clicks going on and certain girlies hang out with certain girlies and certain girlies aren't old enough and certain languages do this and all that you know wait until the holy spirit comes you know what i mean and the love of god is shed abroad in your heart you know and i you know i had a fella come in and after we walked into my office and he stood at the door and he looked at me and he said well i don't know if i can i should come into here i said wait a minute buddy come on in here you know what i mean because we don't got nothing like that we don't have any big eyes we don't have any little use we we don't have those things we're all under the shed blood and so in in always dealing with those things but there there comes a time when you realize that the the flock can't stay in the same field you understand they've got to move on to greener pastures they've got to to move on and i don't say new grass i say the grass that god has prepared for them to go to and we know that that lies within the framework of the word of god so i liked how brother billy put it sunday he said there's not any new revelation there's just revelations we haven't come to yet you you understand there's there's things that there's people that have an experience you know i uh you know for someone to uh i like it when sometimes when i see a young uh young couples or and and uh they're going through the struggle of raising children and i sit back and i think well you know that they have this struggle because those children are going to grow into teenagers you know and after you raise a few teenagers satan never bothers you again you think you can handle anything you know what i mean because you've been through that you've had the experience you know it i mean and then you then other things come up forth in life and and you realize that if the lord carried that uh you know your that the end of what you've accomplished i remember the prophet of god saying that when he said i'm 55 years old and i haven't done anything for the lord now that statement devastates me you know what i mean and you know i'll never be able to match that i don't try to match that but uh you know just the fact that having something on our heart be at that time in life you start asking yourself what have i done what's my future what am i going to leave behind you know what am i leaving for you know what what footsteps steps do i have in in the sands of time and so in in the uh a struggle of realizing that you've always tried to stay balanced you realize we we need to go up higher we all want to go up higher i think it's the call of everybody's heart to be closer to god to have a greater fellowship with the lord to to you know not to put to rest our salvation that we've been purchased with a price to accept the fact that our names are written on the lamb's book of life to accept the fact that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the lord and so we want to move forward and we want to achieve something and we want to have the faith to achieve it and and and it brought me to this message is that we'll listen to for 19 minutes but it's called an absolute and and and you'll hear in this message that you can't achieve anything until you have an absolute um and you know uh and so you you can't move forward until there's something that's absolute that's moving us forward and when you have something that's absolute i think the dictionary calls it perfect within itself so something that is absolute brother brown will say that when we listen but he says it's perfect within itself and and you know and i thought what a beautiful description of the message it's perfect within itself it doesn't need anything from the outside to improve it in fact nothing can add to it i believe brother graham said i'm not delinquent enough to try to say that i can advise god whether he's done something right or not but in order to go forward you've got to have an absolute that's right so you've got to accept something as an absolute right in other words you you don't it's it's not absolute if you feel that there's something you can add to it it's not absolute if you feel that it's left something out it's not absolute if you think it hasn't covered a certain area and i say that because a lot what's going on today is satan's brought bringing all kinds of things in and people make this statement to me well brother branham didn't cover that and then you're telling me that it's not perfect within itself do you understand the thing is is that that is a door that opens up so somebody that has an absolute is not open for any new ideas because the definition of an absolute within itself is it's perfect it's perfect in itself it didn't like doesn't lack anything it didn't leave anything out that it's it can't be questioned it's settled it's complete and and therefore okay when someone says well he didn't mention this he didn't cover this you're you're if it's an absolute then you know somewhere within there it is covered but i need the revelation i need god to speak to me from the absolute and that he might cover the question that i have and so the first thing is is that uh or someone who has an absolute knows that that's going to determine the outcome the absolute is going to determine the outcome there's no other factors no other circumstances no other situations no no nothing from the outside that's going to come in and change the course of the events because the absolute is perfect within itself and we know what our absolute is it's the word of god this message is not something that comes from outside of the word of god it is the word promised for our hour made flesh that's what makes it the absolute it is what god said manifested in the flesh and by the grace of god he's given us eyes have to see it [Music] until it becomes this the settlement of all things right and he'll go on we're not going to listen to that portion of it but he said that's why in games they have to have a an umpire because every has anybody ever played pickup ball that's a game where you do it you call your own fouls well any time a guy misses a shot somebody fouled them you know what i mean and and uh it it it it's terrible so they have to create man in order to move the game along if you understand we're talking about going forward so in order to move along to keep the game going you know what i mean they have to get somebody to arbitrate the disputes and settle them and that person's decision has to be finally you understand yeah and the world doesn't even want an absolute anymore they want a video replay or let's look at it again and and everything well god don't have to look at something again because being perfect in itself he's the one that made it happen in the first place okay so we're talking about we want to go forward so i'm sitting here with you very proud of everybody proud of the way you worship proud of the way everybody handles things proud of the way you love one another uh proud of the way you treat one another knowing that you're solid in the word and you we and we're not letting wolves come in we all have failures but we repent of those we get up we make things right but we still want to go forward so in order to do that we've got to establish an absolute something by which we are going to move forward do you understand so i believe it's coming to a point it it doesn't do any good to i saw a cartoon one time and you know it was sketch i think it was in a some bible bookstore and it showed moses and joshua way out here and and they they said oh let's stop and let the people catch up so they sat down to have a picnic you know and drink and they were sitting there and you look back and the people had all sat down okay well we've moved past that you understand we're not following a ministry anymore another i i'm not i'm not taking the leadership position and saying now this is what i'm going to preach and this is where we're going to go because if that's the case then there's a mediator there's something in between god and the people and god hated that but you understand if it's an absolute then it could it should speak to all of us together you understand it shouldn't be something that that has to be broke down you don't understand now the word of god is broke down to each of us as we go because he does have a five-fold ministry but i'm in as a desire and of the body to move into the ground that god has prepared for us each of us has to have an an absolute that's right or it may even more be more specific not a absolute the absolute each of us has got to have the same absolute so when it speaks we all agree on it when it's revealed it's all the same revelation you apply that to your lives separately as you need it in your life and as the word of god is applied to you individually but as the body it speaks it is the word of god it is our absolute amen and so the that that's what determines the outcome so if we were to go forward what's going to determine our outcome what the absolute said right that that's what our outcome and there's no distractions you know uh and and that's the thing if when you've got an absolute you're you're not you're not distracting what's this people doing or what's this people doing how are they going about how are they worshiping how are they doing how are they that doesn't matter that's right you understand the the that's not we don't look out because if it is an absolute to you then it has you don't look any further than that could i say that that it it's it's captured you i i it's it's it's captured me i i've seen a lot of movements in the years that i've been in the message coming up different people who who caught certain ideas and and preach different things and i'm not going to go through all the labels that they put on them but the bottom line is is the reason they were all different is they all didn't have the same absolute the unity of the bride is based in the absoluteness of the absolute you are so they're they're not they're not looking for another place of interpretation so if they don't understand something they have their source so if you don't understand something within the message where do you think the understanding lies within the message that's where you'll find the answer to the problem it's like any of you brother i think we got several electricians in here you know you know so let's just take uh i don't know if daniel's here but daniel's electrician and troy's electrician jay's electrician okay if you've got an electrical problem in a building you don't go next door they say well what are you doing here well they got a short next door the problems within the system so the answer is within the system you can't look to any outside source for the solving of the problem so when someone when once you're sure it's the absolute then you know the problem isn't here it may be within you but it's complete and perfect in itself so if there's a lack of understanding in there you've got you'll find the answer to your lack of understanding within the absolute itself message answers message questions that's what that's what answers it that's what takes care of it so once you have an absolute there's no distraction you're closed to any new ideas well billy really brother branham left this part out i want to let me show you here now you see here over here he said this and and really you know jesus was a a a man and and uh but he and uh over here but the there is the there is the uh there's not two people there's only two in the godhead jesus and god are one but there is another person called the holy spirit now just think about that for a while wait a minute even to conceive that is the sign there's no absolute an absolute closes your mind there's not an open mind eve opened her mind you understand the fact that he said the day that ye eat thereof the day you died that wasn't absolute enough for her okay if if that was if that would have been absolute enough she would have known that that statement was perfect within itself it didn't have to have understanding because understanding doesn't come from an outside source understanding has to come from the absolute itself if it's perfect is there i don't know how i wish i could make that so clear you might have questions somebody might raise questions but they're not i i don't let anybody raise a question with me if they're raising the question because they have the answer to the question that's a deceiver that's a liar [Music] someone why don't you just tell me the answer first i don't need to be baited you know what i mean i don't be needed to be persuaded into it it's like sitting down with a salesperson and you ask them how much it cost and their answer is well how much do you make well i'm broke will you give it to me do you understand you're not baited you understand so when you have an absolute it the absolute speaks plainly it when you have an absolute it speaks plainly to you now you say why is this important because you can't go together and go on together and rise together if we don't all have the same absolute we don't have the same thing that's covering us if we're not if we're close to different ideas you know i don't like to compete with counseling i don't like to counsel somebody and then have somebody else come along and counsel them you know and have a church full of 50 different counselors that's fine everybody's entitled to their opinion it's like a nose everybody has one you know what i mean and we all value our opinions above one another and by that point sometimes we think of ourselves better than one another but when you have an absolute everybody is the same we've all been purchased by the same blood it didn't take any more blood for me or any less blood for you so in understanding an absolute you understand that they where was their faith resting in every single one of them had an absolute something that was absolute perfect within itself to them and as brother brahm reads the scripture about paul meatman that commission when paul meant that fire pillar fire that became the absolute to him everything he was going to encounter was based upon what back angel of the lord spoke to him that settled it when he was in prison he knew he would have to suffer suffer when he had to go before rome he knew he had to go between before king's impotent day because that became as absolute nothing deterred him from his path nothing deterred him nothing deterred abraham from looking for that child because he had accepted the promise and the word of god as his absolute right abraham it was imputed to abraham righteousness was imputed to abraham because he believed that god was able to perform that which he promised therefore his whole life was based on the fact that god's word was perfect within itself now when he succumbed to sarah trying to come up with a different program that never did work and they got a bunch of wild men that have been trying to put them out of an existence ever since so we can save ourselves lots of trouble by assuring in our heart and i say this to our young people you know like i said you you went you had a great experience in the lord in the and you've heard about the holy spirit you heard about a delivering power and you felt anointed and you felt free from your sins and and you felt a great release and and a great worship and everything but in order to move forward you can't achieve anything and you can't move forward until you have an absolute something that you know is perfect within itself now brother brown preaches this message in absolute right before he preaches the evening service serves as this is this the end time sirs because he's going to start talking about angels coming to him he's going to start talking about the seals being open and his ministry is making the turn from december preaching an absolute he goes out and he preaches the absolute four more different places to telling everything some if if you don't have an absolute you're going to miss the opening of the seals you're going to miss the coming of the lord you're going to miss what god's doing well we have got to really and our young people that had a wonderful experience at camp worshiping everything after that it's maturing time where you've got to choose in your life what is going to be your absolute and what you're going to shut everything else out of your mind except for the ultimate the absolute so presenting this this is good brother ron peterson a friend of mine is going to be coming and and preaching for us this sunday but so i wanted just to lay this as a foundation so we all search our heart and ask yourself do i really have an absolute you know i think in the world don't they call it like a go-to or they have a terminology this is my go-to meal or my go-to thing when i'm in doubt this is what i go to well this is above everything that's a go-to it's perfect with itself so let's listen to this 19 minutes of the absolute and uh and then we'll close very quickly at the end so we're going to start at the reading of the scriptures if you'd like to stand for this reading of the scriptures you can go ahead and if you'll turn in your bibles i believe it's to acts 23 um uh the acts uh i i believe it's acts 26 the 15th verse that's what brother brown has in the book here so i think that's correct so if the brothers if you could go ahead and start this now just listening close to the next 19 minutes and what we're preaching about is what an absolute does for you thank you now tonight don't forget the the time what time is it and now this morning i wish to turn you to have your bibles or market if you care to in the scriptures or we want to speak from uh for a few moments found in the book of acts we might read two or three places uh acts 26 15 first acts the 25th chapter and the 15th verse to begin then we want to read acts 23 11 and you might add with this if you wish to i probably won't have time to read it of philippians 1 20. it's all about the same course the same words now in the book of acts 26 15 we reads like this and i said who art thou lord and he said i'm jesus whom thou persecute arise and stand up on thy feet for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou has seen and uh those things in the which i will appear unto thee deliver thee from the people and from the gentiles whom now i send thee to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me whereupon ogrippa i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision but showed first unto them at damascus and at jerusalem and throughout all the coast of judea and them then to the gentiles that they should repent and turn to god and do works meet for repentance and acts 23 and the 11th verse again and the night following the lord stood by him and said be of a good cheer paul for thou has testified of me in jerusalem so must thou bear witness also at rome may god add his holy blessings to the reading of this uh most gracious holy word that we have before us now i was hearing a man speak or talk not long ago and he used the word absolute and i thought that's a very fine word i hear you so many times absolutely that's i looked up in the dictionary webster's according to webster's it's perfect in itself unlimited in its power primarily an ultimate and an ultimate is the amen that's all amen uh absolute it is it's the unlimited in power the word absolute it's it's perfect in itself that's all of it that settles it i thought that's a glorious thing that's a wonderful word and now a word is a thought expressed first it must be a thought and then it becomes a word because you do not speak your words without thought when we speak in tongues we have no thought it's god taking the thoughts it's god's thought using our lips we don't think or know what you're saying when you're speaking in tongues if it's inspired speaking when you interpret you do not know what you're saying you just say it so that's god and prophesying you're not using your own thoughts it's god because you say things that you ordinarily wouldn't think about seeing but the word absolute is an ultimate and therefore i think that everybody should have an ultimate and every great achievement that's ever been achieved there has been an absolute behind it man no matter what it was it's had an absolute behind and every person in order to achieve something has to first have the absolute and that's the final line back to this that back to the other to you come to that absolute or the uh amen or the ultimate of what you're you got something you have to tie to in other words it's the final tying post the ever achievement it's somewhere it might wind through many different things till it gets to that high post but there is the amen to all of it there must be such a thing you cannot go on through life without having one you when you got married there had to wind back through your mind something do you hit that thai post and it should have been love for your wife or your husband well maybe she isn't as pretty as john's wife or she was she not the the this that but there's something about her that you it strikes you you you say she might not be as pretty as the other or he might not be as handsome as the other but there has to be a absolute there that that person's different and that's where you hold on to if that isn't there you better not get married that thai post that absolute we can think of many who had absolutes in the bible oh how we could take down to the stream of that bible and just be here two weeks from now and never even touch the surface if we think of the absolutes in the bible for instance let me just call one or two just brief them look at job now he had an absolute everything went wrong for that man a just man now we would be darrison to say that he wasn't just because god said he was there was no one on earth like job he was perfect in the sight of god and he knew it because he had an ultimate he had an absolute when everything seemed to be contrary sickness broke out his friends might have said now there you are job that proves that you are sinning you're wrong and then the bishops come down uh they call them job's comforters and instead of comforting them they seen nothing but sin in his life because god had dealt with him the way he had and his children was killed his his property was burned his is everything went wrong and even his own life in jeopardy sitting on a as she broke out from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet with boils and even his lovely sweet companion the mother of those children said you should curse god and die of the dead but in the face of all that job had an absolute amen oh in time of sickness if we could only tie ourselves to that absolutely job know that he had done jehovah's bidding and he had faith in what he done because jehovah required it we can just do that jehovah required a burnt offering for his sins and job not only for himself but for his children had made a burnt offering and that's all god required oh you might say i wish that's all he required today it's less than that just faith in his word and you if you make his word your absolute chicken any divine promise in the bible you can tie your soul to it all right no matter how much the weave is whipped you're around you're still tired you're absolute and he held on to it and when this comforter said you've sinned he knowed he had not he was just because he'd done jehovah's bidding and when he's uh every the man come in said your children's dead another come in said your camels are all burned up and there come fire down from heaven look what an argument is discomforters had you see the fire came from heaven now job that proves it proves nothing now you wouldn't have struck your children job you're a just man but job said i know that i've done what's right he still held on he had something that he could drive down amen that's it he had accepted it it had done exactly what god told him to do and he was absolutely sure all right then when he come to the spot one that absolute help then finally he began to feel the string tighten up they've been running loose bouncing around but it began to tighten up in the spirit come on him and he stood up being a prophet and he said i know my redeemer liveth amen see he tightened up to his absolute he come in contact he know that he had done what was right and someday he had to pull to it amen i know my redeemer liveth and at the last days he stands up on this earth though after skin worms destroys this body yet in my flesh shall i see god he knew that that is absolute anchor abraham an absolute coming down from babylon from the tower and uh out into the shine out in there where he was uh souljourning with his father perhaps as a farmer but one day way back in the jungles somewhere maybe picking berries are are going to kill a beast for his meat and somewhere back in there god spoke to him when he was 75 years old and he was he and his wife sarah her being 65 was childish childish they didn't have any children then god told him you're going to have a child by sarah but in order to do this you've got to separate yourself god's promises are always on condition you must absolutely no matter how fundamental you are with the promise it's under conditions always how we could stop here and wave through that scripture back and forth for hours think that the condition is what means something you can be just as fundamental as you want to but it's under conditions by the promise predestination and so forth notice now abraham he believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness now what a a horrible thing it would be to meet a a civilized world a man 75 years old with a woman 65 and lived together since they were young couples because she was his half sister and now going to have a baby bar but he had an absolute there was nothing go to movie and when the first month it didn't happen his absolute health because he knowed he had talked to god the second month second year tenure and at 25 years later when he was a hundred and sarah was 90 his absolute still help the bible said when his obituary was written he said abraham staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong giving praise to god why did you ever think why he was absolute positive and the only thing he had to do is separate himself from his people god never did bless him until he did it he took his daddy daddy died he took lot and when after lot separated from abraham then god come to him but now walk through the land amen obedience promise under conditions always goes with god and his word now look at let's take moses moses the the runaway servant prophet and god had raised him up and educated him and pharaoh's palace and and moses went out with his theological training and was the first man he sleuth then the first little defect come along then moses was scared to death why he had no absolute he only had his his mother's testimony of his birth he was a strange child he had his mother's word about it he had the scrolls that god had perhaps in paper somewhere they had written packed along with him that god was going to visit his children he know that that was a time like we do now we know something's fixed to happen now moses knowed that was the time and he knew that he was chosen for it but he didn't have an absolute see and one day on the back side of the desert when he lost the vision god appeared to him in a burning bush and said moses i have seen the afflictions of my people i've heard their groans and crying of those taskmasters punish them and i have remembered my promise i've come down to deliver them now go down to egypt oh my said moses complained he said i don't speak very well my my deliverance is not very well they won't believe me he said what's in your hand he said a stick he said throw it down and turn to a serpent said pick it up with a tail and turn back again to a stick he's giving him the assurance of vindication when god gives an absolute he gives a vindication to that absolute always then moses when he was down there and he threw down his stick before the magicians and pharaoh and the magicians come and threw down their stick too moses never run and said oh well i was wrong i was just a cheap magician trick and maybe i was wrong but he knows amen amen he was positive that he met god and he stood still let's see he had done exactly what god told him to do so a job done exactly what god told him to do moses had followed his commandments then stand still and watch the glory of god amen moses is tied to his absolute his commission and he stood still and when he did his serpents swallowed up the rest of the serpents see he was tied to that absolute god said when you deliver them children you'll worship me again on this mountain now the enemy in every way that he can will try to get you away from that absolute right as they started out of egypt they got cornered right in the neck of the of the red sea mountains on either side come up through a valley and there's a red sea no way to escape over the hills no way to escape this way and pharaoh's army coming this way what a place to stand see how the devil gets you in a place where you don't know what to do but remember if you're tied to that absolute that's got it moses know that god promised him that you'll worship on this mountain when you bring him out and i've come down by your hand to deliver him and play some more in that other land he stayed right with it and god sent an east wind and blowed out the waters out of the bottom of the sin they walked across on dry land an absolute how we could go through the scriptures daniel his absolute shadrach meshach and abednego they're absolute david his absolute oh absolute was that inspiring amen amen well you can go back and at home and keep working it up let me grab my bible so i i just thought there's a couple things in there that we just want to just say real quick you notice he said nobody can achieve anything until they have an absolute you can't go through life without having one right right amen every absolute if it's from god is totally vindicated you know what i mean i everybody that's ever intellectually came up and challenged me on the message had zero works they never prayed for the sick they never had a miracle they never had anything but everybody that i've ever met that had had signs and workings of god in their lives never spoke against it they may not agree it but they wouldn't speak against it because every absolute has vindication and my my answer to most people is okay you explain this to me you explain it this way this man explained it this way he raised the dead blind eyes were healed he discerned the thoughts and intents of the heart he even has the scripture that says if you can't believe me for my words believe me for my work say why in the world would i take what you have to say with zero vindication when i've got a mountain of things to stand on it doesn't make any sense right okay and then did you notice this other statement that he made here he says someday you'll have to pull to it now that's to me when a prophet says something in that realm that's a reality of life so everybody someplace in their life is going to pull to what their true absolute is when they get desperate they're going to pull to their same absolute my next door neighbor got involved in the shootout right next door we heard the guns going off i called the police i said there's gunshots in the neighborhood i loaded my gun and the kid started hey you might think it's funny but don't go shooting a gun around my house because i'm going to have my gun loaded i'm going to protect my family i was told someone threatened sarah or uh rebecca one time and brother sat out in front of a room with a shotgun you know so much for the woke i'm just serious though do you understand what i'm saying these people they come up with things and they don't they don't rest they're going to pull to it so this guy got shot and he ran to my house and banged on my door okay so he's laying in my living room bleeding we're trying to do what we can to help him he was shot several times and the police officer come and he said he said i said any any i said i'm i'm not close to him his name is val i'm not close to him at all we don't really do anything he said they'll run to the closest thing that they know is god every time that word came straight out of the policeman's mouth when man gets there how many of them her start calling out i've heard the worst sinners curse god everything get stuck under a machine or something and it's god help me god help me because you're going to pull to your absolute right cook you understand i want to have something to pull to did you see what paul said he pulled to his absolute right what did moses do he pulled to his absolute would everyone in all these situations what did shadrach bed nego do they pulled to their absolute they had an absolute and they pulled to it so he said you have to have an absolute you've got to pull toot it and what's another thing an absolute won't do it won't mix with anything remember they had to come out from everything else totally that's the condition the condition of an absolute is it can't be mixed it can't be mixed with worldly worship it can't be mixed with the way other people do things it can't be mixed in other words you can't put a filter on it so it makes the taste that you want if it's an absolute you take it just the way it is it's got condition and the condition is you take it the way you said it never ask you if you understood it he asked if you what believed it so what is he asking you is what i say you're absent well look what job had to go through didn't he say if it's easier than that today job had to sacrifice a lamb he said it's easier than that today all you have to do today is accept it accepting it isn't saying i believe i'm accepting it isn't on the words the the acceptance of it is you pulling to it as your absolute and hanging on to it as being your life source this is where i put all my trust this is where i put all my confidence this is what i totally rest in god said so well we're going to throw you into the fire o king be blessed forever i believe that god can deliver us from the fire but if he don't my absolute is i don't bow down to idols the absolute didn't meet him at the the door the absolute didn't meet job at the doctor's office he went through it all but they never let go of their absolutes because they had one he said moses in the beginning heard all about him he believed every promise that was spoken about him my name's in the lamb's book of life i am the bride i'm the elected one i'm the chosen people god sent a messenger and he didn't have an absolute but when he met him i would have liked to been there god discerned the thoughts and intents of his heart took him all the way back to his childhood explained everything to him just like he had that was moses's road to damascus and when he came out he knew one thing that's right right you're going to throw this dick down it's going to turn into a servant you pick it back up put your hand in pull it back out he he knew he had talked to god didn't matter what come up against he had an absolute he had something he stood on it was the word of god you know when when we really come to our heart and understand that this message is the vindicated word of god it's what it prophet is he's a divine interpreter of the word of god you don't have to be ashamed of your absolute because he'll prove it to you every time amen if you don't have it find it find it find yours but we we begin to see how an absolute works and you've got to pull to us so you know i just want to close with this sometimes because there's something so if if faith has to have a resting place right so faith is the evidence so i have i have a something that's a substance or something that's real okay i have something that's real that is my absolute so i'm not looking at the circumstances i'm looking at what's real now look at healing i just want to say this in closing at in short because many people think healing's in the result healing's in the absolute deliverance the child that abraham had was in the absolute it wasn't in sarah it wasn't in abraham god proved that to him and what was abraham's testimony he staggered not at the promise of god he believed he didn't know how that god was able to perform that which he promised that was an absolute to him so what is the absolute for every person that's seeking divine healing give me the scripture anybody by his stripes i am healed right so that's the evidence now i'm hoping to get well i haven't seen my healing hallelujah right so what am i resting in the evidence the absolute is the evidence in other words let me ask you did jesus get scourged amen is that a historical fact amen he was whooped he was laid stripes on him why did god put that in the whole crucifixion process is that true is it a fact is it an evidence could i present that in court now my absolute isn't in what i'm hoping for the scripture says i'm hoping for it it's not a shame for me to hope for my healing okay it's not a shame that i haven't seen it yet my healing doesn't lie in myself physician make yourself whole i can heal myself i can do things to help it i can set a bone i can take the medicine that all might work i might use that but my healing is in the fact the evidence so i'm not looking at symptoms i'm not looking at how i feel i'm not looking the fact i'm hoping for it and i haven't seen it i'm claiming and testifying that he died and he rose from the dead and by his stripes i'm healed i know that is a fact i'm not testifying to the results i'm testifying to the evidence not hearsay not oh if you had faith i don't come right right i don't have faith but i got evidence of my healing because he was scourged that is a fact that happened god allowed that to happen god put him through that for my healing when i he never said win why he never said why what are you confessing to i'm not confessing to the results i don't have any results to confess to my results are not my evidence my hope is neither forming or against me yes i'm hoping to get well well what are you testifying to i'm testifying that he was scourged yes i'm testifying that that's true that's what my testament is abraham's testament was god told me moses his testimony was i meant the thing god told me shadrach and meshach god said so they weren't looking at results they weren't even looking for deliverance but they're absolute they drew to their absolute they were pulled to their absolute they didn't mix it with anything it's a fact it's in evidence and evidence is a fact it's something that's true and i can truly say that jesus right was scourged and beaten for my healing that's a fact hear what the doctors say i don't hurt the family history is i don't care how i'm feeling i don't care what i see i'm not testifying to those things as true as they may be prophet of god say don't say you're i'm not sick you are sick i am hoping for healing i am sick well where's your healing what's your evidence where's your healing lie i can't perform it i pull to my absolute i don't mix it i don't say buy a stripe with the doctor's help i don't say buy his stripes if i take this drink by his stripe if i eat this secret seaweed out of the ocean by his stripes if i you know i exercise five times a day and i drew this and i changed my diet and i do that all that's good prophet of god said you do everything you can do but i don't have evidence in any of those things there's one place i have evidence and that is the fact the true fact that by his stripes i was healed and that actually happened that is admissible evidence in thank you court i rest my case yes sir well i don't see it well so what if you saw the absolute you'd see what i see you can share that message don't worry sis it's okay because by his stripes we're healed the prophet of god your child is not young enough to have faith you have faith for them i'll give you a testimony they told sister rachel she'd never drive again she would never drive we didn't believe it did we say i don't accept that so i went got called up somebody in the phone book to give her driver's license the person showed up gave her drivers lessons she got her license i tried to find the person to pay him i went and looked for the number i had and it it wasn't disconnected there is no driving school that i called never existed no instructor by that name no phone number in the book or anywhere that i called somebody from somewhere showed up and gave her driver's license for free and she got her driver's license because by his stripes were healed that's a fact [Applause] evidence they told brother daniel employee in the hospital who do you want to live your wife or your child that's great choice huh how'd you like to be there he went down to the chapel he opened his bible and read the scripture about god giving a merry heart and joy unspeakable and full of glory and he said lord if i have to make this decision i will be sad every day of my life and that's contrary to your word he went down to the doctor he said let her have the baby go through with it because by his stripes i'm healed i don't even remember which baby it was was it probably symphony are you here symphony tonight maybe not i don't see you anywhere you've grown up i probably couldn't recognize you if you were here she's not supposed to be here but somebody had an absolute that they pulled to brother is that how you say it i've missed that poor brother's name up all my life brother omadi doctor came in told his wife he's not going to live and his wife sat down by his bed sister veronique and they talked and he said i don't she said i don't believe what that doctor said and he said i don't i don't believe i don't like that doctor anyway no you never seen it maybe some of you were here but he came down the aisle like this yeah the same strong handsome man that you see out there couldn't walk with no evidence that he was going to live except for he said lord i got children to raise by his stripes amen he was healed then they have a child john i'm sorry little john if you're here i don't know where you're here or not but that kid was born a wreck they say he'd be mentally he would never grow up they wanted to totally break every bone in his face and re-put it together and i sat at a table with doctors she couldn't even speak english they had a french interpreter and these were the finest pediatricians in all of texas hadn't assembled a board of 12 surgeons and plastic surgeons and pediatricians craniologists head this was a case and i sat there and she looked at me and she said brother david will you tell them that i want to give dr jesus a chance first because by his stripes my son is healed you see john over playing the organ you see john the piano you see john in the bass see john on the guitar you see john on the drums yeah that that looks like somebody who's to me buyers we could go on and on and on don't tell me that he's not the same yesterday today and forever don't tell me i haven't seen the hand of god amen it's all over there is a book of acts being written behind this bride and the only way that we won't go off to the left or to the right or to everything is when we have an absolute we draw to that absolute we don't mix anything with that absolute and the absolute has got complete control the prophet of god said the absolute is tied to every gift every gift everything every achievement is tied to an absolute amen so i i kept you i preached my sunday sermon which i just goes perfectly in line with what the brothers preach but i want to tell you our absolute lives and we don't have to go for any other outside source for faith we don't have to go to any outside anointing or any outside worship or any outside thing don't tell me the message ain't martin enough don't tell me the songs aren't good enough that were song don't tell me the gospel didn't cover everything right uh-huh i'll tell you an absolute is perfect within itself it's the ultimate it's the final voice it's the amen amen amen now you can be anything else you want if you want to mix it but if you want to be what this message prophesied to produce you've got to stay with it a hundred percent because it's the only thing that is going to produce the bride that jesus is going to marry he absolutely spoke his wife into existence by the absolute word because he knew what the outcome would be if she held down to this absolute he knew what she would be he's going to get what he spoke that's my absolute is it yours so if we're going to go forward we're going to go forward as believers in this message if we're going to go forward we're going to accept that the prophet of god is the absolute divine interpreter of god's word and have the message that's going to produce a bride that's the absolute we're not we're not going to mix am i okay saying we i'm not going to try to reign everybody in you know i mean i can't always keep the wolves out i can't always keep things that are coming in i can't always keep spirits and new ideas out because they're going to come in to anybody that doesn't have an absolute but when you're anchored in the absolute if we get a people that's anchored in the absolute there's no place for them to enter we possess the gates of our enemy by the absolute word of god god bless you [Applause] hey man let's all stand amen do you love the word of god amen key of f [Music] god [Music] is so good is [Music]
