God praise God praise God praise God praise God is God praise God praise God [Music] praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God may the Lord bless you tonight we are so happy to be gathered in the house of God to hear the word of God without further Ado let's open our Bibles in Ephesians chapter 3. verse 14 to 19. I would like us to pay attention to the word of God [Music] because oftentimes people read the word of God as if they were reading a journal where the Holy Ghost has inspired these words for you it's for your victory that these things are written because sometimes we look to the left and right without knowing that we have the solution with us verse 14 for this about my knees and to the father of whom the whole family in heaven and in Earth is named ah thank you foreign that he may Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened within to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the Inner Man the inner man has to be strengthened he said that Christ May dwell in Your Heart by faith being rooted and grounded in love that you may comprehend with all the saints what is the breath the length the depth and the height and to know the love of Christ which surpasses all on all knowledge that he may be filled with all the fullness of god let's pray our Grace is Father we say thank you for tonight for these few words that we read we ask that you bless your people that you may sanctify this word for them in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen may God bless him and I thank him for the opportunity that he's given me the Bible says for this course about my knees and to the father For Whom the family the family of God is in heaven and here on Earth there is a family of God that he may Grant you according to the riches of his glory god is rich in mercies if he gives you something like what we read tonight it will be wonderful for you Paul is saying here that you may be strengthened uh strengthened with might that you may underline that to be strengthened that you may be strengthened that you may be strengthened by his Spirit and the spirit is written in capital there is a difference between when you write it in small letter and when you write it in capital because the man is in three dimensions a man has both Spirit soul and body as you can know it [Music] you can say is Body Spirit and soul whichever order you place it is all man so when we speak of the spirit of man that spirit that is a small as a small S I know and those that small spirit that we're talking about is what brought gave birth to Theology and all of the education and the things of man the small Spirit gave birth to science and all the things that you see when you read in Galatians 5 16 probably speaking is saying walk in the spirit and that spirit is the capital S Spirit the the capital S is God every man that that works without God is like an animal in that blue he loses the senses he loses shame he loses everything and he does whatever he will [Music] also and today we live in the world where people do whatever they want normal and people think that it's normal that is not normal it's only in this time that God Paul is here saying that God May strengthen you with might less pretty diva by the the the Divine spirit in your inner man Chester I am a doctor I understand what I'm saying this man is not this body or this flesh that you see here the man is inside God said when this man who's inside become weakened this one fails that you may be strong Baba not by by by by medicines but by the word of God if you want to be strengthened 40 God has to strengthen you in a man so how come some have patience and others are without patience because it's a virtue that God gives to someone when you ask of it he has to strengthen you I'm speaking of the inner man who has to be strong because now we'll present you science and God will present you faith the science will present to you a certain demonstration God is Not Looking for demonstration you believe things are changing mom the the science itself is lying because science says I will believe when I see I will show you something that science cannot prove the matter has three stages it's a kindergarten oh the prime Elementary sorry there is liquid there is a solid and then there is gas oxygen the oxygen is is the gas but material or matter is anything with touch okay if I catch season 4 if I see jebron I believe the name on oxygen give me the oxygen the name one looks give me the oxygen why is science calling oxygen matter stages of matter and it's a lie doctor I'm a doctor I'm a judge I'm I am I am by the speaking lies and he said oh show me that God exists it's like the oxygen you cannot see it you cannot touch it but you can feel it that's God so don't walk according to your theology don't walk according to opinions the the inner man has to be strengthened by the spirit God when he strengthened holy saying in verse 17. that Christ may may dwell in Your Heart by faith person that's not that doesn't have faith he's he's uh he's dwelling is a dwelling place for demons because the the for all the demons is called unbelief when Eve doubted the word of God there's three things that happen La premiere deity went out Sonoma her soul become became darkened and and the devil came to abide in her three do they do tell you doubt the word of God will bring to the the unbeliever those things what Paul wants the uh that that God May dwell in the Believers by faith in verse 18 it says that you may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breath what is the length and the death and the height is we are speaking of the height of the death of the length and the breath of the love of God my little subject tonight is the full measure of the love of God for you to know the love the Christian of Christ to know to know is not to be ignorant is there is doctors and that don't know math is they are drivers that don't know the the road signs but he's a driver and we have Christians that don't know the word you have to know the love what is love in the Statue of the perfect man love is not to give a suit to someone love is not just to give food to someone is to forgive the one who done wrong against you says in the Statue of the perfect man it says uh again that it's the piety it's I said to be like God brother to have the brotherly love you have to be like God first if you are not like God you will manufacture love never don't don't manufacture anything let God himself do the work in you to know love love is to forgive your enemy and let's yell and the heavens is for people that are like Jesus Christ I will show you two worshipers I'll show you Cain and Abel both of them were worshiping one brought the fruits and the other brought the blood and God in looking at the worship he rejected came why did he reject came so he brought the fruits and in the fruits there was no blood and Cain who was worshiping God he was mad what kind of worshiper is that who's mad and he preached to the unbeliever God he didn't preach to the believer it was a Believer is Born Into The Kingdom a Believer knows the will of the father [Music] he says why is your face he says do like your brother if you if you act like your brother if you do like your brother if you do like your brother if you love your enemy if you love your enemy I will love the one who loves me in the flesh we are of the same country we are of this God said no you have to love your enemy [Music] and when he killed mm-hmm what did he do he killed what is killing today it says that the the killing is not taking a knife and kill him is to kill the influence of your brother what is the characteristics of the children of the devil they are they rebel against the words they don't let the word of God get into them so criminal they are criminals they are disobedient they come with a repentance with tears the crocodile tears are you are you really crying no no no no no no no no no [Music] it looks like he's not really repented God knows his children that's why when Jesus came he saw a man that were walking that he said you are you are of your your father the serpenter Joseph meeting his brothers it was the expression of the devil man Satan reproduced himself where God is the devil is also there they come to worship all together one wants to worship according to his own way and God wants you to worship according to his way there is no heaven without suffering you have to suffer before you get in heaven all the trouble comes when you become a Christian don't think when you become a Christian Things become easy tonight if you had a problem against someone and not against someone go back and repentance the nature of the children of God is forgiveness the devil can do everything but he cannot forgive the devil wants Vengeance look at Cain who killed when he lifts his hands to pray God God said you are forgiven I'm going to protect you who died in sin us because the the blood of bull and gold and gold see couldn't take away the sins it was they there was a need for higher blood a blood that was higher than the human blood foreign to Abel what the conduct of Abel was I'm sorry my friend he said it was his blood was crying out more my brother my friend my brother my friend Matthew my brother killed me he was crying out for justice a man always looks for justice and God says yes the blood of your brother is crying out from the Earth what was he asking for punishment is tonight I want to tell you that the blood speaks these people that think blood doesn't speak the blood speaks to the lab they look at they get to the lab they take the blood thank you and they say thank you they take they go they take from the girls goodbye and then they go you'll get the result in two days when they put it in the lab they start looking listen the blood it starts speaking to the machine oh they take the other one God and they put the results in the envelope they said you two cannot get married because the blood is spoken if he has the the uh a group s an S group and the other has the same group the problem they will have children that's going to have a lot of problems no I Have Faith Pastor you have to marry us remember the blood is already spoken they get in the marriage children begin to die that's why that president but tonight I want to speak of the real blood [Music] let's read Hebrews chapter 12 verse 24. the blood and the Bible says Jesus Christ the mediator of the New Covenant I'm very sad and the blood of the blood and to the blood of sprinkling [Music] that speaks better things than of the of of able Jessica Jesus when he was beaten up and killed his blood did me ask for vengeance when they beat him up his blood cried out and said father forgive them their sins because they don't know what they are doing the blood of Jesus Christ he's speaking in favor of the sinner the blood of Jesus Christ he's praying for his enemies when you have pity before you have the the brotherly loved the conscious you have to be like Jesus when you are like Jesus that's when they will say brother we are all we have all kinds of false Brothers Jesus Judas was also a brother Amazing Grace but Jesus Christ he was a real brother and he gave us the example that's why the Bible says Jesus is the way he's the truth and his life when we say Jesus is the way it's not uh it's not a road if Jesus is the model or the the thing the the model to follow fix you to get to Perfection probably speaking in Romans chapter 12 verse 2. [Music] and he says be not be not conformed to this uh a world by the renewing of your mind love foreign [Music] foreign but in the presence of God there is a power of transformation now pay attention in the word conforms and the word transformed there is a word that's in both of them you look at to be conformed and to be transformed there is a form inside of both two of them you can look at it and see there is a form in both of them in physics look water formed recipient the water takes the shape of whatever container you put it in the the vase is square water will look Square if the the recipient is triangles if the recipient has the form of the church the water will take the form of the vase let us the the the the the uh the container and the water they work together but water is the word that you have to know the will of God what is good and what is perfect three things that you may pay attention to those three things I give an example you have an American I have maybe a European passport and you I can go everywhere that you can go but I have to pay attention and that they are countries under which those passport cannot go without a Visa I have to pay attention to that it's just the details the same [Music] Holy Spirit who's there doing miracles is the same Holy Spirit here the difference is in the denomination they don't know what's perfect they don't they don't they don't know what these three things are then says in the Statue of the perfect man my message I didn't come to to build churches I didn't come to call people but I just to follow me but my mission is to bring every individual [Music] where they get to the Statue of the perfect man that is what's perfect and acceptable today foreign mm-hmm maintenance now we're going to see something that is important we were you you were not created here on Earth the creation started in heaven We Came From Heaven no one was created here on Earth where were you [Music] with all kinds of sicknesses and other stuff the job on Earth with all the boils and everything but when he's looking at the other side he's so job in in his jumping out he loves his job he saw a job but that job who was younger he says I know that my redeemer lives God didn't pay attention to the things of the earth don't pay attention to the things of the earth pay attention to things that comes from above because the testimony of God was he was a perfect man that was job one one and Satan said it's not perfect job represents the church he represents every believer at your job and your job accepted as a prayer if you believe the trials if you love the trials a Believer that's going to run away from trials let's take a a uh a quote to confirm what we're saying um in that day at Calvary uh paragraph 57 I believe yeah and French is in French it's paragraph 45 okay it's preaching September 25th 1906. it says Europe an foreign no wonder he says no wonder God in human flesh was dying yeah it was the hour that the world had looked for yet many of them did not know it like it is today many look for these things and yet they don't recognize them they don't realize the way out job had three friends God said it was perfect but when job found all the three friends said that he was a sinner in secret they condemned him without showing him a way out for job to come back to his position [Music] we have need of Elijah the prophet took back what was foreign this when when ill who came you come you understand that that was the seventh day that's when we heard the Thunders then God said to Job it says uh God gird upload your lawyers I want to ask you a question and I want you to answer me I want you to underline that job was not a Pentecostal baby because babies don't wear a belt job was an adult the church is not the babies you can see a a grown up with beers but we're wearing diapers and you think it's an adult but it's a baby let's listen baby the the Corinthian Church was built was had babies in them speak I spoke in First Corinthians they didn't understand they didn't understand he went to the Ephesians listen they related to them you don't tell them what to do this when you are a king a child of the Kingdom you know the will of God you know what's good and you know what's perfect [Music] where were you yeah there's a lot of people that says oh the will of God when I pray God hears me two seconds everything I ask God the house the the job everything and God gives it to me foreign God says amen God certain Satan came and said God I have a prayer give me job God said amen take him [Music] because job was an adult he's speaking too much give it to me God said no because Peter had not received the Holy Spirit God cannot prove you above what you could do what you can handle God knows how to prove you and every child of God before the trials he will he will succeed you know and then another day the demons came and said God came and he was uh uh he was casting out the Devils off of uh uh uh uh uh a person who lost his mind is mine can you can you eat together with someone who lost the mind you cannot my friends someone came to him to hit to his place he asked him he says can I eat a sandwich he eats all of it and you say you are a Christian can you love someone who lost her mind we are talking about the four measures of the love of God the the fool that I'm talking about is for whom that Christ left Heaven he came so he can redeem you without giving without without you giving anything what did you give for you to inherit the kingdom of remember the The Throne we speaking of of Heaven to whom where Satan was cast down it's where you're gonna sit es if if the Earthly Throne that's around us you can't get it how can you be elevated and sit on the throne of God without suffering [Music] you have to suffer you have to forgive France that's your suffering your suffering is when people are mocking you are making fun of you you praying for them your suffering is to forgive those that did wrong to you the people say they are brothers but they are Christians but they go out there they don't uh greet one another to become a a lawyer an economist or anything on Earth there are tests that you have to take God will also give you tests and you have to pass those tests shows if the Bible says if in the little things you are not just who's gonna confide you the bigger things from over there [Music] it's not because I prayed God gave me because God gives to the unbeliever too because rain is a blessing that comes upon both uh the believer and the unbeliever otherwise God was going to give rain only to his shoulders that he says learn from the nature that's why Brothers nature the earth and the which we are walking today it was in the form of uh volcanic the volcanica it was it was fire yes before the Earth was uh solid he puts his Prince ownership everything is Sealed With Fire you can you get that's how you you can differentiate uh for instance a car that's a Mercedes and one that's a Toyota and Satan was there he was it was jumping but he had his Prince on on the earth a sin began in heaven if you were a devil in heaven yeah yeah you fought against the one-third here on Earthship even if you dress yourself like a sister with the long skirt and you are singing like an angel I pray for them all after your death you will go back to what you were in heaven a demon see and you become a criminal and you become a prostitute [Music] you become a the most vile of all the Sinners before your death you will meet the world so you can go back to what you were before we are the expressions of Two Worlds of the devil and of God and that you examine your heart and your your face when the word of God is free that's when you will know is God in you oh is Satan that's in you even if you spend 50 years but if your life is contrary to the message your destination is hell the Satan Buddhist is French on Earth and he went back to Heaven he was the second after God blame me but he wanted to be first thank you please yeah God said he he convinced uh two-thirds and God he kicked him God kicked him all out of heaven when Satan was kicked out of heaven he didn't come down from heaven he he fall but Jesus came down from heaven and when Satan falls that's how he deformed the Earth something that Moses didn't see because Moses says the Earth was uh uh was uh with that form and void for me God didn't create something without forms perfect God creates something that's perfect everything that God does is perfect is Satan who came to destroy the Earth when he was kicked down from heaven then God put foreign so he can form man God took men who was created before men he put he placed him into the man who was formed the man who was formed is the 16 elements that's why you sin second that's the prince of Satan this is not you but yeah you see you are inside you are inside you know the words for Perfection the real you looks for the will of God the real you looks for what's good and acceptable yeah differences look at the difference between the the Samaritan woman and the rich man the Samaritan woman in her body see Mary six husband thank you Jesus was the seventh now in her body patient sinner when the manifested word was presented to her she accepted the word and she was saved the the Rich Young Ruler in his body it was perfect he kept all the Ten Commandments Jesus looks at him he says one thing that I like it how many how many how many things do we lack how many how many things do we like because he was a demon now I want to show you the four measures quickly here we're gonna finish in 15 minutes the four measures of the love of God let's take the the the the the length of the love of God the breath of the love of God is in John 3 16. but God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that you who that believes in him for believing him our faith can keep going that would so ever believe in him should not perish but heavy everlasting life the price of the love of God is for all remember Jack criminal even if you are criminal even if you did something that was bad tonight the right of the love of God God has open arms for him to receive you better than you you can come and he's going to receive you because the word of God says come as you were close for me the pastor cannot change but the Branham cannot change it's God who changes through his word and his word is love and the love is his measure for the first time in the history of mankind [Music] that if the the oceans were incense and we had parchment made to write of the love of God that the oceans will dry why because his love is so great so that he can save you what a man can tell you he loves you tomorrow is gonna it's gonna call you all kinds of names are you who's gonna say um you are you have deceived me a parent can say I love you and then he's gonna say you you have deceived me but when God loves you he loves you as you are yes God sovereign who was abandoned by the whole city and he knew nowhere else to go back to the cemetery but the love of God in his breath it came down for a fool he said Lord what are you gaining this man is a fool what are you gaining this man is a fool is a fool what are you gonna gain with this fool with this man he's nothing is worth nothing indicator there was there had been many signposts that pointed to that day many great for sure it's been foreshawn by Lambs by Bullock by uh turtle doves and all these signs you see the the blood of the Bulls and the goats and all those things you couldn't say man it was a need for the blood of Jesus Jesus had to die for you who are you said God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever say I am whosoever Mana now more pose is so but he could not break it it could not break it it could not break that death hold for Satan had the Earth the very rocks that he once walked upon down on the earth burning brimstones Lucifer was the son of the morning and he walked on the earth when it was burning volcanic he was it says those same rocks that had cooled off but when Jesus died now listen you can read on friend he placed his imprint where the devil had put his imprint it was so that he can clean up the power of the devil from your life and he saved a thief without being baptized the the thieves the length the length it's in Jeremiah 31 and 31 and 3. [Applause] [Music] I loved you with an eternal love what was it wasn't with her love it says therefore with loving kindness I have drawn him but when I'm preaches God who's rich in Mercy and with this reaches that Paul is speaking in Ephesians chapter 3. that he may strengthen you mightily I don't think Christ May abide in your heart and when Christ abides in you you cannot do all kinds of stuff even if science says this you are in the word the breath of the love of God it's a it's a it's a very deep love that shows the problem it's a founding in in the Deep things it's a Philippines it's Philippians 3 5. and you don't go through to Heaven you Philippine Philippians 5 chapter 5 verse 2. yeah five and two chapter five verse to have the same love the same the mind that was in Christ say Philippians Philippians yeah two two five to having you remember something the same mind him who was God he left his position being God up there he came down in sin he became man Ila he became one who watches a food washing junkie says the worst kind of job there was to wash people's feet can you wash your brother's feet when it's uh communion night you you searching for the feet that you're gonna watch a friend rather this no no uh brother you're looking at the toes just wash his feet but Jesus God he came down he didn't care what theater was oh I'm running the risk of getting sickness on my hands my hands I've had issues since I watched the faith when covet came all the fighters with the mask Justice I I went to see my Deacon and he received me wearing full masks the law says we have to keep the distance majority but God he doesn't do all the theatricals that we are doing he came down very deep he washed the feet and Peter said come on how can you wash my feet I saw him transform water into wine I saw those blind people I heard the music I saw him walk on water and why is he and me no no no you're not gonna do that you're not going to wash my feet Jesus said if I don't worship over there you don't you don't get it why is he you for you to get in you have to remove um this kingdom is going to go down you will see what you're gonna miss see if God doesn't reveal to you this message you're not gonna go up because the secret with God to go up you have to come down the depths of the love of God for Peter yeah he says oh wash my hands too not just the feet it says the Lord wherever you go I'll go he was very excited he says where I go you cannot come he sees and Jesus get apprehended start beating in [Music] he looks at him no he's God he cannot cry [Music] his God he cannot cry ing Paul was thinking that Jesus is going to call angels to come down that you may burn all these people and and God took the cross this cross and it was started going see in this section it was a complete deception there were this there were it was a letdown yeah they were let down everybody was thinking but their thinking is not the word Mary was there crying and Jesus says your turn will come I'm not taking everything there's also a cross for you tonight I'm letting you know [Music] every one of us has a cross to bear don't throw it away it's gonna help you up there you need a cross somewhere around it it's that that's what's gonna help you to get to heaven you're gonna walk on top of them so you can go to the other side don't walk without the cross don't walk without love you I don't I don't even know him tell me if your wife denies you if your son denies you you know what it does to the heart you know what he does to the heart your son says he doesn't know you and he's mocking you and it's laughing you are not my mom I don't know you the strength of Satan but the love of God [Music] it doesn't look what what Peter did when he died God gave Peter the Holy Spirit and Peter came and he gave the formula on how we're going to get into the kingdom of God hello man I need 12 disciples uh bring me 11. Peter was going to go [Music] he was going to bring 11 sinners like him because he is the place where he lived is Entourage that's where they were cutting catching fish look at Matthew Matthew was a collector he was on a different level if God told him the same thing Matthew was going to go and get people that were in his Entourage but look at the love of God the love of God when and God of bigger he went and took the lowest he put them all together and he says you are my children the the depths of the love of God the height the height there is nothing higher than the throne and to him that Overcomers I will I will give him a uh to to to to to to overcome is to keep life his love he took the throne that he refused to give to Satan he gave it to you if you call the White House tonight say I'm also American I also have to come and eat at the table I have to come eat I have to eat with Biden you will not get in Throne is very low but how much more the bigger Throne of God Satan enviously until this day that's why Paul says that all the saints that they may understand it requires an understanding to see that the man who told you he loves you doesn't love you the mother who told you he loves you she doesn't love you there is no love like the love of God the love of God is alive with full measures for his children he's always there waiting for you [Music] is it good for me to go stay with us stay with us it's very important that I go I will not leave you alone I will send you a comforter let's visit the spirit of truth that's why we finish I'm going to prepare for you a house is a body the body will be created the soul will be created and will live eternally and they will not be sin the glory to come is much greater in giving excuses God is not going to ask you how much money you will how much work you did one second you have to have that form so you can go to the other side if you don't go there's another place that waits for you thank you it's The Fifth Dimension we're living between two Dimensions there's a family of God and when God went to the Earth they greeted him and they greeted him he says they were real jealous I saw them and there was a sister who was about 78. it's the truth there is children of God in heaven these angels is that those that are slipped in Christ and there is God himself and here on Earth [Music] God bless you foreign [Applause] God's a great God and a promise remains a promise until it's manifested and then when it promises manifested then that's the word becoming flesh and I thought tonight it was a a wonderful reminder really what were to be made out of but also there's a great opportunity this evening and I want to ask you this evening if you feel that you have that love of God in your heart and and where would that love take you to what extent would you go the scripture says no greater love hath than man than to lay his life down for another and really that's the essence of what God is that God is love so we have a wonderful opportunity this evening to express that love we have a a young lady that's come here this evening she's a friend and customer of brother Jose and sicknesses struck her body he's not a member of our church but she's a member of our family because our love doesn't stop at these walls and she's come this evening because she heard that we pray for the sick and the doctors can't give her any other promise than the promise of the flesh the promise of science but we heard tonight about a God that's above science his love isn't Bound by the Four Corners of this Earth it's not bound by this dimension it's eternal and when you see someone to me that is willing to come to a church she's never been to before because she heard a word about a people that believe that God sent a messenger she heard the testimonies of the Miracles and the Deliverance that was Wrath by the spirit of God in our generation and she's come because she's cut no other place to go but to him now my question is is you have the love of God in your heart that your can take on that burden that your faith could rise up to where it's no longer of Faith talked about but it's a faith put into action it's not a faith about a God that lived 2 000 years ago or a God that manifested 50 60 years ago but a God that's here tonight the same yesterday today and forever does your love and faith join together that he said wherever two or three are gathered together in my name I'll be in the midst our sister didn't come tonight to join a church she didn't come tonight to be indoctrinated with our belief or our doctrines though we believe their sound though we believe they're scripturally based but you come to ask the Lord Jesus and ask us to join together with her to ask him if he would heal her so it's finally come to the age church it's no longer talk [Music] you know what I mean either that love of God is in your heart when I met her in the parking lot I I said sister your brother Jose said you would come she said yes I am I took her by the hand I said I see that you have a good heart she says I try now I believe with all my heart that she has the faith this evening but do you have the love to join your faith with her faith I mean to pour your heart into it and believe I'm not talking about standing back and say a prayer and say I'm now I'm going to watch to see what the results are foreign the Lord put those people out like if you're sitting here now and you say well I've got to go and I I need to I got things to do and I've got to get up early then it'd be probably better but if you're willing to join your faith with her faith you're willing to take her into your heart and say I believe Jesus Christ heals you sister because you've heard the word and the truth sets you free we heard tonight of a power that's greater than any power that Satan has the love of God and the promise to the church is that the love of God will be shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit I know she told me her name but you know how I am with names and their friend that's with her so sister I'd like to invite you if you would to come this evening here [Music] [Music] it'd be an honor for you to come here I guess it's cancer right thank you we know what cancer is don't we it's a spirit Glory it's an outside Spirit living in her body and that's why Jesus went to the cross for the scripture tells us that the chastisement of our peace was upon him in other words the penalty for sin he bore that penalty and by his stripes we are healed and the scripture tells the sister that Jesus Christ is the same as yesterday today and forever yes and the bible promises Us in this last day that there would be a people upon the Earth not a denomination not a religious organization not a system but there would be an elected people that had the indwelling spirit of Jesus Christ and he would be standing in this generation in bright form yes I ask you one thing you feel for love and I have my heart for you [Music] watch him yes yes okay and Satan can't happen I don't believe the Lord money so if Jesus was standing here today not in this body but in the body he was in 2000 years ago and you came and took him by the hands you yes Glory Glory absolutely he's the same yes Glory yesterday thank you yes thank you thank you thank you thank you Father thank you man yes thank you thank you again [Music] thank you a gracious father this is your daughter yes you purchased her on Calvary father in the love of God has come to surround her Satan we endure you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you have no part of her she is not her we rebuke you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Satan in the form of cancer come out of my sister in Jesus name we claim and pray and command you by the blood and the love of calvary and the church said thank you and now the secret rest your faith the word is a prophet right yes by his stripes I am healed and the story your end of story I don't care what the doctor says I don't care how you feel that doesn't matter because the reality God's word yes yes thank you you're glorious let's Stand Together [Applause] Hallelujah
