a great price lord you had them in your mind before there ever was a star [Music] and you brooded over all of history and mankind until the hour came of their birth because without them you are not complete that's how marvelous your love to us was we ask you to bless us tonight in jesus name we pray amen if you have your bibles and you'd open with me to the book of uh revelations the third chapter of the book of revelations and we'd like to read from the 20th the verse uh we'd like just to we're going to play a little portion of a message tonight and then we'd like if we had a a sermon title or a thought for this little lesson tonight it would be called your calling was in the sign your calling is in the sign so we just like to do that and he said behold i stand at the door and knock any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches amen god bless you may be seated we're going to play a little portion and just have a little fellowship out of the message called the voice of the sign the voice of the sign and so how would you know which voice to hear there's so many voices well god was so beautiful that he gave the voice a sign and so that the the there's a voice that always follows the sign and so as we listen to this uh i as brother branham is laying out the purpose of a sign and the fact that god sent a sign and it's got to be a godly sign you know what i mean it's got to be vindicated by god and prove to god but there's a reason that he sends this sign because that's where our calling is our calling is in that sign we receive our calling from that sign so let us just listen to for a few moments and i think it's about 30 i'm not sure and if and i know that you can look as you as we read i think if you are speak spanish i think you can go to your phone and find it we're starting in about paragraph 25 and we're going to go through paragraph 95 and then i think it's also in the other languages but it was preached in in 1964 on 214 1964 and is that valentine's day 14 good so what a love letter from the lord to us amen this is uh you know i was talking with the brothers the church is talking a lot about maturing and i think when you want to mature i think it's really good to know your foundation you understand why that we are where we are today why we're here what brought this message to us and why we follow it so let us just enjoy this for a little bit this evening and then we'll just take a few moments to comment it when we're done but i believe you'll really enjoy it and then i'd like just to read a statement that you are going to hear but but just keep it in your mind it will come very in the right in the beginning of the text it says and now we find out that usually just at those joint crossroads of an exodus the unusual begins to happen i believe we're there again i believe we're there at the exodus of the bride to go meet the bridegroom i believe the exodus is at hand and and he'll tell us how we know that god bless you as we you listen to this few moments of the tape it'll be a blessing to you god bless you god is so unusual he does things in such an unusual way so contrary to science so contrary to education so contrary to sometimes man's theology just contrary to that god does that just to show he's god and to do that he has to take somebody that knows none of these things so that he can work through that person when jesus come why didn't he take care of us as the priest that was trained and ready for the job he went out and got man that couldn't even sign their name ignored and unlearned the bible said they were because god takes nothing to make something out of it and whenever you get to a place that you feel that you're nothing then you're just about ready to come to god when when you get to a place that you know nothing but you want to know something then he'll reveal himself to you now notice when this unusual thing never happened in the world as we know of it was just the time of the exodus the exodus was at hand and when exodus means being taken out brought out and now we find out that usually just at those a joint crossroads of an exodus the unusual begins to happen i believe we're there again i believe we're there at the exodus of the bride to go meet the bridegroom i believe that exodus is at hand and this exodus to be brought from from egypt back to their homeland where they were promised to come was just at hand in god had to re-educate his man remember moses was educated for 40 years getting all of his doctor's degree and everything and taking god just another four years to take out of him what education put any 40 years in the wilderness what taking it take it out it was to put it in then in the all this great uh thing was out of him god appeared to him in a form of a burning bush now i'll show you it was out of him now if not now moses being a scientist he would have went to take some of those leaves off of a tree and take them down to the laboratory and have them examine to see what kind of a chemical it was sprayed with that that tree could burn and not burn up see because now the egyptians were smart scientific people more smarter in science than we are today peruse that they could embalm a body that still looks natural today we can't do that build a clear maze we couldn't do that the things that they had were far beyond our signs today and so moses was trained in all the wisdom so that made him a scientist so you see when he come in the presence of this bush he knows the bush had what he left if we could only do that today if we could only know the phenomena of god has got what we lack in our denominations but our educational system lacks god's god in the phenomena of the presence of christ that's what we need now we find out this exodus at hand god met moses and told him what was going to take place and give him two signs and each sign has a voice a voice of a sign every sign from god is followed by a voice every time god gives a true sign there's a voice that follows it when you see some kind of phenomena come along and watch it move and it don't change into something then it never comes from god god don't just show signs just to show he's god there's a voice that follows that sign uh by god's help you'll find that in the scripture tonight and see if that's the truth thing here the bernie bush was a sign to moses that was a sign and it was given to and he heard the voice from the bush now notice god never changes his program he never has to take his words back his first decision is perfect i can make a decision i'll say well i was wrong see i'm a man you can make one and you have to take it back science makes it and takes it back do you know that they can scientifically prove it to be right and that you always scientifically prove it's wrong but they won't admit theirs they won't admit this uh french scientists about 600 years ago or something like that rolling a ball at a certain speed around the globe being the earth or or 200 years ago i believe was the three something like that any high e scientifically proved by the raising of this fall at the speed if if someone would go the terrific speed of 30 miles an hour anything traveling upon the earth is the speed of 30 miles an hour gravitation loses hope to be taken off the earth you think science goes back and recognizes that no they're going on and on and on see but ministers are always trying to refer back to what somebody else said way back behind them instead of what god said do we're climbing the tree of faith see and god never changes his program you can rest solely on what god says the first time he ever has to stay with them he cannot he cannot and never did at any time change it because if he doesn't he's finite like we are he makes mistakes he has to apologize and go back but he is the source of all wisdom source of all power infinite omnipresent on that mission omnipotent see he's just he's god if he isn't all those things and he isn't god but he has to be that to be god now god never did use some man-made program to honor him let's just put it to disgrace god always uses a single individual just once never organization never a denomination he uses one single person because we different all one from another there was never two major prophets on the earth at one time never he doesn't do it because it just speaks to that one when that was gone he raises another to speak at that time remember that's always been his program now we find out here that burning bush was a sign it was given to attract the attention of moses now that's what god gives a sign for is to attract the tension of the people that's what a sign is for to attract attention you know we go down through the scripture here as we teach it now for a few minutes and find out if that isn't so that he gives these signs to attract detention and then when he gets the attention of the people then the voice of the sign begins to speak jesus healed the sick to attract the tension see then when he begins to preach always it attracts attention the burning bush was given to moses to attract the runaway prophet's attention and he turned aside to see what it was then the sign gave a voice yes amen the sign itself gave a voice now these voices and signs are to alert the people of god's word is just about ready to be vindicated always the sign is to attract the tensions people now many of you bible readers that are thinking now of different places in the bible we're going to come to some of them that when a sign is given it attracts the attention of the people because god is getting ready to speak he wants an audience when somebody is going to listen to what he's going to say see now always does that his word alerts them of this this time is an alert to attract the attention of the people that the word is getting ready to speak now notice he is going to speak by his promised word something that he said he's going to do notice uh i have heard and i remember my promise i heard their cries in egypt i remember what i promised abraham see what he's going to do he attracted his attention now he's got his word he's going to give it to the prophet moses because that was is and ever is his way of speaking amen amen that's what he does at the beginning that's why he does it now he ever does it the same thing the word comes to the prophet and moses was the prophet and now he has to prophesy that he was going to bring israel out and say i was going to do it but he was going to bring them out of egypt and then he had heard their cries and their groans and their prayers they were only waiting for god god was waiting on them he had his prophet out there in the wilderness but he was only waiting for the people to call him into action i believe he's got the same thing today waiting for his church to call it on the scene [Music] the promise of today is ready but he's got to get the people to praying and groaning like they were down there then it'll come on the scene yeah the moses was out in the wilderness holding there for 40 years the people rejected the the sign of the thing he did down there and were killing the egyptian it wasn't god's way so he put him out in the wilderness and and re-educated now to the phenomena and now he's ready and god said i heard their groans i've seen their thrones their past masters whipping them and i remember my promise amen see he's ready to speak now he's got everything in order now he shows the phenomena that attract the attention of the prophet when the prophet got down there he showed the phenomena because he loves god's voice amen how could a man pick up dust and throw it and say just sayeth the lord not of fleeing the country in a couple hours and then the everything's crowded full of fleas not a fly no word and he said let there be fly and the first thing you know a big old flow fire began to fly around and there was glory to people everywhere who what man could do that it was god using that [Music] watch real close now he is going to speak so he has to track the attention by a sign and the sign voice is what he's going to say his word is promised words going to be vindicated now see i made a promise that i would take him out by a strong hand i'd show my power in that land whatever he's going to do i made the promise to abraham here he is ready to do it so he gives a sign a pillar of fire laying back in a burning bush and he tells moses now you're going to be my mouthpiece go on down there and i'll be with you and when he got in there then the promise word that he had promised was vindicated that was the voice of the sign get it down notice i have heard their groans i remember my promise god never changes he always does it in the same way the coming of a prophet is the sign that god is ready to speak did you not search the scriptures see the bible says god put himself he did nothing until he revealed it to his prophet that's right he does it to them because it comes to him as his servants all right the coming of a prophet is the sign that's overlooked by the people every time they overlook it they never get it somehow let the social worker got their eyes open to see it those who are elected to see it does it but the coming of a prophet was the sign that god is ready to speak because of god's eagle to speak the prophet wouldn't be on earth i remember that he wouldn't be on earth unless god was ready to speak and that's the way he speaks to those channels yes the unchanging god never did do it any other way notice this is always god's way of making his voice known to his people he sends his prophet and gives a sign and then takes his voice that's been spoken before on his word and vindicates it by this man and they know that it's his voice because it's the promised word of the day oh if people could fully see it if they could only stop just the moment and realize that you see there's no way to make them believe it there's there's not a way a man god himself can do it make the people believe it they've got to believe it and if there's nothing there to believe with how can they believe no matter what you do the bible says though he had done so many miracles yet they could not believe because isaiah foresaw it said they got ears and they can't hear eyes and can't see and yet he was perfectly the messiah done exactly what the messiah said and they said this man just breaks up churches and he we don't know points he comes isn't that strange that they would do that but the bible said they would do it and the bible also said in this day they'd do the same thing any high-minded lovers of pleasure more than of god false accusers incontinent despisers of those that are good heaven a form of godliness but would deny the vindicated world the power there the baptism the holy ghost is from such turn away for this is the kind that organizes women's societies it goes house to house and leads to the women laid away with diverse lust never able to come to the knowledge of the truth see now that's prophesying and that's got to come to pass because it's thus far so long notice but their folly would be showed up like jabberson james in the last days now always making on his voice to his people by his prophet simon i'm talking about moses that's where i'm banking back and then see where we're at god's word is manifested by the voice of the sun now the sign that is promised for the day is done before the people and then the written scripture comes forth is the voice of that sign if it doesn't give a scriptural voice then stay away from it it's not god because god can't promise this for a day and say oh this is it see god cannot do that god cannot promise something for one day and say no no it it i won't do that that was for another day what he promises he must stay with us and the real scriptural sign is the scriptural voice moses sign that he saw was god in cosmic life and then when he did that and did anybody know the old hebrew a sign even before there was a bible written was a triangle shape or oval shape of a cosmic light exactly right the low gospel now dr lomsey has that in his bible on the cover on the outside now we notice that moses was attracted by this sign and this sign spoke to moses with the scriptural voice see the sign attracted him and then he said i remember my promise and i've come down to deliver them and i'm going to use you for a mouthpiece you go on down there moses made his excuses but god sent him anyhow now he's that's his way of interpreting his word a prophet in the scripture must first be a a seer that's a vindicator it must not be just any fellow come along and say i got the says the lord next and say i see thus death the lord prophets are not hands laid on them and made prophets prophets are predestinated for the hour the bible tells when they'll come what they'll be prophets are are sent from god they're offices of god that's been born god told jeremiah before he was even conceived in your mother's womb i'll ordain you a prophet they're just that must be perfectly in the man it's a it's not him it's a gift from him moses was born a prophet jeremiah was born a prophet isaiah a prophet john the baptist a prophet god has spoken them and what they say must be true and the way that the people is to know whether they are true or not what he says must be correct because what he's prophesying about is his credentials of his call from god when god vindicates what he says to be the truth now that's why i'm trying to say these things tonight so that you'll understand now if the bible said over here if there'll be one among you who's spiritual or a prophet i the lord will make myself known unto him in visions speak to him through dreams then he says if this prophet says anything and it doesn't happen then don't you believe it that's no more than good sense but if what he says comes to pass then here then you must fear him because he's with him now we find out what moses said come to pass see that made him a vindicated seer that was his credentials because what he said happened he said that about this time tomorrow there'll be fleas all over the ground and there was this time tomorrow there will be so and so and there was it was hit as actually on the dots not just the haphazard so many man today if you excuse this just for a minute not no judge or just passing a personal opinion many man has raised up good spirit-filled man and they try they go out maybe the lord give him a gift of prophecy now there's a million miles difference between a gift of prophecy and a prophet a gift of prophecy must be judged by three before it could even be passed into the church we know as same as speaking in tongues it must go before three judges before it can even be given to the church now we find out now if these men go out sometime and then people begin to press upon them oh brother what will you say see he goes by impression way he feels of the lord will do that thus saith the lord that's a lie see you when you can't say thus saith the lord until god in his own language has spoken to you and told you that then it's not you saying not your impression the bible said it a prophet did that was going out presumptuously that is pursuing and pursue is to adventure without authority he's going upon his own but when you see the man speaking what's going to happen in the name of the lord it happens day in and out week in and out month in and out year in and out then you know that come from god that's god's credentials to the man that he is the interpreter of the written word for that day because god sends the man to knowledge [Applause] if the church has only had some good sound teaching on these things see they'd understand oh i think we get one little track and we run right wow with it let's just take on that one thing and just make a hobby out of it that's whatever every denomination originated from if martin luther would have went on into sanctification okay if the western methodist would have went on into the baptism the holy ghost the registration against it all been one big church of the lord all the time but they get that one little thing and prove it's right and there they are but they had to do it the bible said that's the way they would do it it has to be this way today i hope that my class unders do you understand what i mean raise your hand so and understand you must understand friend this is your life see this is your life yes his credentials is that god has a vindicated this person to be a seer now the english word of prophet just means a preacher the anybody ever preacher is a prophet because he's foretelling something uh preaching the word under inspiration it's called a prophet but in the old testament they were more than that they were seers they were a man who told things that was coming to pass and it happened that gave him the right to be the the interpreter of the word for that day because god took the word of that day and interpreted himself through that man and that's what he come on the earth for he's always a sign when a prophet comes to the earth just watch as we go through it and see if it isn't so he always sends his prophet when you see a prophet rise on the scene look out we're looking for one to come now you know i mean when you see it you just remember it's something fixed to happen this is his credentials then god interprets his word by him and through him numbers 12 6 tells that and remember the entire bible was wrote by the prophets why the word of the lord came to a matter that he was vindicated prophets like jason and through them that was thrown out and many prophets that never went on but god has a way of stirring his word when it's true god's got to judge the world by something the catholic people here they say he's going to judge him judge the world by the church if that's right then what church if you say the catholic church which the roman greek or what see they're all broken pieces he's going to judge about the baptist church now what about the methodist church see he can't do there's too much confusion people wouldn't know where they're at but he said in the bible if you don't know what he's going to judge the people by he's going to judge the world by jesus christ and he is the word the bible man is what he'll judge by a vindicated word that's god's way of judging is the bible so no matter what any creed or denomination says you say write that bible because it is christ think john the first chapter tells us that notice now the bible was written by the prophet we see that it says that the man of old and moved by the holy ghost wrote the bible and hebrews 1 it says god in sunderland times and diverse manners spake to the fathers by the prophets in this last day through his son jesus christ see because he was the manifestation of all the word or the prophet and he was the fullness of the word the word was in him all the words he was emmanuel god manifested in flesh god's come down in the form of the holy spirit two wings like a dove settling down and one upon him saying this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell in now the king james there says in whom i'm pleased as well what difference does it make in whom i'm peaceful dweller who i'm pleased to dwell in the in whom i'm pleased to dwell there it was god in man heaven and earth come together god in man united the greatest hour to that time there was on the earth there had been notice the pillar of fire signed and then the voice of the sign spoke thee the pure sign of the boys was there ready to speak the sign only showed that the voice was ready to speak get the id the sign shows god's voice is ready to speak and when god shows a sign as he's in the last days you don't you look around look at look at the immoral of the people that's god's sign when you see people getting like this look what they're going to he said they get worse and worse they were donuts see that immoral sign all right there's all kinds of signs in the heavens above fearful sights flying saucers the pentagon looks at them normal what they are all kinds of signs theorem ways perplexed the time distress between the nations all these things earthquakes and diverse places man running to and fro knowledge increasing all these other things that he said great turmoil how the christ would be put out of his church in the last days in the lady of the age regardless all these things are god's speaking signs and then once they made us known god sent someone on the scene something on the scene to vindicate that and to take the scripture that spoke up for the day and to manifest it and that's the credentials of it let's see this the sign the pillar of fire as soon as the sign come up there it was that was the sign that the voice was ready to speak and we see the signs of the end amen that right the sign of the end how many blings i say amen and the voice is ready to speak [Applause] the voice is ready to speak because we see the sign the pillar fire was there to say that the voice do you enjoy that aren't you glad you can go finish listening to it and listening to it again i hope it stirs you enough to do that amen someone says why do you just play a little bit of it well because we can't even get the little bit we play you know what i mean but excuse me but i i wanted to say this just to you know especially our young people and people that have been raised in the message and and uh people that have uh come along and uh by friendship and things just to go back a little bit and just to understand what it is that we're built on and what what we mean when we say uh our your calling is in the sign and i'd like to just find that little uh statement that he read he said he said here he says it was god using that prophet making his word a sign to give a call to give a call making this word so our call is in the sign so when you understand that a man showed up on the scene and uh uh he was born and we could go over his life story and he had the a pillar of fire came by his life when he was born it showed up it's they said a strange light came into the room anybody could believe a story like that or say a story like that my family could say that a light showed up in the room that was a sign all of a sudden he said that one day he was packing water and there was a whirlwind in a bush and uh that whirlwind told him not to defile his body in any way that god had to work for him but i i've had whirlwinds come all around me before i've been caught up in a whirlwind in montana the winds we'd have those things that just we call them twisters or whatever you had that anybody could have that but there was a sign of the son of man there was a sign that was that god was going to perform to just equivocally prove that this voice this prophet had a voice to follow and so he said the first sign would be the taking of the hand and the prophet of god would take his hand and he would take the person's hand and then by the vibrations that would go up and down that hand he would he would be able to know what the sickness was of the person and so he that was a sign and that sign he took that person by the hand and and he would he would take it and he would tell him what was wrong and at whether they had and many times on the early tapes you'll hear him say he'll take someone by the hand and you'll say watch that you see that you see those little bumps going up and down to my hand here he says now wait he says if they go away you're well amen and you know i for some reason in my heart i just believed that brother branham had the faith that they were going to go away that's why he draw the people's attention to it again sure enough then they would go away if they wouldn't go away he'd pray for him and just say you know go but if that sign then was a psych and the voice that followed that sign would be thus saith the lord your well that was the first sign and the voice of the first sign spoke of the voice of the second sign so he said after that he said now not only that but now they'll even know the secrets of their heart now remember the importance of this because if if you don't understand the the sign and that's why we we listened to what he said he said god sends the sign and the sign is a sign it's an alert i hope there's a bride alert pretty quick i hope all these phones go off everywhere all over the place bee bee bee silver alert some silver guy's missing hallelujah okay i mean just everywhere going off because the bride's leaving out of here and one after the other you know what i mean but just to just follow the sign understand the sign that god gave the sign because the call was going to follow the sign the voice was kind of the voice of god god was attracting the attention of the people because he was going to have a call so the call was in the sign if you didn't see the sign you would have never heard the call if you weren't attracted by the sign you would never hear the call and so the call was in the sign that keno enzo he proved beyond the shadow of the doubt that they said well it's telepathy so he said and he would talk about the woman at the well and and uh people would say well that was telepathy or or or some form of discernment or or something like that that was just a way to uh he just looked at her and saw her condition and and saw what time she was coming out to the well so he knew that there was something wrong with her and and uh you know he just and he he kind of guest around you know that's what a lot of people do they don't they just kind of guess and they hit it every now and then and if you know god doesn't hit it every now and then he's a hundred percent every single time you don't ever have to worry you know god doesn't do anything haphazardly amen that's why the bride has got to have thus saith the lord or if she sits still and if you say it's thus saith the lord and god didn't tell you it's not your impression it's not how you feel it's not some sort of unction you have he says that's a lie and it's okay to have an impression it's okay to have a feeling it's okay to have a leading it's okay because then you proceed that way you lean that way and and if the door opens it's fine you know what i mean if god don't speak to you and say you know i wouldn't go that way i i would pray about that i would do this you know then that you know then he checks that but when you have thus saith the lord there ain't no checking that settled but it ain't thus saith the lord until it is the saith the lord so you can have impressions you can lean this way you can lean that way you can have functions that's fine but don't say it's the lord i like it when a man says i feel led that's exactly what he's saying he's not saying the lord led me he says my feelings are leading me i feel led i feel led to go fishing i feel led to sleep in that's all right that's right you understand but you got to draw the distinct the distinct division and division between what's god and what's not god that's why god sent the sign so we could have a distinct line between what was god and what wasn't god you know what i mean that it wasn't just a another pathway it wasn't just another thing but it was a clear sign from god that there was a message or a call to follow and so finally so that it wouldn't be any confusion he turned to the one well but he took it all the way back to elohim when god the morphe took on the form of a man he said he gathered up a cosmic god had that form of that man in his mind what a theophany is it's a thought word of god that hasn't taken form in flesh yet and then so he came and god took on this form of a man we it wasn't jesus it was god taking on a form to talk to abraham and to give a sign that was a sign to abraham and he gave a sign to abraham because there was a voice or a call to follow and he said i'm going to visit you and you and sarah are going to have a son huh well sarah laughed but with his back to the tent okay no no discerning the look on abraham's face like abraham you know a lot of people discern your reaction it's called profiling you know you say something to somebody and all of a sudden they cast their eyes away or or they look down real quick or they flinch you know you hit a nerve and if you're trained in those things you just keep hitting that nerve hitting that nerve and then pretty soon that person i'm teaching you all how to lie and then pretty soon that person they start defending themselves you know or they start telling the story or they try to present the story in a certain light and the facts don't line up and the facts don't line up you know why are you saying that it doesn't match you just told me this you see you don't line up but so people have all kinds of ways of discerning all kinds of ways of presenting things let me say it this way all kinds of ways of deceiving but god left a sign so you could know that the voice that followed that sign had no deception in it whatsoever don't blame yourself if you if you find yourself have been deceived because satan appears as an angel of light but if you can recognize and see the vindicated sign of god then you know that every other voice has been ruled out and your call yes sir is in that sign that sign is what's calling you and reaching out to you because it attracted your attention i remember when i first heard the discernments elk and those people would come up before brother branham any and he would talk about their diseases and he would tell him this and i see a doctor examining you i see a big man i see you sitting on the side of the bed i see you this you know i see you back here i love the stories he told about the the the little dog the girl he discerned there he says oh your problem was yeah a dog that scared you we see it on tape the woman comes up and he says oh oh it's a lie they told the lie there's a lie in your church your the preacher said you was a witch and i i would just sit back and and i it was the sign the sign set apart the voice you understand the sign set apart that the sign is what kept it from being intellectual that that's the trouble if you take this message and you separate the prophet from the message you separate the sign from the message you separate the call from the sign you end up with intellect that's right exactly what you end up with and i was so attracted to that i was so attracted it attracted my attention but why was my attention attracted because my call my calling was in the sign my calling was there so to leave no doubt about it he didn't take it to the woman at the well he finally took it all the way back to elohim god veiled in flesh the ministry of god veiled in flesh amen that was that the woman at the well it was god veiled in flesh discerning her thoughts and intents of her heart so he took it back to elohim and what did he do keep there be an audience of people maybe a thousand times bigger in this group here and he'd turn his back to the audience like this there's nothing and he'd look right out here where the vision would appear with the angel lord standing there and he said i see not i see anybody can say that i see a young man with a notebook in cowboy boots and a blue striped shirt on i hope that's blue why and now if you didn't see what i saw then you'd have to take my word for it this sign you understand was going to be so vindicated by god that there would be no question of your call no question of the voice a voice is a call you know what i mean if i called your name my voice is what calls your name if i called if i called out to the back i said brother adrian that that that was my voice calling so this sign was given so it turned his back and then we began to tell people oh i see a man that that the doctors say he's got cancer lung cancer he's a coal miner the things that that that he did to to settle in the heart of the here from where they're calling cain it came from the sign that was the voice of the sign the call i love how he says it and i'll just say it again he said because it's it it's beautiful he said he spoke and both blow fives were everywhere he says who what man could do that it was god using that prophet making his word a sign to give a call we're going out of egypt you understand what was the sign the sign was a call to let us know we are going out of this world always the sign before the exodus so you could hear the call the call was in the sign it's not built on your intellect god didn't do this so you could sit back and build it on your ability to interpret scripture or your ability to understand something he put it in the calling in the sign so all of us had to see and recognize the same sign and hear the call if they if your call's not in the sign then your message isn't according to the sign then it's not pleading you in the right place that's why we've got too many staying gospels instead of leaving gospel too many songs that are sung so that it's in the tune of the day and the beat of the day and the entertainment of the day you know you let folk music be the thing that everybody's singing folk song you let some other music gendra come and all of a sudden songs are upcoming and gendrous which are just to touch our appetite of our flesh while we're here and it's nothing about leaving it's just making this stay here more delightful well i think the eagle needs to blow all the feathers out of our nest so we can't stand to stay down here anymore no comfort in nothing you hear the call the end time i'm going home the things that are spoken are coming to pass so you see when once you have the sign once you understand this message was built not on just divine healing many people pray for the sick that was lying in the scriptures forever men were on the scene before the prophet of god was on the scene praying for the sick that is the inheritance praying for the sick is the proof of the resurrection that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever turning your back to the audience and discerning the thoughts and intents of the people's minds when there was no visual contact at all but by divine vision that was a sign from god that showed there was a message that followed and that's where you get your call what do i mean by your call the way you live what word truth that you believe how to discern the hour and recognize the day and its message if that sign isn't anchored in your heart you have no anchor yes sir you're saying it don't matter when it's questioned they can intellectually question they can throw their bible at you they can give you scripture and everything but when you come down to the sign when you come down to what vindicates your word versus this word they can say i pray this but they can't turn their back to the audience they can't know the secrets of the heart they can't see something out there before it happens he walked into that whole room of ministers and said you all set a trap that man got up there and said you may not believe well brother branham's doctrine but he told me we wouldn't have this room that's right he told me where every one of you would be sitting now who is ready to take their bible then oh they wait for 50 years you know what i mean he tells the story of the bridge he tells all these stories all over the world all this time and then all of a sudden some modern telephone and you know billy told me anyway he said the most unstable thing is the internet i said so that's why it's making so many unstable people can you imagine dating over social media you know what you're going to end up marrying a virus that's exactly the truth a lie a lie well what when's it gonna take for us to get back and make contact with a living god [Applause] that's what the sign was for the sign was so you could see god manifested in flesh and hear the call that this is the truth i can follow this i can live by this i can believe in this i can trust this because it's got a vindicated sign and my call is in the sign [Music] exactly what we're resting in we're not resting in the putting together of scriptures we're not oral robert had bulldog faith he just build faith and give testimonies and grab people and shake him come out of him devil believe god go on believe god boom boom and they had to believe god after such a demonstration of faith like that i'm not condemning it you heard my message the other side of the message why so many people responded to billy graham and you don't hear what they hear but you know what the prophet of god said he took a lot of things off people that god put on for a purpose blinding blind two angels went out to blind the world all your religious denominations philosophies approaches worships and everything are under the deceit of those two messengers the truth but you've got something to anchor in the prophet being on the scene was a sign that god was fixed in the sea it was a sign there was fixing to be an exodus it was a sign and that sign was so vindicated proven it the scripture by the woman at the well proven by the abraham and the promised son and we could go into that for hours but when i talk to then you you recognize that in other words no other ministry had that sign now they try to duplicate it today you've got to have a spiritual seed to be able to discern a counterfeit i have with one of the brothers i don't know who it was i forget the the situation but they they went to some place and bought two counterfeit signs porcelain signs both of them were fake someone lied it wasn't real how do you know what's fake and what's not fake i'll tell you god sent a sign and the word of the lord come to that prophet because that sign was the divine interpreter of the word so you know who you can lay your trust in i don't care how intellectually they get i don't matter how they can go through the bible if there isn't a divine sign that you can anchor them too then god didn't speak very good that's what he said so this call the call of your life the call of your actions the call of your journey the call of this decisions you're gonna make and the choices you make the call why we teach you young people the way that we teach you about dress and dating and getting involved and listening to things and all that it's all based on a sign it's not based on my opinion i let a lot of people play music i don't particularly care for okay but if all you had to do was listen to the music that i cared for you wouldn't like music but see but when it comes to the source the source is the sign without the sign the voice would have meant nothing i still think to us though having the seed in us we would identify with the word whether or not but he didn't leave it to us you understand he took the us out of it by providing a divine sign a prophet sent from god that did the works and the discernment of the thoughts and tents of the heart prophesying for telling things to come a true seer how many things have we seen just lately that have just come to pass come to pass come to pass so we know that that's our call our call to the life we live came from the sign and i'd like to read this in closing he was talking of jonah jonah come forth he was a prophet the lord had sent him and he tried to bypass it like moses you can't bypass the issue let me tell you you cannot by pass the issue the issues are coming the test is coming they're going to press us to the max compromise is in every offer if you don't know what you're built on if you don't know what you believe is built on a prophetic sign that god sent that the words that you believe are vindicated by the god that stood behind every word and it never failed you have got to have that in your heart you have got to have that in your anchor i i don't believe this because i filtered it through my mind i don't believe it because it it it added up to the way that i believe the bible i i don't believe it because there was miracles you have got to come to this place that you've seen in your life i've seen his sign that's what the wise men did they rolled into town they said where is he king of the jews i've seen his sign i've seen what god sent i didn't hear about it i didn't hear about it from daddy i didn't hear about it from the pastor i went and looked myself and i saw the sign i know it was a sign from god i know it's real i i know it's deep in my heart that's why i believe it that's why i follow it that's why i live the way i live i've heard the call of the love you sign jesus try to bypass it you can't bypass the issue many men will want to pat you on the back and say come into our group come into our group there is no group god is the only one you're under see come to us he bypassed it and went straight to tarsus god put him in a whale and sent him right back kind of reminds me when brother brown wanted to just go out and get away from it all it's like when i chose to moved out of california here i am a long-haired hippie we look at the map and we decide where are we going to move to we never considered church we never considered nothing you know we almost we looked and we picked the least populated state because we were hippies you know anti-society you know we pick a place that we thought was pretty and then we finally topped it off by throwing a dart at a map and it landed in just the place we were thinking about off we went well i never knew such a thing as mosquitoes being leslie planted a garden and our first radish was as big as our thumbnail three-month growing season we never knew nothing we didn't know we just went you know what i mean but guess what god sends you back you think you're going to run from it he'll send you back i thought i was in montana and god said you're going to preach the gospel in texas i was good i thought that meant one trip that's the truth i'm telling you it's honest straight from my heart i could tell you one on garfield street right where i was laying right now that old spring bed we had it didn't have a boxing just an old thin mattress on top of an old solid steel coil springs you know every time you roll over great great greek you know i know exactly where he spoke to me i didn't know how it was going to come to pass i didn't know my interpretations i went all the way to arizona but he finally got me here well god will bring you back it's hard to kick against the prick he said oh we do he put him in a well and sent him right back and he went in there and that was the sign and the voice of the sign was to repent or perish they followed the voice because they believed the sign they followed the voice because they believed the sign because the call was in the sign now you young teenagers young people people that are new to the message people that you came in because you heard the gospel you heard what the brother said you felt the love of the church you you felt that you you felt the worship and you felt the presence of the lord let me say that is good but take it back to the sign bring it back to the sign that's what called you not the pat on the backs not not and when somebody comes in we're all so willing am i preaching too much we all we all come in and and you know we pat everybody on the back that comes in pat great to have you baby come on in and bypass and let them bypass the sign the signs the anchor that's what makes it personal he said and the voice of the sign was to repent perish and they follow the voice because they believe the sign and they didn't perish and that's the only way it was because they believed the sign and heard the voice that's the only way that the members of the churches of this day will fail to go into judgment is when they believe the sign and hear the voice of god that's simple let's not forget that we're not built on enticing preachers we're not built on men that can read quotes and and and stir our emotions or or look but each of us should have been and come to the place that we've seen the sign what god did in this day and i'm saying this because we preach the message we go in and we preach the message and people hear the message but you can't become fully anchored until you understand the sign so i'm saying to you if you haven't looked in your own life and went back and taken the tapes taking what the prophet of god said watch him identify the sign watch him identify the work that he's doing he's not praying for the sick just because of hebrews 13 8. he's praying for the sick because there was a sign that was following him being the fulfillment of malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 and revelations 10 7. church that's bible truth this that's scripture manifested vindicated and proven with a divine sign that proved that this was the scripture fulfilled so what i'm encouraging you to do is go back into the word of god and the message of the hour until you can identify the sign [Applause] and when you identify the sign then you will never have no problem never have a problem heeding the call [Music] it's without whether i say it if i said what he said you don't go to me because i said it you go to the sign and you know it's the word of god so lord richly bless you i just want you to know what you're built in what we're about we're not about just another good teaching and i think we're the most lovely group of people that you could ask for i don't think a pastor could ask for a better group of people than the one we got the love you have one for another the care that you have one for another the the diversity that we have with all kinds of different countries and nations and everything you know just the the influences that i've got to balance and and try to keep in check it's but the spirit's wonderful but that's still not what we're built on they will know you're my disciples by your love for one for the other but why did you choose this way i know i've seen the work i've seen the word manifested in flesh i've seen his sign and because i saw the sign i heard the call and i knew that this was the way amen because he said i am the way the truth the life and no man come to this exodus without coming through this sign so lord richly bless you tonight the musicians would come we'll turn the service back over to billy they mean you know what it'd be good if all of us reacquainted ourselves with the sign just go back and and listen and and and just don't take the teaching just don't take the things that are said but sit there and look at that until you can identify and see that sign and that sign becomes so revelated to you that you know that you've heard the call yourself and you're not built on anybody else i've seen his sign and i'm here to worship the king god bless you tonight brother billy it's our stand tonight let's sing the revelation song amen [Music] holy holy [Music] has [Music] [Applause] is [Music] it's hard [Music] holy holy holy history [Music] [Music] in rambo [Music] blessing and honor
