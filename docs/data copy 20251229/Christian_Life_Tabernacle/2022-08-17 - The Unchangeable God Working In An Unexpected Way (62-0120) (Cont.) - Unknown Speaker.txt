love wherein you love me and father we ask that we could know that this evening in your precious name we pray amen amen God bless you may be seated tonight we're just going to finish a little bit of the message we listened to the other evening but before that I was fellowshipping with Matthew and we were talking about a few things about the placing of the message and where it is in time Matthew's real good about Bible timelines and message timelines so I've asked him to come up just share a few Thoughts with where this message fell in place and how God's perfect timing is so if Matthew is here Mary Matthew if you just come up and share some of those thoughts that we fellowship with with the people will joy and then we'll finish this tape this evening and uh so Lord bless you brother man I don't think I can live up to that statement there about being good with timelines and things like that but um certainly enjoy the message that we've been fellowshipping around the unchangeable god working in an unexpected way amen you enjoy that maybe maybe maybe just to to settle ourselves I'm I'm on a I'm on a a short leash here so I want to when the pastor gives you a time limit it's law to me I don't care how inspired You Think You Are you do not go over your time limit amen that's just that's just my heart's conviction so I'm going to start a stopwatch here and why don't we just stand because I think that would just make everybody feel a little bit more a more comfortable Lord we just ask your blessings upon this time lord as we would just say a few things and listen to your Prophet messenger Lord we thank you now ask it in your name Jesus Christ just open your Bibles will just read a very familiar scripture just to maybe have the order of the service a little more familiar to you we read Hebrews 13 8. how many are familiar with that scripture we all know it by heart so without even turning there I'm sure we could all read it together Hebrews chapter 13 verse 8 reads like this let's all read it together Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen you may have your seats uh just in this uh the message here the unchangeable god working in an unexpected way you know Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and you know I I'm reminded I believe in Matthew chapter 11. Jesus would pray this prayer he said Lord I thank you uh father I thank you that you have hidden these things from the wise and prudent but you've revealed them unto babes such as would learn and I I just the title of this message in itself is a paradox because he's saying it's the unchangeable god so he's unchangeable yet he's working in a way that's unexpected he's working in a time that's unexpected he's working in a place that's unexpected so this unchangeable God we know he changes his mask but he never changes his nature he's the same yesterday today and forever but yet it even though you might know his pattern you you might know the way he works it has to be a revelation because the theologians down Through the Ages have always been probing at the scriptures and and had their idea well this is how God is this is how he'll reveal himself this is how he's going to come but that unchangeable God whenever he goes to fulfill his word he goes right over the heads of the wise and prudent but God Reveals His word unto babes such as would learn and so just in thinking upon this message here I don't know why I'm ramping up because I'm not going to preach so I'm just going to slide right back down into the gear that I need to be in so I can honor my time limit but brother Brandon makes the statement he says you know he works in an unexpected time an unexpected place and an unexpected way and you know that's as as the I I wanted to refrain from even revisiting um the the the Bible stories that the prophet has gone through but he's moving towards something uh whenever you know the son of man Ministry what are we we're living in the time at the revealing of the son of man so whenever he's preaching about the Bible stories or the son of man ministry here on Earth and he's pointing out all of these examples he's moving to show you that he's the same yesterday today and forever and that there's a present uh truth that he's wanting you to catch now that the unchangeable God is working right now in an unexpected way in an unexpected place and an unexpected time and I would I would like to move your attention to uh brother Brandon would preach um in in a September 8 1962 he had preached present stage of my Ministry and he would start to talk about even in the very beginning of that message he would start to talk about how um that that it was some 30 years ago that I dedicated this this uh uh Church in 1933 and he's talking about that that um oh 150 yards from here on 7th street that it was that morning I had woke up and I had a vision and he starts to talk about how he had a vision of the Tabernacle and God took him took him up in the spirit and and placed him into a field and he would say that that Tabernacle is not your Pulpit but the world is your Tabernacle and it would be in that same year in 1933 that the uh you know he would dedicate the the Tabernacle there in 1933 and then uh later the pillar of fire would come down on the Ohio River and I would say as John the Baptist foreign the first coming of Jesus Christ so saw your ministry forerun the second coming of Christ and and I just you start to look back into the prophet's Ministry I I want to say that when the prophet was born there I believe in 1909 is that right uh in 1909 April uh something unexpected happened a light hung in the window amen it was an unexpected a a place and it was in an unexpected way that this light uh would hang in the window there and then a seven-year-old boy was walking down a pathway and all of a sudden the Whirlwind was found in an unexpected place and it spoke in an unexpected way and you you see all of these things uh uh start to to start to move forward that uh what would seem so unexpected it's God fulfilling prophecy what was the attraction on the mount it was it was God fulfilling prophecy and so when brother Branham starts to lay out this uh preaching present stage of my Ministry you know brother Branham traveled the world and he had great campaigns and healing campaigns and and people came in by the thousands and sometimes the hundreds of thousands in the meetings but yet brother Brandon would start to preach uh uh here in in a present stage of my Ministry because he's showing that my Ministry is now coming into a change and he would start to take uh the scripture in second Timothy there that he he pulled out of the Bible and and he ripped it out and he put it there in the Cornerstone and and he would say that that has now been fulfilled I fulfilled second Timothy uh uh uh the first five verses there it's now been fulfilled but now he's the first and second pool has been fulfilled but now he's saying I'm moving into the third pool of my Ministry something is taking place there's a change that is happening now in my Ministry and I've come to that place but he's saying and he starts to draw the type uh hopefully we're just we're just trying to you know this wasn't uh anyways I didn't have a way to maybe uh put it down and articulate much so we're just going to try to open up the fountain for a few minutes here and just just speak to you but he starts to talk about present stage of my Ministry and he's showing the type there and the parallel with Paul now think about Paul he he stood on a boat there and and there was an angel with him and he said look if everybody stays in this boat not one of you is going to perish and the boat come to a wreck and no man lasts their life and they come up on the island there and he's throwing wood into the fire and a Viper snatches on his hand he shakes it off in the fire and there was uh they was oh man this must be a God and then the man they wanted to kill all sudden they think he's a god he's holding a prayer line and people are being healed and Paul's Ministry went forth in power and demonstration and it was recognized by by the by the the disciples and it was recognized by the church this this great powerful Ministry but yet now as Paul has come down to what brother Brandon would call the crowning of his ministry he's now in Chains he's in bondage here Luke he has a nurse that's looking to care after him and it seems like now all of these demons has forsaken me he's now come to a place in time in his ministry where it would be unexpected that this would be a crowning time of his ministry and here I go preaching I'm sorry I try to ramp it back down because I got just a few more minutes but it would be unexpected here Paul this great mighty man who preached the gospel uh this wouldn't be the time for him to start writing the letters and the Very word that would be preparing a bride that I might might present you a Chase version uh to Jesus Christ but yet what was it it was now a crowning of his ministry and now brother Brandon is showing that here in 1962 there's coming a change in my ministry here I am in the Tabernacle I'm speaking to but but but just a few 200 people and coliseums have been fulfilled of a field and and doors were open and organizations were accepting them and oh there was such a mighty move but now the doors are closing they're all shutting they they they're not and it would be now he would say oh but it's in a time and if you could maybe bring a paragraph 114 there in present stage of my Ministry it's a profound uh statement but he would say so it is it's even true he says it's when men forsake men when men forsake men that God's servants stay true to his word that it's the crowning of their Ministry and here the prophet is saying that oh though everybody might leave though every my buddy might go away but now I'm coming into the crowning of of of of my Ministry what was it going forth why because he's now Christ he's setting up the breaking of those Seven Seals what is it as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be at the revealing of the son of man what's happening scripture now God is bringing the prophet to that final third pull the climax of his ministry the crowning of his ministry what's going to happen is God's going to break those Seven Seals those seven thundering Mysteries that that thundered their voices that God says seal it up for it won't be until the end time at the sounding of the seventh Angel's message when he begins to sound oh those great uh messages will be revealed now now every theologian everybody in the history is probing at how this is going to unfold but you want to talk about an unexpected place an unexpected time and an unexpected way a hillbilly born in Kentucky without proper grammar without an education but this was going to be the vehicle that God chose to mask himself in and break the Seven Seals where at is it going to be in Jerusalem is it is it going to be is it going to be back on Mount Moriah where is this great unfolding going to be is it going to be when the the word turns back to the Jews is it going to be in the great organizations is it going to be a Billy Graham is it going to be a Oral Roberts is it going to be some great man that that's garnered a great esteem from the organizations of Pentecost and the Baptists and Methodist and he's going to bring everybody together no no that that's not going to be the place that's not going to be the way that he's going to do that but I just want to draw your attention to now as we move uh move to uh God hiding himself in Simplicity brother Branham would preach that March 17th in the morning service and in paragraph four if maybe you could pull that up this is this is uh I I think it's just a beautiful way as we just uh about to uh turn it back over to our pastor to to recognize uh what is taking place because now uh the prophet took what was just a mud bed in Jeffersonville Indiana that people actually avoided because it was just a swamp an all stinky muddy swamp that even the road when it got to that point said we'll just go this way but just to think now that this this parcel of land that seemed to have no value I think it's amazing when God created the heavens and the Earth he had that little mud bed predestinated he said that's where I'm going to unfold the the the climax of my very plan of creation that I would that I would introduce a bride to the Lord Jesus Christ in the end time and he would say this in paragraph four it would read like this and uh God hiding himself in simplicity you say no matter uh where I'd ever roam this spot will always be sacred for about 30 years ago in a Muddy Pond bed I dedicated this piece of ground to Jesus Christ when it wasn't nothing but a mud bed this was all upon that's the reason the street is out of cater the road had to go around to get away from the pawn that was in here and in here there used to be Lily Pond lilies come up and the Lily is a very strange flower though it is born in the mud it has to press its way through the mud and then through the waters and the Slime to get itself to the top to show its beauty and I think this morning think about what morning this is now come to break the Seven Seals I think it's this I think this morning that that's a whole lot of what's happened here that's since that time oh an unexpected time an unexpected place in an unexpected way a little ponderly has pushed itself and when it got to the top of the water it spread its wings forth its little petals went out and it reflects reflected the lily of the valley May at long stand may it be a house fully dedicated to God and are the prophets going to move and he's going to dedicate the Tabernacle again he dedicated 30 years ago but now they've done a remodel and it's fitting because now now think of the natural types the spiritual because here now the prophet is coming to fulfill that third pool the opening of the word who is those seals those seals is Christ Christ is the one that opened those seals where is he going to do it he's going to do it in a humble Kentuckian he's going to Veil himself in a man and he's in an unexpected place and he's going to to loose uh and reveal the Seven Seals but then he then you move on a couple paragraphs and he goes you know before I came out here he said I I just married a young couple he says it's a type why because now what is taking place now it's moving into the crowning of his ministry he's now dedicating a a bride he's now marrying what Behold the Lamb of God he's now in this mud bed in Jeffersonville Indiana there's something that's being performed if I could say it like this in a type of wedding ceremony is starting to happen why because it's an invisible Union between the the the the the the Earthly bride in the Heavenly bride room and in an unexpected place at an unexpected time in an unexpected uh vessel in an unexpected man the whole climax of a Christendom uh everything that everybody had been looking for what is it what is that what what was that picture we didn't know what it was about but what was it that's our Lord up there just turn it to the right now what is happening the seals the revelation of those seals are coming and when he preached the first seal he said oh I'd have made a great mistake but but who was there and Christ was there given the Revelation this Revelation didn't come come from a man this Revelation was Christ Paul said I didn't receive this of man I received this of Christ and now what we see revealed there in Jeffersonville Indiana it's revealing Christ and now that message that has been revealed has now come to an unexpected place because now that message has to take on your flesh unexpected place an unexpected time in an unexpected way [Applause] so we we see our our messenger uh in this message preparing the people for something that God's fixing to do and that's the reason that uh it came on my heart to play this message because Satan is making it seem that it's impossible for the word to God to come to pass that's the atmosphere and the environment that he's trying to create he's trying to put up insurmountable circumstances in our vision in our eyes and and and you know so we find out that and he's trying to let this set in all the denominations are turning against them all the doors are shutting down and God's fixing to do the greatest thing that has ever been accomplished in the word of God to this time can open those seals and like he's trying to get us this you're looking pre-pre the event how he's preparing us well if if this was something we had to look to pre the event of the seals how much more now are we sitting in the same circumstance about the rapture how are we going to figure it out how's it going to come to pass where is it going to be when's it going to be and he's telling us look it's an unchangeable God is going to work in an unexpected way you don't get don't let your anxiety blind you you know it's going to happen and so we know that God works in ways outside of the realms that we can comprehend let me say that again God's word and God works in ways outside of the realm we can comprehend and okay so as we pick it up uh we want to build our faith and uh so what what faith do we have to have rapturing faith We've Got to Believe that were part of the rapture and the Rapture is us we got to move from a wait and see I'll jump on it when it comes if he shows no right now do you have to believe that promise is yours and it's going to come a pass in your life in an unexpected way a way that's beyond you figuring it out but you figuring out is not part of the equation you just believe you're a part of it and God's going to bring it to pass in a way that's unexpected so you that could you have and before we continue the last 30 minutes that we're going to listen to listen to this statement this is paragraph 125 we're going to start on 126th no matter what the promise is okay don't matter are you promised a rapture yes you are I'll come again and receive you we'll be changing the twinkling of an eye in a moment we'll be caught up in the air with the Saints do you believe you're a part of it you believe that's your promise do you believe that your hope how's it going to come to pass I don't know but it'll be in a way that's going to be unexpected he says it's yours anyhow no matter what the promise is it's yours anyhow because God gave it to you whosoever will let him come and drink of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely it's yours it belongs to you any promise belongs to you if you have faith to appropriate it and it'll and it'll do it if you'll just believe it now let's pick up the rest and let's keep this and let your faith build because you're not looking of how it is you're just looking at the word that said it would come and you know it'll happen when it helps or if you ask for it you can have but it's going to come in an unexpected way let's finish this message this evening build your faith hold on to God no matter who you are where you are what you are what position in life are it's the word of God's been given to you to hang on to God bless you now but when Jesus came we found out he's born in a manger so right quick the Jews disagreed it didn't come the way he thought they thought he was to come so they just excommunicated him from their fellowship and he was no more in it but watch what he done he when he that didn't stop didn't stop when Pentecost was first born the church is excommunicated you that didn't stop the message right it goes on just the same Jesus can be stopped who can stop God man you can't do it no you could have more do it you could easier stop the Sun but you can't stop God his program's going to move on so it come when the churches back there was praying for a Revival it come in an unexpected way he got a bunch of some one-eyed colored man over here in California and a couple of hobos on the street and things like that and fill them with the Holy Ghost and start the fire there's look where it's gone to now man it's the fastest growing Church in the world they had more Converse last year and all the rest of them put together praise the Lord that's right our Sunday visited Catholic paper said so they registered a million five hundred thousands praise God Glory word sales oh yes people never take down their soldiers amen calls the word of the Living God is burning in their hearts man that's right God's sending them things in different places blessing him bringing them on now let's keep our in mind on the word and on God and keep moving on now don't get it off then I'm we're going to be the biggest grouper we got the best group in the town the best dress crowds comes to our place or something like that and if you get that on your mind you're falling right then yes sir just remember wherever the spirit is they're the living creatures and that's right stay with the spirit of God whatever you do stay with that Spirit now Jesus when he grew up he proved he was that Messiah that prayed for he showed them the his sign of Messiah he proved that he was Messiah by the signs that he did look at the woman at the well when he told her her sins that she had five husbands while she said sir we know when Messiah cometh he'll tell us all things but she didn't know who he was he said I'm he look at Nathanael when he came back with Philip and he walked up in the presence of Jesus and Jesus told him who he was where he come from what he been doing oh my God that proved he said rabbis are the Son of God Howard the king of Israel my sure because what he is proven he was he was the he was not a brought in the way that Israel thought he'd be issued in they thought he'd be a mighty king with a stick in his hand and go out and beat the Romans over the head with it but that wasn't God's way that wasn't even the scripture for him to do it and that coming the next coming is what he's going to do that they got the first and second coming mixed up together so he come then lowly meat setting on a mule riding in and you come out of a the smallest city amongst all the of the big provinces and all the scriptures just fulfilled of his coming the way you come but they fail to see it see but he did the Messiah sign prove that he was Messiah and they rejected it because he come in an unexpected way to them now if they had just been willing to accept him upon the basis that God sent him can we tonight as Pentecostal people except the Holy Ghost upon the basis of God sent it can we expect the Holy Spirit to do what God said it would do anything is that the basis we want to accept it up on or do we want to say oh I believe I receive the Holy Ghost when I believe I'll shook my pastor's hands and I tell you I believe I got the Holy Ghost that's not what the Bible said when he comes he'll testify of Me Jesus said see when he comes now how does he testify uh of of God he testifies it by the life that he lives in You by the fruits you are known you can say well brother Branham I got the Holy Ghost I spoke in tongues I believe that too but if that life don't follow that experience then there was something wrong see you got the wrong thing see but if you got if you got the real Holy Spirit and you spoke in tongues then the life follows it and then if you claim you've had the Holy Spirit and had the experience and then your life don't tally up to God's word then you got the wrong spirit because you can't gather grapes off of a a thistle you know that see and by their fruits they are known and Jesus when he come claiming he was a messiah he did the works of the Messiah amen said if I do not the works of my father then don't believe me that's right that's right but if I do the works of my father then believe the works what a statement same today as he promised in Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever the denominations the great organizations of the world what do they expect when they see a Revival and break in the city what does the denominations expect a great intellectual speech he has to come by fine education swell words and uh Abel with a personality to get cooperation everywhere and uh everything like that in a great big program what do you do get to the altar a bunch of painted face Jezebels that never worship a bunch of cigarette smoking guys that claim to be Christians and they're never straighten your life still as crooked as a barrel of snakes you tell me that that's the Holy Spirit no sir the holy spirit is Holiness and power all the resurrection of Jesus Christ the Bible said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen that is true my brother not no slight but the what is it get a man up there might stammer a little bit and splutter a little bit in his language and misspell some words or mispronounce them and then they say ah there ain't nothing to that guy what about your Dwight Moody one of the greatest you've had since Charles Finney Drive what about Moody he hardly could read his name little old shoe cobbler one day over in his preaching to the cop and he's over in England and he tried to read the Bible he mispronounced it what you gotta think he'd call Philistines Philistines or something some guy worried he made it he went back half the verse he tried it again he thought he'd have time to try to spell it out he missed it again he went back and read the whole thing over and he missed it again close the Bible and he noted them companies were sitting there just it's got to be intellectual to them he closed the virus said Lord God I'll speak with the tongue that you sent me in it he was tore that face-to-face [Music] the tears rolled down his cheeks a newspaper comes to investigate to see why it's drawing so many people and the newspaper come and wrote up an article said why would anybody come to see Dwight Moody he said the first thing he's so homely to look at and so the next thing says he talks to his nose he asks how he hasn't got a good speech and said his grammar is a poor season to nothing and said he's a horrible to look at he's fat and round and whiskers all over his face oh they call him everything nearly his manager come up and said Mr Moody hears what the paper said about she read what it was Mr said why would anybody come to see Moody and Mr Moody just passed off once I said huh sure enough to come see the Lord they didn't come to if they're coming to see Dwight Moody that's different he has to be something to look at brother if you're coming for an intellectual speech that's what you're looking for that's what you expect but if you come to see the power and demonstrations of the Holy Ghost it'll take the power of God out of Heaven depends on what you're looking for what you're expecting not come to church I expect salvation I expect holy people I expect a cleaned up Bunch from a life of sin that's what you expect those that's what God requires but you see how we're letting down the bars oh brother Spurgeon an old Methodist Minister friend of mine used to preach on said we our talk saying about brother he said we lay down the bars we lay down the bars we compromise with sin we lay on the bars the Sheep got out but how did the goats get in letting down the bars right lay down the bar stay with the word God doesn't even get from this one who can not Jesus you are the same one that held the day of Pentecostals filled all the house for the Russian Mighty Wind and clothing tongues of fire set up on them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost that's the same God that we look to see video depends on what you're looking for the infinite God I am God and I changed up he doesn't change he can't change if that's what he give those first expectants back there that's why to give the second expectance that's why to give the third fourth and everyone he calls will be the same name he said I am the vine you're the branches if a Vine puts forth a branch and it brings up grapes the next by or the next branch of that vine puts forth a bear grapes you can't make one by our pumpkins the other watermelons and then grapes you can't do it see it shows it's been cast it's a it's a Vine that's been drafted that's right there's some vinesville or some branch have been drafted into the Vine I was standing here one time with Brother John shared he showed me about about four or five different Citron fruits on a on the um a tree I believe it's pomegranates and and uh I know maybe I'm wrong there it was oranges lemons and tangerines and tangels and grapefruits all growing on a orange tree I said but Brothers John I want to ask you something when they come forth now put forth their bloods again I said is it all going to be oranges he said no each one of the branch each one of the little branches is cut off and put in this tree if it's a lemon tree if it's a lemon Branch it'll bear lemons I said but what if the original tree puts forth the other lamb said it Bears oranges you're right so brother we can bounce ourselves into organization that's all we got we bear organizational fruit s prepare organizational evidence but if you come forth in the vine it'll put you forth a new creature in Christ you'll bear The Life of Christ so help me you will you'll have the same experience they had in the beginning amen I know it's the truth the denominations look for the intellectuals the trouble we Pentecostals we look so much for Russian wind we miss the still small of all I think that's just what it is yes sir it's unexpected sometimes if it ain't got a steal Small Voice in it well uh has it in their way we don't want to be accepted sometimes our real good teaching sometimes it just cut us to pieces and Tony ruffle our feathers up a little bit you know sometimes that helps us a little bit you know that's true it's the truth yes there's something that'll help us do us good now Elijah heard Russian wins and he knew that was God out there or something going by heard it rains everything but what alarmed him was when he come in that still Small Voice you'd see you come in the rain and see him come in the fire even he heard the winds and heard the rain and heard the fire and seen the fire and all but he was alarmed when that still Small Voice came so he put a veil over his face and walked out oh brother that's it what we ought to do is listen way down deep in our heart that we hear the voice of God and walk out on it believe it is true yes sir ah but I wonder today brother if we are failing to recognize yet Among Us the Holy Spirit I wonder if the people in our attitudes today if we don't fail to recognize that this is the holy spirit see now I know to some of you strangers may be around in the camp tonight some people might live a life that you'd be ashamed to live yourself that may be true but my brother's sister they haven't got what they're talking about that's right that is true but don't you never judge for that when I went into India there was a man wanted to prove to me he could lay on spines one wanted to walk in fire I want to do all these things to show what he could do for a nickel or a dime or Penny whatever you give him but listen but he is playing the part of a hypocrite out there but way back in that interior with some honest person most absolutely doing that thinking they were sacrificing to a god somewhere but he was playing the part of a hypocrite we have the same thing it's exactly right some man women just a poor socologist tries to put on and act like they got the Holy Ghost and uh just cause the rest of them goes that way as I was telling you the other night when I first got in the Pulpit on I got up there and I watched Dr Davis preached and I just got exhort his license so I got up there and I thought it was saying you know what I can preach like that too so I got up there and swung my arms the same way he did and jumped up and down the same way he did and I was just saying hallelujah glory to God and Hallelujah glory to God and Hallelujah the glory to God and then first thing you know when it got out from there all the old women around said oh that was wonderful Billy but old Dr Davis sat there and oh law you looked at me like that I said how did you Dr Davis said rotten worst I ever heard oh my did he deflate me so I want you my study tomorrow afternoon at two o'clock I said oh hi Dr Davis I went in and all beat down you know he looked at me said I guess you feel like you never forgive me Billy I said no I want to know why he said when I first started practicing law he said I'll watch the lawyer and that's no doubt for what you've done to me watch me he said because I see you tried to go through every action that I went through he said but you know what so the reason I said the rightness I ever heard he said because you never brought a bit of the word of God you're just crying snorting and slobbering and carrying home and said I never said a thing about the word said and so on he said I got up there and tried to go through and pleading the divorce case and I said this poor little woman poor little woman when I like answered an old attorney set across there and looked like that for about a half hour I got through beating and crying I was out of voice really said the old attorney said judge your honor how much more of this nonsense will your court stand he said I said I went to the old attorney and he told me he said you know what you were making a lot of noise and everything you're you are that all right but said you wasn't bringing any of the law out it takes the law to defeat the case brother that's what I think tonight too it's got to be the same thing brother no matter how much education intellectual and whatever more we got there's got to be some power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost recruit that it is God that will speak up your life that'll perform and do the same life that Jesus Christ did amen promised in the last days that he'd it'd be light in the evening time the prophet promised that we notice the light geographically rises in the East and sets in the West and the same Sun that rises the East is the same Sun that sets in the West we know that's true now why did civilization start in the east that's right it's travel with the sun and now it's at the West Coast it goes any further it'll come back East again the East and West has met civilization we want you to notice this just a minute now remember the prophet said there will be a day that will not be light or dark a dismal league but in the evening time shall be light now I notice it shall be light in the evening time now the Son of God shined his righteousness and power upon the Eastern people about 1900 years ago and there's come a span of time that we've had intellectual teachings we've had a great time we've made organizations we have done great work which is science it's just a dismal day I don't guess you get them here in Phoenix but in the East we get them kind of Cloudy enough light to get around but the sun isn't shining some words shining of course you it wouldn't be light if it wasn't shining but it's not exactly the good sunlight but then in the evening time the clouds roll back in the same Sun that shines in the East is shining in the West then the same Jesus the Same holy ghost that fell back on the Eastern people has come down through the day of organization that's dropped down here in the last days to shine the light upon the Western Horizon the same Jesus the same thing the same loving one he's sure tonight in the form of the Holy Spirit comes he's he's the unchangeable God you just can't be changed no he comes in unexpected ways working and wonders different ways his wonders to perform mysterious ways brother his wonders to perform but remember Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man no one can doubt that but what he said as it was in Sodom now in Sodom that was just before the fire fell and burn up Sodom and Gomorrah and now we're just before striking that Midnight Hour for the second coming of Christ and the world to be destroyed by fire what happened there was three classes of people in that day and there are three classes of people today first there was a sodomite the world there was lot in his people the church formal intellectual type and there was Abraham and his group Abraham and his group sitting up there they elected and called out Church remember now there was three groups the sodomites sinful Wicked world like today there was a church member lukewarm Cole lost his group there was Abraham the called out of it was sitting out here in the desert taking the hard thing right and the Lord came down in a form of a man the speaker of these three angels that stood now someone asked me said brother Branham you don't believe that was God I said it was God they call us now listen Abraham called him capital l-o-r-d and any scholar knows that that's capital L O R D is Elohim which is God he said well how would he ever I said he said God eaten I said sure I said God just read sure we got a handful of uh cosmolite and whatever more we had to get together some petroleum and Cosmic light and and some calcium and potassium step in there Gabriel step in that Michael and stepped into it himself he's God you fail to see who he is he's the unchanging God I'm glad I've got faith in him tonight that someday when my life my body with his 16 elements so be back in the dusty Earth but he'll say William Branham and I'll come forth free of the breath of life and do it today you'll bypass the birth of to my mother and so forth like Jesus on his first miracle he turned water into wine eventually it would have been wine but he bypassed all that procedure and said turn the water to wine at the resurrection you'll not see Mr Miss Brown get married again and bring forth William you'll speak and I'll come forward that's him he's gone sure he did walk down there before Abraham and watch what he did now remember they was going down two of the angels went down and preached in Sodom is that right they had a meeting down there but what did they didn't perform too many uh Miracles but what did they do they smote them sodomites blind and now we've got them same Angels preaching to the church Farmall today of Billy Graham and so forth and what this blind world is the word and preaching the word is a blind the unbeliever but watch this elected called out church this angel that spoke there to Abraham he's not remember his name had been Abram until just a few days before and his wife's name have been Sarah s-a-r-r-a but he God had met Abraham in a spirit form and it changed his name from Abram that Abraham from Sarah to Sarah I now watch this angel dust on his clothes and he said Abraham where is your wife Sarah I wonder Abraham must have said uh my leading was right I just felt something that fellow was different he said he said she's a tent it's behind you there how do you know he had a wife how do you know what his name had been changed how do you know that she uh uh these conditions said I'm going to visit you according to the time of life how do you even know Abraham was married where is thy wife Sarah he said no watch I have that personal pronoun there I'm going to visit you according to the time of life you see who it was you see who it was and he said um and Sarah in the tent said how can I she laughed in other words little snickery will fall self said now look how can I have pleasure again Abraham was 100 years old and the Bible plainly speaks it out there now that there were both well or old in age and the way of Sarah had been gone for a long time Abraham his body as good as dead and her womb have been dried up and dead for years I'm going to visit you according to lifetime of life and you're going to bring this song I noticed foreclosing and Sarah laughed at how could that ever be me as old as I am have pleasure again and my Lord also I notice that's the little L there Lord Abraham him being old also and the angel said why did Sarah last oh my God I remember Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah and in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man what is it it's God the Holy Spirit dwelling among human flesh in these Sanctified vessels that the son of God's blood cleansed by faith and God dwelling in these vessels performing and carrying on the works of Jesus Christ making him the same yesterday today and forever if we are baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body then we become the body of Christ then we're resurrected with him when he raised up we raise up also in the resurrection with him because he is the head and the head and the bodies together then today Christ is in the church in you and his works that he once did Saint John 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also amen Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever see there people don't expect it to be that way they expect this to be a bunch of uh literary people don't even know what they're talking about they believe it to be some a bunch of dummies well we we might be in the sense that they're talking about but we accepted the Holy Ghost the way God poured it out and got the same results that they had back there so it proved he's the unchangeable god we get the same result amen my old mother when she was dying she said Billy you've been I baptized her many years ago she said you've been kind of a spiritual God to me Billy I said mother you know our people are Catholic now I said when I first know that God was the god I noted all my life from a little boy but a lot of people never went to church and I went out and talked to the priests and he said this is a church this is a way I said well the Bible could I said now you get all confused see this is the church God is in his church you must believe the church well I went over to the lutherans and they said we are the church we're the body Believers one of the methodists to say we're the body believers and went to baptist they said oh they're all wrong we hear that I thought what is going on here a church is a body of people and this one says this way this and says this way and this way and that way and that way something's got to be wrong so I said I went right back to the Bible mama and read just exactly what that first church did and the way they did it that's the way I did it too and got the same results it's gone that's good enough for me as long as I got the same results I see the same Jesus I see the same God that worked in the Old Testament in the New Testament down the pre Nicene Council he worked in there until the coming of the Roman Catholic Church that accepted dogmas instead of the Bible went out through the Dark Ages and come back through Luther Wesley and down here and the lady was seeing Church agents I'll be like in the evening time God will pull out a church there will be and seeing the same Holy Ghost by the same promises doing the same works and the same things blessed be the name of the Lord r the unchangeable god amen or give you the same holy ghost that he gave them there without a change he'll do the same things that he did when he was sure on Earth that any man or woman that'll believe it and accept it if you've got the Holy Ghost take a hold of it like Jacob did and hold to it until positive results come amen believe it for him and at a unexpected time and maybe an unexpected place but if he'll do it at an unexpected Place how much more should he do it tonight in an expected place where we're expecting this didn't happen it's bow our heads just a moment while your heads are bound and I trust that your hearts are bowed too this scares me for keeping as long as I have till nine o'clock but I'd like to ask you this question you know we may never meet again daylight may never come in the morning for some of us and if it would be so that we'd never see another break of days would we meet again beyond the river would there have you the peace and the in your heart and the assurance a scriptural assurance that these people have talked about tonight that when you met God you had a scriptural experience God changed your life completely and now you're not just the same person just rebuilt polished over but you are a new creature a new creation in Christ if you're not that way we have no standing at the altar room but I'd like to ask your sincerity if you would desire that I'd offer prayer for you here from the pulpit knowing it someday I'll have to meet you again and meet my words that I've said tonight would you with all with their heads about in the eyes closed would you just raise your hand and signify with that pray for me brother and I I I want to be that way God bless you and bless you bless you young lady God bless you outside anywhere put your hands against the windows wherever it is God will be just raise up your hand and deem sincerity and say God be merciful to me I I have always wanted to be that way brother Branham but somehow another I've just never been able to get that oh precious friend won't you take a hold of something believe me as his servant the holy spirit is right don't let no one ever talk you away from it hold to God's unchanging hand Christian friend if you've just joined church if you've just been baptized and water and having yet been baptized with the Holy Spirit you've never been actually regenerated now you say brother Branham I I spoke with tongues I I did this or did that now I believe in that too I told you but remember you could dance in the spirit you could speak with tongues I've seen the Hindus do that I've seen Witch Doctors speak in tongues interpret it and I've heard I went into a camp on time where there's some brothers went in there and seen a table tap out in tongues and a pencil will come and write none knowing tongues and then read it all see all those things that's that could be the devil but brother if you do speak with tongues and then you continue to live the life that you once lived then there's something wrong with your experience if you have got that just the only thing you're leaning up on is speaking with tongues don't you try that you'll go over the falls and that boat will never stand up to it but with a poor Larry's tongue they shall cease where there is prophecies that shall fail but when that which is perfect has come all that love of God so rich and pure fabulous and strong then these other gifts will work right in with it see that's gifts of the holy spirit that's given to you speaking in tongues prophesying and what more interpretations that's to edify the church for the edification of the body but first receive the holy ghost that you see that your life has changed now it's been about eight or ten hands grew up since I've been talking would there be another before all for prayer God bless you lady well God bless you Sister will there be someone else just put up your hand say and deem sincerity brother Brandon remember me God bless you there brother someone else just say pray for me I can only pray for you my friend God bless you lady and God bless you their sister now he sees your hand remember Jesus said he that heareth my words believeth on him it sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but has passed from Death unto lion we must believe that with all our heart just believe it with all that's in you and God shall take care of the rest Heavenly Father we now give this little audience to you these broke up nervous spoken words tonight Lord standing here with a feeling of those people standing there their Liam's aching God I claim their soul the best that I knew how Lord to bring the word my poor humble way what little seed was in it father sow it in the hearts of them people and I claim their soul that it shall not be lost yes Lord but it will appear under that day at the resurrection our God there's no other God but you the heathens has images we have a living God the only true Living God we can think of you father setting out on eternity Millions times brighter than a 10 billion Sun oh God shine forth you who could make the worlds but their great solar system in the skies and then come down to save a sinner interested enough to be here in this little Tabernacle tonight with these Christian people or Jesus give us the word that wherever two or three are gathered in my name I'll be in their myth now say these people father that's all I know to ask you I believe that you'll answer my prayers and I pray that tomorrow they'll be right at the church and ready for baptism even yet tonight if they've never been baptized I pray that you'll fill them with the Holy Ghost let them hold on to this real truth of God until Death Shall Set them free in Jesus name I pray amen foreign ly hope tonight that this message encouraged you to be sincere and if you have any questions in your heart or your mind about whether you have the Holy Spirit I think that there's a couple statements I'd like to say it says we what we ought to do is to listen way down deep in your heart till we hear the voice of God then walk out on it believe it is true yes sir until that really that questions settled way down in your heart and he says well your heads are bowed and I trust that your hearts are about to excuse me for keeping you as long as I have till nine o'clock but I'd like to ask you this question you know we may never meet again daylight may never come in the morning first home of us and if we would be so that would never see another break of day would we meet again Yonder at the river would there have you the peace and in your heart and the assurance a scriptural Assurance as these people that I've talked about tonight that went to meet God you had a scriptural experience God changed your life completely and now you're not just the same person just rebuilt or polished over but you are a new creature a new creation in Christ Jesus if you're not that way and and you know it's not something that can be answered anyplace else but within your own heart he said if you desire it then ask for it stay there and tell you're assured it he says it's it's not the rushing wind is this still small boy Act and the experience is still the same God changes lives he's still cast out Devils he still delivers he still does everything he's he's unchanging he can work in unexpected ways and he can work in unexpected people he can feel it all of us any of us any person here with the spirit of God but we never want to lean so much to the intellectual side that it's just the intellectual conception of the message the message was Jesus Christ born in our hearts and the hour we're living in a lot of counterfeit that we have to fight our way through but we can't be fools to compare ourselves one with another is something we all have got to make sure in our heart and it's got to be a desire of your heart and it's the baptism of the holy spirit is so individual that it can't be compared to anybody else's experience it's your baptism it's your birth it's your marriage it's your union with him and if it's something that we can't Tarry any longer to make sure we've got to make sure and I felt we saw the message so beautifully laid out and how The Messengers reached out for the elect because the elect is going to receive this birth going to receive this baptism and they're going to have these signs and wonders following individually and and I hope tonight that that um that we never let the message as the word of God seeing it and recognizing it and knowing its truth become a substitute for our own birth experience and like I said you can't compare it to anybody else you've got to know that something in your heart has changed you and if you desire that if you're calling for it in no wise will he turn you away he said it's whosoever will come drink from the rivers of Life freely I invite you to invite the Holy Spirit into your life God bless you let's stand together this evening our musicians will come I know the messenger made an altar call and and I hope you responded as I did for the need you have but we just like to give you an opportunity once again you play God's unchanging hand and to just excuse but if you're not sure you have the Holy Spirit you might have it and not be sure because it's such a mental battle but if if you know that you don't have it and you say Lord I believe the message I believe God sent a prophet I believe everything I hear him say but I just haven't had that scriptural experience Lord where I've been changed and and you'd like to lift your hands up and say Lord would you come by in my life it might be an unexpected way I'm not trying to produce any way that it'll be I want you to do it but I want to have this experience I want to have it settled in my heart forever that I have the spirit of life and Truth and I want to know it surely father not to anybody else around me not any evidence Lord but that personal evidence of you giving me your spirit in changing my life and you'd like to lift your hand to him to say say Lord I really want that baptism I really want the question answered forever in my heart I want it to be so deeply rooted I'll Never Be Shaken from it even if I fail if I sin if I fall Lord I know that spirit will rise me up because I know I received it from a gift from you if you would like to do that tonight and ask it and if you ask it be leaving and no wisely turn you out but you may the way it just said in your heart and may you continually to reach out and hold to God's unchanging hand oh time is filled with swift transition [Music] s foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] okay [Music]
