[Music] [Music] amen good morning it's a wonderful day and and we thank the Lord and I I hope you enjoyed your new parking spot this morning and and we trust the Lord will just continue to bless us uh we have a special little presentation from our Sunday School uh class this morning and they've worked hard on it and I know you're going to be excited to enjoy in this uh wonderful time of Fellowship as we want to teach a child in the way it should go there's a lot of voices out there today um many of the parents that have children in school are facing all the new ideas and new thinking and so many things that they're trying to direct our children too and our Sunday school teachers and our Sunday school helpers and everyone involved want to point our children to the truth which is God's word and God's gospel and his son our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so this is a great effort to get them involved and for them to realize that they have Fellowship one with another and that's a great sign of what Christianity is they will know that you are my disciples by your loveed one for another and when the kids can love one another and work together I think it all builds to what that we're building for is just to have a a real Christian attitude and spirit of love and forgiveness not looking back but always looking forward so let's at this time let us just stand together and and uh we're going to ask the Lord to bless us and then uh we'll start start our our little uh program this morning let's pray together our gracious Heavenly Father your son so loved us that he laid down his life for us and today Lord we come to fellowship and participate in worshiping you and presenting with our lives and our hearts and our words that we believe in you and our desire is to follow you and to be what you would have us to be we ask you to bless our children father as they've worked so hard father may they reap the benefits of their effort this morning we thank you for the parents Lord Jesus now we commit this into your hands as we enjoy your love for your children in jesus' name we pray amen God bless you all you may be seated for [Music] e [Music] [Music] [Music] all [Music]

expected your name Bailey blots Bailey blots let's see Blitz blotman blubber sorry no blots but I'm supposed to meet some friends inside for dinner I'm already late I'm sorry ma'am you can't come and dress like that regardless of who your friends are what's wrong with the way I'm dressed this is the red side Fellowship you need a red tie to come in that's ridiculous it's the rule nobody get to the red tie Fellowship without a red tie I don't have time for this I'll miss my meeting here this ought to help you look the other way while I slip in you can't buy your way in ma'am I work for the richest man in town bribes mean nothing to me do you know who I am you just said you were Bailey blocks have you forgotten who you are no I mean you don't know who you're dealing with I'm friends with the mayor and all the city councilmen know my name so let me in before I have to tell them you disrespected me ma'am the owner is richer than all of them and it's no respector of persons no amount of contacts can get you in without a red tie nobody gets in the red tie Fellowship without a red tie look I can get a red tie later but I need to get it right now my friends are probably waiting at the table for me right now go ask them they'll vouch for me it won't do you any good ma'am no one inside has any influence on who gets in I don't believe this I really need to meet with these people my financial future could depend on getting this contract won't you give me a break hey I donate to Charities all the time I'll donate to one in the fellowship's name that's very committable ma'am but it doesn't get you in look I'm just as good as any of the people already in there better than some even it's not fair if you let others in and keep others out on the contrary our Ru is the only fair way to let anyone in it makes everybody the same since they only get in by virtue of wearing the red tie just get out of my way report me once I'm in trying to force R in his feet out ma'am I'm much stronger than you just try to stop me please don't do that ma'am you'll only hurt yourself no one has ever gotten through me around me or past me no kidding you're like running to a solid stone wall what do I have to do to get in nobody gets in the red TI without a red tie yeah again you're real big on repeating that one thanks for nothing pal Haven't Seen the Last of Me Mr high and mighty doorman enjoy not you ma'am you can't get in the coils of others well you can't let my girl for trying can you it's been tried before ma'am and don't even look for and don't even try to look for a back door in this is the only way inside thanks for the tip but you won't be getting one for me I need a red tie but how do I get one real quick aha if I can't find one I'll make one myself oh gosh oh my gosh ew leftover meatloaf tie out of this but this ought to get me in hope nobody smells me though this old piece of crummy cloth really stinks hey man kept the rules I've got a red tie I I'd hardly call that a proper tie ma'am hey I made it myself that ought to show you I'm trying even more than if I went out and bought one doesn't my effort to keep the rules count for anything ma'am that rag is filthy and smelly all it does is your inability to ABY by the rule your own efforts count for nothing all right I've had it what's your name Mr D ma'am where's my sorry I lost my pen whatever I might have left it at my house but whatever um spell that for me d e l a w I was holding it okay weird um St that for me again sorry d e l a w all right I'm reporting you to the manager I'll have Justice it's Mercy need ma'am not Justice we'll see get me the owner or manager I want to speak to him very well um are you the owner my father's the owner I'm the manager to get to him you must first come go through me Bailey this is Mr King the manager of the redti fellowship Mr King this is Miss Bailey blotz she has a complaint she'd like to speak with you about a pleasure to meet your BL how can I help you thank you for coming out to me since I couldn't come where you were I'm happy to do it um and that's the problem I can't seem to get past Daw here under any circumstances Daw can be a bit intimidating at times but that's his job he must enforce the rules to the letter and keep out those who don't me the requirements but I can't meet the requirements and I need to get in you're the manager will you please tell him to let me in well Bailey I can't let someone in who don't meet the standards that' be unfair to those already in who did but you run the place you write the rules yes and I'm going stick by them nobody gets in the red tie fellowship with that a red tie in fact not just any old red tie but a special red Fellowship tie made by me well how can I get one can you loan me one no we don't loan them can I buy one from you you couldn't possibly pay what it's worth this is insane how does one get into your fellowship if I can't if you can't loan me one and I can't buy one from you or anyone else then what do I do you must simply ask ask that's all that's it these are wait a minute the wait a minute it can't be that easy not after all that these red ties are too costly just to be free true they are not free but a high price was paid for them but I am paying it and giving it to those that ask as a gift it's too easy there must be a catch I don't believe it well you must believe it if you are to ask and receive it otherwise you'll never ask if getting a tie so easy why didn't D here just offer me one he could have gotten me in right away D has no ties to give all he can do is tell you that you need one so ask and you shall receive don't you want to check my background see if I'm worthy or something your background doesn't matter to me it's forgotten helping you build a bright future is my place that sounds too good to pass up but almost too good to be [Music] true all right I give up may I have one of your red ties please I like to be in fellowship with you of course Bailey but once in my fellowship you're not but once in you're not just part of the fellowship you're part of the family yes this is the beginning of a wonderful relationship [Music] wow thanks so much now everyone will know I'm a part of this Great Fellowship I'll wear it with pride not Pride Bailey wear it with joy then everyone will ask where you got it from and then you can introduce them to me and they can get a red tie of their own that sounds great I'll do it come land Bailey your friends are waiting welcome Miss blotz enjoy that's children God God provided way if the children of Israel would had to try to bypass go around down this way they have got in trouble they had to follow the cloud of fire the pillar of fire that led them they

realize the great importance of your word this morning help us father we just need you and we ask you to just take us from out of the way and let the message that you've given us stand before us by its own Merit by its own Vindication we ask that with all of our hearts this morning in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen uh God bless you may be seated for a moment this morning certainly um thank the musicians and everybody that so labored and um um you know for all our musicians Sunday school teachers deacons and trustees and our sound booth people and our uh interpreters and everything we have a little something for you after service if you would try to get with us uh that would uh would be wonderful uh we all we want to remember Matthew and Andrew in prayer because they're fixing to head off to Roma Romania this evening and we trust that that would be a a great blessing uh for you but I was asked this morning and and I'd like to do this uh we have a new family that's come to be with us uh they were from moved south from Oklahoma but originally I believe they're from Brazil and uh it's uh brother Thiago and sister talene and uh um uh pedosa I believe if I got their name right uh where are you if you are you here would you stand up so and their children go ahead and stand up brother and sister God bless you thank you so much amen they said brother we want to be introduced to the congregation we're this is our church amen well that's your brother and sister so now uh now you're obligated to take care of them I'll preach the gospel you take care of them amen is that the way that it should work it if it's wonderful so uh we're really grateful uh for everything that God's done I I'm not used to being behind such a small Podium I I take shelter and being surrounded but uh uh we're going to try to go forward in the word this morning uh on the subject line that we've talked about and uh uh brother BR makes a statement he says uh you know I have a lot of things to say and some of them are very flat he said so he he asked the sisters he said please take this with understanding well I think that's what we all want is our understanding uh increased and and to grow so uh we're going to go through the word of God sort of as a Sunday school lesson uh maybe try to put a little evangelism in there and a little preaching in there and just trust that when it's all said and done the Lord is present with us and that we wouldn't do anything to keep him you know the scripture said he didn't come with enticing words but Empower and demonstration of the Holy Spirit I would rather see lives changed and people delivered and their hearts set a flame than anything else there's none of us perfect in fact the scripture says that our righteousness is as filthy rags and all of us come short of the glory of God but as we saw in our skit today day because of that Crimson thread that tie that binds us is the blood of Jesus Christ we all have hope and this is given to an age of the Overcomer and if we didn't have something to overcome then we couldn't be Overcomers and it's given to the Overcomer to sit with him in his throne so we have to realize that there's a great struggle set before us and that there's something that we have to overcome it's when we fail to realize that we're in a battle and that life's a constant Warfare when we begin to take things for granted and we don't realize the importance of what is taking place that's when that we become lukewarm and we begin to shrink back but the scripture says leave those things which are behind behind and press for a higher calling and there's a great High Calling that lies before us all this morning and that great High Calling is the rapture the Rapture is the most important thing on our agenda you do not want to miss the Rapture the Rapture is in important would uh you give me a little bottle of water please the the Rapture is important so uh is it underneath oh they hid it from me okay thank you the Rapture is important in other words you don't want to be here for what's going to take place after the Rapture but you don't want to take for granted that you're just going to be there you understand amen you you you want to you want to make sure you want to make sure you're in the spirit you want to make sure that you've been borned again Jesus's First Gospel that he ever taught was you must be born again and we're going to go through that this morning why that we must be born again what is it mean to be born to again what is the battle that we're facing and I'll tell you okay it's bad when you don't when you're in a battle and you don't know it amen but we want to fight for our lives we want to possess the gates of the enemy we we want to put on the whole armor of God we want to fight a good fight we want to run the race that's set before us that's what that's what our our heart's desire there's no big eyes there's no little use We're In It Together there's nobody that's been paid for more we've all been purchased if I could say or Redeemed by the same price and we want to make full uh take full possession of our Redemption this morning so as we go forward forward we just ask that you could be attentive we're going to listen to 15 minutes of a a sermon this morning we're going to speak on it we'll try to move along so it's not too long this morning because of of the the play but let's stand together and let's turn over in our Bibles to one scripture and I think this is a a glorious scripture for our day that we're living in and it it's it's found in Matthew uh the 13th chapter and the the 35th verse the 34th verse reads like this and these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in Parables and without a parable spoke he not unto them now you see the importance of Revelation that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying I will open my mouth in Parables I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundations of the world Hallelujah Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word to us in your precious name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated we talked a little bit uh last Wednesday night on the import of the word of God the word of God is the most important thing in our life it's the only thing that's truth my word is truth let every word of man be a lie but my word is true there there's no other truth but God's word and uh without the word of God we have no way of knowing the truth Jesus said I am the way the truth the life no man cometh under the father but by me there there's only one way and there's only one way that we know him is that through his word you you know him by the things that he spoke and I'd like to read this statement to you so you can understand that that the word of God either you're judged now or you'll be judged someday but the scripture simply says these things and I'd like to read this out of the message uh the spoken word is the Original Seed he says now the word of God continually goes on so ever since it was spoken it continually goes on it doesn't stop it doesn't change it remains ever the same and it continually goes on the word of God is going on going on we read the same Bible this morning that the uh uh that they read for hundreds of years the same scriptures and yet every time that we read it it becomes fresh to us it becomes new to us because it's living word amen man changes but the word of God doesn't and because God's word's Eternal he could speak it in a way that it would meet the challenge of any hour any time any place that word of God is good uh we talked about and many of you have done the same thing how that we've read our Bible over the years and we'd Mark scriptures and write scriptures down and then you find yourself in a different time of life a different situation in life and you might come across a scripture that you read in the past and yet now that scripture takes on new life for you because the word of God is Not history the word of God is the revelation of a living being it's the way that he continually reveals himself like any relationship you you seem to grow and and you seem to know one another and think one another and you grow together and and and your relationship grows you just don't meet somebody and you know everything about them and that's the end of the story no it it's a wonderful in fact the word of God tells us it'll take Eternity for him to reveal himself so the the word of God is is what that we have to Anchor in in fact we know that faith has to have a resting place it has to have some place that it can anchor to some place that it can hold to not a feeling not an emotion not an excitement but it's got to be a promise and every word of God is a promise because there's one thing that God can't do and is God can't lie so if he says it it's true if he says it that's the way it's going to be that that's that's what we we realize that that's why the word of God is so important that's why we emphasize the word of God we don't emphasize emotion we don't emphasize anointing we don't emphasize rain because the rain falls on the just and the unjust but we emphasize the maturity of the Believers Faith to Anchor in what he said and and to believe that regardless of the circumstances and the surrounding things and and whatever happens in history and whatever happens in time what God Said will remain so we don't want to turn from the left we don't want to turn from the right we want to know for sure what it is and I don't want to follow man's interpretation of the word I want to follow his word because he is the word in the beginning was the word not in the beginning was a an emotion not in the beginning was an anointing you know great artist in the world great uh rock stars and writers and actresses and all those things they come under the anointing of the part they get if we could quote unquote they get in the spirit of the role he didn't want us ever to get caught up in that he want us to know one thing it is going to be the way that he spoke it Hallelujah if you have to wait on it you wait on it yes if you have to battle ideas and mental battles and everything you battle it but what he said is the truth now listening to how important the word of God is so we just read this one little paragraph here the word of God continues on I'm told that if we could pick up an instrument that could catch it that a man's voice my voice that I speak today 10,000 years from now could still be picked up in the air it's like dropping a pebble in the middle of a pond and and the tiny little waves after they fail to be seen by the eye continue on till it hits the bank and the airwaves of our voice continually travels around and around the world therefore then our voice what we say will be our judgment now we're going to hold that cuz remember he spoke to us in Parables that the things which forid the secrets from the world are now made known he says then our then our voice what we say will be our judgment Our Testimony will rise up against us our own voice will be echoed in our own ears at the Judgment bar of God when his great instrument catches every voice that's been spoke every word that's been muttered kind of makes you think of that scripture the tongue is an unruly member and can bitter or sweet come forth from the same Fountain now there's only one way to stop that voice that's wrong that's repent amen there's a lot of voices in your life a lot of Temptations things that keep coming back to you that you find yourself repeating and repeating and and you try to make things right and you try to do things different but that Voice keeps tempting you it keeps calling you it keeps leading you into a Temptation it keeps leading you into into a failure and and and and you you purpose within your heart I'm never going to do that again I'm never going to go there again I'm never going to look at that again I'm never going to do this again but you'll never stop that voice until you repent that's the way that what must we do to enter the kingdom of God repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin for the remitting what does that mean the taking away when you've remitted a bill that bill no longer on your charge it's paid for but you can't bypass repentance doesn't have to be a public show but get some where with God and say God I'm sorry and if you've offended somebody don't be ashamed to say I'm sorry I was wrong I got a little feisty with the uh with a uh somebody on the phone the other day concerning an account and and and I mean I wasn't unchristian but you know I could have been a lot sweeter whole lot sweeter and so I went back over there and and uh you know I I I thought they done me wrong and you know they charged something in my card that I wanted to pay with a check and and I didn't tell them to charge my card and they were going to charge me 3% and and and on you know let's just just a little background so I went over to pay it and I I walked in the door and I thought you know I'm going to go tell that person I'm sorry so I went in and I said you know I'm I'm sorry I got a little feisty oh you know you oh don't worry about it I totally understand we appreciate your business you're you're really one of our best customers you know wow that's the fruit of repentance don't let things go that you can repent of I say that to you as a friend I say that you as a pastor keep things right make things right the scripture says the scripture the word the secret Mysteries says don't let the sun go down upon your wrath if you offended your brother go before you bring your sacrifice and make that right make those things right repent of those things keep your slate clean because what happens if you repent it goes before you right and he's faithful and just to forgive you to throw it in the sea of God's forgetfulness not to be remembered anymore that's the kind of God we serve that's the kind of love we serve but he wants to see something from you that makes it appear that you believe in what he said amen your actions speak louder than your words but yet your very words will judge you let us continue and now there's only one way to stop that voice that's wrong that's repent God Alone can stop it if it doesn't it goes on to meet up with you in eternity now just think of all those things you said if you don't repent what's going to happen it's going to go on and meet you in eternity but if you repent what does God do he stops it you don't have to carry the past God Alone can stop it if it doesn't it goes on to meet you up with you in eternity therefore God therefore God being perfect and his voice Eternal his own voice will have to catch up with it therefore he must be perfect in every decision for when he once said says something it has to go all the way and come back to the Judgment let's just look at a couple scriptures real quick Matthew 12 and 36 what are we talking about the word the importance of the word word how the word Works in our life what the word of God does for us he says but I say unto you that Every Idle Word that man shall speak they shall give account therefore in the day of judgment there's word for word for by thy words thou shal be justified and by thy words Thou shalt be condemned let us turn over to Matthew 24-35 Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away so now we just read this this paragraph right and we're coming back with scripture after scripture you will always find that the way of a true Prophet is the word of God now we don't know always how what the interpretation of the word of God is but when a prophet interprets the word of God he brings us back to the word of God that we see that it says exactly what it says Now isn't that exactly what we read let's read St John the 12th chapter John 1247 and 48 we're talking of the importance of the word because we're going to go look at what does the word do for us why do we have to have the word not a sensation not an emotion not a running not a shouting all which is fine but none of that does anything for you comes and it goes the spirit is like the wind right it lists here for a while and it goes over here for a while and you don't know where it went you don't know but what's the one constant that should remain in every believer's life that's God's word because the word is him if he is in you the word is in you amen is that simple it's so simple but we got an adversary who is the father of all lies and there's what no truth in him Thy word is truth so what does the one thing our adversary lacks the word not knowledge not stimulation not explanation but the word the pure true unadulterated word of God we're trying to establish in our hearts this morning the importance of God's word amen yes it's the word the word back to the word how many times did the voice of this generation cry out to us back to the word the only thing that's going to do the job that's right if any man hear my words and believe not I judge him not for I came not to judge the world but to save the world he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judge him the word that I have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day so he said I'll judge no man but my word will judge him in the last days so you understand what judgment you're heading for you're not heading for the Judgment of your good works you're not heading for the Judgment of the evil that you've done you know it's you can't go through life think you're going to weigh out your good with your bad and and my bad counsels this out and and all this you know I like in our little play right they tried to buy the red tie what could I do to get it no there's only one thing that's going to meet you there's only one thing you're going to be judged by and that's by the word and we all are going to come into the Judgment so wouldn't it behoove us with common sense that if you know what you're going to be judged by then that's what you want to line up to you can't present nothing else because if you try to present something else you've altered the word of God the word of God said we've read three scriptures that what we're going to meet is what the word his teaching his judgments because the scripture says that my judgments are true so we we want to settle that as we move forward this morning that what that we're wanting to set in place here is the word the importance of the word and why that we need the word and and so as as we look at I'll make a few comments we'll listen to a few minutes of tape and then we'll finish as we try to set up the tape so we understand understand that the the importance of the word of God because we've got to have something that meets the condition of the hour right we know that the scripture tells us in the last days perilous times shall come men shall be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God they'll be deceivers their conscience will be snared with a hot iron you wonder how can people commit the crimes that they commit today how can the evil roam because they've rejected the word of God and their conscience has been sneered with the hot iron in other words their conscience has been sealed up in them so no longer there they have no consciousness of what sin God help us that we we come to a place that we don't have any consciousness of sin the only thing that gives you the consciousness of sin which is unbelief is the word of God Amen not an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but if someone Smite the on the left cheek turned to him also the right if a brother compels you to go a mile go Twain if he ask of thee land not seeking to borrow again oh I tell you what we need we need the love of God we need Christianity we need to be born again we need to be led by the spirit of God we're getting away with way too much come on I would talk about weak pulpits but I'd put myself under condemnation it can't meet the condition of the hour it can't meet the challenge of the hour we're in a challenge right now Satan's challenging you he don't believe your bride he don't believe you're married he don't believe you have an invisible Union if Satan made job prove it what makes you think you're getting away SC free he said if he didn't judge this generation for their sins he'd have to raise Sodom gamor up again ain't no Cakewalk it's a battle it's a war Satan goes about like a roaring lion seeking you may devour that's right what are you GNA do think he's some kitty cat kitty kitty kitty kitty oh nice kitty you know what he said about that Pentecostal kitty cat oh you can p One Way long as you're petting it the right way well you run that hand back up against that word you run that word be bad if we started getting in that condition right where we couldn't take correction anymore we couldn't take instruction anymore we're too ashamed to admit that we're wrong I'll tell you you're not ashamed to admit what's wrong if you know what's at stake why hang on to a Teddy a petty Pride why hang on to something that's going to destroy and and take away your reward let every man build on but let let every man watch how he builds righten that his Works aren't destroyed I don't want to be saved by fire I want to be saved by love I want to be saved by his spirit I want to be saved by his word I don't want to come into the Judgment it won't meet the challenge of the hour in other words they're not prepared for the deception Satan uh appears to have they're not prepared for the deception because Satan appears as an angel of Light oh all these good works you think he shows up with a little Pitchfork little forked things and a little tongue oh no he's a sweet talker all he's after is to get you to reason all he's trying to get you to do is second guess all he's trying to do is get you to think twice let me explain to you what he meant he meant what he said did he ask you did you feel it did he ask you if he understood it he asked you one thing do you believe it if you believe it plant it in your heart it'll grow it'll produce life so they're not ready for the deception that Satan has to offer the deception of Satan is H breeding right amen that's what his deception is to hybrid something what does hybrid mean it means the mixing of two different elements or species to produce something different it's the mixing of two different things what did Satan in the garden mix he mixed the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil the mixture of Science Education civilization trying to mix it with the word of God the word of God does not mix the deception of the hour is hiting mixing what is the process that Satan uses to mix things reasoning people don't like a clearcut line they always want compromise well let's take a little of this and let's take a little of that if you compromise the recipe you don't get the product you get some something different it might taste good it might satisfy it might be sufficient but what is it not it's not the original that's right that's right and the only person that can tell it's not the original is the person that created the recipe in the first place and when they look at it said this don't have the Tex texture I design this don't have the moisture I design this don't have the flavor I design this don't have the look I design this is a hybrid something else has been mixed in here Satan's deception is hybriding and let me say this this morning I hope I don't sound angry but I've got to press myself uh to to say what's the truth you can hybrid by taking away sure you can it doesn't it you leave something else you leave something out the original product has been hybrid it's going to produce something different you're mixing so many of the ingredients but you're not fixing all the ingredients therefore to take the word of God you've got to take what all of the word of God not part of the word not the part you like that's what's wrong with the church the Baptist they've taken the part they like the Pentecostals have taken the part they like but if it's not all of it me say it again if it's not all of it it's not what original know people say no I believe I I I believe everything prophet of God said I'm not hybrid let me tell you something you leave out communion you're hybrid you've perverted the recipe all you people that are on this tape and in this church this church ought to be this fied on communion night you know why it's not you're hybrid and you don't know it you're not living the word of God and you don't know it you've come up with reasoning you've come up with excuses maybe you don't want to face communion and the Judgment that comes with communion but if you're not taking communion you will not God be there have your own hybrid religion try to get in on your own formula try to get in on your own reasoning and your own righteousness I have given you example that you do as I have done come up with your excuses I to call you on the phone on communion night instead of this is a pastor calling I just want you to know you're on your way to hell you can't say that I didn't say it Jesus said I will not judge you that's where everybody's at today oh Jesus won't judge you're right he come to save you but by rejecting his word youve rejected his salvation and he said he who Rejects My word will face judgment no foot washing hbd no Malachi 4:5 no Luke 17:30 no Revelations 10:7 no Reverend Milt William Mariam Bram the seventh angel to the seventh Church age the prophet of Malachi 4:5 hybrid you're not preaching the word of God for the hour you're not preaching the gospel for the day that it's in you're not preach the gospel for the season that it is you're preaching history and not the Living Word of God the Gospel of Jesus Christ who is the word amen so we hbrd by taking away now I'm obligate I'm not I'm just as guilty as anybody I'm not up here on AA horse I've already read that the words that I speak are going to meet me at the Judgment Day how many times did I st hear the prophet of God stand before with this Bible before me which will meet me on the Judgment Day the words that I tell you will meet me on the Judgment Day there I've always asked the Lord Lord I'm going to be judged for a lot of things but I don't want to be judged for not speaking the truth thank you so we don't want to we don't want to hybrid it mix it that's what we've got to get out of our Lives the mixing of Politics the mixing of the world the word of God will substain the elect I've never seen the righteous beg bread that's the word of God Will Supply every need to his elect lady we don't have to compromise to hi you can hybrid by taking away but what do we want to do we want to get back to what will take us back that's what we're trying to do we're trying to get back to what will take us back the only thing that will take us back is the word of God the word of God the importance of the word of God so there's got to be a solution because all of us are born hybrid did you know that I can prove it I'll pick somebody I don't always pick on I always pick on Beno no I might as well pick on Beno he's used to it you're hybrid you came into the world speaking lies you were born in sin shaped in iniquity how are you going to get out of that condition can you get yourself out of that condition no sir no CU there's no truth in you that's right you've got to be borned again something has to give you the birth may I say this and I'm sure everything I'm saying some intellectual will challenge me but you won't challenge what's in here you have to be born again for the age that you're born in that's right Noah's message won't work John the Baptist message won't work Moses's message won't work you've got to receive the birth that meets the challenge of the hour you've got to meets the birth of this age the birth of this age is the word of God for this age not another age not an age gone by but it's got to be the word for the age and it's got to be a spoken word an original word in that message that we read the meanest man I know he said Jesus preaching he might have said something like this he might have said see really your lives are hybrid the father said don't touch the tree but Satan said it won't hurt you don't touch the tree it won't hurt you you can fix it later you're predestinated your name's written on the Lamb's Book of Life you got to prove your name's written on the Lamb's Book of Life I can go down the street all I want say I'm 71 and I play for the LA Lakers you're going to look at me and say you're 5'6 and you're not coordinated enough to play for anybody my actions are speaking what louder than my words I can make the Declaration we got everybody making declarations we're the bride of Christ well if you're the bride of Christ you're married to them you're in a Union with them you're in a fellowship with them and you're producing his seed his right his his children are his attributes Christ Living in you Christ in you the hope of glory if the Same Spirit be in you that was in Christ Jesus it shall Quicken your mortal bodies your doctrine's not going to Quicken you your associations not going to Quicken you your your your voice isn't going to Quicken you it's the Born Again life is the only thing that can Quicken you you must be born again and you must be born by the word of God after seven ages of deception and four horse riders God finally has a voice that can birth the church and this is what he said Jesus might have said now in order to get back to the original God has to speak again that's what he does when he gives you New Birth what does God have to do before you can get new birth is not bring you to a remembrance of what took place on Pentecost but in order to get a new birth he has to speak again that's what he does when he gives you the new birth your old life is gone and you're back to the original word of the Lord the only thing that can k give you what's original is what's original right cuz anything that mixed what dies that's right is that right can't breed itself again let's just read this before we play our our message and then you'll see I could have just played the message and not spoke but I spoke for myself he says you're back to the original word if you're not not your hybrid into Church's denomination but when God speaks his peace and the Holy Spirit then you're back in the original family of God again when God does what speaks let me tell you there's a great deception in the land today and it's a new birth with out the voice I don't care how spiritual they are to say I'll Stand Here on God's word you cannot be born again in this day because Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God and every other voice except for the voice of Malachi 45 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10:7 under the anointing of the prophet of Malachi 4:5 William Mary and brandom is hybrid and it produces death now if that's too big of a reproach for you many are called and few are chosen every Revival produces twins it's always cut in half it always has been and it always will be isn't that right two Adam and Eve Eve was the first hybrid it mixed their first and from that mixture you're all born in sin shape and iniquity come into the world speaking lies and you all die the only thing that cannot separate you from death is a spoken word that's I am the resurrection the life the truth no man cometh unto the father but by me Adam and Eve Abel and Cain Joshua and E Jacob and Esau Moses daythan and cor David and Saul John the Baptist Herod Jesus and Judas five wise five foolish you must have that he said but when God speaks his peace and His holy spirit he speaks his holy spirit into you by the word that's right you say well how did they get the thing in the upper room they did what he said go there and carry amen until you receive power from un High I will not leave you comfortless but I personal pronoun the word will come to you and be with you and in you and lead and guide you into all truth and righteousness for this Spirit shall not speak of himself but he shall bring you into remembrance of everything that I said Hallelujah aren't you glad you don't have to rely on your flesh aren't you glad you don't have to Rite any emotion aren't you glad you can take him at his word and it settles it amen he said and you're back in the original family of God again you don't have to be baby then you're a rugged Christian who can stand it you know sometimes we have to stand our own failures our own angers our own weaknesses I've stumbled at things in my life for years and years and years but where else could I go th alone has the words of eternal life I wanted to give up but I couldn't I couldn't overcome and I couldn't give up all they could do is just sit there and cry and plead and ask one day he spoke and I accepted it and I could walk away not by power not by might but my by my spirit sayith the Lord whatever it may be because the word of the Living God is burning in your heart and soul what's burning in your heart and soul an anointing a rain what's burning in your heart the word of the Living God that's what leads you there is no such thing as the leadership of the Holy Spirit outside of the word of God no such thing it is the Holy Spirit the holy spirit will not deny his word burning in your heart and all can backslide and can turn against you and everything else but that won't stop one thing that rugged word of God stays right there when he spoke that original voice into your heart you are mine let's go now for 14 minutes and I wanted to lay enough background so you won't miss this next 14 minutes the original is the only thing that will produce the original we've got to get back to what will get us back let's just listen I I think you'll be blessed he goes very slow and that if if we went this far in this book today we we would oh I wanted to read this's sorry I I skipped this but I'm going to read this once again about meeting the challenge of the hour if the brothers would get ready oh oh man here we are blessed be the Lord now we come to the body to be the bride of Christ and now to be his flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone right that's what we've all want to do we want to go in the Rapture he is the resurrection we about to be a part of him to be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone and now we'll hurry up now flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone why didn't ask you a question why didn't all your reins back Yonder bring the bride to Christ I want you to answer that if it's outcoming and it's overdue we believe it like it was in the days of Noah longsuffering he's getting his bride re ready why didn't these rains why didn't you Pentecostals back Yonder a few years ago when you started 40 or 50 years ago why didn't you bring Christ the bridegroom to the bride I'm going to let that soak in a minute why because you pregnated yourselves with your denomination that's exactly what you've done he won't marry a he'll marry a virgin it's flat but that's the truth you know it in a flat way you don't have to wonder I don't stumble around about it I tell you the truth why didn't you bring her why didn't you bring Christ Christ bring Christ to her because she's not fit he found her in adultery exactly the reason children don't live forever when they're born Adam found his wife pregnated that's the reason Jehovah had to take a gentile Brown bride found her pregnated that's exactly the way Christ has to get him a bride now he found this so-called group pregnated he's going to seow his seed somebody's going to get it because they're predestinated to be a church on the end time Road what does he have to do he's got to sew his seed may you enjoy the next 14 minutes God bless you now that's why we believe it and it is the word of God therefore God's spoken word is original and everything that God created spoke into existence is original and you can hbed some of his creation secondarily that's the reason Eve could do what she did with her own seed because she wasn't in the original creation amen she's a byproduct of the man not in the creation of God God created a whole things and then he took a part of his creation and made a helpmate that's the reason you can H bre a donkey and a horse but it won't last it's death but the original has got life it comes back again I hope you can see it now the original has a life so that's the reason I think it Cults and denominations and organizations die history proves are everyone dead and never did rise no more and never will they can't breed themselves back got nothing to breed with they're sterile that's why e children dies I'm taking my time so the tapes give people time to study I don't want to be in any hurry amen amen I want to just take my time I don't know what'll happen from here on but I I want this to the people that even though someday God take me from the world if I don't live to see is coming the message will still live on Tru stay with the word now remember every spoken word of God is the Original Seed God planted everything in the Earth by his word and as long as you stay with the Original Seed it will breed itself right back and and reproduce itself again hybrid it it dies and Eve the woman was the first hybrid thing that ever was I I hope you don't turn tapes off till we get out and prove that after a while see show you just why she was a h breeder a bride notice through that brought death through trying to take the word of God and mix some wisdom with it you're not supposed to do that whether you believe got wisdom to explain it just say God said it and that setts it and God said so and that's all there is to it if you can't explain it leave it alone but just say it's so because God said so that's God said it now notice now it will not mix it must not be tampered with God will punish the one that do it and it will not HB to nothing else it's God's word alone God don't need your word with his we're not supposed to speak our own word we're supposed to preach his word God's word now therefore true life can only come or reproduce itself by its original breeding see life I keep now study that now when you're studying the tapes and study it now life l i f can only be reproduced by its original breeding the way it started at the beginning then it reproduces itself it doesn't it's a hybrid it runs out some of them run out in the first generation see it's gone right then it'll soon find itself back it can't bring correct life because it's hybrid Genesis 1:1 the Bible said Jes God said let every seed bring forth of its kind now when God said that that settles it it's always settled let every seed bring forth of its kind to mix it brings a super crop it's a super crop of what listen now that's Coast to mix it I'm trying to hold and such text I could preach on it but I'm trying to keep from doing that to mix it will bring forth a super crop as is proven but what kind of a crop a crop of falsehood death H breed your corn it brings forth a big crop better crop better looking but it's dead PL it back can't reproduce itself again it's done it's finished like Eve see she brought forth a hybrid crop look at us today and you can look look around and see that's true sure did it wasn't God's purpose no sir just have to hold back for something I'm thinking right now see to mix it brings forth a hybrid crop and a hybrid crop is a dead crop forse rebreeding it won't rebreed itself it can because God said so it has to bring forth of its kind and you've mixed it now you can see the church right there where we're we're wind up it dies there for it cannot bring forth of its kind why it's mixed you can't do nothing with it it's dead it's finished all right that's why each generation has its own Revival a chance at the word so The Sovereign God Amen amen that's the Judgment John Wesley's group are raise up and these starw methodists of the day will answer for Luther will raise up the Catholics will raise up from back behind irenius Martin polycarp and those I don't have to stand the J judgement for Hing the word of God to dogmas this group of Lutheran that followed Lutheran's Revival will answer the same thing the group of Baptists the follow John Smith's Revival will do the same thing Alexander Campbell will do the same thing and the Pentecostals will do the same thing that original Revival when the Holy Ghost fell called out a people and God trying to get his word to it and they organized instead of over here and denominated and died right there you say but look what they're doing we'll get to that little later on today we're coming right down to all the I'm just putting the seed in now now we're going to show after a while what happened now that's why each Revival has its own Revival each generation has its Revival God raises him up a man sets him with his word and starts him out for the message for that that age and as soon as that man's taken off the scene somebody else catches it and H breeds it it all falls back to a perfect everything may I can stop here for a minute we ain't no hurry no see go back that's exactly what it started away in the beginning in Genesis God set forth his crop of human race and Eve hybred it see what happened so there's a judgment for Eve Luther set forth all the rest Christ set forth the apostles set forth the prophets set forth didn't Jesus say which one of you has not your fathers persecuted the prophets God saying didn't he teach that a king one time sent a servant and then sent another servant and sent another servant and so forth then finally sent his son see each generation receiving C it's repeating right back to e e Adam and Eve again the first the Garden of Eden half of them lost wise virgin sleeping virgin half of one kept the word other hyb it right back and forth just as hard as it can go right like it's been right down through the age we'll prove it by God's word and by the history here that's right High breeding High breeding first started in Eden started in Genesis it's a beginning that's where it ends up over here in Revelations that's the second coming of Christ I remember correctly that's why each generation has its own Revival it gets a chance at the word then they hre instead of taking on they door somewhere else my mission and I believe that God has called me far I I have to say some personal things today because that's what I told you I do Amen to tell the world my mission I believe to the Earth is what is to forerun the coming word the coming word which is Christ and Christ in him has a millennium and has everything right there because he is the word all right Jesus said in John 3:5 now if you want to mark that down John 3:5 we all know it or either I'll turn and maybe somebody on the tapes would might not be able to turn just at that time and I'll read here uh in St John the 3r chapter and the fifth verse and we'll see what Jesus said we might start off just a little before that third Jesus answered and said unto him verely verely I say unto thee except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God gone Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered verily I say unto you and to thee except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God is that a seed every spoken word of God is a seed that's right I'm going to prove that just minut where Jesus said so every spoken word of God is a seed then except a man be born again why must he be born again he's dead with the fashion he's in he's a h he's got to be born again why he was born in Sin from Eve sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies he's a liar to begin with no matter how smart educated what more he is he's a liar the Bible says he is how holy his parents was or anything about he's a liar to begin with and the only way he can tell truth is say what truth is to his own lips that's the only way truth can come anything contrary to that word he's a liar yet that's pretty flat but that's what God Said let every man's word be a lie and mine be true amen see anything that comes from his lips contrary to deny this word or put it in some other race or some other generation or whatever it is he he's a liar it's exactly he's got to be born again then he sees every word the only way he can be born again is that life of God in to produce that it's the tape is 6 hours from 45 minutes long and now was just 14 minutes you see the importance that hybrid started and what's it still trying to do and Satan appears as an angel of what light mixing mixing mixing mixing but God raised up an angel with the true word of God and every generation gets a chance to hear the word of God don't miss your chance the only thing that can breed you back is the original the original doesn't mix God doesn't need anything but his word amen so we we we we we now I believe have a a greater understanding of the battle that we're in we have the whole world preaching their righteousness their idea their system their way of doing things what they think is important and yet there's one little small true voice in a little man of no seemingly reputation of no background not born of a system not born of an organization but called by God meant by an Angel of the lord caught up into the third heaven to receive the Mysteries and things that have been kept secret for all generations and break The Word of Life to you this morning let's not let this word become common it's our life it's our life this morning live by the word let the word correct you let the word lead you let the word guide you the Holy Spirit if he wants to lead you will always bring you to the word so you have some place to Anchor your faith and I we could stay on these things for a long time but what's our strength this morning the word of God God bless you let's stand together brother Billy would you come do you love them this morning Thy word is truth Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will not pass away oh God's word so solid amen I hope it stir your heart uh Peter said let me stir up your pure Minds by way of remembrance that you might add these great virtues to your life that you might stand in the Statue of a perfect man we don't want to miss the Rapture the Rapture is everything to us this morning let's bow our heads in prayer maybe we'd ask you this morning I ask myself Brother David is there things in your life that are mixed in there even worse are there things that I've been calling the word of God which aren't the word of God Lord I I we all need uh purification the scripture says to purify Our Hearts by the washing of the water of the word father and I just pray that we would all understand here this morning that you said my sheep hear my voice and another they won't follow Lord we're confident in that and we are asking this morning that the deception of this hour is the mixing of civilization education and science trying to mix it with the pure word of God and produce something that'll make a Rapture and Lord we know it won't only the original can breed life back again and father you've given us a chance to hear that voice to be born again to take this isav of your word to take gold tried in Fire and white rainment Lord and make ourselves ready for the wedding supper Lord I just pray that each of us in our own hearts and in our own minds and in our own lives will'll do a self-examination will we ask ourselves Am I Living For That Rapture am I trying to make full proof of my salvation or am I just kind of in the middle of the road am I just kind of lukewarm Lord you told us that if we're lukewarm you'll spill us out of your [Music] mouth Lord we want to turn our hearts to sincere dedication we're not ashamed of the gospel of this hour because it's life and Liberty and salvation in Christ Jesus and it'll do everything that it said it would do father if there's one needy of your spirit this morning they' like to lift their hands as my hand is lifted and my head is Bow and say Lord I need your word to come Purify Me I need your word to separate things out of my life that I know are were not Rapture worthy Lord we don't need a emotional outpouring in this building or we don't need to have it happen here for it to be real we want it to happen in the Realms of our life we want to see it Blossom forth in the life that we're living resurrection and truth and true word living out of us Lord we preached the gospel this morning we've backed up every word we've said with the words of the messengers in the scriptures father it's been established in the mouth of two or three witnesses that Satan's deception is hybriding and the only that'll bring us back to the original is the original the only thing that can breed life is the original word and in this day the Revival of this day and the voice of this day is the message of the hour to
