========================================

[Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] god bless you welcome to the house of the lord let's just all stand this morning we're going to write by the mic to come at this time and take the service in prayer and do our psalm reading this morning as we just get started excited to be in the house of the lord this morning do you believe he can speak to you i mean i came with the expectation came with specific expectation so when we get out of here we can practice what we preach amen [Music] good morning let's go ahead and have a word of prayer and just commit the service to him father we love you and we always appreciate every opportunity to gather together in your name lord knowing that we gather under a promise that we're even two are gathered together lord in your name you're in their midst lord and it's because we come bringing you lord this building is an empty building you don't dwell in this building lord but you dwell on a people and lord when they're gathered together it's the fulfillment of the promise that lord it's the fulfillment of your desire that you would dwell among a people and within a people and we lord we're grateful for the opportunity to come together we want to be careful to commit the service to you we want to welcome you into this place lord this is about you this isn't about us lord we come to learn of you lord we come to fellowship with you we come to worship you with the lift of your name lord that you would be glorified lord and we pray that your will would be done in all things from the very beginning of the service to the very end lord that you would be glorified in all things that every need would be met lord in that year we would go lord leaving this place lord as the scripture said is that did not our hearts burn within us as you talked with us along the way lord we look forward with expectation to what you have for us today and we pray these things and commit the service to you in jesus name amen amen we're going to go ahead and read psalm 87 this morning you know and it's a it's one of the many passages of scripture that speak of zion you know i i assume by now that we realize that zion is not a city or a place on a map that you can go visit not a historical or an archaeological location but you know zion is both a people and a dwelling place you know it's as we've met read many times through the psalms it's where he dwells and it's where a people dwells and it's where god can cohabit with his people together in fellowship and in one accord you know and it's described as a city it's described as a mountain but it's always spoken of in the feminine as her she you know psalm 87 is no different and it's just every time we read one of the psalms that talks about zion you get just another little glimpse into what zion who zion is it says in verse 2 of psalm 87 it says the lord loveth the gates of zion more than all the dwellings of jacob it's his favorite place it's not a jewish place more than all the cities of jacob this is something he loves more it's his beloved it's his most loved in verse 3 glorious things are spoken of the o city of god you know zion is the city of god it says you know the song we're marching to zion the beautiful city of god it says in psalm 46 4 there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of god which is the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high it says in verse 5 god is in the midst of her feminine she the city of god shall not be moved god shall help her and that right early zion the city of god shows up again in revelation 21. verse 2 and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and oh by the way that river shows up again in the next chapter in revelation 22. but you get a glimpse of zion the city the city of god the holy place his most favored place it's a she it's a bride it's a people a special place a chosen people you know we're not marching to zion we are zion it's not a place we're going to it's a place we've been called to it's a place that we find ourselves now if we be in him psalm 87 verse 4 it says there's an interesting passage in here just kind of caught my attention just want to look at this just for a second it says i will make mention of rahab and babylon to them that know me behold philistia and tyre with ethiopia this man was born there you know here the scripture is mentioning all these examples of of cities of great mighty powerful cities and kingdoms you know these are places of great commerce great military might great riches great influence maybe centers of learning some of the greatest kingdoms and cities in the world and how it might be an honor for one to be able to say i'm from that place i was born there my citizenship is one of these great kingdoms and how it might be looked at looked at in those days as you know a badge of honor oh he's you know he's he's from tire you know a lot of money a lot of influence there i bet he's well connected where this one might be from ethiopia that had great armies in that day and man he's he's got the whole backing of the whole country behind him and how it would be a great badge of honor to say this is my citizenship this is my passport this is where i belong this is where i was born it's the same in our day you know people might say i'm an american be proud of that citizenship and of that heritage and being able to get that passport in america being one of the greatest nations on the earth and people all around looking at that or you might be from france and say the same thing about your citizenship and your passport and your heritage and your national identity and how there's great pride and great but you know there's another citizenship there's another passport there's another heritage that is more favored than all of that says in verse 5 and of zion it shall be said this and that man was born in her so there's a birth in this kingdom as well there's an origin in zion as well while people may take great pride in being part of this nation or that nation or being able to get their citizenship here or have this badge of honor of being part of this culture or this nation there's another kingdom there's another city that you can be born in as well which is more favored that's a citizenship that's a heritage that's a passport that's more favored than any of the great kingdoms of the earth favored nation status if i ever heard of it it says in verse 5 and the highest himself shall establish her you can't work your way into this kingdom that's right he establishes your place in zion by birth and it is a more favored citizenship than any of even the greatest most powerful most influential most wealthy nations on earth zion city of god most favored city beloved the holy place a bride adorned as her husband how interesting that in psalms already being able to describe the importance of zion the importance of being a citizen of zion of being born into that most favored place you know last thing is verse 6 the lord shall count when he writeth up the people that this man was born here is there any that can say that they have been born in zion not your choosing but his you didn't bring any credentials you didn't bring any qualifications you didn't pass a citizenship exam you didn't learn have to learn how to say the pledge of allegiance you didn't have to learn how to speak any kind of language by his own choosing he caused a birth to con occur in the most favored nation so as i was reading psalm 87 it just struck me how if you desire his citizenship anywhere if you would seek heritage to be proud of anywhere if there's ever a kingdom where you could have most favored nation status the backing of the most influential the most rich the most powerful zionist kingdom and you can say they've been born in zion this morning when i read this i hope you do as well this is me speaking of zion so that's what stuck out to me this morning if you want to read uh think of that as we read together in psalm 87 just a short passage his foundation is in the holy mountains the lord loveth the gates of zion more than all the dwellings of jacob glorious things are spoken of thee o city of god selah i will make mention of rahab and babylon to them that know me behold philistia and tyre with ethiopia this man was born there and of zion it shall be said this and that man was born in her and the highest himself shall establish her the lord shall count when he writeth up the people that this man was born there selah as well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there all my springs are in thee amen amen god bless you you may have your seats i sing the song this morning is the lily of the valley the bride and the morning star amen i found a friend in jesus he's everything to me he's the fairest to my soul oh [Music] my [Music] hallelujah [Music] he will never

just all stand as we just invited brother matthew to come at this time and as we're ready for the word let's just sing that song to this morning called surely the presence of the lord is in this place amen surely in the presence of the lord is in i can feel his mighty power and his grace i can hear the brush of angel's wings i can see on each face surely [Music] surely the presence of the lord is

your blood [Music] [Music] oh [Music] it's greater than all [Music] amen all your sins all your disappointments the blood's greater prophet of god said that the only provided place of worship is under the shed blood of jesus christ and that's how we approach him this morning we approach them under the blood that was shed for us and because of that blood we can have boldness to enter in to the holiest of holies oh just layer go ahead and lay your faults down and your your failures your sins maybe maybe you had the wrong attitude on the way to church that's why we have a little time of singing a little time just to prepare your heart as you approach the throne [Music] start looking inwardly for a moment if you haven't already done it and start pleading that blood i believe that if as a body we can come in in the same unity on one mind and one accord we can see the supernatural in a way that we have never experienced it before scripture says the prayer of a righteous man availeth much well if the prayer of one righteous man availeth much how much more two three four five what about the expectations of the bride of jesus christ coming to be gathered together together the prophet of god said that when we brings our licks of fire that the pillar of fire settles down in our midst [Music] he said that he sends the angel of the lord for those that fear him the angels are encamped about them where two or three are gathered together in my name there i will be let's just approach them with that type of expectation heavenly father how we love you this morning [Music] our creator our king our savior our redeemer our lover lord you've done what no man can do you had power to lay down your life and power to take it up again the life that was in that blood that you shed you have sent back upon your believer that we could say greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world lord the world tries to tout itself as some mighty something in the nations and the political realms and satan's kingdom and satan's eden oh it's just a bluff they have no power over your word or over your bride because we stand victorious father we thank you now as we come into your presence we thank you for each one that has been able to gather themselves together those that are streaming those that are sick and body father all the needs that are represented we commit it to you now we claim that precious blood that was shed and ask all these things in the name that was given to men to be saved by no other name was given under heaven but that name the lord jesus christ we ask it amen praise the lord as you're standing let's just turn in genesis chapter two just remember brother david and sister leslie as they're still in san diego um visiting my grandma his mother and so we just pray that god would uh bring them back safely amen i was just being a little light-hearted with the brothers there in the back right before service i was telling them i said hey all hail is fighting against this revelation i hope you all came with your swords drawn and ready to fight but i don't know about you but i didn't have the the best week you know we we've been we've been fighting in our body we've been fighting in our health you know ever since wednesday the devil's been fighting and uh the family getting sick and i i was just i was laying in bed this morning i couldn't fall asleep the devil just attacked me in my body and it was about five o'clock in the morning and i know some of the brothers were praying and and i just agreed in my heart i said lord i agree with the brothers that have been praying i believe i agreed together with the saints and i started to speak the word and i i just the very things that was on my heart i was saying lord let this be a reality for me and and i even just felt my sinuses and things just kind of release a little bit and and i was just struggling to be able to talk and all these things and and uh i said the devil's defeated the bride of jesus christ has come together this morning and we mean business amen so let's draw our swords and read out of genesis chapter two we'll be reading verse seven and continue to pray we're weak in body we we feel strength uh uh um maybe lacking but but that's nothing that god cannot make up for so we look to him in our and ourselves we are insufficient but in in god we can do all things amen genesis chapter two verse seven i would read like this and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul notice it says that he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul heavenly father we ask a blessing upon the reading of your word lord we ask lord that you come now and myself lord i'm just a man but we have your divine promise in your word lord by divine gift by your elected chosen that you're here to break the bread of life as only you can in christ's name we ask it amen you may have your seats you'll just also turn in your bibles with me to job 32 just like to read the first eight verses there and remember brother billy as he also isn't feeling well there's been things going through maybe passing around and just been pressing the battle amen well glory to god i pray you come to have church job 32 it would read like this first eight verses says so these three men cease to answer job because he was righteous in his own eyes so we're picking up in the story of job where job has lost everything every everything has been stripped away from job and now job is sitting on the ash heap and now even his comforters and even his friends that are coming to him they're basically just telling job he's a secret sinner i mean joe ain't nothing right going for job i don't know if anybody's ever felt that way where nothing is going right you feel like you can't even get a break i'll never forget one time i was driving down the road and i was going off to do a bid when i was living in arizona and i and i jumped in my truck and i started to drive off and i was like oh man i i i left my my my my workbook so i go back and grab my workbook and i i start to leave and then i left my cell phone i go back i i left my cell phone i start driving off and i realized i left my wallet and i said give me a break that still small voice said haven't i already oh oh i said lord forgive me lord forgive me but sometimes we feel like nothing's going our way and as it continues on here it says then was kindled the wrath of elijah the son of barachel the buzit of the kindred of ram against job with his wrath kindled because he justified himself rather than god and so you know just immediately reading the scripture who is this elijah you know job is is god's prophet job is god's elected these things have beholden upon job and now here this young man a lie who is rebuking job he says he goes and also against his three friends so he's also a liar who's lighting them all up he's like i got something to say to you job i got something to say to you three who is this young man says also against his three friends which was his wrath was kindled because they had found no answer and yet had condemned job notice they had found no answer so these three messengers these three friends uh that are coming to job in this and this this great uh uh uh a place that job is sitting they have no answer and so elijah is starting to to to speak and he and he says now elijah had waited till job had spoken because they were elder than he and when elijah had saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men then his wrath was kindled in elihu the son of barack of the buzai answered and said i am young and you are very old wherefore i was afraid and durst not show you mine opinion so that this this man has wisdom about him he knows he's sitting before his his elders and look we know that that that that uh i mean job was a wise sage that people bowed down to him in the marketplace so i believe a lie who is recognizing his position and who he's talking to and he knows that this is job i know who job is so so i am not going to share my opinion but it would seem as he starts to speak here something is taking place that eli who has a purpose there's something that he has to say because he said look i was not going to show forth uh my opinion i said days should speak and multitude of years should teach wisdom but there is a spirit in a man and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them understanding so we just want to start to draw and i i just want you if you can by the help of god take these two scriptures look at genesis chapter 2 and notice it says and and he breathed into his nostril the breath of life and man became a living soul and you find i want to tie these two scriptures together in job 32 8 it says but there is a spirit in the man and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them understanding the prophet of god would say oh my it's hard for me to keep peace lord help your interpreters and help me now when a man is inspired and he reads the inspired word now i want to speak to you a little bit this morning on when the inspiration strikes when a man is when when a man is inspired and he reads the inspired word the two inspirations together gives the result now you can never no matter how well you study the word it'll never do you no good till you're inspired yourself it takes your inspiration with the words already inspired so what we need today i believe that's today not 1956 not tomorrow spiritual food and due season so what we need today is an inspiration over us god sweeping down with a new inspiration what did our pr our pastor talk about opening on our understanding he said if if we're going to continue to move forward then our understanding has to continue to be opened right so then god sweeping down with new inspiration and breathing over us his power and his love and himself that it might inspire us to quicken us and awaken us to his word and then the word being brought into that spirit of inspiration then you'll see miracles happen and things take place because the two comes together i don't know about you but i want the two to come together this morning i want to be inspired i want the inspiration to strike i want to take the inspired word with the inspiration of the holy ghost and have them to come together and i want to see cripples walk i want to see people delivered i want to see people healed i want to see the presence of god move amongst the assembly i i want to see this this this inspiration of god over my life and god sweeping down with a new inspiration and breathing power upon my life that i can wake up and put one foot on the ground and say oh oh god uh give me a new inspiration this morning may the power of god be breathing upon my life as i would go forward and i would step into the room and i would be having the thoughts of god upon my lips and i would i would be speaking the word i would be thinking about my brothers oh by this you shall know uh that you are my disciples by your love for one another not when you just you show it in public not when you just go out there and meet them but but oh you can show your love to your brothers and sisters without them even knowing it when you get on your knees and you start to pray for them you start to call out to god you start to call it oh god or would you breathe the power of god upon their life i want to see deliverance lord i want to see their lost ones saved lord oh if you'd be so pleased to do it lord i'm interceding on their behalf lord with a love let that love of god let that power of god breathe into your life let those attributes of god start to flow through you start to manifest the spirit of god oh we want to have this this this new inspiration and this power just breathing over us when inspiration strikes we look at here in our opening text here the church had accused job of being a secret sinner his comforters and the one that had come to uh uh uh job these three messengers that had spoken of their rebuking job for being a secret sinner and and job is like you know the integrity of my heart you know i i i constantly constantly besought the lord and all of these things that befallen me but here his accusers uh friends and comforters of him these these three men that have come a liking and the messengers are rebuking him and they're telling them oh my you know uh you're a secret sinner so you see they don't have the right approach they're condemning job see they don't have the full picture maybe maybe they have a portion of the picture uh maybe these men are wise i don't believe that they would have been in the company of job i i think they had a right to be there i think they were in his presence and joe maybe allowed them to come i don't know but just thinking of that they didn't have the whole picture there and so here he's on his ash heap and and and they're they're they're rebuking him for being a secret sinner but you know the prophet of god said job just kept sitting on the ash sheep job was waiting for the inspiration and i find it interesting here in the scripture as i was pondering this thing here comes this young man who and he comes to start to to rebuke job and he starts to rebuke the the the the the three men sitting there and and and elijah was this messenger he was the fourth one that was speaking but he was able to speak the word and and a lie who he started to correct job see but the prophet of god points out that elijah was not correcting job as a sinner but he was actually correcting job because job was was being selfish and and and because of the way that he was accusing god so so ellie who was speaking now from a portion where elijah had a better picture he had had a better understanding because oh i think it behooves us to start to think of who was this allahu that was speaking the prophet of god said oh someday i would like to break it down to you who this eli who was because elijah was christ so there was a word that was coming forth through a lie who that was speaking to job and what was going to happen as this fourth messenger started to speak to job what was starting to happen it was starting to pull job towards a revelation it was trying to pull job towards an inspiration and as as he started to speak to job something started to happen there was a spiritual revelation or a whirlwind started to come down there was something starting to break upon job because now he was going to come into an inspiration he was going to come into a revelation because here a lie who a representative of christ was showing job look oh i know you're not a secret sinner i know the integrity of your heart but look these things that have behold befallen you oh you can't accuse god god has a plan god has a plan for your life i know you're going through hard times i know you're going through hardships i know it looks like you don't know how you're going to make it you're not going to make it out of this child but god is speaking to you and tell you just hold on the inspiration's coming the revelation is coming i know in the trial it's so hard for you to maybe see the word being manifested in your life but i got plans for your life i got big plans in your life you are actually manifesting my very attributes in this trial just keep holding on job just keep holding on brad i have something for you the prophet of god would say and i i i take much inspiration for what we'll share with you this morning i have heard but now i see oh my we we we had a powerful service wednesday night i have heard but now i see we went up to the youth meetings here uh just a week or so a week ago there and i believe there's some young people that can say i have heard but now i see is that right i have heard but now i see i i i i've been hearing all my life i i've been hearing my mommy and daddy i've been coming to the church i've been hearing you talk about a prophet i've been hearing you talk about revelation i've been hearing about you talking about being changed i've been hearing about you talking about being delivered i've been hearing you talk about the holy ghost i've been hearing you talk about god sent a prophet i've been hearing you talk about this power i've been hearing you talk about this transforming power laying in the seed i've been hearing all these things i i've gotten a little education i've seen maybe the church and and maybe the way some of the people act and maybe some of them disappoint maybe some of them i look up to but i'm doing a lot of hearing but oh there comes a day right brother christian where all of a sudden god comes down and he touches your heart and he changes your life and you can stand with the revelation and say i have heard but now i see oh taste and see that the lord is good a lot of us have done a lot of tasting you've been tasting of other people's testimony you've been tasting of the church and the atmosphere in the church but i want to tell you there comes a time where jesus will put the foot on the brow of the ship and say peace be still where you can say oh i have tasted but now i see for myself i have the revelation of what it means to be changed well help me preach this morning don't be afraid this won't hurt you god comes to do business god's here to speak i have heard but now i see so here job he's sitting on the ash heap he's waiting for this inspiration job is a prophet and now a lie who this representative jesus christ now bringing words through him drawing job to this place the prophet of god would say and then at that time it was when the inspiration struck him that's when the lightning began to flash and the thunders began to roar that's when the inspiration struck the prophet and he raised up and he said i know my redeemer liveth and in the last days he'll stand upon the earth though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i see god can i get a little more just a touch more volume i know my redeemer liveth and at the last days he'll stand upon this earth though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh i will see god whom i shall see for myself all i want to say my heart's desire this morning is that the inspiration of the word of god will strike your soul here job was sitting upon the ash heap but he was waiting for the inspiration i believe there's an inspiration and understanding to be opened up to your morning that this morning that'll strike your soul and that can change you and lift you into heavenly places you know i think of the story there where elisha that there's a little ring if you could take it down just a notch where elisha came i believe to joe ash and said hey joash i want you to go ahead and shoot this bow out of the windowed eastward i want you to shoot this towards the way when jesus comes in i want you to go take that arrow now what was it that was the arrow of god's deliverance and so now joash was holding i believe it was joash he was holding the arrow of deliverance there and now what is the prophet going to do they take that word take the arrow of deliverance take that holy ghost take that what god has given unto you and now i want you to take that inspiration and i want you to strike the ground and now what did joash do he started to strike the ground one time two time three time and then elijah and then he stopped he said oh my why did you only strike it three times that was the arrow of god's deliverance that was in your hand you only struck three times so now you're going to have to continue to put up with your adversaries oh the prophet of god said that's exactly what the church has done they've only struck three times i think some of us have only struck one time as we ministered a little bit maybe maybe you've been justified maybe you've struck in the inspiration has struck you that you believe in jesus christ but i want to tell you wait there's more maybe you've struck twice and you're and you're and you're you're starting to live a sanctified life but i'll tell you there's more keep striking you you now have the arrow of god's deliverance keep striking maybe the baptism of the holy ghost is now uh cleaning up your life and and you're living a sanctified life and now that holy spirit is coming in keep striking you have the arrow of god's deliverance that was the complaint with the churches oh uh they camped around justification they camped around sanctification they camped around the outpouring of the gifts but the church didn't keep striking well praise god there's a bride that has received the arrow of god's deliverance the holy ghost and they're going to keep striking is there somebody that wants to take the message of the hour and keep striking look keep striking church don't be satisfied with where you are you have the arrow of god's deliverance so if what's on my heart oh the inspiration can strike you just keep striking church look it's time to take back what's ours this is a restoration message and the arrow of god's deliverance is the holy ghost and the holy ghost is god's agent to say give it back that's what the restoration of the bride tree was is where those those death messengers came and they and they tore down and killed out the the church to those four roman devils oh god started to restore back and what is the agent of the holy ghost it's the enforcer we have the enforcer here this morning we have a right to go to that devil and say give it back somebody needs some joy this morning give it back if somebody needs some peace give it back does somebody need their children give it back what do you have need of what are you looking for keep striking the arrow of god's deliverance look the holy ghost is here this ain't fancy saints this is a reality go ahead you have a right to enforce the word of god you want your brother get your brother you want your sister claim it stand in the gap for him oh that's what the holy ghost is it's the enforcer to enforce upon satan the claims that god has given us i don't know about you but that gets me excited i i mean that's what we need we need the inspiration to strike i think there may be a greater atmosphere in the church when we hear these things i mean maybe if the officers of the land showed up with their badges and said hey i'm going to take you down to the bank and with all the withdrawal the money and give it to you and i have a court order from the governor of texas and and you were able to see with the five senses the reality of the enforcers here at your behalf to take you down to the bank maybe you'd get excited but if the inspiration can strike you if the revelation can strike you that god is here when the inspiration strikes you that you're free when the inspiration strikes you that you're delivered when the revelation strikes you that i can do all things through jesus christ that strengthens me when the inspiration strikes oh hallelujah when the revelation strikes blessed is the man whom the lord will not impute sin what does it say blessed is the man i tell you what when the inspiration strikes oh there is no sin imputed to you also in that same thing blessed is the man i want to tell you you're blessed oh when the inspiration of almighty god strikes you that you are blessed oh what did jesus tell cyber bar jordy he said simon you're blessed for flesh and blood have not revealed this to you oh the inspiration that has struck you simon barjona this inspiration this revelation didn't come from man but this was revealed to you from my heavenly father simon barcelona you are blessed and i'm no longer going to call you simon barjona but i'm going to call you peter why because you're blessed oh i want to tell you church i no longer call you church i call you bride why because you're blessed i don't impute any sin to you you are justified you never did it in the first place i no longer call you church i call you bride you are blessed and i want to tell you what oh you are born of my bone and flesh of my flesh and upon this revelation the revelation of the hour the revelation of the revealing of the son of man the revelation of the lord jesus christ this revelation who you have become one flesh with the gates of hell shall never prevail against it that means the gates of hell can never prevail against this pride because she is the revelation of the message she is the revelation of the new testament oh my goodness why can't somebody get excited about your inheritance you are the revealed word of the hour the message that is taken on flesh oh my goodness gracious i'm sorry but i know what i used to be i know what i was but one day inspiration struck you don't have to stay in that prison house any longer you can walk out this morning oh i believe jail sales are popping open bars are flying open why because jesus christ is here and whom the son has set free is free indeed is there somebody here this morning that is free why don't you act like it why don't you talk like it why don't you live like it why don't you let the power of the holy ghost breathe on you oh glory to god my goodness shake off those heavy bands lift up those hands hallelujah oh glory when inspiration strikes changes things i say doom devils are on the run the bride's filled with the holy ghost is that just mythology now the reason we struggle to live in higher heights is because we're not giving jesus christ preeminence god is not a liar so then when the bible says greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world when you fail in temptation and when you sit there and do the things that you do and you leave jesus right there with dirty feet whose fault is that yes bride you can be at fault that's the only way that eve got in trouble because she walked out from the protection of the word and if christ is with you the only reason why you fall is because you're making a choice over him and he will sit there like a gentleman and yes it's already finished yes your name's on the lamb's book of life and he'll wait for you to repent to plead the blood and to take him back because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and i believe there's an inspiration or a revelation an opening of our understanding that god as our pastor leads our flock into this field that is wanting to open up to us about this quickening power about the rising of the sun about this sheath wave that has been lifted up in the end time because it's showing us the maturity that we're coming in that we can do the greater works that we can be therefore perfect even as your heavenly father was perfect we have received a perfect word in the end time and now that perfect word is producing a perfect bride by a perfect faith because the perfect word has been restored which has restored a perfect bride oh i love it you want to know why i love it because i have heard now i see mama that's me in there that's not some other church oh that's good if you see it in your brothers and sisters but that's not what god's trying to get you to do i i think that's the one of the biggest problems is god has taken you on a journey the journey of the seed that he's placed in your life and you keep looking at everybody else like we're all a bunch of angels oh if i could ever be like so and so i'm sure they never have a trial i'm sure they've never done the things that i do are you kidding me that's why jesus christ died because we're all sinners we all need to plead the blood we all need to wash his feet we all need to choose him look we when you look through the i think we can be so foolish to think that that sanctification is a one-time work if you say you ain't got no sin you're a liar yeah it's a paradox because blessed is the man whom the lord will not impute sin you've got to keep taking god at his word because god ain't a liar people think i'm trying to talk into that i'm not i just lean over no god's not a liar but he has attributes that he wants to express so then when you find yourself giving over to your old nature then there's a revelation and inspiration that strucks you and you're saying you know what i am not a sinner i don't have to remain in this condition i don't even have to to live in condemnation why because the blood of jesus christ is greater than all my sins and now i am going to take the blood of jesus christ i'm going to confess my sins i am going to repent of the things that i've done i know i've been in bondage i know i've been in addictions and those addictions are stronger than me i don't have the power to overcome it i don't have the ability in myself i can't clean myself up enough to make myself ready for god god didn't want you to be able to clean yourself up he wanted to clean you up that's why he said oh with desire i have long to eat this last supper with you i want to have communion with you oh take this bread this is my body which is broken for you let me wash your feet peter peter said oh lord not my feet only but my hands and my hand look peter you don't know what i'm doing right now he who is washed is clean and you are clean i believe that was a great comfort to peter it's just going to be a few hours peter lord i'm ready to go with you i'm ready to die i'll go oh peter was inspired the inspiration struck peter lord what are you talking about i'm inspired lord i'll go with you unto death peter before the croc before the croc rose three times you'll deny me three times i imagine his inspiration was short-lived but i bet in the moment yeah boys i got the keys you heard him he even changed my name i'm the bride of jesus christ i cannot fall it's upon this rock of revelation he's going to build his church i'll tell you what lord i'm ready to go with you in about peter no peter you're just getting the mechanics you just got the mechanics right now peter and and the mechanics don't have the power you've heard peter i've been training you peter i've been training you brian you got the mechanics that's good i've been walking with you i've been training you i've been teaching you peter lord what are you talking about hear his lord's being taken away well we're off the notes god help us here peter's been taken away hey aren't you one of them where was that inspiration where was that lord i'll follow you into death i'm ready to fight for you i i'm ready oh to go into this great battle and bring back the kingdom you know what that inspiration that peter had i wonder where it was from because if there was a big show if there was a guard's ear to cut off if there was something for the church to see him do oh lord help us where are we going there was some self vindication that i got it i get to church early i stay late i dress in my three-piece suit i'm the bride you heard what he said oh as long as there's some big work for you to do as long as you can scream and shout and let the church know that you got it but when it was around a little campfire when it was around the lunch table at work when it was in the gas station and somebody kept using the name of the lord in vain when something was displeasing to your lord and they were crucified in my flesh and you stood there like i don't know the guy what happened to your inspiration that you had in church well you were all enthused about the word then you were jumping and shouting and saying oh yeah graters he that is in me i'm ready to go set the world on fire i'm going to tell everybody about it hey do you know that person named lord jesus i don't know who you're talking about not me i'll just drop a few explicatives so you really don't think i'm a believer oh yeah some of you do it just when the way you dress you're just dropping explicatives yeah i believe the message look at me skinned down weiner teenage boys you look like the rest of them god help us to do something to set us apart but let god speak to you a little bit yeah we get all inspired and we get enthused but a lot so many times it could be the wrong inspiration or the wrong channel you know david got inspired one time oh my goodness yeah let's have church bring the ark of the covenant home what jackson what do you think we should should we bring the should we should we bring the ark of the covenant home i think we should throw a big meeting and i think this is this is what we're going to do we're going to do it over there and i think uh i think this is what how we're going to do it and i i think man this is a great plan i tell you what i got a big vision let's let's just bring it home what do you think church i think we ought to do this and we ought to do that and oh my i mean hey i talked to the church i talked to the other preachers man i tell you what we're man we're all on board with this we're gonna have us a good time everybody meet me up at the church on saturday night and all of a sudden come to find out like what is what does brother david think of it oh well what does the prophet think about it what does the head ship think about it what does the order think about what does the word say about it what did the prophet say did you even consult the message of the hour see a lot of times we get inspiration but if we don't take that inspiration to the word then it's contrary to the word of god and then you can have the inspiration and be the wrong channel for it you got to take the inspiration back to the word and bring it under the headship and if it's of the lord he'll bring it to pass in its season so many times we want to get where are we at lord so many times we want to get ahead of god's program we get so inspired and we get so enthused but if we'll just be like job and sit there and wait for the inspiration to become revelation in its season then you'll see what god's doing lord help us oh yeah peter was inspired but that inspiration didn't keep him but all what did we read there in our opening text if the inspiration if you're inspired and that inspiration is of the lord and it comes together with the inspiration of the message what it it's it's the inspiration of god upon the believer now meeting with the inspired word and you said something has to take place what are the prophet of god said when two omnipotents meet right when two omnipotents meet something gots to shake well i gotta tell you it ain't you it ain't god that's gots to shake he said he said when two omnipotents meet something's got to shake something has to shake because it releases a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass he said what is it it's now that spoken word that creative word oh and you come together with god in this revealed word of the hour it's two omnipotence meaning something gots to shake when that inspiration strikes you oh you can ask what you have need of and by the grace of god if you can believe for it you can have it oh praise his wonderful name the word has been opened up to the bride in this hour that you can do ask for whatever you want to ask for he said i'm you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall do and greater works than thee shall you do because i go unto the father oh the inspiration striking now let the inspiration strike you let something well up in your heart right now are we all ready to quit or are we all ready to go home look i want the inspiration to keep striking till every son and daughter of god in this building has the victory this ain't just another church service god is here god has a purpose god wants to minister to you the mighty conqueror is here in the building let the inspiration strike you church come on you need victory what do you need let the inspiration strike you you need to be forgiven of your sins start believing for it start taking about his word let the inspiration strike you he's here the mighty conker's here let the inspiration strike you oh he's walking up and down the aisle that's not a figure of speech he's here why don't you reach out and touch the hem of his garment let the inspiration strike you he's here you got complexes he's here you got family troubles he's here what are you struggling with let the inspiration strike you that you don't have to remain in that condition any longer that jesus christ died on calvary for your sin that if you'll plead the blood of jesus christ and you'll repent of your sins and be willing with the surrendered heart to say lord i know i don't have power over those habits and over those addictions and my my my whole life has got me to the place where i am at right now and i and and something in my heart lord the inspiration is striking me right now just as job went through all that trial and through everything and brought job to a place where he was sitting on an ash heap his family had been taken away his houses had been taken away his land had been taken away his livestocks had been taken away joe was just practically sitting there homeless until his own wife come up to him and say why don't you just curse god and die oh job was sitting there he was waiting for the inspiration to strike i wonder if somebody is sitting here this morning and if the inspiration of god could strike you to say oh maybe all this has happened in my life to bring me to this place to this predestination a moment in time that the inspiration would strike and say you don't have to live like this anymore but i have died on calvary i have shed my blood for you and i forgive you if you'll just plead the blood if you'll just take me out my word if you'll just let me wash you if you'll just let me cleanse you look don't worry about tomorrow i'll take care of tomorrow for you don't worry about take no thought about what you're going to eat take no thought about where you're going to live look if you'll just take me i'm everything that you have needed don't worry about your education you don't have to worry about your family just put all your faith and all your trust in my word i am the god that healeth all your diseases what do you have need of this morning god is speaking to you why don't you let you let the inspiration strike the seed of god on the inside why don't you let the way the inspiration strike and quicken that seed and let it come to life there is a need that's represented in the body to this morning why did you let god speak to that seed why didn't you start to surrender your heart why don't you let the inspiration strike and when the inspiration strikes oh you can be something like that blind bartimaeus that was held thou son of david have mercy on me i'm not gonna let this moment pass me this is my moment this is my predestinate moment in time i have been doing a lot of hearing i've heard all my life about the message of the hour i've heard all my life about being set free but oh god i want to see oh peel the veil away this morning i want to see the lord jesus christ standing here this morning oh god minister to our hearts praise his wonderful name all right we're ready to start preaching now i'm at my text so here in our text he thought i was kidding job says but there is a spirit in a man and the inspiration of the almighty god giveth them understanding now this this word it's you know if you if you do a little search in your bible the word inspiration will only come up twice but it's actually the word inspiration is shama and it means breathe or it means the breath of god and this neshama is the same word that is used in genesis 2 7. so it says as a liohu this representative of christ is speaking there to job and his condition he says and the inspiration of almighty god giveth them understanding i tell you what as god was leading me down this trail and i ran back into that i felt say thank god i i i i you just love to be gleaning in that field you know uh as our pastor has been leading us and says then the inspiration of the almighty god giveth them understanding so then we look in this in our in our text here in genesis 2 it says when god formed man out of the ground he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life or the inspiration of life he breathed life and the man became a living soul now now i just i just imagine there if you think about it i hear adam adam as god formed adam there in the dust the prophet of god would talk about how how adam was formed and out of the dust and he was standing there like a tree and his his his toes were rooted down into the ground like roots and his arms just kind of hanging there and then adam was a man formed like a tree his toes dug down in the earth and he was just standing there like a tree now he looked like a man but he was waiting for a quickening power waiting for the inspiration waiting for the breath of god so that he could serve his purpose now because remember adam adam was already living adam was a spirit man male and female he was already in existence but now what is god doing he's forming him a body and so now adam already exists because he's the spoken word gene of god but now he's formed a body on the earth so now he's formed this body and i want to say that if he would have formed this body after the fall then adam who was formed out of the dirt he would have came in a fallen nature and he would have had a dirty nature so then when when god breathed upon adam because he he was he was the first man there was no life in him but then god breathed the breath of life into his nostrils and he became a living soul i would say a much like us we were born in sin in a fallen nature so then because we're born in a fallen nature after the way that we came there is a fallen sin nature but then there comes a time that god is going to breathe upon this body that he has been allowed to be formed in ladies and it's going to burn out that old nature and it's going to be a quickening spirit that quickens that seed gene to life right prophet of god would say the church is the mystical body of christ so we're we're tying these things together born of the breath of god the church is the mystical body of christ born of the breath of god oh did you get that the church of god is born of the breath of god god breathed breath into his nostrils spiritually of adam and he became a living soul did you know the pentecostals or true pentecostal church is born of the breath of god you are born of the breath of god look the inspiration of god bringing forth understanding bringing forth revelation when your understanding is opened it's the quickening power making the word flesh in you maybe that's a big talk right there but that's what's happening the quickening power is making the word of god flesh in you we keep moving out of this i have heard but now i see the prophet of god would say now so now now we've been quick and we've been made alive the church has been birthed by the breath of god there's an inspiration that has struck you you know who you are you know where you're standing you know greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world i i i'm the bride i i i'm without spotter i'm without wrinkle oh she is him oh we've heard these things and we're seeing the materialization of it we're catching the revelation all these things that uh melchizedek has come oh uh uh uh you know if if i could say it that way or i was thinking of eliezer i believe although there but you know all these great things that laid there in the scripture all these things are just opening up to us and illumines and our understanding is being opened up and we're feeding on it we're walking in it now there you this is that of i have heard but now i see paragraph 85 he says now there you are when you're prayed for you don't have to run back through a line or go let somebody else pray for you when you know you've done exactly what god told you to do see then wait for that channel of inspiration to open up to you and now i am healed when it drops in there then it's all over you don't need no prayer lines nothing else it's over it's been revealed to you i wonder if there's somebody here that the inspiration can strike you and say it's over i've been running i've been wondering who i am i've been wondering if i'm the bride of jesus christ i've been looking at my faults and my failures i've been wondering the devil keeps trying to tell me i'm foolish virgin the devil keeps trying to tell me i'm never going to make it the devil keeps telling me that i'm going to have to put up with these faults and failures the rest of my life but now faith cometh by hearing the word so then as faith is striking that gene feat of god something is starting to transpire where now that hearing is becoming a seeing by faith it's becoming a revelation and then when the enemy comes and tries to make you doubt it you know where you're standing the enemy will come and try to make you doubt and say you don't got the holy ghost now here's a simple formula because many times we go through trials and god might be correcting us or we're failing in certain areas and then don't mistake the conviction of god amen if something's telling you you ain't got the holy ghost well there's a simple formula you can do and say you know what if i'm not living in overcoming life lord i don't know where i'm at but one thing i do know that you can take me from where i'm at into higher heights and you repent of your sins because many of us have been there say lord my goodness if how could i even have the holy ghost and they've done that but you take when the devil tries to start to condemn you you take them back to the word and say well i've repented of my sins i've been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ lord i want to serve you with all of my heart and if i don't got the holy ghost by divine promise heavens and earth will pass away but your word will never pass away and i'm standing upon that sure word that you told me lord i shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and take that promise alone right there and start whooping the devil with it okay devil you caused me to fall but guess what jesus died for me yeah devil you you got me to fall again but guess what blessed is the man whom the lord will not impute sin yeah you keep trying to rub it in my face all my past and all my mistakes but guess what there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus you start whooping that old devil with the word but when you find out you probably don't got the holy ghost is when you start to justify your condition well you know i mean who you know and you start to cope friends we are not called to cope we are called to overcome and if something in your heart knows and believes and doesn't want to live the way you're living anymore that is the god seed inside of you crying out for deliverance and if there's a deep hallelujah crying out saying their gods to be something more that means there's a deep to respond and there's an inspiration to strike you this morning to tell you look that's been me all the time i'm the one that's been keeping you you should have been dead so many times you should have been gone so many times you would have quit you would have given up oh my when you went through all them trials and tribulations and everything was messed up in your family you would have packed your bags and you would have left you'd have been long gone and you wonder why are you still sitting here this morning why because it's christ in you the hope of glory he's the one that is keeping you he's the one that's holding you he's the one that's carrying you like the sand the footprints on the sand of time oh my in my deepest trials lord why did you leave me when i was so alone and my heart was broken i didn't think i could make it another day lord jesus i looked back there on the sands of time and i only see one set of footprints lord why did you leave me there oh my daughter my son i didn't leave you the the reason there's only one set of footprints is because i was carrying you don't you realize predestination has a destination and you've been wrapped in the arms of predestination and it's going to carry you all the way home oh glory to god that shouting grounds right there breathe the destination of predestination god has spoken a bride in the end time that has a destination by predestination you can't miss it let that inspiration strike you you'll chop the devil's head off let the devil come lying to you then you know david knew who he was david's inspiration wasn't fake david had been anointed david knew where he was going there was a destination of pre of predestination in david's life that's why he could go on down there amen god's given me the kingdom god's given me his word greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world who is this uncircumcised philistine yeah david was just about his father's business david didn't have no prestige he didn't have no position in the church he was just about his father's business bringing down a cheese bucket to the battle all right look you know dad if you want me to bring a cheese bucket down to the battle i mean i'm just a lowly cheap herder you know i mean i'll remain in my calling i'll walk it on down there yeah but david was still living a victorious life he didn't have he didn't have big position or anything but you know what in his normal simple job he was still whooping devils you don't need some great big position you don't need some great big job david was the lowest of his brethren out there herding sheep on the backside of the desert and you know what he was doing he was taking devil's head off maybe the devil was trying to get after him oh man he thinks he's somebody you know he's anointed well i'll just go tear up his his father's house sheep i'll just go ahead and cause a cause a little commotion at his job i'll go send a co-worker over there to cause a big bunch of chaos and i'll really get him discouraged i'm going to send an evil spirit over there and cause some calamities and get david real discouraged well when that devil showed up and tried to try to start causing problems and telling lies on them right that old devil come up and try to oh he's been doing this he's been doing that oh okay all right i see you devil you don't know who i am i'm the bride of jesus christ i've been anointed i've been called i've been placed here in ladies to meet devils like you and i'm not backing down you know what david did by the inspiration that struck him he knew he was in position he killed a bear he killed a lion so when he showed up there at goliath he looked the same lord that delivered me the same lord that justified me the same lord that sanctified me the same lord that filled me with the holy ghost he's the same lord here that's here this morning he's the same lord that i heal my body he's the same lord that'll give me my family he's the same lord that'll deliver in my complex he's the same lord that'll bring my prodigals home he's the same lord and i tell you old devil you're uncircumcised felicity you ain't no different than that bear in that line i'm going to take your head off this day david knew who he was david was faithful in the little things and you see the fruits in his life now when it's revealed to you that you yourself have received god's promise the inspiration you being christians it struck you you don't ever need a prayer line the only thing you need is an open heart when all the mechanics are ready when all the mechanics are ready and let the inspiration drop in nothing can change your mind you've got what are you believing for you got it when all the mechanics are are the mechanics ready are the mechanics ready you know you can get all the mechanics ready this morning well i'll tell you what it's awesome to serve god it just takes a moment in his presence and all the mechanics can be ready i called on the name of the lord you shall be saved god dropped down changed my whole life i mean in a moment in a twinkling of an eye the mechanics got ready and the dynamics dropped in and changed me and filled me with the holy ghost just like they came i believe to cornelius you know an angel appeared unto him right so many times we want to bypass god's program you ever think about that an angel appeared under cornelius and the angel couldn't give them the holy ghost because god if he ever does something one way he does it the same way every time so the angel had to say go get peter have him come pray for you and while peter was preaching the word oh he's the same yesterday today and forever there's something on your heart and something that you're believing while the word is going forth oh the breath of god is breathing upon the bride receive ye the holy ghost and the holy ghost fell upon them and they started to speak in tongues the dynamics came upon the mechanics and all of them jews they looked around peter and all of them and said hey they're doing exactly what we're doing they got the same power we got what should we do is like well we should baptize them because that's the formula they got the holy ghost and then they got baptized while the word was being preached you ain't gonna wait for the water you can get it while it's being preached but i tell you what if you get it while it's being preached you can't wait to get in the water you cannot wait what does hinder there's water right here fill up the tub fill up the pool throw a tarp in the pickup bed fill it with water take me down to the river there's a pool over there let me get into the water i don't care if it froze over break the ice get me in the water it can't contain this fire i got fire shut up in my bowls why because the almighty living god has breathed the breath of life upon me and just like adam my toes were stuck down in the mud my arms were stuck out and i was dead but the breath of god breathed upon me and made me a quickening spirit now the fire is shut up in my bones and the inspiration is struck oh hallelujah praise this wonderful name you've got it look you possess something church you possess something there's a the where the there's a revelation that starts to influence the way you live amen believe our our pastor said something along those lines look you're the royal seed of abraham now think of abraham abraham received a promise right he called those things that were not as though they were when the inspiration strikes now listen to this the inspiration it's an inspiring agent or an influence you know i was i fellowship with the youth uh friday night and we were talking about how they're such an influence now and such a pressure to be successful like this social media presents these pictures and these videos of of everyone being successful and they're there there's these uh successful careers and and they have cars and homes and and the social media and all the videos out there they just present oh my if it's it's ladies on steroids rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing look at me you can make a million dollars an hour if you just click here that's why i'm a millionaire gotcha sign up it's only ten dollars you can be millionaire like me gotcha click over here scroll over here i'm the god of this evil age gotcha there's something there to influence you away from the kingdom of god there's always a lying spirit i think of that in the days of micaiah look they had 400 profit was it and what happened there was an evil spirit sent down and said hey take these these horns made of brass and and you're going to drive back the assyrians and you're going to get the victory and all the 400 prophets went yay glory oh let's go get the victory and it was like but if there's jehoshaphat i don't i don't know see there's there one more is there a real prophet will the real prophet please stand up will the real bride please stand up as there's somebody that will take the real genuine vindicated prophet message of the hour at his word and let that inspiration strike you regardless of what all lady osea says regardless what all the other ministries look look stay with the message of the hour the bride is the final voice to the final age under her messenger not under another voice there was no other voice given to take you into a rapture but malachi 4 luke 17 30 revelations 10 1 7 let that inspiration strike you you'll be like john back there in the book of revelations in chapter five he was weeping and wondering is there anybody able to take the book and lose the seven seals oh john was weeping yeah john was inspired he was inspired with sorrow he was inspired with guilt because he knew if nobody was able to take that book then all of humanity was lost but oh my somebody stepped forward and said oh john john stop your weeping why why do you want me to stop my weep at what i'm weeping about in serious business all redemption is lost all mankind is lost when adam fell we were waiting for a kinsmen redeemer if there's no kinsmen redeemer to take that book and lose the seventh hills then everything we've been believing for and everything we've been hoping for and everything we've been praying for all is lost no john stop your weeping whoa there's an inspiration about to strike you pride there's an inspiration about to strike you from the throne of heaven oh john weak not john the lion of the tribe of judah he has prevailed to take the book and not just take the book to open the book and loose the seven seals thereof oh my tell you what there was some inspiration that struck john the prophet of god said oh john must have saw his name in there john got inspired and when the inspiration struck john oh my john said it's good to be a message believer in lady arcia amen preacher i'm free i'm delivered that's a good song ain't it good song anybody wanna sing a good song i know some worldly christian groups on the radio that seem good songs oh what's the preacher's hand oh yeah we're the bride victorious yeah but my name's on a book that's right i forgot my name's my book i'm justified sanctified i'm a good hearer of the word but not a doer not john and i hear it i hear john's a type of the bride find that for me and show me sounds good i like it john being the type of the bride all sudden some inspiration shrug john john wasn't no cold formal backslidden believer john was signing and crying for the abominations of the world john was sorrow john was wondering oh my everything's lost oh if somebody's not able to take this book oh here we are and ladies see there's been a revival sweep the land and no there's not even anybody to respond to it what is going on the world's going to complete dark apostasy they've come to cadis barnea and the whole church world has rejected christ the word and now christ is on the outside of the church he can't even get back in why the seed has been excommunicated from the shack christ is on the outside what does all this mean oh don't we john the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed come out of heaven ye my people don't be a partaker ever plagues this is me christ the mighty angel i have descended i have taken the book i have opened what do you see in there that's your name that's your name oh and all the heaven heard i john sand blessing and honor and glory forever and ever to him that sitteth on the throne john saw his name in there the inspiration struck john the revelation came oh john fell down oh and worshipped the prophet of god said when the seals opened up everything became worshipped that's why when the bride of christ gets together there ought to be some worship in the house of god there ought to be some people that can lift up their voice because the inspiration the breath of god has struck the seed and brought it to life oh hallelujah praise his wonderful name i don't know what y'all keep doing to me but i am not even lord help us oh my lady you'll see it wants to influence you there's another influence church there's another inspiration don't you oh thank you lord don't you realize that's the cheap musician's trick all that stuff you're you're following it's a cheap musician's trick even your careers and everything i'm just going to say it we're either playing church or that's all ladies it's a bunch of cheap musician tricks trying to imitate or vindicate themselves that they got something to oh yeah you got the message of the hour we got this oh yeah we got this right that's all that all that stuff you're looking at and feeding on and and all this social media and everything that's pretty now like i said i've had this talk with some of you look when when we stand up we're a little disconnected in that regards i i've had a few years go by if you're keeping track of well worldly friends we talk about that but i'll say this those are worldly devices the bible says no weapon formed against you shall prosper there was a weapon that was formed against david called goliath sword if you're going to be using the weapons of the world take the devil's head off with it please if you got social media if you got snapchat let them know that god sent a prophet let them know you've been changed because if you're not doing that you're just like peter sitting around a campfire just sitting around snapchat saying i don't know who the lord is when there's christians out there denominational worlds with good hearts that are just walking up to people in gas stations and saying can i pray for you they don't know they just know they want to do something for god there's people going on missionary trips and preaching the gospel and here we got the greatest treasure that's ever struck the face of the earth and we're about to selfish hoarding all to ourselves us for and no more and you can't have what i got the truth of the matter is is you don't have what you think you got that's the truth because if the inspiration ever strikes you that you're forgiven you don't have to live like that anymore you're free you're delivered oh glory to god there's an inspiration of the holy ghost that'll strike you in your soul that when you see somebody else in bondage when you see somebody else that doesn't have victory in their life there's an inspiration that says oh my son oh my daughter let me tell you about the grace of god there's an inspiration there's a fire because the breath of god has breathed on me and he has set me free oh i told you this is about worship let me worship my king let me worship my savior i'm like john oh blessings and honor and glory forever and not just in my word only in my life in my deeds in my home at my job to my wife to my children in the gas station at my work because it's no longer i that liveth it's christ that liveth in me we're just gonna have to have a part two because oh if you only knew what god had for you i feel like i at least got to give a a prelude we talked about them four messengers a lie who being the type of christ right were four death messengers that tore down the bride tree there were four life messengers that built it back up oh my oh my i know we have a couple baptisms it's 11 58. we usually get out of one out of round one so i believe we're going to be getting out early anyways how's everybody feeling praise god hallelujah we'll be calling for the musician shortly oh my you know we're just speaking about this y'all stop pulling it'll be easier to close hallelujah well glory to god i feel good oh my isn't it good to be free if you would have seen me out in the world i acted a fool you'd have seen me out in the world you know what i wanted everybody in the world to have what i had oh i could tell you some stories it was a perverted expression but if i found something that was intoxicating try this jackson i got the good stuff it will light you up i'm telling you what it'll take you from where you're sitting and it will totally totally warp your brain you won't even know where you're at brother matthew you're being worldly well you know what i was searching for something i had heard of the message but i didn't get filled with the message so the devil had some substitutes to offer me sin is pleasurable for a season sin will take you further than you want to go when i was living in those pleasures for a season i wanted my buddies to experience it my buddies wanted me to experience what i had well hey the natural types of spiritual when i finally got the real stuff and look let me say it like this because there's somebody here that it'll speak to and you forgive me but when you've come from a certain what way you can minister to people that come from a certain way but we used to look for what we called the good stuff that lasted the longest that you wouldn't come down from and the only way i can explain it to certain people out of the world i say hey man imagine taking your favorite thing and never coming down and it being a billion times better so once i got the holy ghost i've been on a high and i've never come down in my lowest valleys i've still been highest than my highest high as a center i've been lifted up so high in heavenly places if there's a little nip down or a little tucked down i'm still seated in heavenly places in christ jesus nothing can pluck me out of the palm of his hand i'm safe and secure and i know what i'm talking about because the inspiration the breath of god struck me and it set me free moving towards a close just speaking along the lines of that inspiration you know that whole uh inspiration and fluids of things out there in the world to be successful you know i was thinking about this you know it's it's just speaking of the natural type in the spiritual you know it's amazing how we can get inspired to do something everybody anybody ever been inspired to do something i'm gonna start working out and i mean it's you're for real no you don't mean you don't you wanna know how for real i am i just bought a set of rubber bands for fifteen hundred dollars that's how real i am i just bought a lifetime membership for ten dollars a month at lifetime fitness well if you could do that that would actually be cool oh but i'm serious i'm motivated i'm inspired watch me now yeah you watch you for a little bit but you know it's amazing to me how in the moment just like peter right in the moment in the moment lord i die for you i believe this message with all my heart i went to camp i went to the prayer line i got inspired watch me now devil you better know what you're talking about cause there's a big target on your back well i i had you okay i had you while you you were entertaining all this other stuff but you think you got something let me see what you're really made of oh you're all inspired and you're all enthused lord i'll die for you i'll go but it struck me i was like it's amazing how inspired you can be to do something and then that same thing is so uninspiring like did i want to get up at six in the morning go work out who wants to do that a cup of coffee and a a scone sounds awesome it's like sometimes i'm like forget that why would you do that to yourself and something that you were so fired up about you're so enthused about it and it was so tangible you could you could see it you could taste it you saw the pathway you saw the vision of it but you know what you didn't have you only had mechanics follow me now you only had mechanics you might have had some thought process about it but no power to fulfill it so we talked about peter a little bit and i was just thinking about that we've we've been fellowshipping around the dynamics and the mechanics see peter wanted to go but peter wasn't ready peter wanted to die for the lord but he didn't have the power to die for the lord and that's why jesus prayed for him and peter denied him three times you know how troubled peter must have been he knew he wanted to serve god he knew he was called look you know you're called stop stop worrying about that you didn't call yourself god called you so stop that you're elected you're called you're chosen but you're having a hard time the lord knows lord knew peter was having a hard time that's why before he left he sat down with peter and said peter do you love me lord i love you he was giving peter an opportunity to make up for those three times he didn't then he told peter peter do you love me peter said lord i love you he said feed my sheep yes on that third time imagine it was the hardest cause peter knew in his heart he wanted to serve god he tried everything he was so inspired many times only to come up short lord i'll go with you to death and then i denied him three times lord you know i love you you know everything or do you know all my weaknesses you know all my sin lord but one thing you know i want to serve you jesus looked at him and he started to tell him what you wanted to do in that upper room you're going to do you're going to spread forth your arms you're going to fulfill that desire because there's going to be a dynamics come upon your life peter that's going to change the world it reminds me of jesus breathing on them said receive ye the holy ghost i believe there's an inspiration as the musicians come to strike your heart this morning you know where you're living at many of us have the mechanics but we haven't gotten the dynamics it's like it's like you want to go fishing and you ain't got no fishing pole you ain't got no boat you ain't got no bait somebody the lord will furnish you everything you need god will set all that in order you just need to surrender your heart just give me a moment real quick that's what the prophet said earlier said when all the mechanics are ready and let the inspiration drop in and then nothing can change your mind you got it i want to speak to you in the name of the lord you're not waiting for victory you have the victory faith already in his word already has you standing on the mountain you say i want to climb mount everest i want to go up there well that's a process but if that inspiration can never drop into your heart by faith you call those things that are not as though they are and you already have the victory maybe you can play draw me draw me lord keep f maybe we'll just stand to change your position prophet of god said and i have heard but now i see he said no matter how religious you are how many churches you belong to how many books your name's on if that genuine holy ghost is in you which is this word manifested you'll see the message of the hour because it's the holy ghost that does it but there has to be something like that off inspiration strike you and if there's if if you pour water on the ground on the ground and there's no seed in there to strike it how can it ever bring forth anything there's nothing to bring forth that is that only the elected of god will see it i want to tell you this morning that it's not your inspiration peter's inspiration failed our inspiration many times has failed but when it's the inspiration of the word in you that gene seed of god inspiration that he placed inside of you when that inspiration lines up with the inspiration of the word then something gots to shake something got to take place because it's not your inspiration it's his inspiration and that's what this message is doing that's what god is wanting to do he's wanting to open up your understanding he's wanting to inspire you and when that inspiration strikes you then the message becomes tangible then it becomes a reality then it becomes flesh in you draw me stroll me lord and i'll come running after just a little bit slower [Music] well let's just sing that a little slower [Music] and i'll come after you [Music] i'll just sing it again draw me [Music] how oh [Music] amen we just want to invite those that are going to be baptized to come at this time those that are going to help them [Music] i tell you what church there's an inspiration to strike the bride of jesus christ [Music] there's so much in store for you there's so much more that god has in store for you i mean i tell you what [Music] there is a a seven course meal that's opened up the skies are the limit i tell you wherever you're living there's higher heights there's deeper depths there's more victory there's more peace there's more joy oh don't don't just settle try god you can't exhaust it we haven't even scratched the surface we haven't even gotten started we'll get started when we get to eternity oh i tell you what they're oh there's nothing like the [Music] presence of [Music] i am [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] free this morning [Music] [Music] my [Music] brother chris here so come and just pray a prayer

hands to lift their heart to you lord to surrender that life lord god to the work that's already completed in their life i pray god that you would just reach down lord and break those chains lord and bring a liberty bring a freedom lord bring a victory this morning lord that they can accept what's already done to them lord father we just ask a special blessing upon brother matthew lord we ask that you build him up lord touch his body give him virtue lord i pray lord that you continue to speak to him lord god that you inspire him lord father we just ask that you go with us lord father we have a work to do and we ask that you lord you just help us to surrender ourselves even more lord that we could do that which is pleasing to you father go with us and bring us back this evening lord we're an expectation father for this evening lord we just commit this into your hands in jesus name amen amen you are dismissed you're able to go if those that want to stay for the baptism [Music] you're

[Music] so uh everybody hear me all right okay well god bless you uh so really happy to be here today with you there's two baptisms the lord just so graciously opened up a door for other cars for myself and some other brothers in the church to be able to go over to dallas probably almost on a weekly basis not sometimes we skip a little bit but almost weekly basis to speak with a few people just giving them the gospel tend to do some of their needs and just being a friend to them and taking the gospel to them and you know what happens when you go and shine the gospel light there's a seed of god in that vessel there forces it to life just like the sun and the springtime shining upon the earth it brings all that grass and the trees and everything to life it can't help itself right conditions it comes to life and just so wonderfully one of uh a couple of them just the gospel light shining upon them they they heard and now they believe repented of their sins and now see the need for baptism so one of the one of the precious souls who who has made this wonderful glorious decision is uh her name is maria and uh if she would like give her a few moments to uh to testify would you like to see don't have to okay all right so that's all right so you know how it is it could be he said that he could be the voice he whispered i don't know it's okay uh so yeah no so we understand a little bit of shyness there but that's fine so we're just so grateful and thankful for uh the light shining upon the seed and them recognizing the believing and recognizing what they must do so we'll read the scripture here uh acts 2 30 uh chapter 2 verses 37-39 it says now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do to stop right there why was their heart pricked because the word had gone forth it dealt with their hearts and their hearts were pricked not to resist the gospel but tricks like i want to be right with god so that's what's happened with the people who come with us today their hearts were pricked and so you know what i want to be a daughter of god god has brought me to life but there's a process then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call so maria upon the confession of your faith that you have repented of your sins and that you recognize you must be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ upon this confession of your faith we baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ [Applause] so we have second baptism today so maria i gotta turn around before i get nervous sorry she gets a little bit nervous when there's a lot of people and if you've ever stood on this in before you could definitely understand there's a lot of faces looking back at you but but she's the second one patricia and actually brother costa and myself have actually uh known patricia for some time from from another spot we used to be at and she's didn't reject what we had to say very kind and very receptive to it and actually there's a lot of the word that she does know for being in church and whatnot but we kept showing up kept presenting the gospel not pushing and what not then two the light of the gospel pierced right through the darkness through her soul she said you know what i i recognize too that i need to be baptized that's the right thing to do and patricia because of that you're fulfilling a promise in the word that when you are repent and you are baptized in this name then there's a promise and it's the destiny of a person who fulfills that scripture being filled with the holy ghost so before we uh before we go on would you like to testify okay you've been my voice no i didn't okay she's a bit nervous so i'll repeat what she wants to say i know the devil took all my memories she said i am she said i know the devil took all the memories of who i am but he's never been able to take my bond with jesus but he's never been able to take my bond with jesus and my vow even though i don't remember completely and my vow even though i don't remember completely and i know that a few times i put that hammer on him this lifetime but i don't know how many lifetimes i've had before because it's completely blunted but one thing he forgets he keeps underestimating me and me and god laugh once again i will die for jesus i will die for god i researched research found my own knowledge and i found out there's several different levels of the soulmate leading all the way up to the almighty and that's where my bond and promise and value is and i will go back to him if i have to but damn with the devil amen all right i think they heard them bless you yeah i think they did too face the fears cross your arms patricia upon the confession of your faith that you repented of your sins and you recognize that you must be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ we baptize you now in the name of the lord jesus christ [Applause] amen we're living epistles the red of all men everywhere we go we need to shine a light amen let's just sing the song as our dismissal song we're thanking for the cross tonight or this morning and what he's done for us amen thank you for the crosstalk [Music] [Music] all my sins [Music] thank you for this love [Music] please [Music] your forgiveness [Music] is [Music] [Music] be told this morning [Music] jesus [Music] is [Music] thank you for the nail please [Music] now all i know you're forgiven [Music] [Music] victoria [Music] jesus [Music] the treasurer is [Music] you
