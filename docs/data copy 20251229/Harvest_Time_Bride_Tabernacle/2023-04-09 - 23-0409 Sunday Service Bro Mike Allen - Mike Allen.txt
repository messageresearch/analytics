you'll never be enough fear he is a liar he will take your breath stop you in your steps fear he is a liar he will rob your rest steal your happiness cast your fear in the fire because fear he is a liar when he told you you were troubled you'll forever be alone when he told you you should run away you'll never find a home when he told you you were dirty and you should be ashamed when he told you

your rest steal your happiness cast your fear in the fire cause fear he is a liar cast your fear in the fire cause fear he is a liar fear he is a liar that's our subject this morning but before that is what I say Happy Easter he is the reason he is risen and I just wanted to if I didn't take time to recognize the resurrection before I started preaching what kind of Easter Service would it be Sonia asked me if I was going to be preaching in Easter Service I said well I don't think it's exactly an Easter service but but I decided we're going to turn to Matthew chapter 28. and we're just going to throw this right in here because if it wasn't for the resurrection we would be able to fear so it does fit I'm just going to go ahead and take this off this morning and I'll have you seated for this and then when I get to my main scripture here then I'll have you stand for the reading of the word in chapter 28 verse 1 I have to get there myself in the end of the Sabbath as it began to draw toward the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the mother married to see the supper and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rode back the Stone from the door that set upon it he wouldn't do that just for no reason something great was about to happen the Lord announces great things with signs and wonders in the Earth with earthquakes when he died on the cross there was an earthquake and the world went dark and that veil was rent because a new day was coming because we were now going to not be able to look at the veil but we're going to be able to enter into the Veil the descending to roll back to someone from the door that sat up on it his countenance was like the lightning and his Raymond was white as snow and for fear of him the keepers did shake and become as dead men I would imagine you see an angel you walk in there that would be a frightful time especially if you're the Roman soldiers guarding the tomb of the man that everybody was afraid of that he was and they'd heard the stories that there was going to be this Resurrection I would be afraid and the angel answered and said unto the women now here come the Believers here come the women here here come the bride and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not fear not ye for I know that you seek Jesus which has crucified are you seeking Jesus this morning are you seeking him every day of your life are you looking for him in every aspect of your life he is not here for he has risen he said come and see the place where the Lord lay because he has risen Satan thought he had put him in the grave for good he thought he'd nailed the last nail in the coffin but on this day the third day he had arisen and he was alive and he would later on appear to the disciples and commune with them in the Great and Mighty conqueror in 1957 brother Branham says this good morning to you a very happy Easter to each one of you this is one of the greatest days in commemoration of the resurrection of our lord it's one of the greatest days of all the world's history it's the resurrection and we're so happy to be here this morning on this great day and see the sun rising and the flowers are rising from the earth everything speaks Easter that's the beauty of spring everything speaks Resurrection the flowers are coming up the trees are coming back in the Boom the Lambs are lambing the cows are having calves and all that and everything speaks of the Resurrection how can you deny the resurrection all you have to do is look at that nature because nature proclaims the Lord's Resurrection everything speaks of Easter and now let us power heads just one moment father God into thy presence we come and we are expecting thee to give to the to us this morning just a little extra blessing from heaven some little touch of Easter in our own Souls some little touch of Resurrection in our own Souls we all have areas of our life that we need a resurrection in whether it's fear whether it's sickness whether it's discouragement whether it's worry whatever it is we have a little part of our life that we need because we're in human flesh the soul is veiled behind Badger skin Fallen flesh a fallen Spirit a fallen mind that that's influenced by the things of this world we all need a touch of Resurrection this morning and brother Branham here in this prayer he's saying just just a little extra blessing from Heaven some little touch of Easter in our own Souls individuals not the church as a whole but each one of you can have your own Touch of Resurrection this morning and when we leave here we might say as those who came from Emmaus did not our hearts burn within us because of his presence for we ask it in his name and for his glory amen that's what I want to leave here I want to be able to say did not our hearts burn within us because he was speaking to us along the way is because we were walking and we were expecting a resurrection in our own life we're expecting to raise up out of this debt and one day we're gonna we're gonna step from this body we're going to step into eternity and we're going to lay down this whole Badge of skin and we're going to take on a glorified body and we're going to be resurrected just like he was resurrected to his glorified body we're going to be resurrected into our glorified body to live with him forever to reign with him forever to come back in a millennium to rule and Reign Over this Earth for a thousand years and then to go and end with him and to a new heavens and a new Earth and a complete full body a fullness of Resurrection that's what we're looking forward to this morning what we're looking forward to very soon the signs and the times are all around us that our Resurrection is near our Rapture is near that we're going to lay down this old dead decaying flesh this whole dedicating body this old dead decaying mind this old dead decaying fears and all that we're going to lay it down and we're going to put it aside and we're going to step into that glorified body and we will reign and we will know as we are known we will be just like him because we are him amen all right and this morning I want to speak on fear he is a liar I'm gonna if you want to stand for the reading of the word here real quick and I'll just read one scripture here I and then it's been good to be here with you all and just kind of hate seeing where it's Sunday and we'll be heading home this evening and because you know it's hard to break away when you're with the body of Christ it's hard to break away when you're just having a good time of fellowship and enjoying everybody's presence and all that and we're going to turn to first John 4. we're going to read seven through eight and if I could get some water that would be awesome I'm going to just read Verse 18 here real quick in first John chapter 4. there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we come before you this morning Father Lord and humbleness of mine Lord to seeking your word father to seeking your guidance in our life father God and Lord we just we just want to remember you on this Resurrection Day father this day that's been set aside to to remember that you went to the grave but you didn't stay there father you went to the grave but you Rose again father God and you come forth in glory and you come forth in life and Lord because you came forth in life and then because you came forth in glory Lord we can live father and and Lord not only live but Lord we can live without fear in our lives father because knowing that you Rose that means it will rise father knowing that you Rose that means we have an advocate with the father it means that we have an advocate that we can lay all our troubles in all our trials and all our fears and all our wants and everything down upon you father Lord we invite you this morning to walk across our hearts father and into our minds father and Lord to to work on us father and Lord to make take those things that aren't like you and Lord make them like you father God to take them things that that we're lacking in father and make it more like you make it into your image board we commit it into your hands father we commit the service in your hands Lord in Jesus Christ and we pray amen amen fear he is a liar now I'd heard that song that Sonia is saying there many times but I always said if always thought it said fear is a liar but then I got to listening to it and I I heard it and it hit me it just hit me one day it says fear he is a liar and what that told me was is because fear he is a liar I could personify fear now I know what fear is it's a demon and if it's a demon then I know what I'm fighting if it's some emotion out here but some kind of complex or something like that I don't really know what I'm fighting a lot of times but because I can identify it as a being come from hell all of a sudden I can say oh the same thing that works against Satan is going to bork against his demons the same thing it works against cancer is going to work against fear the same thing is going to work against sin in our lives is going to work against fear that is the word of God in our lives but we fail to recognize what we're fighting a lot of times we think we're fighting our own mind we think we're fighting our own complex we think we're fighting all this but really it's a demon that's coming against us that's trying to tell us that we're this is trying to tell us that we're that what's trying to tell us why we aren't is trying to tell us we're not a child of God is trying to tell us that we have everything to fear it's trying to tell us that that cancer is a reality it's trying to tell us that that depression is a reality it's trying to tell us that anxiety is a reality it's trying to tell us that we're not a child of God is a reality but it's not I stand here to Proclaim Freedom this morning because fear he is a liar because he is a liar that we don't have to listen to it because all we have to listen to is the truth and what is truth it is the word of God and the word of God says I am free the word of God says I have a sound mind the word of God says that cancer can't come against me it says I am already healed by his stripes past tense yesterday he did it on the cross he did it when he took the stripes he healed me already you believe it you accept it in your life you're responsible fear he is a liar and I just listen to these this song when he told you that you're not good enough would God tell you that you're not good enough no there has to be a demon when he told you that you're not right did you repent did you ask for forgiveness I'm right I'm right Satan I repented I I I I went back and asked the Lord to forgive me so now I'm right I'm in a right spirit with the Lord you are a liar I'm not going to listen to you anymore get behind me Satan when he told you you're not strong enough well the word says I'm not strong enough I'll agree with you on that but it all says my strength is found in Christ and it says I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me I had a reality yes in this flesh I am not strong enough but in the night of Christ and when I'm walking him when I'm walking in the spirit when I have the bathroom it's the Holy Ghost I am strong enough you are strong enough this morning to put all things behind you to put Satan under your feet quit listening to him quite less any time he's a liar he's a liar you don't have to list the time you've gave your heart to Christ you've been baptized with the Holy Spirit he is a liar saying you are a liar saying you're a liar I will not listen to you anymore though you come at me with my bed though you try to put the pressure on now you're trying to put anxiety on me no you try to tell me my children are lost I will not listen to you because I am Christ and I stand strong in his word because I have the baptism only good Glory it's not us it's him doing it through us what's your confession this morning he said he is in Hebrews he said he's the god of our profession of our confession no I'm not saying it just right I'm already losing my voice I'll tell you how he is I preached yesterday I preached hard I preached about the denominations in the message he's trying to tell me I was wrong you know what fear he is a liar fear he is a liar trying to get me down they'll try to get you down oh he tried to give me this last few weeks tell me that I had some kind of heart problem or I had some kind of met brain problem I had had some even some Rogue test that said I might have had many strokes well you know what that was all fear and I got to I I went so far to get the proof on magnetic tape but you know he tried to convince me that you know he tried to convince me I didn't have the Holy Spirit though in my heart and my heart and I knew that I knew but I had to stand up against him you have to stand up against him whatever he's telling you this morning you stand against it you confess the opposite of it if he's telling you you're lost you say no Satan I'm saved if he tells you you don't have the whole baptism the Holy Ghost you say Satan I've got the baptism in the Holy Ghost Talk the same for a little Feud He likes to talk to you talk back tell him who you are tell him that you had the baptism of the Holy Spirit because he's going to tell you you don't he's going to tell you you're going to die he's going to tell you all this stuff well you just start confessing the opposite Satan I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and there's nothing you could do to take it from me Satan I've been healed because the Bible says by his strengths I'm already healed and even if I die in this life I get the ultimate healing so you lose anyways I don't care anymore he tells you you're not strong enough to put up a good fight oh it is profession of your mouth you don't have to have some big strong brawny muscles all you have to do is say I am healed all I have to do is say I have the baptism Holy Ghost all you have to do is say I am a message believer this message of the hour all you have to do is say I am a Christian profession it's not strength and brains and Brownie and all that it's the strength to believe and confess it with your mouth you've talked you speak it you tell him who you are you you you quit saying already yeah yeah right right saying I I I I do have this and and I do make these mistakes and and I did saying yesterday and and we go on and we go on this Rabbit Trail we go on this Rabbit Trail and excuse The Voice we're getting on these rabbit Trails of I ain't I can't well my dad told me one time he said can't you never could do nothing and you know what can't never could do nothing but can can I can do this I can step out on the faith of God I can become a Believer if I'm not strong enough I can become strong enough if I have weak faith I can have weak faith if I'm lacking in this I I don't have to lack in it if I kneeling I need healing I have healing already the Bible already said it he told you you're not worthy oh you're so worthy he went to a cross to die and sacrifice himself for you that he would go to the grave and take your sin upon him that's how worthy you were oh he didn't do that for you I was saying shut up I'm tired of your voice let me get some duct tape put on your mouth let me put some duct tape of faith on your mouth let me put some duct tape or confession on your mouth you're going to shut up in my sight for Satan or I'm going to beat you down and I'm going to beat you down and you're going to hate being around me when I get out of bed you're going to start trembling when my toes Hit the Floor you're going to start trembling saying because I've had enough of and I'm going to confess it from this day forth from this day forth from this day forward say no more from this day for is making confession from this day forth tell him who you are and tell him what you need and that you already have it [Applause] it came to confession despite of the symptoms oh I'm feeling down today who cares praise God I'm saved praise God I'm in I'm in the battle for the Lord when he told you you're not loved why would he go to the cross if I wasn't loved why would he send me to church if I wasn't loved why would he give me a pastor to sit under if I wasn't loved why would he give me children if I wasn't loved why would he do this give me a job and give me money and all that if I'm not love not that science if you don't have a job and that we have different situations trials would go through but why would I care if I wasn't loved a lot of people don't care that don't feel like they're cared for they're going to try to end their life but he cares it says he cast all your burdens on me for I careth for you cast all your worries on me for I careth for you so the word tells us he cares oh when he told you you're not beautiful oh but I'm the bride of Christ he's not going to marry some ugly no good ragged dirt all over my face he's going to clean me up first if it takes that but when he presents me to the world like we were talking yesterday about the bride when when he presented when we present the bride she's beautiful I don't think I've ever seen an ugly bride she's all dressed in her white and she's all done up and and she stands there and she's radiated if you see a bride or even a new mother there's something that just radiates out of them there's a beauty that passes all understanding that this radiates out of a true bride of a true Holy Ghost filled lady that's walking down to meet her husband as the bride of Christ as we are truly filled with the Holy Ghost and we walk out and we're presented to the bride as a bride of Christ there's a beauty that radiates out of the bride and you can't put it down the world can't they have nothing like it they try to make themselves beautiful they try to they try to paint their faces they try I don't know why I'm going to not so many times this week but they're they try to do themselves up and and they instead of beauty they try to attract themselves to to their nakedness to their body and they try to show forth but that's that's reserved for for the husband in the secret Chambers but there's a beauty that goes beyond that there's a glow that comes out of it whether brother Branham said that that Hollywood is beautiful but the word of God glows I think that's how it goes I have a sore in my notes somewhere their beauty is Vanity they're saying look at me look at my beauty look at my body look at this look at that that that's vanity that's vanity but what we're looking at we want to show look at me as I show forth Christ look at me as I show forth his life his Beauty his humbleness his his meekness his long suffering his glory look at me as I show forth that I don't need to to come out and try to be a brawnian and my shirt split open and chest sticking out and all that and and chicken legs showing out with shorts and all that I don't need any of that I spend my time sitting in the word of God and there's a beauty that starts to build inside of you and when he tells you you're not beautiful say are you saying Christ isn't beautiful I'm him are you saying Jesus Christ isn't beautiful are you trying to say the word isn't beautiful it doesn't bring peace it doesn't bring joy it doesn't bring happiness oh I'm a living example of his Beauty why because I've eaten the word and I become one with it and now I'm prophesying to the world remember Revelations 10 11. I'm prophesying to the world I'm living a life to this world of the beauty of Jesus Christ I'm showing forth his Beauty I'm showing forth his love in my life and how I treat others and how I conduct myself and how I act or react with my kids how I can react with my wife how I act and react with my employer how I act and react with my employee fellow employees and all that each day in my life I'm showing forth Christ's Beauty now do we mess up yeah we mess up but we quickly repent and we turn it back and we say Lord forgive me I'll not do it again which we know we'll probably do it again because we're in Fallen flesh but it's not what he's looking at he's looking at that heart's desire he's looking at the beauty of the heart but Satan's going to point you to the flesh he's going to point you to your Fallen body he's going to point you to your Fallen mind and your Fallen spirit and he's going to tell you that's who you are and it's just an old fear tactic brother Branham and the unpardonable sin you know the Fallen body I had to have a cataract surgery now I got to read have reading glasses so there ain't no Beauty on this natural flesh but what Christ is doing but one day I'll have a glorified body and I won't need these sister who man you won't need those the unpardable sin in 1954 verse 31 it says that one sacrifice forever he made his offering giving his own life sit down at the right hand of the Majesty on high and we have a high priest setting in the Majesty of God in the presence of the great creator making intercessions Upon Our profession there were intercessions Upon Our professions or our confession he's making intercessions for that then he said in verse 19 having therefore Brethren boldness to enter to the holiest by the blood of Jesus so when he was died on the cross and that blood was shed and we come underneath that blood we have boldness now that we can enter into the holy is the holiest remember the veil was rent it was split open so that would hid the hallways of holies before in the law if you were to enter into that holiest of holies you would die if you weren't properly prepared for it but now it's been split and it's wide open and now we have the covering of the blood on us that when we need something we can boldly go in remember Esther didn't know who she was at the beginning after she was married to a two Xerxes and but she still prepared herself in the right way but when it came down to when this action had to be done she boldly went in found favor with Christ she had already prepared herself she had already taken on that messenger and went in that way the message of the hour the word of Christ and here we are we can go in boldly in the holiest of holies when we have a need when Satan's trying to pound you down he's trying to tell you you're worthless and trying to tell you you're no good trying to tell you that you'll amount to nothing we can boldly go before the throne into the Hoist of holies and he would say here in verse 33 in paragraph 33 says think of it no fear that's the greatest plague there is in the Christian church today is afraid the biggest plague of the Christian church is there afraid because they don't know who they are and they're so timid and they're let Satan beat him over the head was just a little tiniest thing the littlest tiniest mistake and all of a sudden you're lost the blood didn't lose its power when I was first saved so when I messed up over here it's not going to lose its power then either it's going to make me white as snow but the greatest plague is fear is to be afraid and the reason they're afraid is because they're not taught right and settled right on the gospel they come in under the guise of accepting Christ and his blood and accepting forgiveness like that then all of a sudden Satan says well you got to do this right you got to do that right you're going to have to go and bow down 10 times and walk backwards 10 times and you know you weren't really baptized right because you didn't go fast forward or whatever and and and you know and on and on and on the list goes on and on and on and on and saying to sit there and beat you down beat you down beat you down and but then you go over in Ephesians it says you are predestinated to be conformed Into His Image there's nothing we can do if we're predestinated it has to come to Prohibition so we can sit back and we can rest in that predestination because he's doing the work in US we can sit there and we can rest in that and we don't have to be afraid anymore when we make mistakes we don't have to be afraid when Satan tries to put some kind of evil upon us we don't have to be afraid when Satan tries to tell us that we're not good enough we don't have to be afraid when he tells us that we're not really his because he said he predestinates Those whom before knew he predestinated predestinated and we're all the way up to we're going to be going into a glorified body and I like this and I'm going to personalize this to you guys he says there's no reason why Harvest Time Bible Tabernacle couldn't be a beehive of a power of the power of God buzzing with the glory of God flying from everywhere it's a little tiny Church there is no reason you shouldn't be a Powerhouse of God if you keep listening to Satan telling you that you're no good telling that you're lost or whatever you'll never be a Powerhouse of God because you'll be so concerned about your own self that you'll be no good to the body of Christ he says the power of God buzzing with the glory of God flying from everywhere this little old hole in the wall here almost as known throughout the entire world this little spot you're setting in tonight because not of what William Branham but because of Jesus Christ not because of Dale Langston but because of Jesus Christ not because of the body of Believers here but because of Jesus Christ has been made preeminent and is put being put forth as the Supreme Being ruling over this church the Son of God the gospel that they're content that they've contended for no sir I had nothing to do with it not at all it was him who did it and made this place known throughout the world when it was nothing but a little fifteen hundred dollar structure something like that fixed up here with no floor but it's God Almighty Almighty Who does these things now we have boldness enter into the holistic by the blood of Jesus by a New and Living Way not the old way by a New and Living Way that was the dead way an order of the law but now we enter by grace through the Holy Spirit oh I hope you see it nothing that you could do the law was Works Touch not handle not taste not eat no meat keep sabbaths new moons all forms of worship that what man did what man did but in this New and Living Way it's nothing that we could do it's what he does for us by Grace we just accept it Grace Christ takes away the sin we believe that hear the gospel believe it accept it and then if we truly accept it from the death of our heart God gives us the Holy Ghost as a witness sounds real complicated doesn't it and I'm going to have to go and I'm going to have to not eat meat on this day I'm going to have to not do this over here and and I can't have any more steak or anything like wrong Church of being for that we gotta have a little fun right but a New and Living Way not justified by works not justified by the law but by the grace of God and accepting the work that he did on Calgary if we ever get that right in our mind we will have no fear because we'll know that because he saved us all the promises are ours every promise is ours if we ever come to that exact that perfect realization that he died on the cross to save us and we become him and he remember he said all that was in the father reported into Christ and all those Christ he poured into his bride so if everything that Christ is is poured into you you have access to everything you have access to a sound mind he says I give you a sound mind not a fear not of worry and I'm you can go look up the scriptures later and get the exact saying of it so what do we have to worry about Brian what do we have to worry about you know what it is a lot of times you get people out there and they they come to Christ and and they they love they love the gifts and they love the science and they love the Wonders all that and they become engaged to Christ and all they ever do is they stay engaged to Christ and all they do is they walk around engagement oh I'm Christ I'm Christ I'm Christ I'm Christ but they never go all the way and consummate the marriage there never will go all the way and go through the ceremony and become one with him and go in and lay themselves bare and lay themselves in an intimate way and become one with him but they stay in engagement and they wonder why I have so many troubles in my life they wonder why I have so many fears in my life they wonder why I have so many mind battles in my life because they haven't fully entered in and become one Christ they haven't consummated that marriage they haven't taken on his name but they like staying in his presence because being in his presence there is no other place to be that will make you feel so safe and so secure but they could never seem to get their mind around fear they can never seem to get their mind around it that they could be healed they never seem to get their mind around that they have the Holy Ghost because all they're doing is walking engagement engagement doesn't make you married completely means you have a relationship with him but you have not taken his name you have not taken on his likeness you have not taken on his his um all that he was you have you're afraid to take on the shame that he faced you're afraid to take on everything that he had to go through because when you marry him all of a sudden the sufferings that he suffered you suffered with him with everything that he went through you went through with him and you have to identify when he hung on the cross you have to identify yourself on there on the cross you have to I go to the cross with him you have to lay down all yourself and go to the cross with him and be willing to die to yourself like he was willing to die to himself and lay it all out for you now all of a sudden you're in engagement and all that but you don't want to go into marriage because you want to be able to flirt with this and you want to be able to flirt with the world over here but all of a sudden he's asking you to come into the bride chamber he's asking you to come into the full marriage and he wants you to identify with him as one and go to the Cross lay down all your wants lay down all your desires lay down all the worldly desires and go in and take on his word and take on his name and all sudden when you take on his name guess what you have to act like him because you are his representative on your Earth and if you truly love him you will not be afraid to rep be represented with him you will not be afraid to put his name out there you won't be afraid to write a check with his name on it and be identified with him oh I am Mrs Jesus Christ here's my check for healing here I Mrs Jesus Christ here's my check to overcome depression here's my G here's my check to overcome whatever it is in your life I stand Here identified with Christ I don't care what kind of name he has out here in the world I'm going to stand right here the world may ridicule they may make fun they may ask why you're doing this and why you're doing that I don't care I'm identified with Christ and all that he is I am fear you are a liar that is opened up to me I could step into that today if you haven't stepped into that fully today you step into it for you today do it today today today today don't wait tomorrow maybe too late walking out these doors maybe too late he may drop dead right here if you're just walking around engagement with the Lord you don't have a full relationship and the Satan has every right to put every fear upon you he has every right to torment you because you have no protection you have some partial protection you can get into a scene of Revival and go to a church meeting get all the fields and all the joy and all the tangles up and down your spine a lot and you'll have a little bit of victory for a few minutes but as soon as you walk out these doors guess what you're by yourself again it may last a week it may last a month but if you haven't went in and married him you're the subject of all back God testifying of his gifts so don't fear fear is of the devil Everything Jesus would say fear not fear not constantly fear not fear not is that right always fear not now God don't want you to fear he wants you to believe so every one of you believe with one Accord one Accord every one of you with one Accord all be believed imagine if you got everybody that says they're a believer to fully believe the word of God how powerful we would be Satan would not be able to stand we had walked into we'd have a convention meeting and I would think it was was it funny all he had to do was walk down the street and people repented because he had such a relationship with the Lord that brought fear upon the people about repentance upon the people just walking down the street you know each and every one of us have that same ability we let laodicea get that out of us what makes us any difference in the church age Messengers what makes us any different than any great Christian that was out there whether it be moody whether it be funny whether it be Sweeney whether whatever whatever it was whether it be Wesley healing praying for a horse that was lameed and getting right up and going on what makes us any different than nothing everything that they did is at our fingertips we can live a life that is so close to Christ that people would see the glow coming off of us for miles around and Satan's demons would flee just because the presence of God is so strong in our life that they would be so afraid to come around us and people would just start repenting just coming into your presence that is possible for you but Satan's devised the world to get us so distracted and so we got to do this and we got to go out here and we gotta we gotta do this for this person over here and and we got this entertainment we want to do and and we go and we go when we go and we forget our first and foremost thing is we're the pride of Christ and our first our call is to be on display our cause to walk out on display to this world think about that think about that if you're not on display you're backsliding you need to repent of it now and there are times that all of us backslide mother Brown said he backslide it ten thousand times a day or whatever a thousand times a day of the prophet backslood who are we he walked in vision he'd walk the story he'd see a vision he knew that he knew that he knew who God was we don't walk in Visions a lot of time and we walk by faith so much we can question our faith at times We can question who we are when we start listening to the Enemy by cause we're not getting into the word of God how do you become Christ you get into the word of God how do you become Christ you get in the message of the hour you start reading it you don't have to understand it you just get in that presence and when you have time and need of it he'll bring it back to you remember us you don't have to be a minister to get into the word of God and to read the message and all that you don't have to be able to break it down like a minister can you don't have to be able to break it down like brother Brandon did all he's asking you is to get into his presence when you sit there with your husband or your wife and a lot of times you get in the presence all you do is sit and you listen you may not say a single thing or he may just both sit there and you're just in the presence of each other and in that presence you're learning each other you're learning what the she likes she's learning what you like and but if you get busy sometimes you forget what they like sometimes you forget what Christ's like sometimes you forget that you are a Christ child and then that liar called fear can come around can influence your mind tell you you're not his tell you you're not saved tell your you're lost tell you're not healed tell you're going to die tomorrow tell you that you're blasphemy whatever it is fear he is a liar there's no need the Christian people seem to be back in a corner oh I'm afraid and this is from God's covenant with Abraham and his seed in 1956. why you ought to be the most freest people in the world oh brother Brown would I get in the millennium I ain't waiting for the Millennium I am right now we don't have to wait it is ours now all that was in Christ he pulled he has poured into us a lot of people they say oh I'll wait to the next Revival oh I'll wait until God does some kind of Supernatural side of my life no waiting you don't have to wait we don't have to wait until we're in a perfect body to know what Christ is we don't have to wait to know that the promises are you do not have to wait till tomorrow to get your healing you do not have to wait to get set free from depression anxiety fear whatever it is you do not have to wait till tomorrow today is the day of salvation it is yours today you step into you walk into it you see the vision in front of you if I seen a vision and I was thirsty and I seen water up ahead and it's not a mirage and I know it's water I think I'll go there tomorrow but I'm dying of thirst right now oh there's a house over there maybe they have some food I can eat or something well it looks like they're having a party or something I don't want it to serve but or no you're going to run up and you're going to knock on the door I've been in this desert for I'm gonna die you got some water why wait till tomorrow and die today is the day of salvation you don't have to wait to the Millennium to have healing you don't have to wait to the Millennium to have a sound mind it is yours today if you will accept it if you will believe it you accept it you believe it it is in your hands it's not in Christ's hands anymore he's presented it to you what will you do with Christ Jesus what will you do with him will you still walk around in a pity party oatmeal My Oh Me Oh my I can't do anything I'm not this I'm not that I'm listening to that demon of fear listen to that demon of Doubt telling you all this stuff or will you take the word of God and go boldly into the holy of holies go boldly Before the Throne of Christ and say Christ I have need of this Jesus I

have need I have need go before him boldly he wants you to come before him boldly he's sitting back here waiting for you to come boldly you step forward you step into the vision you step into the word you step into your place you go forth remember in the wedding the groom's standing up here he's waiting for the bride to come forth and she's back there and she can stay back there but until she walks forward there is no ceremony until she walks into the blessing there is no bride until she walks up here and says I do there is no bride and until you walk into that vision of your healing until you walk into that vision of your salvation until you walk into that vision of the spatulence of the Holy Spirit it is not yours until you walk into it and you accept it by faith and you ask him to come into your heart it is not yours you're just looking at the groom from a distance but you got to come forth and you've got to walk and you've got to take it with all that you have but Satan's going to try to knock you down along the way he's going to try to trip you up with trials he's going to try to trip you up with accidents in your house he's going to try to trip you out with your children backslide he's going to try to trip you up with anxiety he'll try to strip you over depression he'll try to ship your eye by putting sickness in your life but you step boldly for that Vision you had the vision before you you walk into you take Christ you run to him and whatever it takes you run to it you step into it don't care if he trips me a thousand times I don't care I'm going to get back up

word's been wide open and it's ours to take whatever you have need of if I need a little steak over here I'm going to take a little steak and I'll eat a little vegetable over here I'm going to take a

Demon of Torment keep you back you tell that demon a torment you can tell that demon of fear who you are and you walk away from them don't play with them say yeah you're right maybe I did this yesterday and I did that don't don't don't play around with it go boldly into the throne go boldly before him you run with all your might and you go and you take what you have need of no longer

let's Satan get you down don't sit there any longer if you do it's your own fault and you bring that upon yourself it's not the ministry's fault anymore it's not Christ's fault anymore he made the way he paid it you take a hold and if you're lacking in faith ask him who giveth liberally she's more than willing to get it all right oh but we listened to that demon of Torment whether it's in that demon of fear I listen to demon of fear for as many years a little testimony yeah we're warm I walked around in fear for years even preaching I was in fear I thought I was lost I thought I'd sin too much went away went too far across the line and all that and I walked with that demon of fear on my shoulder every single day I'd get up and that he was there I'd lay down he was there and I would give him a little room here and I made a little room for him I guess to come on into my life come on into my life and you know what I would read the scriptures in Hebrews chapter 6. they knew the truth and walked away and that really didn't fit me or heated into verse 10 26 he the senateth willfully oh man I would do I was to a point where listening to messages I was in the messages I knew that wasn't an end or knew of somebody that wasn't condemned all that I mean Satan had me wrapped around his finger and I remember sitting at I was going to work and I had a I had a nervous breakdown we'll just put it that way I had a nervous breakdown and I thought I was lost I was on the phone calling my pastor I was on the phone doing this that and and for years instead of just letting it putting it aside when I knew I hadn't I kept bringing it up in my mind I keep playing to it I'd keep listening to it and you know when you keep listening to it it just stays there it doesn't go anywhere I remember sitting and I decided I was listening to all the messages I started in 65 I was working my way backwards and I was coming to the Hebrew series and I knew I was going to be coming up to it was time to listen to Hebrews chapter 6. as I I'm working I'm in a room by myself and I'm like I'm going to put this on and accidentally put on Hebrews chapter 7 instead of six I was like you got another day you don't have to face that fear and I get in the van to go and I've got an hour and a half drive back to Lima I'm working in Columbus Ohio at Ohio State I got an hour and a half drive to go and Lord's like no you're listening to Hebrews 6 today I'm like no and I was refusing I was at for that much fear and he uh I stopped to get gas and you know when the Lord wants you to do something he'll make it unbearable it's finally I put the Hebrews 6 on that was my Deliverance I faced the fear I listened to it and they're like that has nothing to do with me and I was just afraid I let some little demon of fear sitting on my shoulder tell me did it go completely away then he'd come back and try he comes back and tries but I recognize it and like you say guilty behind me guilty behind me you think of you think of David I was in the Bible said I was telling brother Dale I do this devotional with some non-denominational and denominational I think there's a Catholic in there I do a devotional in the morning I was invited to join in read a devotional and then we discuss it and so it's kind of interesting because you get to hear a lot of different perspectives and then they're hearing a lot of stuff they've probably never heard before they have been introduced to the Statue of a perfume man yeah they were talking about fear was it fear or was it had to do with fear the good thing about David he come into the camp of the Israelites the Israelites were at war with the Philistines and they were afraid they were scared to death they had some Giants in their life they had some Giants of anxiety they had some Giants of of cancer they had some Giants of not being saved they had some Giants and not having the Holy Ghost in their lives and they were trying to work their their courage up and all that Here Comes This little tiny Shepherd boy into town he'd been out on the back side of the desert he had been listening to the Seven Seals he had been looking at the church ages he had been reading the message of the hour he'd been reading in his Bible it had been reading our opening scripture where it says there is no fear and love is Christ and he's been out there and he had a few Giants come in his life trying to steal his happiness trying to steal his Joy trying to steal his little children and he got out there and he he killed him and here he comes in and he hears this giant this giant of doubt in the camp this giant of fear in a camp proclaiming how he's going to beat the Israelites down he goes why aren't you guys doing this evening you imagine he's been he's been in the word he's prayed up he's been looking at it he's been watching it he's been that's his whole life has been just wrapped around that and he's been in the word every day and all of a sudden he comes in and these Israelites had gotten out of the out of the word and got out of the out of the line with Jehovah and they let a little fear of a giant of fear came into their camp and he steps forward and says I'll go fight him why because he had been in the word because he'd been listening to the message and when fear presented itself he could stand boldly before it and he could take the five stones of Jesus the five stones of Faith the five stones that that never all smooth that had made him and he could sit there and all he had to do was launch one Dart take that out and he didn't stop there either he said I'm tired of this fear I'm tired of this doubt I'm tired of the suppression I'm tired of this anxiety he said I'm going to take the enemy's word and I'm going to take that sword of his word and I'm going to cut his head off with his own his own devices I have no fear of you and he took that sword the enemy sword that seemed to be a giant sword bigger than him he took that fear like I I looked into my fear when I listened to Hebrews chapter 6 I stopped and I looked into that fear and I stepped into that fear and I took that same fear that he was trying to heap of me and I defeated the enemy that way David walked up to the that big giant of doubt that big giant of fear and took the fear that he was trying to kill him with and slew him for good once and for all you can do that this morning all you have to do is step into it all you have to do is accept it all you have to do is believe it quit listening to the enemy's doubts listening to what he tells you know he says he's given us a place of rest in Psalms 27 it says the Lord is my light and my salvation of Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and they fell Satan can't even stand against you if you're in the word if you're hidden in his presence if you hidden your life in his word he will stumble and he will fall he will try to get you down but he will stumble and he fall he cannot get a stronghold in your life when you are in the word when you are bathing in The Lord of Jesus Christ and you have taken on all him he cannot get to you he'll come up and he'll try to eat your flesh you'll try to eat your mind he'll try to take your joy he'll try to take your happiness away he'll try to take all that from you but he has to he'll stumble he'll fall when you hide yourself in the word of God though a whole should can't and he'll go back and get more enemies more demons and try to come at you on different different angles and all this and and all of a sudden you're all messed up and all that but if you stand there in his word he says though a host shouldn't Camp against him and my heart shall not fear your flesh May fear your mind may be fearful of all that but your heart your soul it won't be afraid death comes knocking on your door the Satan's trying to make you afraid you're ready to go you're ready to walk through that door you're happy you're joy and he can't understand why you're not afraid and you're shaking and all that when cancer comes to your life and you're not afraid of it and you're sitting there saying I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm Healed when depression comes to your life and you just take a stand against it and you rise up and you become happy and he starts to tell you you can't do this and that and you refuse him and you look back at him he doesn't understand it says my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and that's why I'd be confident one thing I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion and the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up by mine enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of joy I will sing yea I will sing praises unto the Lord don't give you the unconditional Covenant that God made with people don't give you permission to sin now remember that but I'm trying to get this fear knocked out of you you're always scared about something don't be scared God has promised God has to do it if you believe it if you're the Seed of Abraham someone said to me like the Baptist friends used to say what difference does it make the one that went off into eternal security they said why why don't make any difference to me I'm saved glory to God I can do what I want to do that doesn't show you're saved that's right that just shows that you're not saved that's right that's right if you're saved you don't want to do those things that's right so there that's not the fear of whether you believe God and are his out of you if you don't want to do it you're his means you're saved you must be born again what do we do what do we got to fear about we should be the freest happiest people there is anywhere and we don't have to guess about it God's in our midst and proves it that's right and it's according to his word and his spirit but when you this is in expectation but when you stand under Divine promise of God there is no fear in God that's right it's bound to be it's perfect it's never failed it will never fail because God cannot lie Fury is a liar he will take your breath stop you in your steps fear he is a liar he will rob you of your rest steal your happiness cast your fear in the fire what fire the fire of the Holy Ghost you cast your fear into the Holy Ghost because fear he is a liar they told you you were troubled you'll forever be alone no the presence of Christ is with me wheresoever I shall go I'm never alone but he'll try to isolate you and make you feel like God doesn't love you and that you are alone when he told you you should run away you'll never find a home oh how many times has he told you you should just walk away from the word God doesn't love you the people don't love you this person doesn't love you you'd be better off in the world and you'd have more friends in the world and and you'd be able to go to this party to do whatever you'd hang out with them he's told you you should run away he'll never find a home but I found a home in Christ my life has never been the same I would never know this church here if I hadn't found Christ and I feel just as home here as I do at my home Church when he told you you should run away you should never find a home when he told you you were dirty and you should be ashamed oh I was dirty once that I was washing the blood of Christ and I'm not ashamed of that blood when he told you it could be the one that Grace could never change I'll just look back at your life see where you were see where you're at today Grace has changed you think about shamgar everybody remember shamgar the little farmer fitting story for a pastor here the farmer shamgar he raised some grains and all that for his family they eat and all that but the Philistines every year would come in and take his happiness take his Joy try to take his life try to take everything that he had he got tired of it one day he said enough is enough and all he did is he took just what he had there a little Ox ago it's a little stick here 600 demons coming at him 600 Philistines coming at him he said I've had enough and he took that Ox go to Faith and all it takes is a little Mustard Seed of faith there it says the Mustard Seed if you had Faith the size of a mustard seed you could say to this mountain be plucked up and be thou removed and cast over here all sudden you got to get mad enough of that demon in your life you got to get tired of it enough that you're willing to stand there and die no matter what it takes you stand there if you got to be at the altar for three days straight you stay there you got to be in prayer for three days straight you stay there whatever it is you stay there don't just stop when it first starts to tingle don't get up but make sure you go all the way man I would I going back I think I mentioned it Wednesday when Satan was he was hounding me you don't have the Holy Spirit you don't have the Holy Spirit and you're going to have to get up there and you're going to have to walk in front of that group of people and you're gonna have to be embarrassed you're a minister and all this and and you're going to have to go up to before your pastor and tell them that you're battling this and all that and I remember the first time I tried to get rid of it I stayed for a few seconds a little emotion I get up and it was still there but this last time we had a prayer line and I said now or never I want to battle this all the rest of my life or or I'm going to go humble myself and I'm going to go before the congregation and I'm going to go off to brother Wayne I'm going to say I'm battling with this what he told me to do he told me to start confessing it thank you assistant he goes you confess it now Glory you confess it now you say it now I have the Holy Ghost and I was like I have the Holy Ghost a man the spirit hit me just like that three feet I said I was spinning around three feet in the air that wasn't me and that's been gone ever since you stand up you claim it you defeat Satan in your life your brother's not going to do it he can pray and put his shoulder against you but you have to be willing to die to yourself and put it before God and let him come in and do it shamgar decided I've had enough no more Satan you're not taking my grain my family's too valuable my peace is too valuable my joy is too valuable I'm taking a stand now and he went out there was all he had with an ox code just a little Mustard Seed of faith and he defeated 600 Philistines and saved his crop for that year you think those Philistines ever wanted to come back there oh one guy one little puny guy one little peony farmer guy just beat a 600 of our Philistines how did he do it he stood on the word of faith he stood on the word of God and he wasn't afraid anymore to claim it and to stand out there you must be born again what do we got to fear about what we should be the freest happiest people there is anywhere we don't have to guess about it God's in our midst and proves that that's right and it's according to his word and his spirit let's open the stand what do you have to be afraid of nothing it's yours he's already given it to you he went to the Cross he died he took the stripes on his back now it's in your hands what are you going to do with it you take it a gracious Heavenly Father Lord we stand here this morning Father in your presence Lord or knowing that

thought keep coming to me and I just want to mention it the messages were just amazing I'll feed on them for many days is Satan won't be coming to you if you were already his amen Satan would not be talking to you if you're already his if you were in the bar and you were serving Satan and you were uh you know of his family like when Jesus said you are of your father's the devil he's not talking to them they have no fear serving the devil the drunk going down the road that's completely stoned out of his mind serving the devil has absolutely no fear all right well fear it off because the fear is the demon it's the D it's the Heat it's the demon and I was so beautiful brother Mike brought that egg it's the he the he is the demon and all you got to do is do what Jesus did is tell him the word and it's so perfect I want to give you three examples you know what you say you're not loved you say God so loved you that he sent his son pay the price for you say you know just so beautiful amen you're not healed you said but but Satan haven't you read the Bible that by your stripes I'm Healed and say he said but you're not going to make it he said well Satan you haven't read Romans 8 24. or 32 I believe it's 32. you say you better read that pull that up that I'm already glorified you start preaching back to this he should've been saying I'm already glorified I'm already healed from Calvary it was the stripes and I'm already loved like that's not a question did you not know that part of the Bible saying Satan you better get God's word and read it we know he does but he can't believe it man amen hallelujah how did Jesus fight Satan he said but it's written but it's written I'm already glorified but he said you'll never be a but but it's written I'm already healed Satan but it's written that you'll never make but I'm already made it safe and I'm sorry I'm sorry right I'm not sorry oh wow but you won't have enough to eat he said but I've been eating every day this man don't live on just bread alone but the word of God Satan you you've got to get that Bible and get reading that Bible scene so you know what you're talking about hallelujah oh this is this is just this

in the week it's just it was just it was just wonderful really God bless you we'll have brother Matt foreign I'd just like to share something with you that also came with me and I I miss this and I just want to give Satan a black guy you know my brother Mike Allen was preaching last night he talked about how when Esther came to the king and he said ask her I'll give you even half my kingdom Kingdom and I was thinking on this Gods actually give us all these and if you figure on how brother Mike finished and I'm sure my brother Mike picked that up said you know when Esther came to the king and said will you change your life brother Mike said he can't change it but the king gave Esther the power to write her own law in the spoken word of Esther that overruled the Old Law that was a hundred percent hallelujah amen why why are you crying out to me just speaking the prophet said the word is in the bride and she will know what he what's done with it you don't have to ask God everything you don't have to ask God everything you write your own law hallelujah amen God bless you all you dismissal [Music]
