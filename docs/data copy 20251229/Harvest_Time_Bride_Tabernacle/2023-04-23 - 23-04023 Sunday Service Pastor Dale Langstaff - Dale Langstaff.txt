for something to read in your Bible this week read first Peter it was amazing I I just was losing control on which verses to read I didn't think I should read the whole chapter and it was just amazing

understanding you're never gonna comprehend this piece when you're getting shot at you're just like oh it's fine the world's looking at you like amen oh wow I just enjoy his word this morning and just wow just an amazing amen all scripture is given for by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine reproof for correction and for instruction in righteousness in 17 that the man of God may be perfect perfect God expects us to be perfect his word will make us perfect if we get to where we should be you'll be perfect you might be dying every minute but you'll still be perfect Paul said I Die daily but brother Dale has to die every minute and that to keep perfect amen that's how you keep perfect amen and thoroughly finished unto all good works first Peter 2 first Peter 2 and 9 and this was just beautiful chapters first Peter 2 and 3. it was first Peter three I just my goodness you could have just preached straight there for a couple weeks it was just amazing but first Peter 2 and nine Mike you're a chosen generation by God a royal priesthood he made you that and a holy nation that kingdom of God look at look at the Lord's Prayer thy kingdom come right here oh it's it's just unbelievable Hallelujah A peculiar people that ye shall show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Marvelous Light Lord Jesus we ask you to bless your word and bless your bride in the beautiful people that you've blessed us friends with Lord Jesus bless them supernaturally in a Divine Way that only you can do in your name we pray amen you may have your seats this morning and I tell you I it's just good to be here and good to good to serve a God that you know who you're serving and and just uh it's just amazing amen there's just no other way to explain it you know there's just no other way Hallelujah yes we were gone this week and we just thank God for safety and just pray for Jared looks like you you must have went with them amen uh for safety where they're at and just uh we the Wayne got to meet a lot of uh of a good friends that she someone hadn't probably seen for 40 even 40 years it's been a very very long time some she had went to Bible school with before she even met me we met oh there's Elliot back there amen amen hallelujah it's just so beautifully but you know we want to be a testimony and I mentioned that last Sunday and I you know yourselves too have seen the scene uh a one-man uh Mission you know it's all of us we should all let our light shine amen you can't make a horse drink water but you want that horse to see the light you want that horse to see the light you want him to see the water you know if I have a sick calf or something I'll put my hand in the water trough and I'll go it's right there it's right there I'll put you right up to it amen and we should be that way you know you know I I fear sometimes I mean I think God fears sometimes that we've got the truth and we've kept it to ourselves now I I'm not saying throw your Pearls Before Swine I'm not saying that but the prophet said preach me or leave me a message not preach me anymore and you can just go and you know you see that I mentioned that last Sunday you see that you go somewhere your people see it and they should not just see it and the sisters should not they should not they will but they should not I tell you what I mean by that and I I don't know where I'm going this morning but it'll be in God's word I promise you that but but we need to have such an atmosphere Christ you know when we're in Christ we're just completely surrendered and and see we don't have to have our own way I mean it's it's just beautiful this word of God you know Proverbs and we're going to go into it and maybe before I do I want to tell a little story just to lay a foundation the brother toured it at the funeral and and I really felt I wish Jared was here to see it here so you're gonna have to tell them Julie or or tell him to listen to the first uh two minutes or something but uh uh you know the brother that preached the funeral the brother that died was 91. he taught public school for 50 years at Jay County 50 years full-time teacher when he retired he continued to teach as a full-time substitute after 50 years and then he finished by teaching the special needs amen and he'd give his heart he'd serve the Lord for I think 71 years he got saved right about the time he got married and just you know when you live a long life and so the man preached in the funeral was an old man he didn't have a lot of hair on his head but he was a young boy when this man was married so here he told the story he said we come over to Evelyn's what was this thing Eugene and Evelyn's house and he said now Gene and Evelyn are married and this boy that's preaching the funeral he's in his 70s but he was just a wee little work he said they come over and he said Gina Dublin's boys and they went out and they were playing and all the ladies were in the house uh I said I wasn't going to preach on kids anymore but I am going to get off it and the kids were outside and all the ladies were in the house and they said after a minute the lady saw it you know we maybe should check on those three boys and so they stuck to one of the sisters stuck their head out the door and they said uh you know hollered Adam they heard some noise in rockets and they say hey what are you doing well you know maybe you better come in the house so the kids come in the house and they had a wonderful day and the other people went home this man he's like 75 telling the story but he was like five and so after they got home his mom called back to to uh uh Evelyn and he said Evelyn he said you know do you and Gene have any Windows broken in your chicken coop and Evelyn said she said oh no she said Gene just fixed all those windows because we're getting chickens in a couple days know where I'm going I said oh no no no Gene just fixed those windows we're getting chickens in a couple days and he needed all the windows fixed and this this woman or this man preaching that's in his 70s style it was just a little kid he said you maybe better go take a walk to your chicken coop and she said okay yeah I'll go take a walk to the chicken coop and as The Story Goes that these three boys were outside and they were playing uh Cowboys and Indians and the Indians were coming in off the fields and out of the bushes and the boys didn't want the Indians to get in the chicken coop so they broke 21 Windows sticking their bone arrows and guns out so they could shoot the Indians through the window the windows that Eugene had just made sure he'd put them all in just a day or two ago because they had chickens coming in two days and you know that brother never said they got the rod because see those boys were doing what boys do boys play and boys were doing exactly what they were born to do was play Cowboys and Indians and the man said to himself in the story he said you know I think my dad bought the windows for Eugene and he had to put them in the second time and this is how he finished this thing he said Eugene invested in me God invested in you God left the splendors of Heaven to come to a pig pen called Earth to invest in brother Dale to invest in a bride and as much as you invest in somebody will be what your reward is and this man ministering said I am today what the investment was put in on me as a little boy and it wasn't by a beating wow God help me you know and I said last Sunday you know we tried to visit people and new people and we've been out it was out this week and and different things and the land got to see people and you know Luann's seeing people that oh she went to Youth Camp the Youth Camp that she went to as a wee girl before she was even a youth no it was I was a couple days ago it's still going on you know and I stood back and watch those sisters of the second generation and line up my wife and hug her I said honey we need to meet them for supper someday and just let them know if something comes up what God's revealed about it it won't be in a church service but you know things have a way of coming out in that amen God help us to let our light help us to invest in people help us not to be so busy building our bank account so we never visit people man we just we got to different people even before we left you know and remember the new man that's been coming on Wednesday night last Wednesday was the first time in like five weeks he missed amen and just you know it's it's not it's just God I mean it's not us don't have nothing man we're just remember Lauren and Sheila we had a wonderful time with them went out for dinner breakfast and and they've kind of been dealing with health you know it's too bad you know and he had an ear infection and believe me I know what that felt like and just but just remember them amen it's just it it's called compassion and God had a lot of that bro you want to believe for brother Dale why I was in the pig pen on beautiful oh he said I still call you mine amen I still love you and that God help me God help me amen God really amen this this is uh this is this this is not this ain't about church and this ain't about an individual this is about a character we're only taking that with us character God give me your character to be christ-like that even when people will notice my wife but they'll notice the atmosphere you know the Bible talks about how wives are supposed to love and submit and obey their husbands but God told me something on that scripture and just studying amen they're doing that they're doing a fine job even the ways that aren't because they're just following the lead of the husbands that aren't obeying and following God any husband that's obeying and following God like they're supposed to and like the scripture say your wife will have no problem doing likewise but there's a lot of fat men uh-huh that don't deserve huh see and she's the weaker vessel and you expect her to do something that you don't do either you think whoa I'm God oh God you're a long ways from God amen as you surrender and submit to Jehovah she'll have a perfect example how to surrender to you it won't even be you because it's not you see you died we can preach on forget the wives let's preach on the husbands if we get the husbands right the wives will be perfect see that's why Christ's bride can be perfect because the husband here in this case is perfect amen I had nobody had problem following Christ because he's perfect whoa Wow Let's go to first Peter three and one to six and and you know I I just I'm really scattered I I'm sorry I just I I get stuff and I just I hardly know how to put it or where to put it I just pray God just makes sense of of what he gives us amen but I believe God's gonna give us peace in this world that's that's that's incredible and I encourage you to fellowship with non-believers or weak Believers or remember Stephen Cassie I need to go we got to go see John Blackman amen oh my goodness I think I could be gone almost almost every day of the week my like I you know I miss somebody and I feel like but it's uh and but but see you're investing it's not it's not it's about price you're showing them and see like we we're expect we expect people like you know I don't want to name names but we expect like Steve and Cassie to be like McDonald's drive-through the hamburger is already warm they're already saved filled with the Holy Ghost praise God handed out the window and everything no no no no no this is a journey it took me 55 years just to become semi-normal no because when I was a baby believe me I stayed a baby a long time spiritually I was drinking milk forever you getting what I'm saying but so but why do we expect other people to be just just love them and guide them and show them and and admonish them and and teach them and be right there beside them and when they stumble them fall you know Luanne was doing that this week you know one of her brothers and his wife was saying that they'd been going to a lot of the churches around the meant you know the atmosphere is against God you know I don't know if you know that in North America it's not in Africa but it isn't and she said multiple churches in the area whole towns like no church had pastors look there's no one Glenn was telling me about churches she went to as her mom I know I I that's what I said brother man I said wow the way I said me and my mom went to church he said there was a pastor's wife my mom and me and I went wow what would be if you and your mom didn't show up who was there whoa huh God help us Amen to admonish you know God didn't give us this good present to keep to ourselves I mean it's for us but we're teaching meant not you know what I mean amen God help us God help us we can have peace and and uh surrender and and it's just beautiful I mean this gospel is beautiful but oh anyway back to the wind you know her brother said you know something that was you know it was good and bad at the same time you know what I'm saying and Lil Wayne said well you know and she just quoted the scripture to him she said me and my wife are going to these churches and me and my wife Minister and she said what's wrong with you you can preach see that's aligning up the word that's your brother you know we didn't go into oh you know to see if you offend somebody you could have went in oh the Bible said don't you know the what no of course not we know that but they don't so see there's little ways that you can amen help us Jesus amen first Peter 3 and I'm going to read one to six and here we already got into this amen and just how we're talking and I'm going to read some it uh scriptures on peace and just see where God takes us this morning but likewise wives be subjective to your own husbands now see we already said that but if the husbands would get subjective to God it'd be a piece of cake that's called reverse Mass man we're not preaching our lives this morning many miles from it yeah the day May that if any obey not the word that they may be without the word be won by the conversation of the wife I wonder if that would apply with the husband too of course it was uh-huh husbands have no scriptures to be rude and they have a whole lot to submit Die daily humble patient kind wow hey man you know the Bible says that uh how does that say it I'm just this is fresh this the Bible says that a a word in Grace or a word in kindness sends turns away Wrath that's good for men too oh honey bless God uh-huh wow be careful who we've seen John and Laura Garrett too yesterday coming back and they send you their greetings amen Hallelujah may God help us amen and why we Behold our chaste conversation coupled with fear this is good for ministers too thank you Vanessa amen that's the truth amen you know when you know when you read first Peter three the other well I'd hugely encourage you to read first Peter 3 chapter there's there's a lot of good you just need to read a burst an hour kind of let it soak in amen those who are doing you see we're talking about the beauty of Christ and and see this is a mystery amen and what we're looking into and what I got up here my iPad was it was proverbs 31 is who can find a virtuous woman but we're not just talking about in the flesh I mean the flesh is fine but that's the only type of the spirit who are we a virtuous woman there's a lot of stuff that goes with that amen God help me who's adorning let it not be of the outward adorning and painted embroidered a hair and a wearing of gold and putting on of apparel and people would take this right out of contacts and stop there but watch this here this is this is a mystery but let it be the hidden man notice it never said woman but let it be the hidden man of the heart and in that which is not corruptable but even the ornaments of a mink and a quiet spear which is in the sight of God a great price now I want to just go slow here this is I hope this is all right I'm this is just this ain't Revival this is just teaching this scripture said men you know men don't normally Adorn themselves with gold normally the scriptures preached about women but the Bible said men see when I go to the restaurant the women are the people in the restaurant they don't see my long hair and they don't see my dress so I look like a man like they would recognize my wife but they can pick up your quiet and meat spirit oh I tell you what you say well maybe not if you don't the waitress sure can the people you're with sure Ken amen for after this matter in Old Times the holy women also who trusted in God Adorn themselves being subject to their own husbands that's also us being subject to Christ men being subject the five-fold ministry being subject to Christ amen the fivefold ministry have nothing to offer but Christ amen God help us and even Sarah when she obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters ye are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazing man that's not talking just for the Sisters this morning let's talk in spiritually who are we the daughters of a we're the children of Abraham father Abraham amen this ain't just talking women here spiritually speaking amen and God wants us to have this inner beauty that you just no I never and my preaching about myself this morning please don't get that I'm actually preaching about this this hidden piece and this hidden Beauty you know I never before in my life went someplace where the the owner of the funeral home made such a big deal about the best that I wear that Luanne makes he wanted Luanne to move to Indiana and have all his clothes and make vests so he could do funerals every time we went in the funeral home he spoke to me Adorn yourself in a way it's an atmosphere of Christ God help us God help us let's turn to proverbs 31. and we're going to read that scripture amen and just uh fine see let me read a quote while you're pulling that up he said here why are people so tossed about he said now you know that that we're a resting price that a Christian is a a true born-again Christian can rest his faith his or hers upon the unmovable unmovable unmovable by foreign minister no no no I didn't say that the unmovable word of God the all scriptures given for recruitment you know in many of these scriptures when I was printing out quotes I said this don't have no bearing on our church because because you're already converted man you know the prophet he said many when he was preaching many times he said now this ain't for you here church this is just going on the tape you know he said I'm not preaching to you sisters this is worldly spirits amen and I was praying quotes off and I'm like our sisters it's not the but maybe somebody or something that would bring it to remembrance and you share it with somebody else said amen amen God help us amen here he said on the movable face he said by the True Believer his faith rests solidly on the onshifting as he approaches the word of God he said and I Christian the faith is based solidly upon rest in this day and age that's a huge huge thing man we traveled in the states and just you know we're not going to get into it but amen it's rest and peace in this day is not the norm hello Hallelujah he said uh Christians Christians now watch this this is powerful Christians we got Christians here this morning amen sure if we died that I'm sorry I shouldn't even that forgive me Christians are not tossed about I'm preaching to myself he said you know Christians are not tossed about toss the boat they're not afraid they're not living in fear they're not they're not unsettled they're not you know they're not upset well I'm really preaching to myself no I better change the subject uh you know what I mean because see it don't matter what happens it don't matter if you know it don't matter if you lose your job or you have a flat tire you know or you see me or you know the beans don't get planted or do or it rains or don't see because we're just on a holiday you know I I my our best holidays were the holidays never you know if you were taking any advice from me never book a holiday in advance like where today you're at this cabin and the next day you're at the next cabinet and the next day what are you gonna do if the plane crashes you've already paid for that cabinet our best holidays where you just take off and you drive till you get tired and when you see a cabin looks good you just whip in and buy room if you don't like it you just keep on going see the footsteps so I'm just making a comparison but see we got our life so planned that if God changes our plan we're like ah amen Christians are not Christian doesn't run from twice to place oh ouch a Christian doesn't Christian you know you know I I printed a bunch of quotes you know I mentioned yes last Sunday about the real dollar and the phony dollar and just show me Christ I studied on that this week [Music] there's a lot of impersonations [Music] a lot of impersonations Christianity but the prophet said it like this he said you can't be you can't you can't be you can't be become a member of a church you're born into it and see if you're born into a family brother Matt your daughters cannot impersonate you it just is just born it just it just happens they can't even cover it up amen you getting what I'm saying but that's the same price see we got a lot of people pretending to be in the family but you can adopt kids but they're going to look different to me or they're going to act different you you may love them to death but they're still not born amen Christians don't Foster fume or worry about anything or things before so we would change our prayer meeting instead of saying God give us rain or God give us a job we just say God you know arnique wow he said a Christian rest it's all over it's all finished just like the scripture says you're already in God's eyes I know you don't believe this but I'm just going to tell you what the Bible says and God's actually you're already glorified because he he knows the end of the story yeah it's already finished so watch what he says here he says a Christian rest it's already over it's all finished for the believer at Calvary that's right he said oh the sickness may come and the disappointment may come and you could put in anything in there you may have a flat tire lose your job you know kick the dog or don't kick the dog but I mean the dog might bite you or something amen but a Christian just says oh it's all right but a Christian rest knowing this that God is able to keep that which he has committed till that day amen there oh man it's beautiful he said knowing that the thing look at like how the prophet said he said when when God sealed the train car it was sealed to the arrival of the nobody has authority to break that seal amen you may come off the tracks but it's still sealed he said you know the Bible says you know what will separate us from the love of Christ famine and it goes under all these things and this is what he's talking about he said neither the matter it looks like whether it's sickness or sorrow or death there's neither starvation or anything can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus because you're at rest brother Dale's still working on that part he said that old ship the toss but the anchor holds amen I mentioned that last Sunday I'd read that quote I knew it from memory man God help us God help us to get to this point amen and here when the Bible in Proverbs is talking about a virtuous woman here here we're looking at the worlds looking at even spiritually man that's why Christ will never leave you here to be persecuted because he sees the value of you he's he's he sees the character the character you know the prophet talked about the in the beauty the outward beauty is vain Beauty was of the devil the devil was the beautiful angel amen all natural beauty the character his bride who can find a virtuous woman for his price is far above rubies the heart of her husband does safely trust in her see now you can just compare that to Christ so that she shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life and she will seek seeketh she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands man just put spiritual onto this working for the kingdom of God and God trusted in you just put spiritual thinking caps on this amen I mean it's got to type both ways amen and she like she's like the merchant ships that she bringeth her food from a fire and she raises amen she raises also while it is night and giveth meat to her household in her portion to her maiden she's considered the field and giveth it buys it and with the fruit of her hands she planteth the vineyard man God don't have a lazy bride a character of Rights spiritually speaking amen God never gave us all this to keep it hit it under a bushel amen she girdeth her Lords and strengths in his her arms and she is perceived by the merchants is good or her merchandise is perceived is good her candles goeth not out at night She lays her hand to the spindle in her hands holdeth to stop and she stretches out her hand to the poor yay she reaches forth her hands to the needy she is not afraid of the snow for her household not afraid of even politics of the world matter for her household where she at her household is clothed with Scarlet she makes herself clothing and task freeze their clothing is silk and purple her husband is known in the gates Christ Jesus is known in the world by you oh you thought they read the Bible are you kidding that's the one with the dust up remember the story about the pastor that went by and he came back a year later and the wife was concerned that the pastor has told us her silver spoon he said no I just put it in your Bible a year later amen Jamaicans are covering the fast free and her clothes are so oh sorry her husband is thrown in the gates and when he sitteth among the Elders of the land see maketh fine linen and dwelleth in it and delivereth girdles on to the merchants strength and honor spiritually speaking is our Beauty strength and honor in Christ Jesus is her clothing and she shall rejoice in the time to come she opens her mouth with wisdom in her tongue the law of kindness she looketh well to the waist of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness Hallelujah her children rise up and call her blessed and her husband also for he Praises her see how this is Blended together and the family Hallelujah and many of the daughters daughters have done virtuous but ye thou Excel them all favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but the woman that feareth the Lord she shall be praised give the fruit of our hands and her own works praise her in the gates now what are you going to have in your crown when you get to heaven would the prophet say the greatest desire you should have sea Souls what have you done for Christ what did our Prophet say when he was nearing 55 he said I haven't done near enough what I should have done I need another amen and you think of his life amen God help us God help us amen amen if we look at some scriptures talking about these these verses see see you know that we learned this and we mentioned this about the the the the the phony dollar and the money and and not dwelling on the phony but everything's safe and Satan can't create nothing God created everything and Satan's trying to imitate everything you know you you just you just think on that for a second and I got I I pulled up some quotes for that and we might go into that but everything God did Satan's come the prophet said that God came out with news worship and dance Satan come out with rock and roll and perversion thanks he didn't create it he didn't even have the idea he got it from God amen you know I I just recently you know this is just beauty high Fallout God will will minister to you just recently brother Matt I was watching a video and and the government or the police or the army or whatever they come out with the new light and it's supposed to be a really special life think of perversion Satan can't create nothing this thing of the pillar of fire when Paul Saul was going down the road and the pillar of Fire come out and he fell down and was crippled blindly okay think of the pillar of fire when God called the children of Israelites out of Egypt are you with me and at night time God put something between them and Satan's just catching on and he's coming out with that fire you know what they call it brother man they call it the puke light so if you're resisting arrest if you're resisting giving your heart to God the pillar of Fire fill their fire since the beginning of time what about the pillar of fire when Moses refused to go to Egypt deliver the children of Israel remember the burning bush remember the bush didn't burn huh remember the pillar of fire over our prophet the god allowed to be photographed so God don't change you know the same pillar fired it ain't gone away but Satan's trying to come out with its own pillar fight and they call it the puke light because if you're risking arrest when they Shine the Light on you it'll it'll do exactly what God did with Paul Saul on the road it'll bring your rate to your knees and you because when I read that I decided you old devil the old devil God said that under the power of conviction for thousands of years tonight but you've got to recognize all these things that you know there was multiple things that here that I can't even remember all that that Satan you know multiple things anything that God did Satan tried to talk you know they said Hollywood shines but the bride gloves it's a big difference big big difference you know in Colossians 3 15. just reading a couple scriptures on peace he said let the peace of God rule your hearts you'll have no trouble following the scriptures surrendering to the pillar of Fire if this peace of God rules your heart which also you are called into one body and be ye thankful wow see we're living in a world that don't want to surrender or have anything over them amen no no control and that's perversion they're not they won't surrender to God but they'll surrender to Satan and they think they're free you're kidding me they won't pay they won't support God's kingdom but they'll go out and support the drug trade don't think that way is easier because that way Satan eats his own Amen Let the Peace of God rule rule your hearts oh that's beautiful and now here in Romans 15 13 He said now the god of Hope fill your filled with all the joy at peace in believing so you have to believe it and that in believing that ye are about abound in Hope and through the power of the Holy Ghost the let the god of Hope fill you with peace in believing God gives you a chance Amen to believe him and one more scripture on peace just just finishing that just to go along with our thing in Psalms 4 8 talks about I will both lay me down in peace and then rest for thou Lord only make us to dwell in deceit Amen in a world that's gone completely insane he can be at rest because God is still on the throne and man God God's completely in control amen that Satan all these governments are just a tool in his hand amen oh praise you God Hallelujah amen thank you Lord Jesus amen just looking amen just going to read a quote on impersonations here here's people you know when the prophet was here everybody thought that his you know Discerning the hearts of men was meddled the the deceptively I can't even say it amen and we know and and just mocking God Amen and here here's the prophet he said he said we know that the devil has impersonators for the real thing that God has see everything that God has Satan comes in with an impersonator same with the ministry of man Believers all these things amen all the things that God made Satan come in and perverted he said they always have he said they had they had James and jambres and when Moses was there Moses and Aaron he said they had Simon the sorcery and when Philip went down to do the healing he said they always were pro and con he said they've always had this so Jesus comes and when all the negative is taken away he said here here you go he said dance was first orchestrated in the Bible and he said the Devils took it separated it separation from human and families certainly sees all these things singing praising God imagine the devil took it made a boogly Wiggly Hallelujah Satan copying Christ Satan's trying to give you peace that only Christ can give you amen he's trying to give you this cheap worldly peace in a country or in a government or in a bank account or in a relationship amen that only comes from Christ you'll never be happy until you're in Christ amen let's go to Second Timothy or Titus sorry second Titus 2 3-5 and Hallelujah Prophet talking about Satan Beauty was vain sinned sin is beautiful but only for a season God help us not to be sucked in by the Satan's devices amen hallelujah here's here's uh the prophet and the prophet says you know I said before this don't apply to you sisters here not even not even remotely but it was the spirit of the age that was on the worldly backslidden women not sisters the spirit of the age and here's a woman that was out and and here's the prophet it says he was talking to her and here here this is how the lady talks to the prophet she said now would you shut your mouth for I'm the one doing it that's your prophet see despairing you know and he talked about how they were doing it and how you know when women get out of the kitchen they're out of the will of God and and to be obedient you know he talked about the Bible traits amen you know for the marriage vows was to obey their husbands now we already went into that first the husbands have to obey God I mean that's why the Bible says so clearly never never never don't dare you be unequally yoked together it'll be hell on Earth that you never marry an unbeliever never amen because see that man has to be subject to God and then you'll have no trouble being subject under him amen Christ and he says some strong things here strong strong things and here he says he said you know he said I know this Scourge but he said it's a gospel pill that will open your spiritual digestive tract and if you'll let the Holy Ghost sweep through it'll make you a different person if you will only believe it whoa he said that's what the Bible says and you can never here he goes on he says that's what the Bible says now can you hear this he he's saying this is the question or he says is your ear already closed up amen God help us not to have our ears closed up to the spirit of God Amen and really all he's saying is that here that you know when the Modern Woman came out during the after the war and become out from underneath headship and had her own bank account and went to work and became the head of the house put on slacks amen God help us he's here he says in Genesis 16 and just carrying on the same quote in the same these are all tied to this here he says God told Eve he said because you listen to the serpent instead of your husband he will rule you all the days of your life he said let her be an obedience obedience but we all have to be in obedience to the word okay that's why you don't never want a husband that ain't you want to know upside down he's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen here when we go into Titus 2 3-5 he said here he's talking and this was our whole thought was see God uses humans to fulfill his will and this is really don't apply to our church but we're just going through the the you know the the word of God Amen and it's all for our good even though there's not an issue here at all but here watch how God uses sisters he said the age women likewise that they would behave as becometh holiness and not false accusers not given too much wine teachers of good things and that they may teach oh I didn't think women could teach the women could teach that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands as their husband loves God and to love their children you mean the older sisters are told younger sisters love each other you definitely don't apply it here but you see this is in the Bible and that's why you see in some message churches Things Fall Apart because things are never taught or it's not encouraged or it's just plain not old baby they'll love their children and to be discreet and Chase and keepers of home and good oh that's actually in the Bible the prophet was dealing when he said that he said if a sister got out of her kitchen she was out of the will of God beekeepers of the home good and obedient to her own husbands that the word of God may not be blasphemed Hallelujah God help us and young men also young men likewise exhort to be sober minded and in all things choosing thyself a pattern of good works and in doctrines showing uncorruptness gravity sincerity eight and a sound speech that cannot be condemned man if our men were this perfect there'd be no problem God help me that that he that is of the contrite part may be see that a shame part has become normal see it all goes beautiful together you know you know and I miss the scripture but somewhere in here it and I and I read it this morning I said you know this ain't just about wives being submissive to their husbands and kids being submissive to both the Bible says we all be submissive to one another oh see we're all going to be submissive to one another as unto Christ amen see this has come together beautifully in the word of God Amen I don't think we've got there yet that's in Ephesians 5. God help us where was I having no evil thing to say of you you know when the prophet picked deacons in this church they went out to the town to see if the problem foreign Bible verse 10. not help me out here honey prolong me but during all good that they may Adorn the doctrine of God our savior in all things see teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we shall live soberly and righteous and godly in this present world that's an amazing thing you know one thing when we went to this funeral and we were in the states and that one thing my wife said she said he said I cannot believe how people changed you know what I mean amen it's because they never stayed with their rest the Holy Ghost they never stayed with the rest of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost never changed so you know what happened they left God help us God God help us amen let's turn to Ephesians 5. and we'll read some scriptures Aaron and maybe we'll we'll close with there to just see what God leads us I just many quotes and almost more quotes than you could could read amen just uh God help us I believe it's good sometimes to look in these scriptures that you don't normally hear in a Revival or at a camp meeting this isn't something that you would preach in a camp meeting setting or different things but you know uh all things can be done in love and kindness and doctrine of the Bible amen and and and God has a purpose for everybody no one you say well what does God no God has you placed in the body you got sisters that have lived their life and their their they have a lot of wisdom and they can go to a younger family and say you know I did this it might work for you amen amen God help us Ephesians 5 Amy let me pull it up myself Hallelujah God help us here we see more teaching and this Paul teaching us how we're supposed to live in this world Amen we got to be peculiar to be a witness people aren't going to listen to what is the the the the people in laodicea and the people that you rub shoulders with are used to everybody looking them straight in the eye and lying okay so they're not even you can look at them brother Mike and say well Jesus Loves You Jesus Paid well well they just listen to the politician that said that he was going to lower their taxes and he never did it and you know and all these things see man and so they they're they're they're living in a world of of accepting lies and they believe a lie and even if people came here this morning I would say something they would say well he's probably lying but when you live on my life and they see with their own two eyeballs that you're a peculiar and you're different and your atmosphere and you're that you can't lie that amen neither can you live it without him living in you amen watch how Ephesians 5 1 goes he said that ye may be followers of God as dear children but wait a minute I thought we were growing men amen God's looking at us to follow him as you expect your children you know you wonder why your children don't obey maybe they watch how you are at home for me for any of us Matt do they see you obey God when it hurts because see when you want your kids to obey and they don't obey that's because it hurts them but when it hurts me do they see me surrender for that followers of God as dear children that's for brother Dale and walk in love as Christ has also loved us and has given himself for us in an offering and a sacrifice to God as sweet smelling sweet savor sweet smelling saver that's like when your kids are just doing what kids do you know when kids are defending themselves from the Indians coming you don't have to get to The Rock because if they didn't do that they want to be kids see like what I'm trying to say is we need to have we need to have wisdom and character not just how you treat your families but how we treat each other and then how we treat our neighbors in in trying to witness to them to Christ don't throw your pearls don't you know if you're going to a neighbor that hasn't been to church in their life you know I mean yes we God sent a prophet yes the prophet through God through a prophet revealed the secrets of the scripture but don't tell them that just start out with with milk in a spoon at least let that be your second say you know Jesus came and died on the cross and Senator profit to reveal the secrets of what this all means you know because if you throw a kid's steak you know I'll have the most tender steak but if we try to feed a baby steak he's gonna choke head that amen but at the same time we don't also want to stay there's Babies we have to mature let's go up to verse 11 Amy these are also an amazing chapter as I'm studying just I put different ones down and just as a highlight and have no fellowship with the unfruitful work of Darkness but rather reprove them be careful who you fellowship with man you can go and be a witness but if it's your every Friday night occurrence you know if you're out with the boys or you're going out with the girls and they don't have a relationship with Christ you know be careful you can't be unequally yoked with unbelief be careful yes I'm not you know it's a paradox I'm saying don't hide it under a bushel but don't move in amen for it is a shame even to speak these things which are done and them in secret whoa that would say never listen to anything public that spoke volumes to me for it's a shame to dwell on the sights of the evil it's a shame it's what the scripture says for it's a shame to speak of these things which are done of them even in secret amen that's why I said you know show me cracks you know I I pray I pray to God with God's help that that we'll we'll be so focused on Christ that we'll forget about who's preaching and we won't need to know the name of the preacher as long as it's Christ and we'll forget about everything we'll forget about where we're sitting or what church we're in or what peel but it's just Christ it's Christ everything's Christ amen that's why I it you know I I know I know maybe we we might need to or you know know what's going on in the world but I don't need to know everybody that's came against this message or don't believe the prophet because because it it's not food for me if there's 10 million people that don't believe the prophet's message it don't affect me because I do and so okay like you know what I mean just just show me the truth and Christ in me will recognize the truth and I don't really care about bogus dollars amen I don't really care that Satan's sitting next to me in the Pew and he's impersonating Christ because I'm trying to be Christ and if Christ is impersonated right beside me and I'm just focused on Christ and crisis and I've died and he's living in me the impersonation won't affect me because I got blinders on it you know when we were in Indiana we'd pass some horses and Luanne would drive like a maniac and she'd pass those horses with the blinders they're just and those horses wouldn't even flinch because they're not focused on the car going by them you know what I mean wow God help us man let's go ahead here to 15 and 17. and see then that you watch circumspectly not as fools but as wise see God cares how we live God cares this gospel that says well it don't matter what I do because God sees my heart that's that's from hell that's from hell yeah actually God does care what you do and everything in the Bible talks about that amen and every Walk of Life child wife husband relationships and everything he cares how you act amen see that your white circle but speculate not as fools but it's wise Redeeming the time because the days who are for sure evil God knows that therefore be not unwise but understanding the will what the Lord is that's why God said these scriptures are all for our benefit amen and many many times we don't dig into these off the road scriptures because many times they don't even apply it was like when I was talking about a virtuous woman or woman with the I said that I I'm printing out these quotes in the and the prophet's talking about the women and then he stops and he says well I'm not talking to your sisters I'm like this is there's not this in the church why am I printing this quote out but it's still God's word amen it's through God's word and you'll you if you hear it you'll say hey I'm not like that I'm Christ fed amen amen let's just jump ahead to 19. the 18 is just talking about drunkard that's definitely not a concern here speaking of yourself speaking to yourself in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs and singing and Melodies In Your Heart unto the Lord now here's God trying to show you what you should be dwelling on it doesn't say listen to the news Fox it doesn't say either that it doesn't say either that you know the preaching of the word is the most important part so I just come to church I don't need to be in the worship service because I'm beyond that you're not even converted yet if you don't if you're so converted that you don't think you need to worship your lord and savior oh I've heard that one well you know the worship service it's just always dull there's a terrible person that sings opportunities brother day or I mean they think of something oh the woman she didn't know the you know the sister Luanne she didn't know that one song messed up my whole concentration wow feel sorry for you but here's here's the Bible we'll have no excuse but speaking to yourself in Psalms and hymns spiritual songs and singing Melodies in your heart to the Lord see this is saying what you are what you eat you are what you eat if you listen to Fox News three times a day do you pray pray and read your Bible three times a day be careful with all this this internet stuff because you'll never shut it off you know watch this you know when we're reading our Bible say uh that's enough I'm done well when you go on Facebook oh oh no there's never enough uh-huh you're never on Facebook you say oh I think I've been on here long enough no nothing that's a trap of the devil and you become what you eat and then when you go to a funeral that you haven't seen somebody for 30 years they say wow I can't believe how they've changed and it was just hair per day and when you see him and you say wow are you still going to church anymore wow let's drop to 22 and and I promise we'll close when we get to the end of the chapter amen hear wives submit yourself unto your husbands as on to the Lord now see the husbands have to be already submitted unto the Lord this is I'm not preaching to wives here believe me he said but for husbands it's the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and the savior of the body so you don't definitely want to be a wife if that husband ain't got a savior good definitely don't want to be that no no no if you want to go to a concentration camp just go direct don't go through a man wow God help us amen therefore as the church is subject unto Christ there you go you know what I'm trying to say it's really easy for the fivefold ministry to preach on the women but they're only revealing what's already been preached from the fightful ministry in the men because our very Prophet said that the wife is the reflection of the man and the wife he picks reveals who he really is you want to know who a man is just take a look at his wife and look at her character and you'll say wow that man my brother's got a lot of character right man God help us therefore the church is subject to Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything so let the church and the five-fold ministry be subject to Christ in everything amen amen this is combat our Prophet said all scripture had compound meaning amen husbands love your wife even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it amen that he might sacrifice sanctify it and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word amen God is changing thee by glory to glory he's changing me amen I'm still here he's still working on me there's still hope because Christ is still on the throne amen hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus that he might present to himself not a glorious wife a glorious church that's that's brothers and sisters amen spiritually speaking that Christ see we have to get the character of Christ amen it's not we're not pointing our fingers Point them at me amen it's all of us we all need to be in an atmosphere and a character and the the discipline of Christ men there's no big Jesus God ain't respecters a person he give just as much blood for the sisters and the children as he did the brothers and the fivefold ministry amen you see but when it's all in perfect tune beautiful most beautiful thing you ever see Brothers submissive and and to to each other and brotherly love and respect and honor and and as as as if they were talking to Jesus Christ in the flesh wow that's a powerful Church did anybody present himself a glorious Church having that spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that is that should be holy and Without Blame You See God gave us all these scriptures what what did he what did he say in the first quote we read that your resting place would be in uh word of God and so he taught us how to become this this this amazing church amen Hallelujah so what man to love their wives as their own body that he loveth his wife loves himself here because Christ did that he he left the Splendor of Heaven to die for me we can't comprehend that we can try but we can't comprehend that amen for no man hate us its own flesh but nourish it and cherish it even as the Lord does nourish and cherish the church so why we to be members of his of his body and his flesh and his bone talking about Christ Jesus for this cause a man to leave his mother and father Leave the World Behind and so join unto his wife and the two shall be one flesh and this is a great mystery now that's why I was trying to bring you to spiritual all the way through amen that you would be bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh Jehovah God and you'd be so much like God the people are just like this is a great mystery and I speak concerning Christ and its Church nevertheless let everyone in particular so love his wife even as himself and his wife reverence from her husband may God help us amen I wish I could find that scripture I read this morning talked about us being in subjection and surrendered to each other amen as we surrender to each other with the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're surrendering to Christ see everything in the Christian family was about surrendering and everything in the world we're living in is about fighting and as much as your believers you're still living in this world and and if those Spirits you know you know you something happens and you and okay you have to have lengths off blood but something happens and you just go woohoo I'll tell you and and then there's something in there goes uh you know I read scriptures this week and even in studying you know how Christ you'll read that in First Peter 3 the chapter how how Christ surrendered completely persecution itself no much less will his wife even the Bible says how the the wife would say the wife would say the husband in her character and Chase spoken words now if you put spiritual eyes in that you know for the matter if we could just speak in a situate that brother Dale and brother Matt and brother Bernard we brother Tim that we would save our neighbor soul just by our Chase character and our spoken word you know the prophet said things about that that people's internal destination was the thing by how we reacted to an action of road rage oh show them plus God that man's got ta that help us amen God help me amen Hallelujah to help us see God I'm going to close with that forgive me this we've got just a little bit of time first Samuel 15. I've just moved to here and then I'll close I said forgive me I shouldn't say I was closing but here the Bible is teaching us that obedience is better than sacrifice and God is ex this I just felt to say this because see God wants us to be in obedience to his word and to him better than our confession of this light talk huh because see you you watch us as you mature in Christ you'll see that people that got this light top watch be careful just just watch they might be an impersonator huh you know just like if if if if if you're a sister and you're going to marry a man watch how that man treats his mother or the sisters in the church and you'll know exactly how he'll treat you in private actually actually went back it'll be worse in private so if you see him just remotely snub a sister or just even a hint just even that much snub his mum in public for run through your life because when you're in private oh yeah oh yeah see God give us wisdom and it's called the Holy Ghost because see the the Devil is a smooth but he don't have the life you don't have the life here here first Samuel 15 22 he said Samuel said hath the Lord give great delight and bird offerings and sacrifice as in obedience to the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than to Fat ramps fat and a fat of rams for now watch this is powerful and I I am going to close for Rebellion as of sin of Witchcraft that's Rebellion to the word of God when you just see it laid right out there no matter how dry it's preached and in this type of a morning teaching fashion and you just see it and say well I you know the prophet talked about with when he would go to sisters and they said well it says so obey your husband said I'll show him I'm an American yeah no different than on to obey Christ man well I'll show him I I have this doctrine that uh-huh for Rebellion as of witchcraft just think of that spiritually and the spiritual world on the word of God impersonation huge and stubbornness is as the sin of Witchcraft stubbornness as is as iniquity knowing to do right and not doing it and idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the Lord and he hath also rejected thee as being part of his bride it says as being King but see all scriptures start compound me so just picture that spiritually speaking and go wow God help brother Dale all scripture they sing brother all scripture is given for our good Matt it's given for brother Dale's gift amen it's good for reproof correction and now let's stand when you see things come forth amen right out of the word of God and it's just you're and well it's impossible for your human flesh to come up because see you don't have human flesh no more you see it dying and see Christ is living it's no longer me that liveth but Christ to liveth in me and then see you can just you can just hear you so a minister can preach exciting or dull or quieter that but he was reading the script you just say amen ouch you might say ouch once in a while amen God help us amen to watch what we watch what we eat watch what we eat because that's what we'll be and and and this is what's deceptive it's a slow change when you when people start to backslide slow change when you start to get closer to God but you just watch and God will give you a trained eye they've really grown in Christ that's my friend that's my prayer and my desire God help me as we grow in all these scriptures that you know and how how brother Dale not not that I point fingers but I point them at me you can see everything has a if everything's lined up in the family it's beautiful if Christ Christ is a much needed third person of every home and he's for sure the most needed part if Christ is here it's worth coming amen it don't matter who's preaching and that that's usually oh more than anything amen thank you Lord Jesus amen I I pray that God will take this scattered and it's hard for me to teach sometimes because you read and slow down and pick things out and I was scattered and I apologize for that but uh but the word of God's still the word of God I'm not just reading if even if I read it wrong and it's up there you can see it if I say a word wrong not not be not intentionally out of my ignorance I want to become the word of God and I don't just always want to be the person say well oh bless God the sisters bless God your brothers first huh let's start at the top work down we get the brothers right the kids will line up to see the brothers will realize that they play Cowboys and Indians when they were kids too see what I mean I'm trying to get into his with me you don't just got to pull out a rod and beat everything because it's a life growth we're growing into Christ yes we're birth but it's still good God help me in that girl then please [Music] let me me please to you let everything that I did be pleased praise [Music] everything God be pleased [Music] one more time please [Music] let me be pleasing to you let everything that I did please [Music] pray help me God let everything I just want to share this just why Lorraine plays that and we'll sing him one more time I really want to share this you know in the natural types of spiritual and when somebody's ready to do something terrible in the flesh they normally always 100 percent reach out to somebody likewise in the spirit when somebody is spiritually right for picking they normally in a very very I don't know how to say that but in a very Sly way we'll reach out for an answer I pray to God that I'll hear that reach out I pray to God that you'll hear that reach out because we got to be lights and we got to be salty and our Prophet said this he said if we get there and we weren't we'll be judged for not showing this truth and I pray you know in being around people that maybe I've never seen before this week but or not for a long time that if they just would just give if they just would just say some little thing you could just grab it and give them a food that would change your life for history amen the world's looking for love they're looking for Christ they're looking they're looking for Christ but they don't know how to get it and I want to be available that when somebody reaches out I I don't need to know I just need to know that I know Christ and I can share them with you and as far as you want to go with Christ Christ will take you amen God help God help each every one of us it's not that's just not for ministers that's for and your own workplaces people will be hurting and domestics and and relationships and all this and they'll reach out for an answer and you need to have Jesus on your tongue that you can give them the word of God truth that'll turn them around
