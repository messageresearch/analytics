walk plainly in this light knowing that that we are walking up the King's Highway father may you take complete control in this service tonight Lord for this few minutes to ushering this New Year may you speak to us from the pages of the Bible Lord if there's someone here who doesn't know you may they come to Know You by Revelation and by experience if there's a backslide in our midst father tonight who has been struggling or fighting or pressing whatever it might be Lord there are certain things that must die with 2023 as we prepare for this Lord major changeing season of 2024 Lord may we leave the old skins behind the old ways behind the old behaviors behind the old attitudes behind the old problems behind the old weights behind Paul said to shake of those weights that so easily beset us father so father for the next few moments may you anoint your people may you anoint your church those that are here those that are connected online may you take me out of the way let not one word be spoken that you don't once said Lord use me as your microphone and shut down my thoughts my feelings my words Lord and let what is said only be what you once said father because this is your house this is your people and we are yielding ourselves to the Divine leadership of the Holy Spirit tonight may you break chains and shackles we take every Spirit under our control by The Authority that rest in this word and the spirit that connects and follows this word in the mighty name of Jesus Christ and at the end of this service may you get all the glory may you get all the honor may you get all the praise may you get all the Thanksgiving and the church says and the church says and the church says amen amen amen amen will I greet you tonight in the precious name of Jesus Christ and while you're standing we'll do the formal greetings after while it's let's just go to the scripture reading from Revelation chapter 3 reading from verse 7 Revelation 3 a reading from verse 7 and to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things sayith he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and has kept my word and Hast not denied my name behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie behold I will make them to come and worship before the thy feet and to know that I have loved thee because thou Hast kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth behold I come quickly hold that fast which thou Hast that no man take thy crown him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out no more backsliding no more going back into the world no more going into your old ways no more and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name he that ha an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and let's drop down to verse 20 behold tonight I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door door I will come into him and will s with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father in his throne he that had an air let him hear what the spirit sayth unto the churches may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his most holy word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord this evening God bless you good evening thank you so much for coming out to this special o years night service I greet you in the wonderful precious marvelous glorious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who had called us all as individuals from our backgrounds from our families he never called us as a group he never called us as families he called us as individuals one by one we came into this world and one by one we have to answer for our time on this Earth so I greet you tonight in that precious name of he who is the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last he who wrote your name in Blood and is responsible for making sure that you overcome and responsible for making sure that you have what it takes to be victorious we have our part to play but he has a big part to play also can the church say amen he has done his part he is doing his part and he promised to keep doing his part because he's the same yesterday today and forever so we don't take it for granted that we are here tonight and I pray that you are here tonight not by accident or Not by chance or not from formality or from Custom but you are here because you are truly looking for something from the Lord the church say Amen wonderful so I am also instructed to greet you on behalf of our precious Pastor how many appreciate our pastor this evening he has asked me to extend greetings to the church and the very best of God's blessings to you in this season and Beyond and as you would know he just returned from a wonderful convention in Mexico I think the last service was over 2,000 people in that service and he close off the convention so he is still recovering so keep him in your prayer because we need your prayer and we need to pray for one another now more than ever this is a commandment to us to pray one for another Harry one for another to support one another and this is something that must become more important to you as we approach this season that we are living in this time that we are living so I trust everybody's feeling fine and everybody took their coffee and they came here not to sleep into the new year because I know have all kind of things going on and people are sleeping into the new year they are partying into the new year they're doing all kind of stuff into the new year so we came to meet the New Year in a certain kind of way we came to greet this new year this change of season with a smile in our faces we came to greet this new year and say goodbye I can't change the past forgetting the things that are passed and looking for the things that are ahead of us looking for the blessings ahead looking for the trials ahead looking for the problems ahead looking for the opport opportunities ahead whatever comes ahead we can handle it because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world it's built into us to overcome we are born to overcome you can't help but overcome you overcame all kind of stuff to be here tonight many people didn't make it to this service tonight but you are here because you an overcomer and he that started to work in you I can guarantee you he's more than able to bring it to pass oh Hallelujah so I'm here to encourage you tonight Hallelujah to give a little a little dressing cuz you have had some good preaching over the year we have a letter thank God for every service how many you appreciate brother ol's message this morning but ol's message last week brother uhh uh Chandler's message last Wednesday brother Anthony last Wednesday before that how many appreciate the services this year from our pastor from Anthony all the exaltations how many appreciate all our Elders in the church can we put our hands together for the elders the ministers Hallelujah the deacons you appreciate them the ushers the helps the governments the technical team the musicians oh the song leaders the Sunday school this is what makes us a church each man coming into their position each man coming to their do their job Hallelujah and then when every man is in his place the devil is in trouble if the church could just get in order then the devil is fre fin no wonder brother Bram said when the last name is called oh then the Rapture could take place we got to get into our position and once we in our position the devil is finished oh and I believe we are in a position tonight Hallelujah to Say Goodbye World come on young people there's no better place to be this is the best this is the Holy Ghost Party that's what they had in the in the on the day of Pentecost they were dancing they were shouting they were singing and if you think I'm crazy tonight oh if you taste what I've tasted you'll be just crazy too oh you don't hear me tonight oh Hallelujah everybody feeling fine I'm going to keep checking to see who's sleeping Hallelujah Glory where's where's brother Clarence at he's supposed to be my clock Hallelujah it feels good this evening so listen it should be a joy to come into the house of the Lord that's why the Sam is David said I was glad when they said unto me I saw some people walking this evening and I was wondering if they was glad or don't brought over it maybe this year had an extra heavy burden but when David saw the house of the Lord he said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord oh the devil is in trouble this evening the devil don't know what's inside of you you know that's why he comes after you if the devil only realized he didn't know what was in Jesus that's why he said if thou be and Jesus he said I don't owe you an explanation it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of God I don't have to explain where I come from I don't have to explain where I'm going you're going to see for yourself and most of jesus' ministry he kept saying the hour is not come the hour is not yet come it's not midnight yet the season hasn't changed yet but there's coming a time when the season is going to change and when the season changes I can't help myself can the church say amen that's only 80% can the church say Amen we're going to make the church comfortable for some and uncomfortable for others Hallelujah the prophet taught us there's noise in heaven and there's noise in hell I'm going to pick the Heavenly noise any day any time under any condition oh I rather shout jump praise God give God glory Hallelujah from the right rising of the Sun to the going down of the same his name is worthy to be praised I'm still testing the temperature you know I just want to I want to see who's in the house I want to see who's in church tonight Hallelujah you know the devil gets Disturbed when you break the routine when you break the [Applause] ordinary anybody here you may be seated driving to church at one point I don't know what your experience was but part of the road had no electricity I say what is this I wonder if I have Curren in church then at one point your Reigns come and say but what is this all kind of say look is it the enemy fighting and I see them were Good Neighbor Next having a little party I say well what trouble is this every side the enemy trying to do something but listen when the Bride of Jesus Christ comes visible that's why listen there's no Victory without a battle you heard brother U said this morning God will bless the work of your hands you got to do something with your hands for God to bless without doing something the prophet said you got to do something for something to happen so I want to challenge you tonight give God a big shout of worship Hallelujah you may be there are people in here tonight who are sick with all kind of conditions do you know when you worship God those diseases start to tremble oh you don't hear me tonight you know when you give God praise demons those diseases start to say what going on here boy because you creating an atmosphere and especially when it defies the expectation oh those demons like it to stay normal and stressed out and frustrated but I believe we are changing a season and it takes the Holy Spirit to drop upon you to create an atmosphere for a new birth for the Holy Ghost himself to connect with your 16 elements drop down into the socket of your soul you may be seated I'm not going to be too long with you we just have a conversation into the new year can we talk about Jesus the prophet said when we talk about him he draws near you know he likes to be the center of our joy the center of our conversation the center of our [Applause] deliberation but teren the temperature has to feel comfortable we still have a few other people but I believe we have enough who brought their fire brother George to light up the rest of them Hallelujah brother Stephen hallelujah we're going to create an atmosphere and run them Devils out oh Hallelujah so I got a title for this evening the placing of the Overcomers in their position of power I'll say that one more time the placing of the Overcomers in their position of power God has an objective of this whole thing it may come as a surprise to you but God is not in the church business you know that's right right we are not here because God just wants to have a church he wants to have a church for an objective he says the fivefold ministry is for the perfecting of the Saints so what happens when the saints get perfect for the edifying of the body what happen when the body is edified for the unity of the FI what happens when it happens then the ministry of the fold is over because it's to an end God wants a direct relationship with you and to get you into that relationship that relation ship comes with power so God is looking to place some Overcomers not church members not people who made it to church on Hest night only but Overcomers you overcome the job you overcome what's happening in your home you overcome the financial issues you heard brother Olu speaking about the crisis don't waste your crisis you overcome the crisis you overcome negativity you overcome gossiping you overcome what people say about you you overcome how you feel you overcome your yesterday you overcome last week you overcome what the enemy said you overcome your own negative self-doubt you overcome your tiredness you overcome your fear you overcome your frustration you overcome Temptation you overcome depression you overcome lying you overcome sickness you overcome your boss you overcome your coworker you overcome the person who lied about you you overcome the person who hate you you overcome your neighbor you overcome the devil but the BAM said you overcome false Christ you overcome false teaching you overcome it all and because you overcome there's a blessing that is just for the Overcomers can the church say Amen so my title the placing of the Overcomers in their position of power for a subject David's son David's key and David's Throne David's son David's key and David's throne and for an inspiration to him that overcome it and we read that scripture in Revelation to the angel of the church in Philadelphia right and mam taught us that each of these churches or church ages is this great bride of Jesus Jesus Christ to different that dispensations and all you were speaking to it could be said a geographical location what is said there in that spiritual age is also relevant to us today these things said he that is Holy we know he's talking about the Lord Jesus Christ himself he that is true he is truth he that hath the Key of David yes sir and in this one scripture here in the Book of Revelation picks up this key of David that is only mentioned one time in the Old Testament and we'll speak a little bit about it can the church say Amen so I believe tonight this evening that we are Mysteries you are mystery your mystery to the world your mystery to your family your mystery to your neighbors your mystery to a lot of people they don't understand what what has you going why would you leave your home in a night and come to a service like this why you come all year why you believe a prophet why I believe this message what and it's because you're mystery you have even been a mystery to yourself because you can't explain when the Revelation dropped into your soul the change that came over you that pushed you even when you didn't understand something kept you coming all [Applause] along something keeps you coming it's not you but there's something in you that's mysterious because God is a mystery and God that mysterious God put a mystery inside of you that even you can't figure out yet but during the fullness of time that mystery becomes plain and becomes visible to you you because Christ is a mystery of God revealed and Christ wants to make himself known to us your mystery to your family mystery to your friends mystery to your neighbors even when you make a mistake and the devil think you're finished you're mystery to him because somehow you still find yourself back in the house of God and he learn right you off already but punch you know what time the devil say well that is it he G through you know what time the devil say that sister finish but here you are this evening and he don't try to figure out what is this how come and after you went through that you still in church the devil confus this evening you know all of us have enough reasons to not be here tonight but we have more reasons to be here tonight oh you don't hear me this even the mystery in US is bigger than our problems anybody can identify with that you know much time listen you may be seated so you don't think eyes get depressed amen but punch they don't think I get depressed you I get frustrated I don't want to speak for the pastor but you don't think he get frustrated but didn't Elijah after the mount carel experience tried to commit suicide didn't the prophet try to commit suicide cuz he was so low Elijah says best you take my life this is after a great Victory you know so depression coming in the thing you know frustration is part of the thing you know being upset and frustrated that's part of the thing but something comes inside of you that overcomes the depression overcomes the frustration there's a voice saying don't bother to worship but something else kicks in and said he is worthy of the worship he is worthy of the praise and that's overcoming that's built inside of you anybody in the church tonight and but the BR said overcoming keeps life in you so when you get a hot trial you know what God is saying oh God giving them some life turn up the trial turn up the testing get a flat tire let your roof blow off something happened on the job this happened and when you're there some of you you have a fighting and and and it look as if you're fighting up but you're just staying alive you know if you sit down for hours and days and months and weeks and don't move after while you reckon you can't move but the pun of that sisters here afraid spider it don't matter how lazy somebody is if they see a spider and they afraid of it they get it up and moveing them so God has has send things in your life to get you moving and when you move your heart start to pump your muscles start to move and then before you realize you recognize that's when adrenaline kicks in and God sends things different things your way to keep you moving you move from here to move from there because your car stand still if God knows you're moving to the promised land because every place you put your foot is yours so if you stood still for MOS 2023 let that die in 2023 because we moving into 2024 and we don't want to stop moving I might be moving slow but I want to keep moving I want to keep I don't want to stop I can't afford to stop can the church say Amen somebody give God a sh of praise hallah so God has promises just for Overcomers not for church members Adam could have never claimed these promises because he had nothing to overcome before the fall so the promises for Overcomers could not have been for Adam because he had no temptation he had no trial no test he had no back pain he had no rent he had no back pay he had nothing and God interrupt allowed it to be interrupted so that Adam had to overcome and you read script in Revelation because Jesus is saying there in the scripture to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame so Jesus himself had to overcome Jesus himself had to learn obedience by the things that he suffered we have to learn learn obedience obedience to his word obedience to his will obedience to his purpose obedience to his vision for us obedience for what he wants us to do and if Jesus had to learn it by suffering how you want to learn it but over they see the amen just just disappear Hallelujah Adam could have never been an overcomer but we here this evening we are Overcomers and we will continue to be Overcomers can the church say amen hallelujah friends we must never forget the grace of God in our lives because our ability to overcome is only by the grace of God our ability to be here tonight is only by the grace of God can the church say Amen there's nobody here tonight because they earned it or they deserve it we are all here tonight as trophies of his grace if you are here in the house of God tonight you are here by the grace of God I am here by the grace of God that is enough for you to shout and worship the pastors here by the grace of God the assistant pastor is here by the grace of God the ministers the deacons ERS all by the grace of God nobody's better than nobody because the grace of God makes us equal through the blood God looks at us and say there's my bride coming into you let us not forget what God brought us from we may not be what we want to be but we certainly not what we used to be can the church say Amen it is not our ability it is not our effort it's the grace of God to us that he predestinated us to see what we see and to be part of this great unfolding of this mystery can the church say amen hallelujah so can I get to my thought a little bit in a message Revelations chapter 5 but the BAM said Jesus the name Jesus in The Gospel has four titles of son amen one is the son of David one is son of Abraham one is Son of Man and the other is Son of God when our kinsman redeemer become Jesus Christ he become the son of David which is heir to the throne he Heir the throne by being a son of David God told back there that he would never leave David without a seed and Christ is the son of David and he became our kinsman redeemer waiting getting a place ready to where he can reign with us as the son of David he's heir to the throne as the son of Abraham he's heir to the Royal Grant Palestine and all that's in her Abraham seed he is a son of Abraham as the son of man what does son of man what did man lose he lost the Earth so as a son of man he's air to everything in the Earth all this he's got and he has to give it back to us then he's returning back as he was now then a Son of God he inherits all things andam summarizes as the son of David air to the throne son of Abraham air to the Royal Grant son of man air to the Earth Son of God air to all things in heaven and earth now many years ago I preached a message that God gave jurisdiction to man for this Earth we have no jurisdiction in heaven amen Heaven belongs to God that's why the Bible says we shall reign on the we have no authority to re in heaven God has a throne in heaven it's a Heavenly Throne we don't have the authority to set in that Heavenly throne but there's a throne that CS this Earth and that's the throne that was given to King David can the church say Amen anybody with me so when Jesus came as son of David it gave him right and access to that Throne can the church say Amen but there has to be a way for us to get to that Throne because we are promised jurisdiction and authority and Power on this Earth can the church say Amen everybody with me so when man fell God couldn't even deal with a situation from up in heaven because as a spiritual being he had no jurisdiction to come on the earth and deal with the situation so you had to take the form of man because only a man who has the authority to be a heir to the Earth could come down and deal with Earth business so Jesus gave up his authority in heaven took on 16 elements and walked the Earth like you and I suffered like you and I ate food like you and I wept like you and I at the grave of Lazarus but when he dried his tears and said Lazarus Comfort it was more than man can the church say amen and but the Terence in that form he couldn't even go down to Hell because you needed to have sin on you to go down into hell so Jesus had to take your sin it wasn't a matter of he he wanted to take it he had to take your sin because he needed sin to be upon him so he could go down into hell and walk up to the devil and take away the keys of sin and hell can the church say amen and that's why remember the Brandon preach House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus because Jesus took the keys the devil doesn't even have keys for his own kingdom oh you don't hear me tonight no wonder we could preach and the word of God could set you free because the devil cannot lock you up Hallelujah Johnny CR the devil has no power to lock you up he has no right to keep sickness in your body he has no right to keep your son your daughter your finances your health you could walk out today if you want to go free or you don't hear me tonight you could walk free if you want to go free come and go with me to my father's house can the church say Amen somebody give God a shout of Praise anybody in the house [Music] tonight Hallelujah woo but brand continues in that same quot now notice oh this does me so good this is where I get a really good feeling now listen let your heart loose to God just for a few minutes Satan is a squatter this Earth has a owner this Earth have somebody who name comeing to sit down on the throne butam said he don't legally own this and he has had 2,000 years of fuss whether he owns it or somebody else owns it but a punch for 2,000 years he devil fussing with who own this thing boy but Christ came as the kinsman redeemer and redeeming back to us but Satan is currently in possession of it that's right but you know after a while this great fight is going to be over and he'll be cast into the Lake of Fire he'll be done away with and all them who worshiped with him but the HS of Salvation will come with Christ can the church say Amen oh Hallelujah so come on you Overcomers I want to let you know who you are tied to two Sundays or so ago I preached about the sacrifice the perfect sacrifice making a way for the living sacrifices and we spoke about the priesthood that you are born into we spoke about the fact that before there ever was a king God told Moses you going to have a kingdom of priests and he said something that nobody could have understood for hundreds of years to give individuals Gentiles Divine access to the priesthood but it's not just priests you are also Kings you are Kings and Priests so we spoke about the Divine priesthood that you belong to today I'm talking about the kingship that you belong to because you are royalty from the moment you were born you are royalty you could have been born in a hut you got to be born on top of tree you going to be I don't care where you're born your royalty and somebody who's born into royalty they don't even know their royalty until they are told that they are royalty you don't hear me this evening if you're born into royalty somebody hiding a village and you don't know who you are you will grow up thinking you're just normal in the village until somebody Whispers to you you know who your father is you know you own that land you know that castle belongs to you you know if they only realize who you are they have to open up because royalty runs in your veins you have legal right to walk in there anytime because your father was the king but your father died and he left it for you you can either stay in this Village for the rest of your life or you could shake yourself and walk to the castle and see a coming for what's mine and that's what our position is this evening our Kinsman Rea di wrote your name on the will and say come and take it whenever you want to take it come on now somebody give God a shout of [Applause] Praise so Jesus we know our great God when Jesus came he came as prophet he came as king and he came as priest amen this Great Divine mystery in three Hallelujah he's Father Son and Holy Ghost this mystery of tree he's a lamb he's a lion and he's a lamb a lion a lamb and he's an eagle come the church say Amen this Great Divine mystery but connected to us he's son of David that's connected to us because true sunship and being a son of David is about the kingly inheritance amen that we are in title too yes and David didn't know he was a King David grew up not knowing he was a king he grew up as somebody who couldn't be even in the Army he grew up as the one to raise the Sheep he was so overlooked that when Samuel came to anoint a a king they didn't even decide to call him they presented everybody else who look like king walk like King act like King and they say listen you don't have anymore they said we just have one more fell day I don't think he's he when looking for you know call David and when David come Samuel pour the whole horn oil the whole horn in Fr the brothers say but where is David boy going and David went back quietly to his sheep in the backside of the desert and God is unveiling a great mystery that he could take you from being hidden he could take you from being a nobody he could take you from being somebody people underestimate he could take you from being from a simple family from a simple position he wasn't a soldier he wasn't an overachiever you know in school there's right person most likely to succeed but that wasn't David they had no big expectation of David but when David got the Horn of oil upon him and he was anointed he was now an anointed shepherd He oh come on now somebody preach back to me God is unveiling his mystery and when God called you he poured a whole oil upon your life you went back to what you was doing and you didn't even know that you are royalty oh God somebody help me tonight you are in the house of God and God is pouring an anointing oil upon your life can the church say amen God unfolding his great mystery amen thank you Lord thank you Jesus God doesn't choose the way we choose he doesn't choose the way politician shoes he is different he looks at a heart and that's why he can say David a man after my own heart Elijah didn't get that Moses didn't get that just David and we'll understand why this thing is so important could you take some more anybody sleeping Deacon just check just take a quick [Applause] check God unfolding his great plan God hinting to what he was going to unfill all the way back to Genesis there was Abraham Abraham was no prophet he was a father of faith but yet God allowed me to meet MDC the king of Salem the great king priest and Abraham paid tith to mzed not even fully comprehending the great mystery unfolding that he was actually paying tis and this same mzc was the root and Offspring this was Christ meeting Abraham can the church say Amen but Abraham said he had no beginning he has no talking about mzc he had no father he had no mother he was simple Abraham with no books no tapes no Bible nothing and here he is the great prince prince of Salem can the church say Amen the king of Peace the king of righteousness he was not only a king he was a priest he was the Prince of Peace the rose of Sharon lily of the valley I'm reading from the Prophet The Morning Star the alpha omega he that was which is and shall come B the root and offspring of David but said he was before David in David and after David amen God was setting up brother Lyon this King thing a long time ago in Genesis 49 Jacob pronounced his blessings upon all his sons sometime I'm going to speak of it let me just read one scripture before I get to this one we have some time right check in to make sure there one verse I want to get to but before I want to get to something else first and Jacob called unto his sons and said Gather yourselves together that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days you imagine that come let me tell you what's going to happen to you listen to this gather yourselves together and hear ye sons of Jacob and hearken unto Israel your father amen and he speaks to each one of them yes he sat up with Reuben Ruben Thou Art my firstborn my might and the beginning of my strength the Excellency of dignity and the Excellency of power unstable as water Thou shalt not Excel you imagine a father telling a son you shall not not Excel and that's prophecy you know we'll get our Bible study and that and why that is way but what I want to get to is verse 8 Judah Thou Art he whom thy Brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy father's children shall bow down before thee Judah is a lion's WEP from the pray my son thou had gone up he stooped down he crouched as a lion as a as an oh lion who shall Rous him up the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come can the church say Amen so God setting up this King thing he dropping a piece here he dropping a piece there he drop a piece on Judah and the king the scepter will live in Judah so now you wonder now when the children of Israel reach Point say we want a king you you remember that and he say Samuel we want a king because everybody else have King Samuel was grieved and God had to tell Samuel well they haven't rejected you no they rejected me and you know who they pick Saul what tribe was Saul from benjam how are benjamite getting thrown when the promise of the scepter is in Judah so it goes and and this is not something but upon today know you know I think I said it in the message last time people have the books and the tapes and you wonder if they already have the books and tapes you know because if those brethren had the books and the tapes they say but didn't they say that deceptor is from Judah but they weren't looking at the word they say sa tall that what the Bible said and he has a nice countenance he Head and Shoulders over everybody else we like that tall man so Saul is appointed King based on looks but they have quotes that supposed to say there's any King supposed to be from Judah amen am can the church say amen amen could you take some more good good good so David though what tribe is David from Judah the tribe of Judah but Terence rolling with me tonight so David meet the check mark of the right tribe now we have to go to the right training cuz all the time he just being Shepherd part but when we look at David we could think about many things and I preach about David a man after God's Own Heart before and when we think about we think about the Psalms of David the songs of David the worship of David the heart of David the leadership of David the repentance of David the faith of David the Covenant of David the anointing of David the Friendship of David the victories of David we think of Our Shepherd King we think of the legacy of David we think of the trials of David we think of the Poetry of David we think of David as a musician we think about David dancing there's no other biblical character who you see from a young man to an old man on his dead bed like David no wonder God could see he's a man after my own heart in so much that when Jesus come he's the son of David even though David had his mistake Jesus said I'm the son of David oh can the church say Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord and I preached this before when he thinking about David and this is so relevant to us as we end the year here David speak in Psalms 23 the Lord is my shepherd has he been your Shepherd for this year I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yeah do I walk through the valley of the shadow of death is not death know is the shadow of it I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff is there anybody can testify of this they comfort me th prepares a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anoint is my head with oil my cup run it over that's my prophecy for you as we go into 2024 may your cup run over can the church say Amen surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever make this my permanent Dwelling Place I don't want to leave his presence I don't want to leave his house I don't want to leave his anointing I don't want to leave his safety I don't want to leave his protection can the church say Amen Psalms 3 hear the words of David Lord how are they increase that trouble me Lord you know how much bills I have Lord you know what the doctor said Lord you know the battle in the family how are they increase that trouble me many are they that rise up against me many there be which sath my soul there's no help for him in God in other words they say there's no hope for you they say you can't make it they say you're wasting your time but David throws

up he's the one he's the one the Lord will do it can the church say Amen somebody give God a shout of [Applause] [Music] praise [Applause] here it is now I'm on page 24 of 98 I'm on page 24 of [Music] 98 are you ready [Music] I want to skip some parts but the punch me to do all the pages and this David we talking about I'm when your low moments and I want to encourage young people the Psalms is a great place to encourage yourself every day you should read something in there there are few things in this life you have control over and one of the most powerful things you have control over is your mindset your mind your thinking change your thinking you change your life that's why the Bible could say be transformed by the renewing of your mind mind be careful what you listen to and watch just before you go to sleep because you are programming your mind into certain things be careful what you do when you wake up in the morning because you're programming your whole day I encourage you as you go into this new year I know people who are not even churchgoers who commit to reading the Bible they have those apps now a Bible in a year a scripture every day brother Anthony and the purpose and they go to church one I say but look at the discipline and they will attribute their business success to that discipline and believers who supposed to know read your Bible and pray every day don't have the I can't say the word discipline because some of us didn't get enough discipline so life have to you see what brother preach this morning some of us don't have the finance you don't any finances in go listen to the message this morning again and the one from last week he said lot of money L for popularity these things you even know what I look like because only when the situation come and you really have money you could really have a chest about it you there with your $20 but let some let let somebody get a million dollars and you see you can't see you for a year USC church church where why chur address again you and cruise all of a sudden you are Cruiser give somebody enough money they will take her to rocket to space something you know I want I want new new experiences in life and that's why many of us God can't bless us too much a little bit of money and and your whole your thing change from rituals to Starbucks let me not start I whole life change and God is on the prepare you because God wants to bless you you know you know what Bram said you are God's advertisement board you know so God wants people to see you and be comfortable to say that is my blessing and you could say well I'm only a trophy of his grace am but the moment God blessed some of us is like but if you know hard I study I say study had but it's how you say it see if it wasn't for the Lord who helped me study you see the difference that's why the say in all thy ways but you know the thing man let me live the thing now in all thy ways acknowledge Him all your ways and this is the practicality of the Gospel some of us miss because if you're about to lose your handle and fly off your handle find a way to acknowledge Him just before you fly off try it just before you're about to fly off the handle acknowledge Him and watch what [Applause] happens you know but to go and answer the boss and before you answer back you say Lord I acknowledge your presence all of a sudden you forget where was where is going say you about to say something horrible to your wife horrible to your husband the neighbor do something Vex and as you're about to go and deal with it you say Lord I acknowledge you give me the right words to talk talk to the neighbor I guarantee you you will talk different Lord I acknowledge you have a meeting today help me pick the right clothes oh Lord help me Lord I going to school I want to help me pick the right music to listen to now I see some of the younger people smiling because when you acknowledge Him in your music choice in your in your dress choice and all of a sudden you have to live like a Christian you know it no longer becomes a rules thing well I have a rule you know as a Christian you know I don't wear makeup and I don't wear earring and I don't wear pants no you acknowledging him and because you're conscious of his presence you're conscious of what he has done for you you're conscious of the fact that you were supposed to be dead but he said kill me instead to give you a chance to live let me take your place so you could take take my place and you can't acknowledge Him in all your ways I'm trying to close out can I but a punch I make a little progress I'm on 28 so this David I was just trying to make a point that's why I said David and see the Psalms and meditating and young people Proverbs there are 31 chapters in Proverbs as a young man I try to do one a day it'll preserve you it will guide you it'll give you wisdom so God told David through the prophet Nathan in 2 Samuel 7 and verse2 when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers I will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and I will establish his kingdom he shall build an house for my name and I will establish the Throne of his kingdom om forever I will be his father and he shall be my son if he commit iniquity I will chasen him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men but my Mercy shall not depart away from him as I took it from Saul you you hear this I will chasen him but I will not take away Mercy because God will never stop correcting us am I want you to catch this lesson he will correct us he will chasten you he will tell you do in foolishness and you need to straighten up but he will extend Mercy but he said I took it from Saul in other words I cut Saul off from Mercy Lord help us tonight let me never be cut off from the mercy of God because Saul went too far and God cut him off there is such a Place Church as going too far but brandham talk about young people coming to the Altar and praying and God not even looking at them because they cross the line so if you're here tonight and you're one foot in the world and one foot in church I will say to you like Elijah why halt you between two opinions why you keep moving between church and the and because you know this is right I don't think anybody here mental so if you're here because you have enough sense to know that this thing is something that you need to investigate and understand to change your life but you have to want this more than you want the world you have to want this more than you want the Styles and the fashion and the music and the boy and the girl and whatever else there is out there am I'm trying to close out could you take some more so God through his Prophet Nathan established that through David his throne will be established forever so on the foundation of being of the tribe of Judah and the promise of the scepter always being in the tribe of Judah Here Comes David with a promise that his throne will be established forever can the church say amen amen in so much that by the time Jesus come to the Earth by the time reach Matthew 12:23 the Bible said and the people were amazed and said is this is is not this the son of David because jesus' Behavior was lining up with certain prophecies and certain things about his life he couldn't help himself can the church say Amen I'm trying to find a place to close up but I want to just bring this talk to you friends and originally I told Brother my title was going to be the city of David the son of David the key of David the Throne of David and and the David's Ministry and brother say that kind of long because I was trying to tie that the time to Christmas but the Lord had a plan and those messeng the all who came in perfectly to address not just needs in his church but needs here in the church as well but it was in my heart because it was Christmas message that Jesus born in Bethlehem the city of his which is also the city of where David was born in Bethlehem and the rulership was the city of M which also called the city of David so from the city of David to the throne of David because there's a prophecy that the son of David the son of David will sit on the throne of David amen so there more significant when Jesus came and says the a greater than Solomon is here because the son that's being spoken wasn't the lineage wasn't Solomon you talking about so it was more than talking about the wisdom of Solomon when he say the greater than Solomon is here because Solomon was the greatest King in terms of wisdom and wealth and it was the the peak after that is when the kingdom split into the northern kingdom and and Jud and Judah so the peak of David's kingdom was really under Solomon so when Jesus comes say greater than Solomon is here he was really saying the rightful heir to the promised son of David he he now reach can the church say amen and to see how powerful this is because we read the scripture in the Book of Revelation to him that overcome will sit with me in my throne even as I am in my father's Throne Jesus talking about now two Thrones The Father's Throne or the Heavenly throne and his throne which is the Throne of David So to him that overcometh who is he talking about will sit with me in my Throne because right now that Throne of David is still empty because Jesus is in the Heavenly Throne he's in his father's throne waiting for the bride to get into position David's Ministry on the scene to usher in the great Millennium oh come on now after the battle is over we shall wear a crown anybody with me but to sit on the throne of David you have to be your Overcomer and being an overcomer you are now grafted into the lineage of David part of the tribe of Judah a king priest come on now somebody help me I'm trying to find a place and that's the key to you saying we shall re on [Applause] [Music] the I'm trying to find a way to close the musici get get ready we we almost we almost done I want to quickly touch now the book of Isaiah is a powerful book Isaiah 1:1 says the vision of Isaiah the son of Amos which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in other words the people and the place in the days of Uzziah jotham ahaz and Hezekiah Kings of Judah so I want you to understand Isaiah was prophet for four generations you know Hallelujah he watched Uzziah his son jotam his grandson ahaz and his great grandson Hezekiah and through 66 books of Isaiah which parallels to 66 chapters the 68 books of the Bible Isaiah sits there as a spiritual pillar in scripture Behold a virgin shall conceive and speaking a lot of prophetic things so here in Isaiah 22:5 very quickly are you with me thus sayth the Lord God of hosts go get thee unto this Treasurer even shebna which is over the house and ask him what hast thou here and whom hast thou here that thou Hast hewed thee out a seula here as he that heed out a seula on high and that gravet and habitation for himself in a rock in other words what you doing in a way you shouldn't be doing it building things you shouldn't be building doing things you shouldn't be doing to try to protect yourself to try to preserve your legacy to try to preserve your future to try to secure your family anybody with me behold the Lord will carry thee away with a mighty captivity and will surely cover thee he will surely violently turn and Tossy like a ball into a large country there shall thou die so you say you're building a nice f a nice grave and the grave you're building for yourself you not going to go into that grave amen and some of us trying to set up our future and our Legacy and what we want to achieve and what we want to do and and that what I want to have and when I gone this is what need to happen anybody with me anybody in the house and God say all that planning and preparation and things you're doing is out of order he shall violently turn and TOS you like a ball into a large country there shall thou die and there the Chariot of thy Glory shall be the shame of thy Lord's House I will drive thee from th station be careful Church don't be in a station station means place don't be in a place it shouldn't be and from thy stage shall he pull thee down in other words he was elevating himself to a place that's like brother pre doing God a service without being his will you doing things it shouldn't be doing this is a warning to us and it shall come to pass in that day that I will call my servant Eliah Kim the son of hilia and I will clothe him with thy robe and strengthen him with thy girdle change of garment change of office and I will commit thy government into his hand and he shall be your father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah amen and the key of the House of David will I lay upon his shoulder and that's he only reference to the Key of David now when you read this you can read it in the context of Isaiah speaking to somebody but when you look at it again you see it's really Christ he talking about anybody with me can the church say Amen now we getting ready to close out in the Church ages Philadelphia Church age brother bam said he that had the Key of David this beautiful phrase follows and comes out of the preceding phrase we read it he that is true Christ the perfect realization contrasted with the partial realization here it is Moses was a prophet of God but Jesus was the prophet of God David a man after God's Own Heart was king of Israel but Jesus is the greater David king of kings and Lord of lords God very God now David was born born of the tribe of Judah out of whom no priest came yet he ate of the shoe bread reserved for priest in other words but trying to build a foundation now he said he was the great warrior overcoming the enemy establishing the people as king he sat on the throne he was a prophet he was a wonderful type of Christ now it says in Isaiah 22:22 and the key of the House of David will I lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and None Shall shut and he shall shut and None Shall open the spirit uses this Old Testament reference concerning the Lord Jesus Christ and his ministry in the church what the Key of David signified at that time listen carefully is a mere Shadow which is now fulfilled in Jesus standing in the midst of the lampstands it has to do with our Lord after his resurrection and not his Earthly pilgrimage but what does the key signify the answer lies in the position of the key it is not in his hand it is not worn around his neck it is not placed in the hands of other men or the verse could not be saying that he alone has the use of the key for he alone the Bible said opens and shuts and no man has that right but Jesus himself isn't that right but where is the key it is on his shoulder but what does shoulder have to do with it read Isaiah 9:6 and the government shall be upon his shoulder but what does it mean and this is your promise I'm getting to you the answer is this the phrase government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the East we talking about brighting now we in brighting now when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulders signifying that not only is she under his Dominion but she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head and also that he bearss the responsibility and the care and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility and that beloved is the Key of David God being Sovereign he forew by Divine decree exactly who would be in his prde he chose her she did not choose him he called her so God the one who could open and the one who could shut he opened for you to be in the pride oh come on now Hallelujah and you didn't choose him but he chose you and we are trans have you transferred your rights have you transferred your rights to him is he your lord is he your king is he your leader is he your master I'm closing I'm done can the church say Amen give him praise last quote the Key of David was not David the king of Israel all Israel and is not Jesus the son of David according to the fact that he will sit upon the throne of David in the Millennium and Reign and rule over his Heritage surely so the Key of David signifies that it is Jesus who will bring in the Millennium he who has the keys to death and hell will raise up his own that they may share in his reign of righteousness upon the Earth we shall reign on the earth how wonderful that our Lord has all the answers friends I have no answers but our Lord has all the answers I'm done give him praise truly in him are all the promises of God fulfilled truly by being in him we are AES to what he has pushes us for oh Hallelujah Hallelujah and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful Cel the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace in him is perfect fulfillment oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] [Applause] hallelujah amen Hall just to bring the closer some of you may not have heard this in the mess Elijah bam said Christ is not on his right Throne he's on God's Throne now in Heavens but when he returns back he will come to David's Throne which he is air to in the manifestation of thy Resurrection to the people of this day butam said and to think he's waiting for us to take this gospel to all the world then he said I will return he's sitting on his father's throne tonight waiting to return to his own Throne David's Throne to rule and Reign through the Millennium he is longing to return and he's depending on the church he's depending on the church to get into position brother B said how short we have fallen God help us and forgive us and brother said the kingdom of God in God's preparation the kingdom of God shall Rule and Reign and smite down every nation every flag and there will be one flag that will be The Old Rugged Cross there will be one language that will be the Heavenly language one people that will be the Saints and they will rule and reign with Christ on David's Throne can the church say Amen oh Hallelujah Give the Lord a shout of Praise so come on you sons of David come on you priests and Kings come on you royal priesthood you peculiar Nation this is your year this is your time to
