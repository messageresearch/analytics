there uh Saint Mark chapter 11. amen this one familiar scripture here uh see in Mark chapter 11 and verse 22 says on Jesus answering answering the Sith unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but believe but shall believe that those things which he had saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said therefore I say unto you what things however you desire when ye pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your

God bless you tonight what a year we've had amen praise God I just thank God for this year there's been so many ups and downs in and outs but throughout all of it I feel that God has been involved in all of it praise God Amen he's his hand you'll see his handiwork in your life amen praise God Amen it's always like the Masterpiece you know when it starts off it looks like a blob or misshapen rock or whatever but it starts to take form over time praise God and as the artist continues to bring out praise God the Masterpiece begin to it starts to take shape praise God Amen and we see our lives taking shape under his presence under God's watchful eye under God's hand over us we see ourselves taking shape we're not what we ought to be but we are certainly not what we used to be praise God we are coming out of and we are going into something praise God do you believe it tonight amen amen praise God I feel that Wing praise God but uh amen I don't mean to ramble on but uh praise God but just reflecting on the year amen I don't know by the grace of God um if if this might have been last last service I preached to him maybe for the year amen but um we'll see what the Lord will do praise God you know as we close out but it's just been a real blessing to see God's hand upon our lives and to see him in every situation nothing happens by chance no encounter you have is by chance no person you meet or thing that happens to you is by chance if you truly believe that there is a God watching over you there's a supernatural Spirit looking over your life and and keeping you praise God then you don't there's no chance in that everything that happens is supposed to happen and couldn't happen any other way praise God Amen I was meant for a purpose everything serve God's purpose every flower every tree praise God and you are here for purpose tonight praise God hallelujah amen isn't that right if you didn't have a purpose in God and you wouldn't be here and that's just the way it is praise God remember if you're here tonight then that means god call you God put something in your heart God put something in your life to respond to the word of God not many could do what you are doing tonight you trespass sin you press past evil you press pass unbelief praise God what did that another Spirit another something inside your soul a seed inside of you crying out for Life cry I know for the supernatural crying out for the Holy Ghost crying out because you believe that it is out there somewhere it have to be real Prophet said he wouldn't give you a test if there wasn't something to satisfy that thirst and if you have a test tonight for the Holy Ghost then that means there is a holy ghost there is a God there is a power there is a fire otherwise you wouldn't toast for itch but the reason you're thirsty tonight the reason we're hungering tonight the reason that we came tonight is to meet Jesus and I believe Jesus is real I believe he's alive even after all these years even after the world tried to kick him out after the churches try to kick him out after America is trying to kick out God oh but we welcome him tonight we welcome him in this place we welcome him in our hearts we welcome him in our lives we need him more than ever I need him more than ever every day I live I realize how much less oh hello power I have and how much more powerful he is oh hallelujah hallelujah Glory oh do you believe it tonight yeah many men so I have a title tonight praise God the spirit of forgiveness amen and I have a subject faith is based on forgiveness amen all of that scripture you're ready all right say Mark 11 right amen praise the Lord is time pray and forgive praise God have faith in God you have faith to speak to the mountain but that faith is based on forgiveness oh Hallelujah glory to God isn't that right and we know the kindnesses or age requirements isn't that right and if it's a requirement then we have to have it in order to move forward our requirement is something I have to have amen if we're going to line up for application or something and they tell you I have to have a certain document then you have to have it they're not making no praise God unless you deprive them or something then I'm passing it to the back door there's no back door for you you have to have it if it is people you have to show up at your good people you inhabit and go down by the office catch a bird paper and come back here but we're not making excuses for nobody and brotherly kindness is a requirement you've got to have it you've got to have it praise God in order to move forward or tomorrow to move forward in God you want to have faith to speak to the mountain when you stand praying for gifts if you are born against any oh but if you do not forgive that neither will my Father in Heaven forgive you it's not a suggestion or it's not an argument it's a requirement you've got to have it hallelujah oh oh you've got to have it you've got to have it in order to give it oh hallelujah hallelujah and the devil is going to test you on it because that's what this world is about this world is a big war zone Hallelujah that's what it is every day Supernatural is taking place beyond the natural beyond your eyes could see someone was asking me a question one time praise God he said he said how is it possible yeah this is a question how is it possible for positive and negative energy to exist within the same a realm what do you call it who's down here praise God it's not right y'all people who worship God people who are Christians just like yourself they vibrate a certain energy when they go and they speak to people it comes out but around them said I could tell somebody the Christian in five minutes praise God I've encountered them I pick up their Spirit praise God they got something about them somebody who worships Lucifer's Spirits they have demons upon them they are angry they're always at War they have their face just looks like praise God Amen they had war with you praise God because that's the spirit that they they have they channel that they are knowing that they Inspire that they believe that they see the world through that atmosphere praise God and this is happening all around you you stand up in a bank and you have people of God people of of the world people here neither here nor there praise God there are people on faith fire for God and then there are people low praise God a man who's struggling trying to make it and so on on all over your levels it's a big war zone and every day territory is being either claimed or given up for the devil people an everyday territory is being claimed or given up for God what territory are you claiming tonight I came here to claim a territory for God to put my foot on the mountain and say give me this mountain praise God hallelujah we have the Lord speaking that day oh I don't care about the anarchyms I don't care about the parasites I don't care about the Philistines give me my Mountain I will kick them off run them out if I have to praise what is bound to belongs to me and tonight Malachi 4 fought to produce Hallelujah a mountain pray he gave us a vision of a mountain oh that we have to climb and brother I'm sold on this I don't know about you but live or die single swim let that live in me oh God is my prayer oh Hallelujah if I maintain nothing else let me maintain Christ oh Hallelujah give me my mountain tonight I'm better fights fight for my inheritance fight for my land fight for my portion if God give it to me then we are well able to take the land that he has promised us in this last day oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God nothing can stop the purpose of God and if God's purpose is in you then nothing can stop that oh Hallelujah God keep Moses a ticket Hallelujah a round trip back to the mountain he said bring this people back to this mountain to worship me there would enough devils in the universe to stop Moses from bringing the people back to that mountain don't care how many pharaohs how many armies how many Horsemen oh there was nothing to stop Moses and there's nothing to stop you tonight from receiving a baptism of the Holy Ghost not enough devils not enough demons not enough forces not enough spiritual awakenness in high places this could ever stop the purpose of God what he put inside of you the devil is too late tonight or you're gonna get a victory somebody shout victory oh give him a shout of Praise hallelujah oh glory glory glory glory amen so you gotta excuse me but I'm on fire tonight amen I see the hand of God in our lives you are trophies of his grace come out by yourself there was another Force there was another spirit that was with you that wouldn't let you die that wouldn't let you fall to the ground that when the enemy came like a flood the spirit of God raised a standard in 2022 and that's how you made it wasn't your education it was on your power it was in your greatness it wasn't your talents it wasn't nothing that you did it was what he had already done for you he paid the price and no devil in this universe could stop the purpose of God that he put in your heart in your heart Hallelujah Glory so don't you doubt don't you fear God is with us tonight he said he'll never leave you never forsake you if your name is on that book that angel come down to deliver every name every name that is on that book he comes to seal you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire seal an angel come down from heaven Hallelujah glory to God to fill up the children of God oh before those terrible plague strike you're gonna be sealed on the inside no Devil's gonna come in there your womb will be sealed can I conceive another but Jesus you're gonna bring forth Christ in this last day amen glory to God have you received them tonight am I wow okay well then we're on the same page now so if it's a requirement we have to have it isn't that right now we know that God wants to move isn't that right familiar code here and speak to this mountain Prophet said I believe that the Church of God is moving into a sphere now that's going to shake the whole world that's the first time it's been since the days of Jesus of Nazareth to a human being he said ask anything that you will and it shut it shall be given unto he said don't you see the words of Jesus Christ being fulfilled oh it's going to come to pass pretty soon he said I'm looking for it to happen in this meeting are you looking for it to happen you've got to be under expectation will you get what you expect oh if you expect God to move then he'll move oh but you don't expect nothing you get nothing oh Hallelujah glory to God and expectation in the atmosphere that is created by the Holy Spirit oh Hallelujah when you get into the spirit of the coming of the Lord then your expectation begins to rise according to the promises of God's word and God is obligated to keep every one of his promises outside his promises he can meet you but if you're standing on a promised word of God he is obligated tonight to meet you on the basis of his promises if he promises he will he'll meet you there and he'll heal you if he promised to deliver you he'll meet you there and deliver you if he promise I'll fill you with the Holy Ghost he'll meet you on the basis of that promise tonight oh oh he's got to because that's what makes him God the fact that he can keep his own word that's right because man's world will fail we speak in the morning and evening it perish but God's word will never fail and that's what makes him God so when he promised to deliver you when he promised to heal you but he promised to deliver your family when he promised to fill you with the Holy Ghost that's God's promise to you it's signed in his own blood it's got to happen the devil is a liar tonight he's always been lying to you but he's finished tonight he's finishing your life finishing your heart finish tonight oh we kicked him out of Heaven we're gonna kick him out down here oh there is no room for Satan no room for the devil no rule Hallelujah of unbelief glory to God hallelujah praise God Amen yes amen he said I'm wanting it to happen now that that anointing hear the prophet's expectation that that anointing will strike the whole Church of the Living God the whole church is not a person the whole church is not a certain certain group we're talking about the international Body of Christ into which we are all baptized into by one Spirit one over here one over there one over there here's my spirit flowing freely that's what we're talking about strike the whole Church of the Living God what an expectation yeah wow and she'll rise to her feet like I'm biting marching on me is that the sick will be healed by a word oh Hallelujah not even hands me later on just speak the word huh glory to God he said the devil here the dead will be raised up and the power of God will shake the world with the Church of the Living God he said we're in the process of it now he said but I believe it's soon coming to pass oh Hallelujah so back then was a process but now fulfillment of Prophecy praise God that's what we're looking for now a fulfillment of this he said I believe it will be just exactly that way I believe it's gonna strike the Church of God soon and it's going to start our Revival that will shake the world I believe it do you believe it tonight that's what we came for a Revival we didn't come for a program if you want a program going to Catholic Church praise God hallelujah hallelujah they have a program day it's wonderful but here we want to find foreign [Applause] [Applause] I can stop you tonight oh because that's your place in Christ abduction time that's what we're here for tonight oh hallelujah praise God amen glory to God Amen the Lord of Heaven who made the heavens on Earth whose servants I am he said and stand here before you now what a declaration he said and you and in the name of Jesus Christ those words are true Amen brother Branham we believe it praise God he said oh we're near something my heart here it is my heart waiting with anticipation I can't even rest in my hotel room last night he said I couldn't sleep at all he says it's never left me I couldn't sleep on the road out here I didn't oh he slept sleep for about two hours or three hours a night I just can't rest cause I know that someone's fixing to happen oh God is fixing to move on the scene just as sure as we're standing here oh so whatever the prophet saw had him fully persuaded somebody's fixing to move praise our Emily tonight This Promise dwell not fall to the ground nothing that Prophet said he'll ever fall to the ground there's coming a Revival amen do you believe it he said and I know it or not I'm only building you're always close at hand when you're gonna see something happen when something is going to take place oh I'm positioning this don't take it strange now we're still going to preach for only kindness praise God but just before we bring forth Christ that sweet spirit is going to come upon us praise God tonight because I believe something is fixing to move praise God hallelujah hallelujah glory amen they always come in when something's gonna happen somebody's gonna take place and all of this background here has only been laying our foundation for a short quick message oh glory to God hallelujah hey yes that will shake the whole Nations amen hallelujah on this on the church he said and I believe we're on the Borderland tonight I was wondering about all my meetings and things Prophet said hard to cancel them out he said but I truly believe before the church can have the Rapture it's got to have Rapture and fate he said we can't even have faith for Divine Healing let alone Rapture and fate gotta have a fate that will change your quickness body and be taken away he said and I believe there's a church on its Road tonight oh you on the road tonight glory to God hallelujah oh afraid to move mountains fate to move mountains Hallelujah glory to economy man got to have a faith that'll change his quick and his body and be taken away I believe there's a church on this road tonight a power of the Living God that man will speak the word here and there and it'll flash like lightning and the church is coming out oh tonight you're coming out oh we're breaking out it's a brickish jailbreak open the nation All Souls are gonna escape death Escape hell break out of prison House of Hell give way to the name of the Living God oh hallelujah praise God Oh Glory honey the church is coming out not a psychologist not some of this put on make-believe stuff no but a real true genuine anointed Holy Ghost call out church amen that's what's coming up praise God Amen back to the Bible back to the foundation amen it's not right okay United on the one hand Prophet said oh my this is kind of hard for a Baptist he said but I feel really religious right now he said I believe I could almost shout he said you don't think they should they shout you ought to get me around sometime he said oh I feel good here's the prophet said for I know that the spirit of the Living God is here he said and I just seen something happen to set my soul on fire oh hallelujah praise God oh getting the spirit of this quote here amen he said oh blessed be his name God will have a church United oh Lord I said he said one of these days he said it is not far down the road so the prophet is seeing something here's what he says he says we will be one one and purpose one purpose will be one he said like the Great temple when it went together there wasn't a buzz of a sore or a sound of a hammer for 40 years he said but God's continent and Methodist Baptist Presbyterian all funny looking blocks but one of these days the Holy Ghost will come that rejected Stone and the building will go together without a murmur one of these days just exactly that stone has been rejected that Chief Cornerstone which is the Holy Ghost new pillars of these denominations remember that the rejected Stone chipped Cornerstone he is here tonight he said I believe him oh Hallelujah he said oh how wonderful how glorious the prophet is shouting now but he's praising God now he says I know that he's present oh Hallelujah he said oh I wish you felt like I do he said I know why you think I am oh I may look silly he said but I'm not he said I may think you think you think I don't know where I am but I do he said it's the spirit of the Living God he said oh I can't just can't preach no more but a joy bells are ringing [Music] [Applause] I've never had it to happen like that he said but there's just something I know he said that there's coming a time that's coming something that's going to take place I see it this is a prophet I see it in the near future [Applause] Hallelujah what's he seeing cripples walking blind speaking gospel being preaching his power oh how are you seeing you receiving the Holy Ghost you see me you climbing your pyramid he's even you get in your Hallelujah your position in Christ oh Hallelujah my God that Church of God coming into his mighty power he's seeing it you see the Church of the Living God the spirit of living God fall fresh on his church I see it in the near future this is what he's saying he's described it said the spirit of the Living God falling fresh on his church there's going to be something take place he said I hear a sound in the mulberry bushes he said well she said something somebody just spoke to my heart and said fear not preacher they'll be one one of these days they'll believe oh holiday do you believe it tonight he said it may take persecution and things to drive us together but God will drive his church together just as certain I was standing in his Pulpit on the one he said that's Christ Christ will be the head no denomination will be the head Christ will be the head of every believer hallelujah oh get a lot of Shadow prayer Hallelujah oh my [Applause] God [Music] [Applause] no man takes a lot to be all right amen who am I glory to God so do you believe that tonight so we're on the expectation for something to take place praise God it's not right so we're talking about brotherly kindness right Spirit of forgiveness praise God and just before our mother gets ready to bring forth a child something happens right the prophet setting on things that ought to be said now remember now we're getting ready to bring forth Christ right so listen to this now remember the Bible said that if this is Tabernacle or dwelling be perished if it perish or be dissolved we have one already waiting just as the little baby its muscles and the mother are twisting and turning and bit just and see uh and he said uh and you notice you could take a woman he said if she is ever so foul but when she become a mother a little while just before the bad baby is born said there's a kindness about the woman he said get around her and there's always something she's more tender why because that because there's a little angel Spirit waiting to receive that Natural Body he said and just as soon as it's born the Breath of Life comes into it and God breathes it in there and it becomes a living Soul he said now just that this baby is born then the spiritual body is there to receive it amen it's not right but I wanted to notice here that there's that sweet spirit that comes upon the mother she could be fouled she could be whatever praise God but when that baby is about to be born there's a kindness that comes over that woman that gets you say get around her there's always something he said she's more tender oh hella Justice is getting ready to come forth praise God Amen and my wife was telling me praise God even if with our last with our son here she said she felt that anointing just as he was getting ready to come out she felt that anointing come over her something praise God it was a flushing praise always an anointing it was a presence praise God how the prophet's words are real praise God hallelu isn't that right amen she said she failed it praise God spiritual body said now what she said no perfect Faith sit on perfect fit the prophet said here said now faith is based on forgiveness said and then then as we said this morning trying to get the plate the church into a place where we could really see Apostolic times moving Among Us so look at how it's connected faith is based on forgiveness people have uh on expectations for Apostolic times moving Among Us praise God hallelujah but we've got to come to forgiveness he said that's what we all hunger he said and it's just laying right at the door he said we see it but we want to see more of it see he said he had his listeners he said we wanted to search a flow that it'll be a help to us and flow out to others oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hey so if you have to have faith for somebody that forgiveness has to be there also you can't pray for somebody with Autumn grudges huh praise God you can't enter into their sufferings praise God and you have hatred in your heart praise God and get your brother your sister no no that's got to be removed praise God has got to take God's got to take that out of there God's got to excavate that out of there oh and reform you and reshape you oh forgiveness where's the brotherly kindness but you want Faith to move mountains brother uh Jesus said when you stand praying forgive if you have what against any praise God that brings you forgiveness brings you on speaking terms with that angel oh hallelujah hallelujah it brings you on speaking terms with God hallelujah outside of that you lock God lock your neck praise God isn't that right shut the whole thing down why no forgiveness isn't that right praise God he says lean right at the door but it has to be such a flow that will help it'll be a help to us us to flow out to others oh hallelujah praise is not right that compassion has to be there isn't that right said now remember Jesus said now uh uh as we had in the lesson this morning he never used his power for himself he use it for others there it is nice so we want power power to heal a sick power to raise the dead power to cast our Devils praise God but it's meant for others and if it's meant for others then there can't be no Autumn grudges then you have to have been the right channel oh for God to use you to be a vessel to be used of God or you can be gummed up with hatred and envy and jealousy and enmity in your and your life praise God and ALT against this one or ought to get that you've got to get rid of that stuff in order for you to be a vessel for God to use you praise God people want power but there's a lot that goes with power there's a character that has to go along with that or what you'll end up with is a Lucifer on the earth killing people taking people out praise God with no forgiveness No Love No character of Christ amen to reflect praise God and to flow out be our help to others it's meant for others the prophet himself was sick yet he was praying for people and healing diseases and stuff like that and he had his own stuff going on he had his own ailments and stuff like that he said but a gift is meant for others he had the feel for them he had to enter into their suffering praise God it takes the spirit of God to do that praise God that's not you that's another Spirit God has to teach you Jesus learned obedience by the things that he suffered oh Hallelujah you have to suffer in order to Reign God's not going to give you power unless you're willing to go through stuff unless you're willing to go to heartache and to persecution go into rejection oh Halal going to respite Hallelujah and disapproval and stuff like that you've got to go through that in order to come out right on the other side a bunch of spoiled children isn't that right it's not there's brother green here he's talking about this is not a tailor shop I love that praise God this is not come and get we will fit something to fit you no you've got to get cut to fit this thing you've got to get cut to fit that God's not going to cut anything to fit you praise God that's how it is you got to grow and earn your way into this mantle praise God in the right God's Not Gonna freely give it over oh Hallelujah isn't that right he did that once before and man fell in the Garden of Eden with all our power with all our Glory he gave up the word praise God and took the Devils that are the devil's uh interpretation isn't that right true Eve it's not right and they lost the whole thing there so man's got to be restored back by the same word or that he fell from oh hell is not right so that's why God hallelujah send a prophet with the restored word throughout the ages then when we receive that word then God could bring the fullness of himself in us oh Hallelujah because that character that nature where that person will be in there oh now he could give power to you now you could heal the sick now you can call for this call for that why because you've got his nature his being oh hallelujah hallelujah amen oh praise God he said use it for others that's what it was sent for and you think sometimes well why would a man feel so full of power like him ever be sick he said yes sir he said but I've read in a book somewhere he said when he raised that body up the Widow's son from nine he said I believe the prince uh the House of David he said he set on a rock and grown with a headache see he bore our infirmity bear means to pack them see carry them see he bore he had all these things like we have he had sickness he had Temptation he had trouble he had frustration just as we have because he had to be the right kind of immediator so he had to be a partaker the husbandman of the fruit before he would know isn't that right the woman at the well and many things see if we look right into the scripture isn't that right amen praise God so he had to walk that road in order to tell you about that road because he walked that road and overcame you you can walk that road also and overcome tonight isn't that right praise the name of the Lord okay so then sixthly statue of perfect man the prophet said let's add the Bible says that let's add Broderick love broadly kindness so he's going on the pyramid and he said no that's a good one right there he said the sixth seven all right he said adding bodily kindness all right he said when we get to that brotherly kindness he said put yourself in his place who your brother can we save it put yourself in his place in your brother's place on the Mata now you see praise God Amen and amen now you now look at it differently praise God praise God because we see things through our own eyes and through our own eyes we are right and they are wrong but if we understand the struggle if we took a moment to see it through their eyes praise God no you can begin to put yourself in their place now you can begin to effectively pray for that person praise God because you're seeing in the way they're seeing it I'm not in your own head or in your own thoughts isn't that right praise God hallelujah said my brother sin against me said Peter Peter said shall I forgive him he said seven times a day seven times a day he said no 70 times seven see probably kindness now see if a brother is All Out Of Tune don't be impatient with him see he said be kind to him go anyhow oh Hallelujah it doesn't matter what he says no matter what a spirit is he's in go anyhow praise God because you're after his soul praise God imagine what you agree with him but you love his soul enough to pray for him oh you might always agree with him but your love is soul enough do not let him see in danger do not let him see go astray oh Hallelujah that's how you enter into amen for your brother brotherly kindness he said somebody said not long ago he said now watch he said now how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to the Assemblies of God and and the Oneness and all this all the rest Prophet said then put put Berlin and see put it let's look at it now said see hoping someday patient with him see temperant enduring with him see all these virtues coming out now Hallelujah as they enter as he's entering into the suffering what she says knowledge to understand what he believes remember it is in his heart that's what it is praise God it's living these virtues out put you in a self he said to let it go with kindness let it go out whatever you say whatever you do let it go out with kindness meekness to him having faith that someday God will bring him in oh on Sunday God will bring him in praise God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah amen it's like fishing I used to go on throw line three four a.m in the morning with somebody boys amen and sometimes oh they're throwing line and you throw a line Your Castle and you're with you have to wait for a long time please go outside the nibbling up your bit I'm going with it please go ahead and pull it back and put more bit and throw it out again and keep trying it's a patience game it doesn't happen right away praise God you have to wait with it enjoy with it stay with it praise God I have a meekness having kindness something to go out praise God hallelujah patience Hallelujah isn't that right going out with it isn't that right Hallelujah enduring all things believe in all things hope in all things charity never feel it oh Hallelujah when that comes into you then you're starting to live out something then you started to be like Christ to your brother be like Christ to your sister this is what it takes this is what we need oh Hallelujah we can't have that it's Titanic you see praise God Amen sometimes you get all caught up with the power and the glory and we love the testimony see the prophet go out there and heal the sick raise it then but there's a lot of Trials and testings behind that that you don't know about praise God stuff that he went through you see the man on the pulpit healing a sick and calling out sin and supplementing and discernment is flying all over the place praise God but they take a certain level of obedience to bring him up to that place where he could be a servant of God and a closer to God the prophet came the more shy like he become because he had to be trusting in God waiting on God Waiting for God he said you know what I'm waiting on I'm waiting on the Holy Spirit he can't heal the people he said you know I can't heal you I don't know nothing about your condition but there's a God in here who can there are God in here who did it one time and then all of a sudden the angel rush in a vision break something happened praise God and God began to minister it's not the man it's called using the man and it won't be a man today but there would be God fail in the people it's not the Acts of the Apostles but the acts of the Holy Ghost and the apostles Healing The Sick praising the Dead cast on our devils and if ever God is going to work again today it's got to be the Holy Ghost veil in a pride on the earth oh she gotta have the mind of Christ the intelligence to know what he once done with the word and she does it in his name oh Hallelujah Glory but there can't be no odds there can't be no grudges there can't be no bitterness there can't be no hatred there can't come to church and shaking hands and smiling with people and you go out to the world and you're mean like a junkie a dog God will not have that praise God you got to repent gotta make it right with your brother making rights with your sister make it right hallelujah oh Hallelujah hey is hard enough people really feel God don't see that's the problem if you go don't see sees everything you see the pray to the father who see it in secret and the father would see it in secret shall reward you openly it's the things that you do in secret you get the rewards for therefore if you're praying in Secrets going to your brother say brother forgive me brother I'm sorry you don't have to let the whole world know that you just go and make that thing right leave your gift for the altar go and make that thing rich and then come back and present your gift oh and not before oh Jesus said so oh that's not a suggestion that's a requirement that's something you have to do in order to hear from God in order to be used of God other than that it's just a big self starting there on the pulpit uh but if we call it more champions seeing a lot of stuff at Liberty praise God but no life to back it up after all these years in a message we can't have that we've got to come to Perfection we've got to come to adoption and before we bring in our Holy Spirit there's that there broadly kindness praise God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah God put that up there and the prophet said we make space for all these words like Temperance patience godliness but it actually gets narrow as it goes up gets deeper gets harder to climb harder to find place to put your foot break up because there's less of you and more of God yo you know holding on is he holding on to you as you press your way up but many fall off they don't make it all the way up there hey many many are called but few are chosen to go all the way up there praise God and produce Christ especially in this court and this Godless evil world to produce Christ that's a miracle but God's gonna have miracles in this end time oh look at yourself look at your brother go look at your sister you're a miracle standing here tonight you're a miracle sitting here tonight it was a miracle how you came out it was it was thousands of devans millions were lost when you were saved that's a miracle oh hallelujah praise God oh don't get me started oh my I'll tell this popping up you mean to tell me a lot of millions in this world God chose me to dwell in me to put his brotherly kindness in me to give me something something in the world that's longing for something in the world needs God's Gonna pour it into your soul Hallelujah pray that's the greatest message on the earth massage now and he's spoiling you building up Pride oh my my my my glory to God give another shot of praise [Applause] oh my think about it think about his love think about his goodness think about his grace that brought you truth [Applause] hey many man amen [Applause] so when we come to God God forgives us if it gives you of your trespasses gives you he pardons you of your iniquities your sin your filth your messed up situation he forgives that but what this is asking us for is to forgive others to climb another level higher he'll pray God God if God forgive me then why can't I forgive you what reason what reason do I have to hold it against you when God let it go for me when God helped me when he freely gave to me his love his power what reason what am I holding on to you think it's about us well I was hurt he was mean to me and you don't understand what I feel do you understand how I feel it did it to me I was the only one there there was no one else in the room when it happened still forgiveness you still have to find it because the church lost it and the prophet said she's got to find it in order to call to the other members of the body come and read I hate to come and rejoice with us they got to find that lost coin it's right in the wood people walk around it says it's right here they make circles in the desert they'll make the death walk until they come to it got a content we've got to tear yourself down your pride your good self that nice self not a bad self you're not talking about bad Christians people who smoke and drinkers no good stuff that one who comes to church pay tithe come early sure wonderful person never give a bad handshake that self have to die and rot and be stripped and killed and laid dead then God will use it because that's a lot of just a solar self dear God can't use that when God ready to do the spirit ready to flow and you say oh no no no not that one really not that one why why not that one same on your blood can't take that same one is who I want to heal and bless and deliver and you have to get yourself out of the way enough to love that person's soul oh how to love that brother that sister's Soul enough doesn't matter what history what relationship what took place what happened gotta get yourself out of the way said I am my biggest hindrance if I get myself out of the way then God could begin to use meat 10 minutes into the people it's not right I am my biggest enemy that's the way you've got to see it praise God Amen isn't that right remember God's calling Fishers of Men he say told Peter said I'll make you fish as a man what does that mean I'm gonna draw use your life to draw a man unto me in order to do that you cannot point the people to yourself Peter's Ministry and able to point the people to Christ point the people to Jesus to the one who can do something for them therefore it couldn't be about themselves it could be about Peter or Paul or James or John or any one of them it was about how much of themselves could die but they could Point themselves to the one who changed them to the one who saved them to the one who fill them with the Holy Ghost to the one who converted them Hallelujah and then Peter can say the one who confronted me here he is he is the spirit here's a spirit flowing freely that's his presence that you feel it's not me it's Christ praise God hallelujah then in order to be in that kind of a way you've got to be in a red spirit isn't that right the right attitude right character e many man freeze God hallelujah now this is not the

reviling it's not right oh my it feels good here tonight amen we're coming on to our nice clothes here oh Hallelujah hey man you've been a great group oh thank you Jesus tonight Blasphemous names Prophet said but what what this man was pouring into the water he's talking about uh uh Shepherd's dream right he said the messenger come to the church point the message into the church but what was the water doing see it was boiling all the trash that was in it that was what that's what the Holy Spirit does boils it up now amen boils out the trash isn't that right it's a moving of the spirit Right Moving the trash out bringing his presence in now watch now the honey represented brotherly love brotherly kindness which is this age this age we are now he said I just got through telling you see of broadly kindness the age that we live in now praise God so that's what we got to have it that's the age we're in yeah he said now watch now you may look he said look now I don't like but I've never he said oh sure I don't I don't like brother Jones he's making making a point right I don't like butter so and so something like that right he said but just let something happen to him oh brother your heart is broke it nearly killed you see we can obtain bodily kindness and feeling for one another see but to maintain it in a group of people he said he said why do you care for that brother because you broke bread with him here the altar as as you would tonight you fellowship with him you shook his hands you worship with him he's your brother and he might do something in the flesh that you disagree with because you just kind of say stay well which way you ought to do you just Sun him a little and so on but in the bottom of your heart if something really happened to that brother you it would just nearly kill you or that sister amen all right he said I'm an old man I once was young and now I'm old I've seen it throughout the age do that here people say I don't want nothing out no more him and something happened to that man oh it nearly kills him see he thinks oh God I let my precious brother go without making friends with him something deep down inside you telling you that praise God hallelujah man that's a that's that's it right there proves that it does exist pray there is a brotherly kindness that exists it's deep down in the heart of you praise God even though you fall out even though things happen it's not right one time a scientist was telling was talking about um he was trying to prove the existence of God right here's what he said he said logic will tell you that if an old man is drowning in a pool he's drowning in the water and he can't get out and he can't swim to save himself logic and science will tell you let the man die because he's old if he's older than you and you are younger then logically your time expectancy is longer than his so it doesn't make sense to risk your life to save him stay out of the pool stay here and let him die that is what logic would say that is what science would say because it makes sense but something in the human Spirit won't let you do that something inside of you is telling you to save him that there is still a chance for him and the man said that's what God put inside of you that means you have a soul you're not a robot you're not a calculator there's something vibrating inside of you that loves other people you understand what I'm saying there's something deep down inside of you that loves him you've never met him before but he's a living Soul oh Holland somebody's out of his move to save that man if he said that's what God put inside of you he put something in your heart to love other people and forgive other people and help somebody and do something praise God and God could work with that oh Hallelujah he can't work with a robot but he could work with that because he put it in you praise God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah it's more than the science it's more than this logic it's a spirit you see and so if the spirit of God truly come upon somebody it will give them a burden for Lawsons if they're giving them it's not right amen the Holy Ghost really come into a man it'll give him a burden for this for the loss a burden to pray for somebody doesn't matter what church he goes to it doesn't matter what group what Fellowship what race he is praise God there's something inside of that man that's vibrating a life a presence praise God that's reaching out to others helping it to flow out to others and God can work with that praise God wants to use you but you've got to be willing to be stripped God's got to strip you more and show you less of yourself and more of him more of his love his power his forgiveness his Mercy oh and when you see it you begin to come more like him now God could use you to expand your circle and to reach out to others and to pray for others and to be effective to others and to help somebody and to pray for somebody at the standing again for somebody I don't have a burden for somebody yeah I had to hold on I said Lord help my brother Lord help my sister Lord help him to hold on until his change come and we'll make it together by the grace of God oh hallelujah hallelujah amen May praise God hallelujah may God put it in your soul amen if this is what we need it's a spirit with me in order to truly Carry Out The Works of God in the attitude and behavior of Christ you have to come into His likeness His Image you have to reflect that but he's gone isn't that right oh my God praise God Amen he said well uh something happened on my mind and then he kills him see not as much as she come there from there down the hill to the bottom of the hill no he's still talking about the dream he said now this glorious water was gushing over Hills and five streams and now five is the number of Grace j-e-s-u-s-f-e-i-t-h-gree uh g-r-e-c all five letter C five is the number of Grace five streams was pouring up out here through through down there and each one of these ages had that rock confession the Saints are sleeping waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting see until this age but as soon as the Holy Ghost being poured out from Christ will come and seal up the church and that the church will be raptured oh is that what you're hoping for tonight it'll be a complete unit of God a bride for Christ who will be the head of all things he said you follow me now amen and amen First John 3 let's read through this here Behold a man of love the father bestowed upon us that we shall call the sons of God therefore the world knows not us but we it knew him praise God Amen is not right now watch this here he said now watch no this is First John 3 and verse 4. uh he said whosoever committed sin transgendered also for the law of the law for the Senate uh is the transgression of the law amen it's not right okay let me skip on verse 7 says whosoever abided in him sinneth not whosoever sinner had seen him neither had known him let little children let no man deceive you he that do it righteousness is uh is righteous even as he is righteous praise God it's not right okay it's the part I want to get to is this a children of God are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever do it not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother for this is a message that you have heard from the beginning that we should love one another not as Cain who is that of the wicked one and slew his brother and therefore slew he him because of his own Works were evil and his brothers righteous praise God isn't that right it was a oh it was an abominable thing what he said am I My Brother's Keeper praise God hallelujah how could he say that isn't that right that is that's evil praise God Amen praise God it's not right see of the wicked one see but Marvel not my brethren if the world hits you he said but we know that we've passed from that one to life because we love the Brethren he said he that loveth not his brother abideth in death this is a scripture you know amen my verse 15 says whosoever hate this brother is a murderer and you know that no mother had eternal life abiding in him hereby perceive we love the Lord uh we the love of God because he laid down his life for us this is a perspective amen and he gave his life for us praise God then we live our life of service service to others as Christ gave to us isn't that right and we ought to lay down our lives he said for the brethren for whosoever had this world's good has seen his brother have need and shuttered up his bowels of compassion for him who dwelleth the love of God and how dwell at the love of God in him question he said but my little children let us not love in the word neither in tongue but indeed and in truth and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall also of our hearts before him for if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart I know it all things this is the part I want to get to amen amen if you've got odds and grudges in your heart then your heart condemns you then how can you have faith before God faith is based on forgiveness so then he said beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence towards God the Bible says it right here amen isn't that right this is what we want to come to praise God your heart condemned me or not now you're in a condition praise God to ask he said ask what you will and it shall be given because forgiveness is there praise God you've cleared it out praise God in your speaking terms with God ask what you will he said whatever you ask we receive of him because we keep his Commandments and do these things that are pleasing and inside and this is his Commandment that we should believe on the name of his son Jesus Christ and love one another as he give us his commandment amen Christian 4 said beloved let us love one another for lovers of God and everyone that loveth is a born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not know it not God for God is love and then this was manifested the love of God towards us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him oh you're alive tonight because of him praise God hearing his love not that we love God but that he loved us and he sent his son to be the appropriation for all sins so beloved so if God so loved us we ought also to love one another no man had seen God at any time he said but if we love one another God dwelleth in us it's the evidence that God is in you so shall he be my disciples when you have love one for another he said God dwelleth in us and has and his love is perfected in US hereby know that we dwell in him and he and us because he had given up his spirit and we have seen that do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world and whosoever shall confess to Jesus the son of God God dwelleth in him and he in God Amen and amen do you love it tonight amen praise God so he said in this commandment verse 21 we have from him that he will love it God love is his brother also and a message Elijah I'm getting ready to close here now time is fast pen praise God but uh trust has been a blessing to you tonight amen but a sin could come please go now everyone wants to be loved he said I tell you the truth I do oh I want to I want to love me and I want the people to love me see that that's exactly the truth and if God loves me then the people who will love me and if if I love his people then he'll love me for doing it God would rather add love you than love him
