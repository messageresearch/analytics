========================================

For by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created by him and for him. And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence. In the church world today, there is two systems of work. And now listen, read your book. Now, let's see if you going to say amen on this. There's two systems working in the church world today. I'm going to get this off my shoulder and then I have it over with. We all know that. That's the word of God and the denominational system. There is the two systems at work. Just as it was Jacob and Esau, one end of the spirit, the other half of the flesh. And what is it? Esau and Jacob was fighting in the wombs of the mother even to the time they were born. And so is the denominationals and the word fighting one against the other. They have been since Luther first brought the first reformation. I hope that's simple enough that you can understand it. These men if they pick up this and go out with it, they can make more sense to it. See to bring it to a place you I just want to lay this seed. Hope they make it come to life. Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach except they be sent? As it is written, how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things. Now I believe that there's a church coming into that perfection, that ministry of perfection or the offices were apostles, prophets, teachers, pastors, evangelists for the perfecting of the church, them pastors and teachers and so forth to be so with the word until the whole thing will work right up to the coming of the Lord. I believe that and I believe we're nearing that time now. I believe so. That's right. If you're not called to the church or so forth, they are chosen by God, apostles. Second, prophets. Third, I may not have these lines just right. Third, I think, is teachers and evangelists and pastors. Five spiritual offices in the church to set the church in order. apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists, pastors. Those are called offices by God. Then in the local congregation, there's nine spiritual gifts that work among the people. Now, in these offices and places in the offices, you hear from the apostle, his ministry. You hear from the prophet, his ministry, from the evangelist, from the teacher, from the pastor. Each has a separate ministry and their ministries is of God. God has set them in the church for this purpose. Heat. Heat. [Music]
