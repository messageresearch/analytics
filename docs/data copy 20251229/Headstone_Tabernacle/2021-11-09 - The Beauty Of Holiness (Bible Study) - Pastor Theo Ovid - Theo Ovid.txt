tonight and honor your word among us take me out of the way and inspire it to the hearts of your children in jesus name i ask it amen god bless you and welcome um i'm happy to be here tonight and share this word with you and if you have your bibles i'd like you to turn to psalms 96. i want to take something from out to that psalms 96 and we would see how it grows so psalms 96 in the bibles says oh sing unto the lord a new song sing unto the lord all the earth sing unto the lord bless his name show forty salvation from day to day declare his glory among the heath his wonders among all people for the lord is great and greatly to be praised he is to be feared above all gods for all the gods of the nations are idols but the lord made the heavens honor and majesty are before him strength and beauty are in his sanctuary give unto the lord we kill dreads of the people give unto the lord glory and strength give unto the lord to glory due unto his name bring an offering and come into his courts oh worship the lord in the beauty of holiness fear before him holy earth say among the heathen that the lord remembered the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved he shall judge the people righteously let the heavens rejoice and let the earth be glad let the sea roar and the fullness thereof let the feast be joyful and all that is therein then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before the lord for he cometh and he committed judge the earth he shall judge the world with righteousness and the people with his truth tonight i want to extract something from that verse 9 there and it says worship the lord in the beauty of holiness and for title to give this bible study tonight i want to call it the beauty of holiness that's the title uh i want to give it tonight the beauty of holi uh you know we talk about yoga gyro gorgeous provider and what is a healer called the liver corres i am that i am i am and whatever you have need of he he has and he will provide and so on but there is one distinction in of him that defines him than any other being or person or any other thing and that is his holiness and we were not born holy actually as you know we were born in sin and shape iniquity and of time you would hear say that when moses came to the children of israel to bring them out the only hearing about this god he didn't notice god moses met this god moses was in his presence in the burning bush and so on so god told moses bring them to this mountain and bringing them to the mountain was to teach them to reveal himself to them to share his thoughts and word with them because they didn't know him and i want you to see us tonight in israel as not knowing god the way he's supposed to know him and how we're supposed to know him in that way and having a design in your heart you want to know him not just as a provider to give you bread and food on your table not just as a protector you have a shelter you protect it from evil and harm and danger all of that is different attributes but to know him in the beauty of holiness so god help us tonight help me tonight it's a thought that struck my heart and i said i will dig into it and look into it and and it was really something else in going through what we're going to share tonight so let's let's go forward now this thing about beauty and i want to look at this is exodus chapter 28 when god was telling them about making the garments for era and this is exodus chapter 28 verse 1. and i want you to see how god see beauty and i wish i don't have it tonight but i know there's somebody who put out a nice drawing of this how it looks it's really really beautiful the priest garment listen to the description here of reading from chapter 28 and read in verse 1 and take down unto thee aaron thy brother and his sons with him from among the children of israel that he may minister unto me in the priest's office evan aaron aaron's sons and thou shall make holy garments for iran arana iran thy brother here what for for glory and for beauty now this is god speaking here and this is how god wants the objective of the garment and then those three we begin the details why and everything else and those shall speak unto all that are wise-hearted whom i are filled with the spirit of wisdom and that they may make aaron's garment to consecrate him that he may minister unto me in the priest office so god is saying these people who have the gift and talent are inspired by me to do this with four and these are the garments which they shall make a breastplate an effort a robe a broided coat a might a girdle and they shall make holy garments for aaron thy brother and his sons that he may minister unto me in the priest's office they shall take gold and blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen they shall make the effort of gold of blue of purple of scarlet and fine-twined linen with cunning wood it shall have two pieces there are joined at the two edges thereof so shall be joined together and the curious girdle of the ephod which is upon it shall be of the same according to the work thereof even of gold of blue of purple and scarlet and fine twine linen thou shall take two onix stones grave on them the names of the children of israel six of their names on one stone and the other six names and the rest of the other stones according to their booth but the work of an engraver in stone by the engravings of a signet shall thou engrave the two stones with the names of the children of israel thou shalt make them to be set in arches of gold and thou shall put the two stones upon the shoulders of the effort for stones of memorial under the children of israel and eren shall bear their names before the lord okay so i'm going to stop there and okay i'm going to stop it but i read that for you to show you one maybe when you have time you can go and read it just show you the details of how god want beauty and glory for the garments of the priests because the office that will represent him now i don't want to see priests as just iran and ministry and whatnot because you are called to be kings and priests after the order of course of manchester we are called into this priesthood so to speak oh let's continue now isaiah 38 was it says and a highway shall be dear and away and it shall be called the way of holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the way fearing men though fools shall not kill therein so i want you to say tonight that god speaks up a highway and in that highway let's call that highway the broadway and let's call the way of holiness the narrow way away in the middle of the highway so let's say this road this highway is all of christianity all the different churches and people from different churches and different groups but amidst all of that there's a we call the way of holiness and i trust that god help us tonight to see clearly that way he's talking about okay deuteronomy chapter 14 verse 2 says for dawah the holy people unto the lord thy god and the lord had chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself above all the nations that are upon the earth so this is god's thinking of getting a people that one they'll be holy unto him two they'll be peculiar or different or unique in other words we as believers cannot be as same as those unbelievers or those in the world we are called to be peculiar different you have to see that that you're called to be apart separated unto god this is a high calling and that is what we are called to now the word sanctification sanctified is means to be made holy or consecrated and sanctification i think we did it some time back in the bible study is the will of god first thessalonians four very interested in scripture first testament for we want to refuse one to seven it says furthermore then we beseech you brethren and exhort you by the lord jesus that you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please god and so should have bond more and more for you know that commandments we give you by the lord jesus for this is the will of god the will of god even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication and that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor not in the loss of concussive sense even as a gentiles which knew not god that no man go beyond and before his brother in any matter because that the lord is the avenger of all such and we also have forewarned you and testify for god but not call us to unclean us but under holiness so this what we are sharing tonight has nothing to do with church going to church and and and and you belong to a group or you go to this church or whatever this is the calling of god i want to read this in the amplified furthermore brethren we beg and admonish you in virtue of our union with the lord jesus that you follow the instructions which you learn from us about how you ought to walk so as to please and gratify god this has nothing to do with pleasing church it has to do with god as indeed you are doing and you have to do so even more and more abundantly attaining greater perfection in living this life for you know that charge and precepts we give you on the authority and by inspiration of the lord jesus that this is the will of god that you should be consecrated and that consecrated here in the amplified says excuse me separated and set apart for pure and holy living that you should abstain and shrink from all sexual advice that each one of you should know how to possess and that process is to control manage his own body in consecration purity separated from things profane and honor not to be used in the passion of lust like the heathen who are ignorant of the true god and have no knowledge of his will that no man transgress and overreach his brother and defraud him in this matter or before his brother in business for the lord is an adventure of all these things as we have already warned you firmly and told you plainly for god has not called us to impurity but the consecration to dedicate ourselves to the most thorough purity so i hope this strike you tonight since that i think we're drilling down with the heart with the mind with what god requires of us and it's not i have any message and i have a a good pastor or a good teacher or good apostle or whatever or i belong to this i belong to that is whether or not you are prepared tonight to take the next step because it is a step to get closer to god or to take the next step in what god requires of us okay so let's continue go praise the lord for the brown he was referring to this in the church ages i know that i work scripture by labor like patience as he walks in the midst of his church he's aware of the suffering of his people and he cares as it was in the days of the captivity in egypt when he heard a cries he who never changes still hear the cries of the oppressed as he walks among them the very word labor signifies awareness to oppression god's people do not only work for him in a labor of love but they suffer for him with joy they are patient and bearing the yoke this first aid suffered great persecution it had to work hard to preach the gospel and the shed for truth their high calling in life was to serve god and when their hopes in life were blighted they were patient and committed all to him who would promise a lasting recompense in him for what they had given up for him on earth i think we ought to stop here and deal with the thought that god's people have always been and always will be persecuted you know that genesis is the book of the beginnings you find starting there will carry right on through the revelation never change we see that cain persecuted and killed either because the latter pleased god we see a perfect picture of abraham the son of the flesh ishmael who teased and fought with the son of promise isaac there was esau who hated jacob would have killed him had not god intervened in the new testament we find judas between jesus while the religious orders of the first century attempted to destroy the early believers the children of this world controlled by the devil hate the children of god who are controlled by the spirit here we go no matter how just and upright a christian is before the public and how gracious he is to his fellow man doing not but good let him confess christ as his savior and acknowledge the operation of the gifts of the holy spirit in tongues prophecy healing and miracles and he will be condemned the spirit of this world hates the spirit of god and because it can't overcome the spirit of god it tries to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit of god dwells persecution and trials are a natural normal part of the christian life i think that would reason again persecution and trials are a natural normal part of the christian life there's only one thing you can do about them commit them all to god judge them leave their own working and final judgment to him though can't not bear them which are evil scripture continues and that was tried them would say their apostles and are not and has found them liars these ephesians believed that god's people ought to be holy oh could we give the lord a praise offering tonight these ephesians believe that god's people ought to be holy according to this verse they took steps to keep the body unleavened from sin remember we talk about the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth and sunday right but they took steps to keep the body unleavened from sin most evidently the apostasy had already started sin had entered into the church but they were obedient to the words of poor when he said to put away the wicked from amongst them they were separated people they had come out of the world and now they weren't going to let the world enter amongst them they were not put they would not put up with sin in the church holiness wasn't a phrase with them or a figure of speech it was a way of life oh could we give the lord some praises tonight are we going to get back to that where holiness becomes not a phrase not a figure of speech but a way of life because this is what the origin and we have to get back there now let's continue and i believe this is from hebrews 12 and it says here and you have universe five and you are forgotten the exhortation which speak it unto you as unto children my son despite not though the chastening of the lord so we will see how in this trial and testing road which is the narrow path or let me say because that was chosen this is the harder way in narrow way you walk in your own choosing and some of you tonight would be challenged to make a choice tonight as to the way that you're going to walk and we identify that way already is called the way of holiness so peter is drilling down here paul he says now my son despise not the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the lord love it the sexy chastener and scorch it every son you receive it if you end your chastening god delivered you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if ye without chastisement where if all are partakers then your pastors are not sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and they give us and we give them reverence shall we not much rather gave me subjection unto the father of spirits and live for the verily for a few days chasing us after their own pleasure but he for our prophet listen listen so he's saying natural father chastened us we give them respects and so on and jesus for our pleasure for their pleasure but god for our prophet any objective of that that we might be partakers of his holiness hallelujah so the objective of chastening the whip the rebuking the correction is for us to be and you can say it out with me tonight partakers of his holiness repeat after me partakers of his holiness that is the objective because we don't know god in that way we don't understand his holiness there is no measure to it you could say you could say like the teacher in your class with a very a great man or wise man you could say this brother is very knowledgeable you could say this man is a great father you could say this man is a very good prime minister or president or whatever it is but you cannot say this man is holy that teacher is a holy man you can't see that the person you could point that to his god he is god and he is holy it's the quality that that of what he's made up of and because we are born in sin and shape in liberty our desires is skewed our motive or objective is skewed he said the heart is most deceitful who can know it but god so god offer he's a new heart i will give you a new spirit i'll put within you and then i put my spirit in your spirit he said let's exchange do your sins be a scarlet they shall be right as well so what god wants to do with man full man and a man who want to serve the lord is given exchange you're drinking you're smoking that's what am i going to do run young woman carrying on adultery fornication everything else but then he comes a bigger heart operation to change your desires but that is what it's all about to give you a new nature to give you a new desire so the desire for drinking if you move desire to lust is removed desire to run around and fool around is removed and as that comes out by the operation of the spirit you find your desire changes for the things of god the things of the word things of heaven the things of righteousness knowing that is not your works understand this knowing that is not your ability is god's grace because we are redeemed by the blood of the lamb do you believe that tonight oh blessed be the name of the lord now okay let's continue now romans 13 11 to 14 is a familiar scripture but i think it will it will be seen fresh tonight and romans 13 verse 11 and that knowing the time that noah is the high time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed the night is far spent days at hand let us therefore cast out the work of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in writing and drunkenness not in chambering unwantedness not in strife and envying here we go verse 14 do i want to get to but put you on the lord jesus christ and make not provisions for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof in other words don't set yourself up to fall in the flesh don't set yourself up to be going on lusting and carrying on don't set yourself up don't make provisions for that so what is what is holiness how can we identify holiness we are not born with it you could we could only have holiness to the extent that we know god because god alone is holy first peter says here he says um this is first peter one and peter's saying here elect verse two rather first peter chapter one was to elect according to the four knowledge of god the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience so okay let's let's take that slowly okay so peter is speaking to the church scattered to pontus galatia the producer asia and virginia he's an elect this is true of first peter chapter one elect according to the four knowledge of god so that's one part that's god's mind true sanctification of the spirit that's done here now unto obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace unto you peace be multiplied and then peter begins blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy had begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefined that freedom of the way reserve in heaven for you who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein he greatly rejoiced don't know for season if need be you're in heaviness through manifold temptations so peter send them up to heaven show them the other inheritance and it's undefiled they feel another way it is reserved it's reserved but you're going to stop now that the trial of your fate being more precious than of golden person so these christians were going through a rough time a tough time and they were in heaviness through manifold temptations i was six seven you identify those temptations and all those heaviness that's the trial of your fate be more precious than of gold that parachute do it be tribal fire might be fun unto praise honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ whom have we not seen you love in whom though now you see and not yet believe in you rejoice with joy and speakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently and prophesied of the grace that should come unto you certain of what manner of time the spirit of christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of christ and the glory that should follow let's jump to verse 13. wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ let's go to 14 now as obedient children here we go not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust in your ignorance but as he which have called you is holy be holy in all manner of conversation now that word conversation is not like talk not like fellowshipping that word conversation means manner of life okay so verse 16 because it is written be holy for i am holy and if you call on the father who without respect of persons judge it according to every man's work pass the time of your sergeant here in fear now that is that speaks for itself in other words you can you cannot carry about yourself if you have no fear of god they say to you for as much as you know that you will not redeem with corruptable things as silver and gold from your vain conversation or manner of life received by tradition of your fathers but with the precious blood of jesus christ as of the lamb laminator blemish and without spot who verily was foreign before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in these last times so in the amplified that verse 15 says but as the one who called you is holy you yourself also be holy in your conduct and manner of living for it is written you shall be holy for i am holy now from the random question announced on genesis he was saying that there were ten men to meet the bergen jesus said so that's right how many agree with that see amen consciousness says amen time went to meet him no watch all of them were holy well in order to be holy they had to be sanctified so sanctified means being made holy because that's the only cleansing holy stream that god has is sanctification now watch all ten of them were sanctified but five didn't have any oil in their lap five had oil in their lamb is that right what does oil represent not not the purity the virginity all represent the holy spirit okay so now i think sometime back i spoke about uh um the the wise virgins and the elect and so on like that but here it is to come now to not just living any life you're talking about the first holy spirit the first clot or out of the cloth of sanctification he's cutting out a bride let me rephrase that out of this holiness bunch or sanctified bunch there's a bunch in the bunch that's going to ask for oil or get extra oil the rest will be sanctified so in other words the unsanctified life not even counter don't even talk wrapped at all don't even talk rapture unsanctified life heading for tribulation let me say it good or let me rephrase it on holy life head in for tribulation so if your life not as it's supposed to be you have an opportunity tonight to get it right or to refocus or be transformed by your mind being renewed and the prophet said justification okay you're filthy you're dirty you're smoking drinking you're sinner you'll give you are to be lord is picking up a beauty glass sanctification is washing the glass preparing a glass and setting your mind in order for holiness so you can't bring in your stuff into god's plan and program you can't drag all your stuff whatever you used to do and how you should do it no that is what you used to do what you are setting your mind for is to see you know what god say be holy it's a command and i'll get it for i am holy it's not a suggestion you know you know it you should live a clean life you know you know it's a good thing to do some moral things that's not what he's saying here this is a requirement i'm not talking about sunday sanctifying i'm not talking about wednesday nights and people i'm not talking about when you go to church you're holy and when you're not in church you're unholy no this is a way of life there's a highway and a way and the way shall be called the way of holiness oh blessed be the name of the lord so brother brian said no you said i i don't think i am okay he said i want to be holy but if the lord ever told me to rule i guess i will rule but i want you see what i said i want to be holy anyhow and live a life of holiness means cleanness before god oh my and if there is one person that got an experience that transformed his life is isaiah and we want to go to isaiah 6 a family scripture we want to read them one to seven isaiah we know was leaning on king uzziah the musa was a king he tried to play priests he went and interfere with the incense and whatnot they beg him don't do that and he got leprosy and he died and when he died it shook up the prophet isaiah as i hustled into the temple i began to crowd into god and god gave him an experience not just a word but an actual experience and we want to look again at that experience tonight in the context of what is being presented tonight isaiah chapter six i don't want you to see it as a scripture text but you're here already and you're ready already but i want you to see what is required of us of you of me is up to six reading verse one in the year that king judge died i saw also the lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and the stream filled the temple above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings between two wings he covered his face between two wings he covered his feet and between he did fly and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said i who is me now before we continue dear pull it right there then say that who is me this is a prophet it's not a pastor there's another teacher this is a prophet this is a man that speaks on behalf of god look at the effect of presence look at the effect of god's holiness look at the effect what effect it has do you see arrogance do you see pride do you see a man seen himself up there somewhere hear what isaiah said who is me for i am undone because i'm a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for my eyes i've seen the king the lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a life call in his hand which he had taken from the tongues of the altar now this here is not a message simon these aren't an attacks is that a man preaching revelations and mysteries and unfold the word and open up the bible and open up this and open these are open this is a man that come into presence and baraban said the seraphims are the burners they are the one that presents the worshipper and brings them into god's presence so they are in charge of this sanctifying fire baptizing and purifying you haven't had god yet because to get rid of god you have to pass these beings these beings oh glory around the children of god they cried day and night holy holy lord god almighty holy holy they're not stopping two wings to cover their feast humility irreverence two wings they cover their feet and humility and two wings they in action in action in humility and reverence that's how the ministry is supposed to be in action in humility in reference a little child could talk to you anybody could correct you anybody could to bring a word for you you're not above anybody oh hallelujah because the presence of god that dania one dead to john book of revelation he fell as one did the presence have one effect upon man it shows man littleness it shows we are nothing it shows me about us it shows that we can't even stand in the presence but the man says for days he was numb and the angel presence break upon him oh my god hallelujah then flew one of the surfaces of me having a life call in his hand which he had taken from the tungsten of the altar is that a silence i believe no this is something active this is a live call like i call on fire he laid it upon my mouth and he said lo this has touched my lips and that iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged hallelujah and we know this other part of scripture when the lord the voice of god said who shall go for us he said he are my lord send me he had confessed he was purged and he got a commission three wings action humility and reverence and brother brown was singing the song millions now and sin and she went down listen to this sad and bitter he's some brother he's into their rescue quickly on some master here [Music] speak my only speak tonight speak my lord speak and i'll be quick to answer thee [Music] speak my law [Music] speak and i will answer lords and then begin to pray begin to pray said heavenly father let us be the depths of our heart lord truly millions know in sin and jim are dying right here in the city of phoenix literally thousands grouping in sin and here we stand this morning enthralled with the presence of the holy spirit we are all conscious of his august presence i feel him in my heart i feel him among the people oh god may a vision come to us that we can see the holiness of god and see how little we are may the temple post we move in our presence and there while we are in his presence lord may the power of the holy spirit just shake us o lord that not only the temple shall be moved but the post in our hearts will be moved the post of indifference that let the poor the door of god's opportunity to come in be moved and the stone of unbelief taken away and let us lord answer quickly master i humble myself i wonder wings over my feet over my face first lord humble me that i might influence others granted lord or give the lord some praise right now my lord i feel his presence i want you to write where you are begin to just give god some praises and worship him oh right now but abraham god can do without you he can do without me but we can't do without him we have got to have him for his life and he alone not to know his book not to know this no doubt or know the creed but to know him his life know him as the person christ in you the word made flesh in you that's knowing him when you and he become one like i said last night in the super sign he has got to come in you god and man must come one and here is bomb you are conscious of your littleness i wonder how much ministers conscious of their living i've met believers and ministers and pastors and different people so arrogant nobody could talk nobody can tell them anything at all they know it all they have it all but what i am seeing like how the prophet said he said intellectually we are hearing the message how we need to lay in the presence of the sun till our fate isn't ripe enough we need to lay in the presence what what laying in the presence means you know in church and you know five hours someone but lean in the presence really me the presence of god because when isaiah come into that presence it transformed his life never be the same after that never oh blessed be the name of the lord so what you are conscious of your littleness in closing i might use other other two wings totally he could fly with the other two wings watch face covered by wholeness of god and in reverence his feet covered in humility and with two wings he could put himself in action to move god was showing his prophet hallelujah god was showing his prophet how a prepared servant ought to be quit looking at uzar here is your example i've sent before you cover your face in reference cover your feet in humility and go into action oh what an example he had looked at us so long and seen it fail no god was telling him what to do showing him happy at seven you see what going along isaiah was leaning on uziah and god allowed us to feel in order to get isaiah where he wanted him and god will allow people that you lead on to feel we don't want people to feel but god wants you to depend upon him god wants you to lead on lean on him that is what god wants man wants you to lean on them especially them message popes and bishops and whoever they think they are they want to release on them because they want to be like like like it's true which they get to god no jesus is the channel to get to god which is the word all they're supposed to present is the word i'm pointing to christ oh praise the name of the lord okay so isaiah 57 15 this is a scripture that i love isaiah 57 15 if you have the bible you want to go to it and this is the scripture i i really love for those seat the high and lofty one that inhabited eternity whose name is what an introduction i'm not a boss i am not the person you're working for i'm not your husband i am not i'm not prime minister president tell me who i am dusty at the high and lofty one so he's up there that inhabits that eternity what time his whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place this is where he lives with him also o glory that is of our contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones right now you should be giving god some praises because he identifies who he's going to work with he identify where he is who he is how he lives and who he's going to communicate with you're going to commit those who have a humble heart and a contrite and that's a broken spirit oh blessed be the name of the lord so friends i want you to think now of your approach to god and approaching god on the basis of his holiness you know people could approach god on the basis of he give things you know the rain falling just on just oh bless me lord i want a car i want a job i want and they get it the people have child like feed they ask god they get it and they see god as a blesser they see god as a giver and um what do you say he added no sorrow with it and so on and but tonight i want you to see your approach to god is approaching him by way of his holiness and what he wants of us because this brings sunday service in a deeper way um sincerity and truth into into bringing us alive with the holiness of god which is what you require of his people what makes us his people hallelujah is the holiness of god and and this way that we must be holy to be his people leviticus chapter 11. you want to look at verse 44 to 45. the father bibles this is a bible study you should have your bibles leviticus chapter 11 44 and 45. for i am the lord your god you shall therefore sanctify yourselves and he shall be holy for i am holy neither shall you defile yourselves with any man of creep and things that creepeth upon the earth for i am the lord that bringeth you out of the land of egypt to be your god ye shall therefore be holy for i am holy so i want to present holiness as a commander from god another suggestion not an option bring up buffet style you take what you want you take this blessing you take that and take whatever you want but this part you want nothing to do with it in other words let me live my life no you were bored you were bored you were bought with blood you were bought by the most precious thing and that is why there's a landing on the river for you that is why death had no power over the blood watchman you are bought with a price you are not your own he brought you out to the pawnshop out to the devil's country to serve him and to worship him hallelujah in the beauty of holiness thank you lord let's go to leviticus chapter 19 i think has been the book of life with us have it kind of sick and true and we go from chapter 3 chapter 19 verse 1 and leviticus chapter 19 verse 1 and 2 and afterwards we go to late videos chapter 20. chapter 90 verse 1 and the lord speak unto moses saying speak unto all the congregation of the church of israel and say unto them ye shall be holy for i am the lord your god i the lord your god i'm holy so this is what god tell moses see until then let's go to leviticus chapter 20 under verse 7 and then we go on to verse 26 leviticus chapter 20 verse 7 sanctify yourselves therefore and be holy for i am the lord your god and if you go down to 26 you will see this this is a powerful powerful verse verse 26 of leviticus 20. and ye shall be holy unto me this is god speaker for i the lord i'm holy and have severed you from other people that you should be mine my god you shall be holy unto me for i the lord i'm holy and i've severed you from other people that you should be mine so what will separate us from other people becoming holy unto the lord so holiness is a separation between the people of god and others so family a and family b could have a ton of money a ton of boats on a car's stone or whatever but what the separation between those two families going to be the holiness the consecration the devotion to god leviticus 10 going back there this is what god told the priests leviticus 10 want to read verse 8 11. and lord's faking the error and saying do not drink wine nor strong drink dull nor thy sons with thee when you go into the tabernacle of the congregation lisa die it shall be a statue forever throughout your generation that ye may put a difference between the holy and unholy between the unclean and the clean [Music] and that he may teach the children of israel all the statutes which the lord had spoken unto them by the hand of moses now we know clearly when the anointed strike we go to the book of revelation him that is filthy filthy still in that is righteous righteous still aim that is holy holy still in other words things are going to shape up to get people almost like a picture a snap in a set condition and whatever you are then it remains holy holy still righteous righteous still wicked wicked still evil evil still full of malice malice still unforgiven unforgiven still so this tonight is a serious thing and again this is not church-based okay first peter 2 9-11 remember what god said we just talked about him talking about i severed you from other people look how peter said here in first peter chapter 2 familiar scripture 9 11 but here chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people which is different strange unique different that you should show forth the praises of him who had called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in time passed were not a people but are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy daily beloved he is speaking to these same people now these are not unbelievers now i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lust with war against the soul let's look at the amplified but you are chosen race a royal priesthood a dedicated nation god's own purchased special people that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of him who call you out of darkness in this marvelous light once you were not a people at all but now you are godspeed once you were unpitied but now you are pity that have received mercy beloved i implore you as aliens and strangers and exiles in this world to abstain from sex sensual urges the evil desires the passions of the flesh your lower nature that wage war against the soul so paul peter was presenting these thoughts these words to the church because remember we have a lower nature that's the nature we are born with and also when i want you to write wrong and you know the battle within the flesh and the spirit and they that in the flesh cannot please god it is impossible so he said uh oh god that you walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so you have to want to walk after the spirit in order to do what please god they are in the flesh cannot please god so you have to say wait a minute you mean i have to have a desire to please god yes you have to start with a thought you have to start with a desire if you never know god was holy you will know it tonight by the scriptures by the word by what he's saying or what he's expecting of us oh blessed be in the name of the lord deuteronomy oh i'll read that one already we're going to read this one deuteronomy 26 verse 18 to 19. usually 26 18 to 19. and the lord had a vote d this day to be his peculiar people as he had promised thee that thou should just keep all his commandments and to make thee high above all nations which he had made in praise and in name and in honor and that thou mayest be and holy people unto the lord thy god ask yet so god's objective is to make you and i his people above all nations in praise in name in honor and that you may be holy people unto the lord as yet hope so god's holiness upon our life makes us above makes us where he could support us in a truest sense as his people are people called up are people separated are you separated are you called up do you see yourself called out to be separated unto god to serve him to serve him to love the lord thy god with all thy heart all i sow all thy strength do you see that tonight oh blessed be the name of the lord i'm in love with you again ii corinthians 7 verse 1. this is a scripture that means a lot to me it's a key scripture it's a anchor scripture and i want you to look at it really close it's a big one second corinthians chapter seven verse one have indeed for these promises daily beloved let us us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god i want to think about that a minute hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord let me read it again hallelujah praise the name of the lord have india for these promises daily beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness and the fear of god perfecting what holiness and the faith of god and having therefore these promises let us let us do something otherwise there is something for us to do but abraham said if you find yourself going wrong doing things wrong he said don't just do just continue like that you could fast you could pray you could ask other people to pray with you pray for you you could get done and seek god take a three day prayer and fast and say lord deliver me clench me i've been there for these precious promises let us cleanse ourselves he says make yourself a christian get tagged at your means the deceptiveness behind the pulpits today some people deceive thinking they are christian when they are not because they haven't made yourself a christian they set the face of the prophet today to tell people once you believe that's it that's a hitting when the bible teaches that the kingdom of god is preached and every man press into it present to what if there is nothing for us to press reach sit down relax eat drink and be merry for we die but if there's a kingdom and the prophet said this way he says we are striving to enter the kingdom of god before these horrible plagues strike the plagues are coming this corona virus is like a down payment where the installment is coming but you talk about adopted sons that are going to stop cancer stop diseases stop playing stop whatever is coming there has to be a display of god's sons it's not that if it's not a but it's not a maybe it has to happen because this is what the whole creation is grown in for this is what the whole christian is growing for to see these sons manifested now remember and adam also produced other sons just like adam but before he could produce sons in his image and likeness and reflecting intent called intent and purpose he fell so then it fell into sex and that is how we born in sin but we were supposed to be spoken with sons adam speak and the word spoke eve conceive producer next son just like adam so that's when jesus came his first message the very first teachings was you must be born again of the word i love the spirit to bring us right back into how you're supposed to be back the inanimate but because adam was a seed of the word jesus was the flesh of the word and we now have to be formed into that word image so in other words adam fell a spoken word son fell in a garden with no smoke no tampee with no booze with no drink but no white woman and son he fell a man that god said let there be fell that means you could fall fall fall flat so don't think you above falling that is why we have to walk in this way this way of holiness all right let's go for another one first thessalonians three and this is paul twisted verse 11 first thessalonians chapter 3 verse 11 and paul was praying and he says hey i believe it was paul yes now god himself our father no you just don't think we pray but god himself and our father and our lord jesus christ direct our way unto you and the lord make you to increase and above in love one towards another and towards all men even as we do towards you to the end objective that he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness before god even or far at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all his saints let's read it again mr t to the end he may establish your hearts on blameable in holiness before god even our father are the coming of our lord jesus christ with all his saints oh praise god this is about a brand now everybody can't be a preacher but you've got a voice and if you can't preach to people a sermon if you are preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach if you are not you are still a preacher but live the people a silver let your sermon be lived and it's the voice of god that will bring reproach to them who reject it they will say no one can put a finger on his whole life they are sweet living if there ever was a man of god it's that man a woman see leave your sermons don't try to preach them if you're not called to be a preacher you get all mixed up anyhow and messed up but you'll get the people tangled up and you won't know well you'll ruin them and yourself too just live yourself now the preacher is called to preach his and deliver too if you can't live it then stop preaching but you're supposed to live your sins all right there was voices oh how we need is jesseville thousands of live voices the thunder of god thundering out in sweetness and holiness and purity undefined lives walking around in the earth today without a blemish yes sir real christians that's the thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holla the devil don't care how much you can jump on what you can do this or shout but what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to god say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on that chosen away that's the thunder that shakes the devil almost done first thessalonians 5 this is the prayer verse 22 to 23 poor abstain from all appearance of evil all 23 and the very god of peace sanctify you holy and i pray god that your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless under the coming of our lord jesus christ so this holiness have an effect upon your spirit upon your body and upon your soul hebrews 12 14 it says follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the law blessed be the name of the lord and i believe it's about the final quote i have here the way of god is holiness this is the prophet this is to the message it says to you here believers the way of god is holiness let this be known to every member here of the body of christ until you live a holy life god refuses your sacrifice let me read it again the way of god is holiness let this be known to every member here of the body of christ until you live a holy life god refuses your sacrifice the sacrifice must be offered with holy hands the high priest before he could even come to offer the sacrifice he had to be holy and dedicated and anointed and perfumed and everything before he could even walk in the presence of god to offer sacrifice is that right then how can you go out here and cheat and steal and fuss and fight with your neighbors and everything else and carry on the way you do and then come say lord jesus or praise god hallelujah people say i see them speak in tongues that still don't mean that you've got the holy ghost i hear them shout that still don't mean the god of holy ghost the holy ghost is alive oh my this great purpose of the beauty of who it is the object the end of this what we are talking about tonight is to get us into the place where we can worship because that is what the exhortation worship the lord how in the beauty of holiness and then do they worship me why teaching for doctrine the commandments so i believe that the true word will bring true holiness the true word will bring true faith and that true faith will bring true worship it will bring the worship that jesus says woman the overcome and the father secretary you seek of them that worship the father in spirit and truth to worship god is not just a reason about talking about hallelujah and the heart not right and the mind right and the whole being not right no that's not what we're talking about he's talking about worship in the lord the beauty of holiness god wants us to be holy because he's holy i want you to seek the lord tonight to ask him to become a partaker of that holiness we find out we read in the scripture the chastening and testament trial is in order to effect and give us a taste that we can be a partaker of his home we can only understand his holiness as we get closer to him as we get into a relationship with him and we can see what he expects that's why you tell them those priests if you move that way you will die many men die of freedom and chance because they're not being what god said i wish i could have read more details and if you have time in exodus 28 of the garments and you take specific details and god actually put those there he said that garments of beauty and glory you know just as garments may look beautiful god want our inner garment that garment to be beautiful also and that beauty reflected in our consecration of a dedication of of a holiness to god at this time i want but anthony praise the lord to sing that song for me holiness holiness is what i long for praise the name of the lord [Music] amen praising the lord holiness holiness is what i long for holiness is what i [Music] need what you want from me so take my heart [Music] and take my wings [Music] oh righteousness righteousness righteousness is what i long for [Music] righteousness is what i need [Music] righteousness righteousness is what you want from me so take my heart and control it take my life and transform to yours [Music] take my life [Music] [Music] oh heavenly father this has been to me an amazing thing to look at the beauty of holiness to worship you but i may this not just be a psalm that was read tonight but made ring in every soul and heart those i would hear it afterwards the beauty of holiness something that you can't purchase in a grocery you can shop for it in a pharmacy you can't get it and dig in a ground and mine it and it has to come from you holiness belong to you and yet you declared i am the high and lofty one that dwells with him that have a humble heart and a contrite spirit jesus when you see an earth you give reference to a clear example of the pharisee saying i am not like that sinner i do this i do that i do the other the sinner man couldn't even come inside the temple he stood out there and said lord i'm not worthy lord help me i'm a sinful man jesus was able to say that man went away more justified you dwell in humility you live in humility and usually when people get blessed they get puffed up they get arrogant and looking back over the years i see people boast and proud and and make all kind of boasting and to see they get cut down they got vulnerable they get old and they pass away father help us may we all recognize that truly life is a stage and we are like actors we come to perform we come to act we come to run our course and after a while we have to walk out of the stage one by one but i help your people tonight bless your calebs here strengthen them encourage them may they have a desire to be drawn closer to you your holiness i trust law that that intellectuals wouldn't be troubled by intellectuals who say we're talking about sanctification talking about john wesley pastor asia's pastor stage all that kind of intellectual gymnastics no we are not about that lord we're about what you call us unto father for if a man like john who walked with jesus in the flesh who fellowship with jesus who jesus loved and he was on the isle of patmos when jesus appeared to him in that glorious condition he fell as one dead it's a different realm altogether oh god help us tonight help us tonight it's not proper dancing it's getting into divine presence where we recognize we are nothing recognize we are nobody father there is sick among us tonight heal them may a supernatural power be released here tonight not operated by me but your power released to bring healing to bring comfort to bring deliverance lord i want to remember lord brother nicholas and sister know me in a special way visit them and bless them and help them and pour your spirit upon them remember knight's family in a special week remember lord the nicolas family in a special way visit them minister them and help them bless the service tomorrow night god that will be played god bless the deacons the elders the trustees bless the church and we have a mighty outpouring of your spirit is coming sunday blessed special services coming friday we commit the people into your hands in jesus name we ask it amen amen god bless you church thanks again for being here we certainly appreciate are you spending this time you could have used your time elsewhere but you choose to hear us bring a bible study tonight and i trust this will still your heart to see not as man see but as god the comfort of him being a prophet but he went into the temple and he saw something that transformed his very life this is breaking the supernatural now this is not just you know i'm saying words and whatnot no this is an actual experience of fire tongue some of the earth the seraph the burners they are the angels that prepares the person that committed genuinely we should go and the real way to come to worship god not just spirit and truth but in the beauty of holiness god bless you have a great night
