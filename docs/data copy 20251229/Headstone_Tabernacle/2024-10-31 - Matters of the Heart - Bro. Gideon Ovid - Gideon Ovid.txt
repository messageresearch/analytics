thank you Jesus blessed be his wonderful name amen hallelujah you're glad to be here while you're standing I'd like you to turn with me to a familiar scripture reading from The Book of Malachi chapter 4 reading verse five and six amen and it says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord in verse six it says and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word may we just bow our heads oh Heavenly Father we are so grateful tonight for this opportunity Lord Lord we thank you for this time Lord we thank you for life health and strength and the ability to gather together in this way Lord Lord we pray that you will have your preeminence and your oversight and you would Lord be in this service Lord from from everything that is said Lord everything that is done Lord I pray that you have your perfect will manifested Lord Lord I pray that you'll speak lip to air to your people and take me out of the way Lord Lord I pray that you will put together these broken up words and thoughts and and and and weave them in the way you'd like them to to be delivered Lord Lord I pray if there's anybody sick in our midst Lord that they'll be healed tonight Lord that Hearts will be transformed that that that that people will be renewed Lord Lord that they'll be restored Lord and wherever people may be connected tonight Lord or even if they were to encounter this or see it afterwards I pray that your Holy Spirit would drop down wherever they are Lord that your presence will be with them Lord that your anointing will will overshadow them Lord Lord be May no one leave here the same way they came Lord Lord I pray that you have your perfect will in and through our lives and everything that is done Lord in Jesus name we pray amen you may have your seats blessed be his name wonderful amen what a mighty God we serve amen this evening just a a simple thought for a title the title is matters of the heart amen matters of the heart I know I know when you hear matters of the heart it sounds like a romance it sounds like a love story but that's what the Bible is a love story amen so tonight we're going to talk about matters of the heart because it's very very important and the scripture that we read we said that he sent Elijah in this hour in this time to turn our hearts back so it means our hearts weren't where they're supposed to be it weren't going in the direction that he expected that he would like us to be at so some intervention had to take place for it to be turned back amen so we just want for our context just to to to acknowledge the fact that God is concerned about the state of your heart amen he is very preoccupied with that he don't want you to to be dece same he don't want you to to live and act and operate the same way over and over year in year out day in day out it's the same all you know he have certain requirements he have certain things he want certain things he like and certain things he dislike amen so we want to examine and explore a couple of those things and and one of the things I want to start off with is the fact that your heart is really designed to be filled you shouldn't have an empty heart the objective is to fill it and to fill it with something that is substantial something that is sustainable right so you you're born with this hunger in your heart and you have to have a cry in your heart you have to have a hunger in your heart for it to be filled and he is here to fill it tonight amen in a message why in 1960 in paragraph 12 the prophet said and that's the reason today that people are dying in the church pews of sin is because they refuse to take the toxin that God has given for the remedy for the the the the the remedy sorry for the cures of heartaches of ills of sicknesses diseases of the heart soul and mind people just refuse to do it it's not easy you know but some people refuse to do it it doesn't change the fact that it is a requirement am amen they say oh that's a bunch of Holy Rollers that's a bunch of Pentecostals and they go ahead and try to hush that blessed thing that God give them did they ever think why does why does a man drink why does somebody drink these are not even my words these are Prophet words why does a man drink why does a man woman young girls go out and look at Migra and and in our context Carnival and get out of these Dives and things is because there's a place in their hearts that's thirsting for something that's hungering for something that desires something that wants more that wants to be filled amen God created them to thirst but he created them to thirst after him they try to hush that blessed holy thirst for the things of the world why you're perverting the very thing that God give the people to thirst for him you are trying to satisfy it with things of the world it will not work it will never work and then if the devil can't get you to do that he gets you to just put your name on a church book and call yourself a Christian he tries to satisfy it with that just just be a a good believer just be a good guy a good girl a good Christian that go to church on a Sunday and a Wednesday and a Friday you want to satisfied with that but there's no satisfaction until God himself comes into the heart to control and to satisfy the people and bless them and give them the things that he has created in their heart he wants to fill that space there's nothing else in the world that could fill that don't you ever forget that nothing you can try nothing you could explore nothing you could examine could fill that void that he has created in you to thirst for him amen so that's just for a context that we know that there's a hunger and a thirst there's a void to be filled and the devil's job is to distract us and fill it with other things but God prepared that to be fill by him to be fill by his love to be filled by his power and his presence he want to fill that with the Holy Ghost he want to fill you he want to satisfy you so you'll never thirst again amen so we know that God looks at your heart in in the book of Samuel you don't have to find it the Lord said unto Samuel this is 1st Samuel 16:7 it says but the Lord said said unto Samuel look not at his countenance and I'm sure you could recall we preach about this many many times and with his natural eyes he looked at the sons of of David he looked at Saul and he looked at different ones and with the natural eye he said unto Samuel look not at his countenance or on the height of his stature because I have refused him referring to Saul Saul was a decent guy you know Saul was from The Tribe of Benjamin Saul was all right Saul was the chosen man for the hour at that time but God found a better man and at that point he say listen I refuse all know I done with him I know you are looking at the fact that he's tall and he's stately and and he look like he has confidence and he could command attention and he has Charisma and class but I refuse that cuz I don't look at that he said for a man lookth on the on on the outward appearance but God look it on the heart so that's what we want to talk about tonight the heart matters pertaining to the heart matters of the heart things related to the heart and getting your heart filled and right with God amen amen amen now I I know I'm not going to stay very long but once we establish that I want to just highlight the fact that God wants to hide his word in your your heart am he wants that for you it's not going to drop down magically he wants you to keep it there he want you to hold it close he wants you to hold it near and dear to you in Psalm chapter 119:1 and you'll hear me quoting quite a bit from the Bible because I use this as a reference here to to highlight my point it said Thy word have i hidden my heart that I may not sin against thee right so that in in itself was an inoculation to sin when the devil tempted Jesus he said the word the word the word it was inside so it could come out because what's inside of you could come out of you and you'll see it in a little bit so it's important that you take that and take the word and hide it in your heart so nobody could pluck it away nobody could deceive you nobody could fool you because you have his word and you hold on to it amen now why are we worried and concerned cuz it sounds good you have a space in your heart a void that is to be filled by God what could go wrong you see Satan wants to fill that void and he is very successful in doing so at times but not with his bride we want to be aware of his devices so we wouldn't succumb to that amen so Satan could fill your heart in the book of Acts chapter 5 and verse one and we familiar with with these but a certain man named ananas with Safara his wife sold a possession and in verse two and kept back part of the price his wife also being privy to it and bought a certain part and laid it at the apostles feet in verse three but Peter said anas why has Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost so you allowed Satan to take that space you allow allowed Satan to be master of that that God created to be fill by him you allowed Satan to take over and cause you to lie to the Holy Ghost so this is not your will that you trying to outsmart everybody else you know but you allow Satan to fill that space and Peter called it out there he said listen why you allow that and to keep back parts of the price of the land while it remained was it not thine own we didn't beg you for it we didn't we didn't ask you for it we didn't solicit it you volunteered that wasn't that yours to give wasn't that yours to do what whatever you wanted to and after it was sold was it not thine own power you had the ability to do whatever you wanted with it because it was yours why hast thou con conceived this thing in thine heart so it was so important the Holy Ghost true Peter was showing us something here that it's so important that you Monitor and observe and maintain the position that you can't allow the devil to to take over in your heart because the result of that is judgment and death amen why hast thou conceived this thing in thy heart thou Hast not lied unto men but unto God now I want to shift gears a little bit you see there are some persons due to circumstance and due to to events around them they they tend to get cold they they Harden their heart in particular ways and they get upset and they don't want anybody talk to them and stuff like that but true scripture we will see and I will highlight it here you see anytime your heart starts to get hard is a sure sign that your judgment about to strike is a sure sign that you're about to fail is a sure sign that you're about to fall you see if your heart is being hardened your judgment and destru ruction is near so it's a sure sign if you realize listen are getting upset and and angered just by the sight of this one just by getting these feelings right of your heart being cold and hard and formal in the Book of Joshua chapter 11 and in verse 18 it says Joshua made War a long time with all those kings and just as a background in the background of that you'll remember when Joshua got his commission his objective was to challenge everybody and beat everything standing from children go up just blaze a trail every place you put your foot is yours just conquer just fight you listen this is the one man I know in Trinidad they're talking about anti-bullying campaign now Joshua could just go and challenge you and you sure you're defeated because he had god with him and he was commissioned to do so to take the land and the divide the inheritance unto the people of Israel amen so in Joshua 11:18 it say Joshua made War a long time with all those kings every King he met he made war with there was not a city that made peace with the children of of of Israel so he was I mean he was firing from from the hips he wasn't hesitating to go to war right they says save the hivites the inhabitants of gibon all other they took in battle for it was the Lord Lord listen the Lord to harden their hearts that they should come against Israel in battle so God was hardening their hearts and when they Harden their hearts they believ they could face Israel and when they face Israel listen what it says that he might destroy them utterly and that they might have no favor but that he might destroy them as the Lord commanded Moses so it wasn't them just sitting in a corner and their heart getting Harden you know God was hardening their hearts to come against Israel but God gave Israel the ability to blaze anything moving I mean I know it sounds a little unfair but I just thank God that I'm on The Winning Side so it doesn't matter the way it sounds it doesn't M matter the way you logically think about it sounds kind of unfair but here the thing and it's not once you do it I'll show you you do it over and over and over again so you see that person that hat you and they don't know why and their heart Harden against you and they they battling you listen something sometimes God had in their heart to challenge you know because he want the glory eventually he know he give you the ability before the foundation of the world to blaze them know he know the commission he give you he know listen you above and not beneath know you're the head and not the tail know he knows you're more than a conqueror and the battle is already won he knows that for you so listen want to shift to the Book of Exodus on the same point of him hardening Hearts Exodus 14:15 speaking about Moses mooses and it says and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore criest thou unto me if you could recall on the way out they were heading out of Egypt the the enemy behind him Pharaoh behind him and I don't have the time to go through it now but God told Moses before he went to Egypt here here what he said he said listen you will be the god Aaron will be your Prophet so is a Twan Army r with they're seeing two persons he said but in addition to that I'm going to harden Pharaoh's heart I'm going to harden his heart against anything you say against the people of is of Israel I could assure you I will make sure his heart is hardened why because I tell you this part I'm going to allow him to get blaze I go and defeat him I go slame utterly he will listen he will forget he will wish he had never had a bad thought about you right so and when you read the scripture you see it was repeated over and over so listen we talk about flies and frogs and and water turn to blood and stuff but before everything happened every single time he said listen I go hard in Pharaoh's heart so he wouldn't release them because I want to give him almost not not necessar excuse but I want to give him a a a a Vigor I want to give give him a passion to to go against so I will harden his heart knowing that you have the victory already now he tell Moses this before he gone know when he given him the commission Moses already know I mean human nature may have you thinking a little bit you know I wonder Bo is is that really the voice of God I heard because he tell me and a stutter at times and he really tell me that Aon would speak on my behalf and but you know what when you have your trust in God it doesn't matter how you feel about it it's going to come to pass regardless so in in the context of that in Exodus 14:15 the Lord said unto Moses wherefore criest thou unto me so they're halfway out they says speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward but lift up thy rod and stretch thy hand over the sea and divide it and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea in verse 17 it says and I behold I will harden the hearts of the EGP Egyptians so it wasn't Pharaoh anymore it was the Egyptians now so he wasn't just in the leadership you know he came among the masses among the people among the soldiers among the servants and the slaves he said I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians and they shall follow them so they shall follow the children of Israel and listen listen why I will get me honor upon pharaoh and upon all his hosts upon his chariots upon his Horsemen and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I have gotten me honor upon Pharaoh upon his chariots and upon his Horsemen the Egyptians will know I am the Lord so you could hold them in bondage in other words you tonight could be in bondage your children could be in bondage for the last 20 years it doesn't matter the enemy's Hearts can be hardened against you against your family against your loved ones it doesn't matter because at the appointed time when God decide times up he only set that up and Harden the heart for you to win the battle here know for him to get the glory you know he said listen I will get honor upon Pharaoh his chariots his Horsemen all the host it doesn't matter he is going to give you the victory Amen in a message the 7 the 70th week of Daniel paragraph 158 he says everything has fell right in their hand how did they do it because and he he went through history here he said Hitler's Hearts was hardened melini's heart was hardened so he is not now doing this you know this this is what you call hismo he does this all the time anytime he want to get major Glory he will harden the heart of the so-called enemy in this case to ensure that it's not by might it's not by power it's not by strength it's not because you have an army no it's because he could do it and just because he could do it he doing it he say he Harden melini's heart just like Pharaoh's heart was hardened and driving them back in that land and for 40 years they have been coming back into that land speaking of the Jews now they there they sat waiting the Gentile church is in the L leodan End of the leodan Age if the Jews are in the Homeland already and the Gentile apostasy has already taken place and if we have a president like we have we have a nation that's broken up like we have we have atomic bombs hanging in the hangers we have a church at lukewarm we have a church of people that draw theel together we have a Ministry that pattern the ministry of Jesus Christ for to catch a stone when it comes what's left to happen it might be at any minute there isn't nothing else left we're at the end time Oh Glory I don't know whether I'm going to be able to get into that Jubilee or not but I just want to to get part of it to you anyhow so it was so important to him that the prophet said listen everything is in place so know he had in the heart throughout history and he continues to do it now also you thought you had no trials going to come you thought it was going to be easy pickings from from now no he have to harden the heart of of of of of the oppressors to ensure he could get the glory amen [Applause] now there are times when we talking about this hard thing and I'm not a a medical doctor a cardiologist or anything but we talking about matters of the heart doubt could fill your heart is that right doubt could fill your heart instead of Faith instead of Love instead of hiding the word inside some people allow doubt to fill the heart now in St Mark 11:23 you know the scripture early I say unto you whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but Shall Believe on those things which he shall which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said so that speaks about Fai H if you want to be healed tonight and you harboring doubt in your heart where is the space for Faith to work you had to eliminate that you had to get rid of that so these are some of the things we can't allow to happen you can't have your heart getting hardened you can't have doubt in your heart amen you can't be be just going through and and Satan in your heart so you expressing all kind of foolishness but you need to have the word you need to have love you need to have faith there's also there's also the fact that your heart could condemn you yeah the same heart you know the Same Heart we're referring to could condemn you in 1 John chapter 3: 18 it says my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth you know some folks could put on a good show he's saying let's don't do that don't pretend to love love by deed love is an action word show love so you could feel it and you know it you do to ask how do I know you love me no because is an active action thing Amen in verse 19 it says and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him for if our heart condemn us God is is greater than our heart and knoweth all things beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have then have we confidence towards God and whatsoever we ask we shall receive of him because we keep his Commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight so essentially if your heart condemn you you're not free you're bound up so you can't ask liberally knowing with faith that is going to be done so you ask kind of tentatively apprehensively because you know chances are the way I living he not going to do it you know the way I operating he not going to do it the way I thinking he not going and respond I don't really pray so he must he don't even know who I am chances are with that kind of condemnation you go nowhere you know so we had to eliminate that too in a message per perfect Faith paragraph 67 Abraham said but as long as you're doing things that's wrong you can't have confidence towards God so you see you can you'll automatically know that you're wrong most folks you know when when you're wrong you know you know you're wrong before before anything else happen you know you're wrong he say you automatically put yourself back there as Sinner by knowing that you're wrong but when your heart don't condemn you you know you're you're a Believer and there's nothing between you and God you can ask God what you will and know it'll be given because it's the word that God's given to you just like it was to these disciples now the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are have faith in what the word says that you are and Jesus had faith in the word of God and said what he was he said it is written of me didn't David in Psalms and the prophets and all of them speak of him I'm the bread of life that comes from God out of Heaven amen amen I am that tree of life from the Garden of Eden I am all these things I am that that I am he knew with that perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon him he said now I in myself do nothing but it's my faith in God and God was in him the word made manifest and when the word of God comes in you and that's what we saying when the word of God comes in your heart it's made manifest for you are believer see the faith of God that moves in you is the believer that's why you want faith in your heart that's why you want the word in your heart that is why you want God to dwell in your heart so you could only reflect God you could only reflect Faith you could only reflect the word amen I want to quickly run through because I know time is is is is running away there's a scripture we we often read and and some times I think sometime we don't pay enough attention to it the Book of Luke chapter 6 verse 54 and I'll reference the theme in a second a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good The Treasure of his heart not the things he think about you know not his plans you know The Treasure of his heart speaking about what's inside it goes on to say and an evil man out of the evil Treasure of his heart bringing forth that which which is evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh so it's easy to tell what's on the inside you know because it's reflected it comes out automatically you could only hide for so long know but after a while I like to say it leaks out it does leak out at times so you protected and you pretend and you put on the good show but at times the real you does leak out and when it leak out that's what in your heart you know that is the real you that is you when nobody else around so out of the abundance of your heart the mouth speaks the mouth give utterance based on what you have on the inside so the prophet was sent and it says behold I will send you Elijah before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers least I come and smite the Earth with a curse so he was sent to ensure that he know God watching your heart God concerned and it it is very important to him so he want to ensure that he sent a prophet to lay his word down in such Simplicity that when you're done your heart right you that when you're done your mind right you know that when you're done you could forgive when you're done you could love when you're done you could drop your hearts because you want to be able to ask and know that it's it's done you want to ask and know that it will be given you want to ask by faith you don't want any hindrances you don't want Satan fill your heart you don't want your heart to be hardened no so he sent Malachi for to ensure that this could happen amen David in Book of Psalms chapter 5110 and we know it we sing it we say it he said create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right spirit in me it was that important he put it in song he wrote it down he he listen he meditate on this you know cuz you'll see it like a theme Time After Time After Time he talk about a broken heart a contrite heart a broken Spirit he wanted to be humble he wanted to be pure he wanted to be clean he wanted to be a particular way because he wanted to please God and God in turn say listen you see that fell there I know he he Frau with weaknesses you know I know he have challenges if you look for it oh gosh you wouldn't finish but that guy is a man after my own heart that guy is a guy that I am pleased with that guy is a guy I could endorse amen so it says cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit it goes on in that same chapter in verse 17 it says the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit and a contrite heart oh God that thou thou will not despise that's what he looking for my question is it written here in the scripture how do we apply this how do we take this seriously do you have a broken heart a broken Spirit a contrite heart are you humble are you forgiving are you Lov or are you sitting back and allowing the Devil to take residence in your heart are you allowing Satan to use you that heart was created for God to dwell in you despite what scientists say about pumping blood all over all over the place God have a special place that he want to dwell in your hearts you know don't get me wrong I'm not against the health but God more important than the health you know he could heal you he could deliver you he could seal you he could restore you he could baptize you he could bring you back the way it was before you know before anything else went wrong so this is what he asked for he said listen don't go trying to sacrifice the world don't go trying to burn everything down no he said but bring your heart for me let me check it out is it contrite is it humble are you trying to live out the the way that I want you to live in in Psalm 34:14 he goes on he say listen depart from Evil and do good seek peace and pursue it all these are instructions depart from Evil and do good seek peace and pursue it the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and the ears are open unto their cry the face of the Lord is against them that do evil to cut off the rembrance of them from the earth listen the righteous cry and the Lord heareth and deliver them out of the their troubles the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and save it such as be of a contrite spirit so I didn't read proud and hay and arrogant and rude here and disrespectful you know nowhere in this Psalm did I read any of those adjectives I didn't hear D David come and say well you know I'm King David say you know who you're talking to the Lord and I have a special Rel I didn't read that know he said listen the God will hear the righteous cry he hear it and deliver them out of their troubles are you troubled tonight are there things that you need help with is there a breakthrough you're looking for well the bible say that he will deliver you out of your trouble he say is n unto them that of a broken heart are you hungering and thirsting to be closer to God to commune with him to get more of him but if that is so and you have a a broken heart and a contrite spirit guess what he'll be drawn closer to you it goes on in the book of Chronicles 1 Chronicles 168 he said give thanks unto the Lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people so testify on me let people know how good he has been to you how good he has been to me how he brought you out give thanks have a Thanksgiving make sure people know listen it's not by might or power or strength is but by his spirit because of his grace because of his love towards you they say make known his deeds among the People Sing unto him sing Psalms unto him talk ye of all his wondrous Works glory in His holy name and and listen to the instruction now let the heart of them Rejoice that seek the Lord so you seek God yes you seek God you want God in your heart well rejoice he want the heart to Rejoice they say Seek the Lord and his strength seek his face continually day after day morning after morning night after night seek Him seek Him seek to be closer to him seek to be drawn to him they say let the heart of those that seek the Lord let let it Rejoice let it be glad as you testify about the goodness of God seek Him and rejoice and be glad listen over and over you would hear they say love the Lord thy God with all thy heart trust the Lord with all your heart not a kind of partial good morning Lord you know I acknowledge you now but for the rest of the month now it's mon so I than you a little bit I might get pay but come between the the second and the and the two 23rd or so is pressure out here know you don't know what these people these Egyptians on job doing no no he say listen continually worship Him Praise Him acknowledge that he has kept you thus far and he who has brought you to this point is more than able to deliver and see your through till the end and listen the things that you think are problems and troubles and challenges he going to show you that listen I just do that for my glory you know I just do that to to ensure that you understand and you remember that I am in control you know it's not by you you know it's nothing that you could do you are failure but because of who your father is you're going to be all right you'll get the victory so in the book of Deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 4 it says here oh Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might amen and these words which I listen which I command you here just speaking it because he feel listen to the command he said which I command thee this day these words shall be in your heart to love the Lord so in your in your heart make sure to have a space for loving God God want that he want you in your heart to love him he put a space there for that he say listen it shall be in thine heart hear what else he said and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sest in thy house and when thou west by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up now I don't know about you but if I translate this to our local Palance this is every day all time only talk about him thank him love him Express teach your children when when all you're talking is not old banal and what happened on Facebook yesterday and what happened on I don't know Instagram or or Tik Tok or wherever no the love of God listen teach them to love God with their heart with all their heart teach them he say I command you to hold this in your heart hold it close teach them diligently they say teach it diligently to your children so when they grow up they wouldn't forget it when they grow up they wouldn't depart from the lessons that you teach them it goes on in the Book of Proverbs chap chapter 3 speaking about trusting God they say my son forget not my law that sound just like the scripture before when you do it over and over it kind of hard to forget to know because it becomes part of you it becomes custom I remember one guy one time he told me you know what a customer is he say a customer is somebody who get a custom buying from you it becomes so routine they don't think of anything else you are top of mind so they so accustomed doing it they become your customer and they do it over and over so here the scripture saying listen I want you to get accustomed to doing this I want you to trust and love and speak and do this so many times that afterwards Hallelujah it feels like it's innate it feels like you're born with it it feels like that's part of you it can't separate it so when the scripture say what could separate me from the love of God nothing no fine War pestilence flood no no family drama nothing will separate you because this is part of me you feel the love of Jesus it's so wonderful it it just surround you that's what you have to give that's what will leak out that's what you will speak you will speak goodness and mercy and love and grace over people because that's what in your heart in Proverbs one he said my son forget not my law but let thine heart keep my Commandments not you know he said let your heart keep it let your heart keep it for length of days you see why not because I want you to learn 2 by two is four and four fours are 16 no he said there's a purpose for that for length of days and long life you want to live long keep that in your heart let your heart remember the Commandments he say and peace shall they add to thee so all this drama you're going through could be avoided by doing this yes hallelujah it's right here that's what it says in verse three he said let not mercy and Truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck write them upon the table of your heart put it there so shall thy found so so shall thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man so wait now you mean all this drama you going through on the job and in school and in in in the neighborhood and the community if you focus on this you will find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man yes that's what the word say in verse 5 here what it says trust in the Lord with all thy heart lean not onto thy own understanding listen in all thy ways we know the scripture acknowledge Him so thank him honor him acknowledge that he is the one responsible for your success he have you where you are tonight he brought you safely he kept you it may not seem perfect but it's his will for your life right now he have you where you are for a purpose acknowledge Him and He Shall direct your paths everywhere you have to go he will direct it he will guide you you don't have to figure it out he will show you where he wants you to go and where he want you to stay away from in verse 7 it says be not wise in thy own eyes fear the lord and depart from Evil amen isn't God wonderful still speaking about the heart to know these are matters of the heart if we could get these things right we'll be in order know we'll be all right you know if we could get these things right in the Book of Joel chapter 2 chapter 2 verse3 it says and Rend your heart let me say it slowly and Rend your heart and not your garments and turn unto the Lord your God for he is gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repented him of the evil and Rend in that context is to rip up tear up you know you say I I abhor myself listen I'm nothing I I am leas of the tribe and bottom of the barrel rip rip it up you know good he say Rend your heart don't don't rip up your clothes don't put on a show for people because you want them feel your real spiritual no you surrender your heart to God you surrender your life to God and see what he will do through you see what he'll do in your life you'll be shocked and we touched on this one before and it was highlighted in a couple places right where in the book of Acts chapter 13 it says and when he had removed him he raised up unto them David to be their King which is when they removed Saul to whom he also gave their testimony and said I have found David the son of Jesse a man after mine own heart which shall fulfill all my will you see part of his will is to fulfill all of his will right right and part of his will for you is to fill you with the Holy Ghost he want to give you a new heart he in the Book of Ezekiel chapter 36 and I'm winding down now 36: 26 he says a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit I will put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I'll give you a heart of Flesh so you remember earlier on when I said your heart hardened here he's saying listen sometimes it's a little Stony because you're not all right you know in your human senses have your ways but you say I want to take that out too you know I want to replace that with a new heart a heart of Flesh a heart that I could dwell in a heart that could really fully surrender to me so you could love me with all your heart cuz you say I will give you a new heart and I will put my spirit in there and I will take away the ston heart the old one you have you want to take that out and give your heart of Flesh in Proverbs 23 verse 7 and we know this one it says for as he thinketh in his heart so your your heart could think yes your heart could remember your heart could could could take notes your heart could believe and trust and love yes it can you say for as he thinket in his heart so is he eat and drink said he to thee but his heart is not with thee so once again say what they want at the end of the day what inside is what will come out as you think in your heart that is you and know it don't matter you could paint it up as as they say you could put a bow on a pig is still a pig on the inside is a pig so you might be in disguised tonight but the faith in you is the believer Amen in Proverbs 423 it says keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life so guide it take care of it monitor it watch it don't just leave it to do its own thing no you have a role to play you have a responsibility you have been guided instructed and commanded to do particular things and that's what he wants of you musician could get ready at this point at the end of the day he wants a pure heart he wants a clean heart he wants a heart that he could dwell in and a heart that he could fill in the Book of Psalms 24:3 it says who shall Ascend into the hill of the Lord or who shall stand in his holy place he that had Clean Hands and a pure heart who had not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully he shall receive the blessing from the Lord and righteousness from the god of his salvation in Matthew 5:8 it says blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God still speaking at the heart there are so many instructive lessons they say blessed are the pure in heart is your heart pure tonight if not you want it to be pure tonight he is the surgeon he is the cardiologist he could fix it he could mend it he could replace it he could twist it tilt it adjust it to suit him but you you have to be willing to let go you have to be willing to give up you can play create to me and clean heart at the end Christ wants to dwell in your heart in the book of Ephesians as we close chapter 3 it says that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the bread and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God Amen may may we stand at this time Saints he has given very very clear guidelines as to what he requires what he dislikes what he endorses it's up to us now there's nothing more he can do he has sent Malachi for to bring your hearts back to turn your hearts back to make it in a position that he could dwell all he wants to do is live in you you know all he wants is to be in the control tower to sit on the throne of your heart and have full surrender from you so he could do his will through you are you willing to surrender tonight let's sing that song renew right Spirit within me God bless you cast me not away cast me not away from thy presence oh Lord take not thy Holy Spirit from [Music] me restore unto me the joy of my salvation and renew a right Spirit within me with every hand raised let just sing it one more
