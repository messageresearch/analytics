way and may you speak lip to ear to your children may you use me as a microphone that you could speak directly what you want them to hear this morning father in a special way we want to pray for the fathers that are here in the tabernacle those that are connected on the internet on this father's day that the great father lord would inspire them to be better fathers to be better men to be better sons may you bless the church this morning will you bless the reading of the word and the opening of our understanding to your scriptures we turn this service over to you in the precious name of jesus christ and the church says amen amen amen amen amen so i greet you this morning in the precious name of jesus christ and just to get straight to the word i'd like to read uh four portions of scripture genesis 1 genesis 2 matthew 11 and hebrews 4. looking for a wonderful time in the lord this morning there's no better place to be than in the house of the lord on a sunday morning is that how you feel wonderful so genesis 1 and reading from verse 26 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply now i want us to recognize that this conversation between god and man in genesis 1 is god speaking to spirit man this is not man with flesh because that man can be found in genesis 2. so god is having a conversation with the spirit man and he's telling the spirit man that you are blessed because the bible said god bless them and god said unto them be fruitful so that spirit man was supposed to be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea that instruction came without even the flesh being around so we're not here to speak to the flesh man this morning we are speaking to the spirit man hallelujah made in the image and likeness of god and that man was to have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that move it upon the earth and god said behold i give have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree and which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat and to every beast of the earth and every fowl of the air and everything that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life i have given every green herb for meat and it was so and god saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day continuing into into chapter two genesis 2 thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the hosts of them and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made let's go to matthew 11 and reading from verse 28 matthew 11 verse 28 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light and our last scripture reading hebrews 4 and verse 11 let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord this morning blessed be the name of the lord oh it is good to be here this morning i do have a title this morning let us and let us labor to enter into that great rest let us labor to enter into that great rest and so i want to greet the church i want to wish a happy father's day to all of the fathers about here near far and wide it's such a blessed privilege to find fathers at such a time as this not men who have children but fathers there's a difference between having a child and being a father a father speaks of a certain level of responsibility a certain kind of an understanding a certain kind of leadership a certain kind of behavior and an attribute and we know that when we look at history and we look at the word and we look at how eternity and time were connected the fact that god existed by himself and there were certain attributes that he wanted to express and when he existed alone he could not have expressed these attributes and we read there in genesis genesis 1 genesis 2 and genesis 3 as you go then genesis chapter 1 and see the first day and the second day and the third day when god created the animals and he separated the the firmament and all these things he could not have expressed his attribute of being a father until a son was there can the church say amen only when a son was there he could claim being a father and we know that when we look at the attributes of god only when somebody is sick he could claim to be a healer only when somebody needs a breakthrough he could be a deliverer only when somebody needs a to be pulled out of a hole he could be that mighty hand that pulls you out can the church say man [Applause] so we want to speak a little bit and it's so interesting today's father's day it's also labor day and because of labor day we have a holiday tomorrow so it's interesting that because of a day that speaks the labor we get to rest tomorrow so i was looking at these words about labor and rest and the connection between labor and rest and labor and work and reward and rest a lot of people who like reward without labor a lot of people who like results and they like the blessings but they don't want to put in the work they don't want to put in the effort they like to put in the rest but they don't want to put in what is required for rest and this word rest is an interesting word and we're going to look at it because there's rest and then there's his rest there's rest and there's god's rest can the church say amen and we live in a time when we have a lot of restlessness people are restless and i want us to firstly separate the word rest from sleep because it's two different words there are people who sleep and they don't get rest because rest does not mean sleep we sometimes mix up these words and we put it together and we use them easily and patch them together but there's a difference between sleep and rest the word rest is a word that speaks to peace when you're at rest there's no movement when you're at rest you are unbothered when you are at rest you're not you're not concerned about certain things i want to remind us that we live in a world where people struggle to sleep and because they can't sleep they get no rest charles spurgeon a great preacher many years ago he said rest a dainty word indeed too rich a syllable because it's one syllable for this unstable it it is not a stray word he said rest is it obtainable is it possible can there ever be rest for a race who were driven out of paradise rest is it possible for a soul polluted with sin tossed to and fro with inward lust because rest again is not sleep it means peace with god rest means freedom from a servile bondage world free to worship free to praise there are people who don't understand this rest that we're speaking about because rest means deliverance rest means freedom and it's interesting to separate that sleep from rest because when we look there in the garden of eden are you with me this morning i'm laying a foundation because we want to go somewhere the bible said that god on the first day he created on the second day he created on the third day we know this and i read specifically on the sixth day and god said let us make man in our image and in our likeness on this particular day day six there was a certain level of care that had to be exercised because it wasn't making an animal god had to look at himself and fashion he had to look at himself and put it together because he said let us make man in our image and our likeness he couldn't just see that's an animal there and that's an animal there this was different he was taking time to perfect this creation because it had to look like him operate like him live like him anybody with me this morning and after he was finished with the clarence for the first time we find that word there in genesis god was able to rest a god that cannot sleep rested a god that cannot get tired rested isaiah 40 28 says hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainted not neither is weary there is no searching for his understanding a god who cannot get wary took a rest what kind of rest is this that someone who cannot sleep can be in rest can be in peace can be unmoved by what's going on because everything is in order can the church say man we are reframing this morning the concept of rest for god rest was not a necessity it was a choice rest was a decision rest was a reward at the end of the successful completion of a specific set of actions he didn't rest after the first day he didn't rest after the second day he didn't rest after the third day he didn't rest after the fourth day he didn't rest after the fifth day but it was after the sixth day was finished when the mission for which he was building was accomplished rest was now possible because everything was in order rest was possible because nothing else was required hallelujah god was able to rest because a father had produced a son anybody with me this morning on this father's day god was able to rest because the father could see there's my son a son just like him produced the rest of god a son in his image produced the rest of god can the church say amen day one day two day three day four day five of creation they were physical corporal manifestation that were visible these manifestations could not produce the rest of god but a son in his image and his likeness produced the rest of god because rest represented the finishing of a work rest represented a reward god could rest because a son is in position i wonder what would happen when more sons come into position i wonder what will happen when sons take their place one more time because god knows that there are workers who could handle the work the work in the first day and the second day he had to do it but when man was there god said i could rest now or because my son can continue to work and the church say man i could take a rest now because i have empowered somebody i said to that son you're gonna have dominion over the fish over the trees over your circumstances over your situation and because i've given you that power and because you are in order and because everything is in place i could rest because this jurisdiction belongs to my son and as a proud father i could rest when my son is in position oh how god loves to rest when he sees his sons in position [Applause] and adam lived in the rest of god the safety of god the peace of god the comfort of god a rest there was no worry there was no stress he was in the rest of god when you are in that rest and remember the letters labor to enter into that great rest because when you're in that rest you don't have no sorrows you don't have no stresses you have things to do but you're at rest your soul is at rest your mind is at rest your money and your bank account in trouble but you are at rest oh to find that rest this morning is there anybody looking for rest tired sleeping but you don't have rest this morning there's a rest he said come unto me all the labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest rest from your trouble rest from your ups and down rest from your worries and the cares of the world come unto me all everybody everybody who laboring heavy laden have all kind of burdens and i will give you rest [Applause] adam walked in the garden living in the rest of god rest doesn't mean you're not working you know it just means the state of your working adam worked in the garden living in the rest of god i want us to add to this the devil was in the garden but he was powerless because adam was at rest the devil walking around but he's powerless because adam is at rest god put me into that rest where the devil can't move nothing could move you i might rest nothing could shake my feet nothing could shake my work nothing could shake my talk i'm at rest i'm at perfect peace i'm at peace in my heart peace in my soul the storm might be raging the devil could be walking around but i might rest up nothing can move me my ankle is holding in spite of the storm because i'm at rest and that's how adam was walking the garden he was naming the animals the devil is mad he's watching but he can do nothing because adam is at rest he's living in the rest of god lord take me into that rest but come this morning all ye who are laboring and heavy laden and i can give you that same rest that rest that adam had he was born into that rest and you have to be born into this rest [Applause] [Music] when you're at rest there's no worry in the world that what the government is doing don't bother you because you're at rest what the doctor says can't move you because you are the rest god give me the rest to raise above the doctor's report give me rest to raise up of my work situation give me rest to live above my family situation the rest of god [Applause] rest when an object is at rest there's no no movement the wind could blow but it's at rest the storm could come but it's at rest i think back to when jesus was on the earth and he was so tired he rested on the boat oh god he was resting but his rest was interrupted by a storm that came and i loved the context of this statement because jesus by the eclipse could have spoken to the storm but he did not dress the storm he said peace come back to rest peace be still because if you have peace in your heart and that peace is a stillness it's a rest it's a place it don't matter what the storm is doing when peace is in order the storms could swirl but there's a stillness in your heart because you're in the rest of god i'm not talking about resting in the safety of your job resting in the safety of your work or your church or the safety of the pastor we're talking about the rest of god come holy you labor and i have you laden i will give you rest this kind of rest is you meet some people who say they're tired and it's not and it's not that they're sleepy they just really want rest they slept eight hours and i wake up in the morning still feeling tired it is not a physical tiredness they're talking about it's a tiredness of soul that only could be cured or remedied or the prescription that is really needed is the rest of god [Applause] because five minutes in his presence will give you more rest than eight hours of sleep at night or you don't hear me this morning or you don't hear me this morning five minutes in his presence is worth more than eight hours of us sleep medicine because he is our rest oh god i want to find that rest i've been laboring i'm heavy laden but i need to get some rest choices decisions situations issues conflict turmoil they all wear me down i slept but i'm tired i sleep but i still at night i trying to sleep but i can't find rest but this morning lord take me to a place where i could find rest when adam fell in sin he fell from the rest of god bear in mind he was working in the garden but he was in the rest of god it was because of the fall by the anthony that god said to adam now you're going to move from work to labor and by the sweat of your brow because work and worship is the same word the root word of work and worship is the same but it's the difficulty of work and labor work is purpose adam was commanded to be fruitful multiply subdue replenish these were his work that was his work when you find your work your purpose your calling you're at peace you're at rest but you see labor and and not only was adam told by your sweat it's what you will eat but now eve was told that listen in childbirth i'm now going to introduce labor labor did not exist before the fall only worked it so because adam fell from the rest of god work became labor what was purpose divine and destined and purpose-driven adam was working in the garden he had power to do certain things it was never something that got him tired it wasn't something that got him sick it was something wary he was just like god who could not get wary but all of a sudden the fall brought labor pain sweat turmoil effort struggle a fight and we were removed from that state of spiritual work which was a combination of worship and work that was directed by a job description that god provided oh you don't hear me are you with me anybody with me you realize that adam was given a job description to worship the fellowship to subdue to replenish to have dominion that was a job description his job description wasn't paying pills and collecting checks and that wasn't his job description but because he fell from his place his job description was rewritten tone of labor and one of sweat and one of effort and one of turmoil and from that time till this time that labor has been in effect so that's what jesus met when he said come all ye who labor weary tired trying to make ends meet trying to do the best you could trying to struggle before i came there wasn't really a solution for this thing but now that i'm here come all you who labor because this labor started with adam but now a new adam was in the urge to address the issue of labor that was established here in genesis or you don't hear me this morning so now the plus i sh now jesus could say come all you labor are taking away your old job description and i want to give you the job description adam had hallelujah that was worship and spiritual work oh you don't hear me this morning where adam was at peace i want to bring you back to the rest that adam lost [Music] anybody this morning no you see why your struggle and your pain and your labor going through this labor and the labors you go through there's only so much god could even do while he in the labor that's why he said come come come all you labor come come come come closer don't stay that far away come come all of you who labor and are heavy laden if there's a burden if there's no burden then this is not for you but if there's a burden a burden for your children a burden for your home a burden for your soul a burden like those who sigh and cry now for the abomination in the city those who are troubled by the agenda of the enemy that has slipped into our homes for the fathers who are trying to be watched towers over the altar of their homes there's a burden to restore the prayer ultra burden to sigh and cry a burden to see families and order a burden to make a church that would make a revival a burden on all of you who have that burden come unto me and let me show you the rest is this helping anybody this morning [Music] [Applause] in a message fellowship in 1956 branham said here a few nights ago i woke up and i had a sermon on my heart of resting so the prophet is stirred in the middle of his night and his sleep is interrupted with a thought of rest he said i didn't have no audience so i had a one-woman audience my wife i woke her up he interrupted her sleep to tell her about rest i said honey i just got to preach to you a minute i did about three hours he said oh resting in the message the interval so this is a wrong the same period in fact this is just a few days or so around the same period of time but the brandon is going through a period looking at this thing about rest he said now that is what i find around most christian lives most i hate to say it that way but it's true most people that can profess christianity they seem to have such a hard struggle in time to hold on i believe it's because of a lack of correct teaching of the bible there's no such thing as holding on he done the holding on the whole christian principle is based upon rest and but the random quotes the scripture come unto me all you that labor and heavy lady i will give you rest where you don't have to worry and struggle you're just resting that's all given rest you enter in peace peace that the whole thing's finished peace that you're gonna make it peace that you're gonna be healed peace that he is jehovah jireh peace that he is your provider peace that all things will work together for good to them that love god and them do what they call according to his purpose peace that he is still a healer peace that he will open doors that you can figure out how to open you are resting on that you are resting on that piece that he is the prince of peace you are resting on the promises of god and the devil can move you you are at rest the devil brings a mind battle but you at rest i hope this stabilizes the rudders of your ship this morning you parents who worrying about your children what are you going to do could you fix it those hard bacteria you could fix it you knew who how you were anybody gonna fix you if it wasn't for god backing you up against a wall curing you in a better sickness closing down a door somewhere driving you to a church service he didn't want to go to anybody with me this morning if you could only get to that place of rest to know that the promise is unto you and to your children you can't make the promise of them but god already made a promise to your children i pray you could rest on that tonight can we rest on that promise that your children will be restored is there anybody this morning want to rest with me on the promise that your family has got to be delivered and it will not be you doing the delivering but you could rest confident on the fact that the one who wrote the word is still more than able to bring the word to pass can you rest on the promise that though the skin worms destroyed his body yet in my flesh you're gonna see god i'm resting on that this morning friends it's not easy to trust you know it's not easy to trust it takes a lot of restraint when you want to get involved in something to try to fix it but i want you to take this note this morning you can fix anything the fixer is god and if you could just rest on that and put trust in that and put confidence in that and you could just you heard what i read the whole christian principle is based upon rest by rest i don't mean you're not praying or you're not know you're not worshipping them but you're at rest in god but you're worshiping lord i'm trusting you lord i thank you lord i'm holding on i'm resting on your promise my child in trouble but i'm resting on your word the doctor's report is a negative report but i'm not going to study that report i'm not going to pick it up every day to reinterpret the analysis of the data i am going to trust you i'm going to put the report aside and i'm going to rest and i am the god and healed thee i'm going to rest and by your stripes i am healed i'm going to rest on you said if i acknowledge you in all my ways you will direct my path there are some decisions i need to make but i want to rest that you will direct my steps you'll put the right words in my mouth you'll help me to break past my own limitations is there anybody in the house can we give the lord a shout out praise this morning [Applause] [Music] in the message fellowship adam says the whole christian experience is based solemnly and holy upon rest he said we are tossed about with everything until you come to christ then it's all finished resting in christ perfectly friends i was saying to my wife i say getting all this something else i see brother clarence laughing clarence say what brother is that talking about this young boy but getting all makes you reflect and think who is certainly not how he was when he was 15 or 25 or 25 and as you get older you started because a real question am i ready if the lord were to call me home this evening am i ready what are you resting on that could allow you to sit back on a chair and say i'm resting on this solid place i've met people who said i'm i'm ready to go not because they want to leave here to know but their soul is at rest soul is at rest trust me the sleep you get at night when your soul is at rest is a different kind of sleep when your soul is at rest not your mind at rest people's mind racing but when your soul is at rest it's a comfort you begin to look through people you begin to re-evaluate relationships and conversations and situations and challenges because everybody going through something but it's a difference when you're going through something and your soul is at rest trials will always be there situations will always be there but god let my soul be addressed i'm back to the court but i'm saying resting in christ perfectly no matter what comes or goes that's a place to be friends you're not tired of one day you're up one day you're doing it you're just agitated you struggle you you press your way you'll fight you here one month you're good next minute you just dare you go through a boat a depression go through all kind of agony and you're like oh god can i just find some stability in you that no matter what comes the children come and say something you job was obviously at rest because no matter what it brought to him he wasn't moved through his whole trial people talking to him and somehow you couldn't get job to bend even when his wife come and say why you don't curse god and die he's he said you speak like a foolish woman then his ash he be even break because there was a rest in his soul i want to be like that is there anybody here wants to be like that you get bad news from your business here the band give you a piece of news and listen listen i've been through days where news knock you off your feet it take hours to recovery sometimes a phone ring and you hang up and your wife say isaac what happened don't worry about it see i know something happened what is it because your whole continents change your whole mood change you was eating food and all of a sudden you lost your appetite the food was a singer but that piece of news yes your whole appetite you're looking at the food but the tea is gone you have no tears two minutes ago it was good enough but a piece of news come and interrupt your life but if your soul is at rest and as you saw it you could you could keep eating the food keep the taste and your confidence is like water and duck back oh you could hear that in your you're still focused because i'm at rest if this happened this way it's because god allow it to happen this way if this interruption if this thing went wrong if this happened this way it's either we trust in god or we are trusting god but if we trust god and all things work together for good and we are resting on that then how things could throw you off friends are preaching to myself you know i'm preaching to all of us you go through some stuff and you see how you have to grow up at a time when branham went through his trials he wasn't seeing it for what it was it was when he when he was stable more stable and god beat him out and say listen you have to be more sincere he could look back and say he was just testing me but those tests and those experiences to sharpen and hone his character so he can handle the situations of life i trust this is helping somebody this morning no matter what comes or goes nothing can touch us with out it comes over the shepherd let's hold it but abandon this positioning he has to permit it the bible says all things work together for good to them that love god you have to remind yourself of that to know when things go wrong whenever things go wrong say all things work together for good i'm not seeing it right now lord you know i'm not seeing it but i trust him because you said all things were together [Applause] whatever the situation is that is resting on it and friends it's not going to be easy to do it you know but if you practice it and practice it and every day you drill it all things work together for good nothing can happen at god or allah it's either go to control or you're not in control if he in control then nothing could come to your house or your door to your situation that god didn't allow to come for your perfection for your benefit for your maturity [Applause] no matter how unpleasant it is because if every experience we have is pleasant you're not going to grow from it it is true unpleasantness we grow that's what forces us is out of our comfort zone that chicken has to break out of its comfort zone to break out the shell and if you don't break out the shell it will die but it is uncomfortable so god will make things uncomfortable for us for us to re-evaluate and go back to basics for us to go back to the genesis to go back to the foundation take it back to abc's after all yeah leave all the mysteries and stuff in a recognition i know all these missions but this depression thing and this frustration thing and this temper and this anger and this envy and this lust and it's whatever it is god wants to take that out of you take the lord on me can the church say amen and that friends is our labor because we are laboring through these trials truly said to enter into his rest because that is not what paul brings out in the book of hebrews can the church say amen you maybe see this there's a few more things to encourage us i just want to finish this quote he has to permit it the bible said all things work together for good to do not love god has to come over shepherd first said i am the door no man can come in without me you see how powerful that is let me tell you when god permits anything i'm reading it's working to your good so just to nail down this thing about rest and it's not sleep on these things we know the story of root i want to do a bible study in it soon but ruth chapter 3 verse 1 then naomi her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall i not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee what rest was naomi looking for it wasn't sleep she was trying to get rude to sleep she wanted the rest or the peace shall i not seek peace for thee rest for the comfort safety for thee that it may be well with thee in a message fate but i said i was preaching to her but about him a couple times this thing about rest for quite some time he keep talking about i wake up my wife to tell her what is resting and he said i was preaching to her on the christian's rest when you've come to christ everything's settled come unto me all you that labor and i heavily now give you rest it's settled it's all over christ has done paid the price everything you have to do is just rest let down quit jumping around getting all this to place the police and denominations packing a letter from the methodist city baptist that's john barron from doctrine young church church you think one minute you think put it in heaven once and leave it there don't be so let god just come to my rest if he's jehovah jireh rest on it if he's jehovah rapha rest on it if he's the law that saves us by grace rest on it if he's the lord who heals us by grace rest on it if he's a god that's coming from heaven with ten thousand of his sins rest on it if the dead in christ shall rise first rest on it everything rest oh my he said i feel pretty religious right now or resting not jumping about from pillar to post and carried about with every wind of doctrine but resting on what god said every promise in the book is yours i'm going on every amen and year is yours what you've got to be worried about may after this disservice you have no worries anymore even all age it shouldn't have a thing to do with it so but i say don't even worry about all age sickness has nothing to do with it god promised and god has to keep his promise [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my my man come unto me matthew 11 we read the scripture come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden you have a burden and i will give you rest and jesus goes on in verse 29 take my yoke upon you and learn of me that's why we come to service that's why we have bible study that's why we fellas are going to learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy my burden is light i want to go through hebrews 4. you could get it on on scripture we read the end part pretty much of it but i want to kind of build just some context out of this hebrews 4 if you would work with me here from verse 1. and bear in mind this is paul writing maybe brother nicholas you could get it up on the screen this is paul right and it's not a letter to the colossians or to the galatians or to the romans this is a letter to the hebrews so he's speaking to people who understand the law he's speaking to people who know history he's speaking the people who would have studied the books anybody with me this morning he said let us there for fear so he's bringing a solemnness in this letter here lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should come short of it so paul let me just fix this here quickly let us therefore feel as a promise being left us of entering into address any of you should seem to come short of it that's a serious scripture in other words he said there's a seriousness to this thing for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them so you see the preaching of the gospel that came to us was also preaching was done to them and he's speaking about the children of israel but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with feet in them that heard it so the gospel was preached to the children of israel and because they didn't mix it with feet because you didn't take action because they were not positive about it it had no benefit to them you see how people come to church and you would preach and there's no benefit because you're not mixing it with faith and fear comes by hearing and hearing the word of god so there's supposed to be a mixing of feet and a taking of the word by saying here and amen to the word and an action to the word of god and faith without works is dead and faith in the word means you take action by not worrying by not complaining by not because that is always how to mix it you're mixing faith with the word so you're saying for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but you would preach it not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it for we which have believed do enter into rest so the first step of entering into that rest starts with belief as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest all of the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spake and so paul is tying up all the loose ends of this thing for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise this is back in genesis now and god did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place and as brother brown said that was just a type of the rest because i said what is this but he said one when it's sunday in this part of the world is sunday somewhere else it's saturday the times when he said that which just a type of this great rest this place of rest for the believer he said if they shall enter into my rest seeing therefore in verse six it remain it that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief so he first said they didn't mix it with faith now he's saying because they didn't believe it is why they didn't enter in again he limited a certainty saying in david today after so long a time as it is said today if you will hear his voice harden not your hearts and paul is now bringing jesus into it now he said for if jesus had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day so paul is saying listen this thing is not finished yet he said now in verse 9 there remained there for arrest to the people of god there's still this resting that the people of god have to enter in jesus called him to it he introduced it he said i will give you this rest but paul is saying they remained therefore arrested the people of god for he that has entered into his rest he also had ceased from his own works as god did from his let us labor therefore so this scripture we read verse 11 was based on the background because he used the word therefore so based on the arguments that i've laid out before let us therefore let us labor therefore to enter that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief so this was a warning scripture church a scripture of warning starts over saying letters there for fear he's warning the church that this labor is actually what is is a labor true unbelief you know is a labor to not be like those who went before it's a labor past your own limitations he said let us labor so we don't end up in a situation that they end up in before anybody with me and to you the way to do it is to mix this word with faith every single day you're pleading the promise you're claiming the promise you're living the promise you're shaking yourself it's a sacrifice a sacrifice of praise a sacrifice of worship it's an attitude it's you taking your thoughts and putting it under subjection can we go on a little further hebrews chapter four listen now to brother brown i'm beginning to tie it together now so if you have never received the holy ghost yet you have never entered into god's rest say it one more time if you've never received the holy ghost yet you have never entered into god's rest you don't have to say oh i wouldn't i want to smoke i just couldn't i'm a christian i really don't want to drink but i'm a christian i just can't don't want it but i like it he said if you lust after a woman if you do all these ungodly things you have never hit that rest period yet you have never entered into your rest and when you enter into this rest you cease from your own worldly works like god did from his why you're part of god you rest eternally there you are that's the sabbath come unto me all ye that labor can the church say amen so now we begin to tie it together now this rest is this holy ghost thing you know have you received the holy ghost since you believe have you received the holy ghost since any message have you received the holy ghost since you come into church have you received the holy ghost since you know all these mysteries have you seen have you seen you read all these books and these tapes is the holy ghost inside of you because a promise is still a new heart a new spirit his spirit takes you into that rest that's the rest we preaching about let us labor to enter into that great rest oh hallelujah can the church say man somebody gave god worship somebody shake us up this morning can we labor can we switch laboring for for the job and slavery for home and home life and labor in a spiritual realm because a kingdom suffered violence and a violent take it by force can we labor to make a church that will be a revival can we labor to have some old-fashioned prayer meetings can we labor and hold on to the horns of the altar for the sick in our midst for those who are barely holding on can we labor away from selfishness if you don't want to press for you press for somebody else no if you don't want it catch a burden with somebody else can the church say amen amber branham goes on in the messaging unfeeling realities of the living god this is about three years or so later from hebrews chapter four he is horn again he said the bible said with stammering lips and other tongues will i speak to this people and this is the rest of the soul he's saying with the holy ghost experience a holy ghost fire burning inside your soul is the true rest of your soul it would no longer be your effort to work to be a son and you're trying to overcome and you're trying to live a holy life but you can rest up because the holy ghost is on the throne of your heart you don't have to think don't thought of what you're saying because the holy ghost speaking for you the holy ghost leading you the holy ghost guiding you come on church rest for your soul he said this is the thing that will come hallelujah somebody give god praise somebody get excited anybody want to to enter into this thing they were there in the upper room they were in one mind and one accord they were praising and their praise was labor oh hallelujah they were worshiping and their worship was like a labor they were there saying lord send the fire lord send the power lord we need more we need more than last week we need more than yesterday somebody praying lord come by here they were not spectators they were laboring because they wanted something they wanted a revival they wanted an experience they wanted a transformation so they started the labor they were digging a valley full of ditches oh somebody helped me preach this morning they were making preparation because they knew something was promised and it wouldn't just happen like that so they got into an atmosphere they began to labor they began to press they began to push that woman with the issue of blood she had the labor to push past this one to push past that one and when she met jesus and touched the helm of his garment she felt what rest felt like for a long time blood was leaking out but she met rest after she labored oh god i want to label this morning i'm tired of laboring for the world i'm laboring for my job i'm laboring for the mortgage but this morning i want the labor to enter into that great rest where there's no sorrow where there's no sickness where there's no depression where there's no sin where there's no debt where there's no unbelief where there's no black biting lord help us as a church of labor to make a church that will make a revival help us to labor [Applause] oh come on now come on now the harvest is plentiful but

write unto you fathers take your place come on soldiers of the cross take your place up let us labor together to win this race like paul he labored he didn't afford the fight i kept on fighting he said i finished my course i stood the test of time and now i'm finished oh come on now that has to be your testimony labor to enter into that great rest we can't stop short of it we can't almost make it we can't almost overcome [Applause] harvest is plentiful but the laborers oh god give us some labor us give us some deacons who believe us give us some ushers who will believe us give us elders who will belabor us give us ministers who will be laborers give us fathers who will belabor us give us mothers who will believe us give us young people who will labor labor in this vineyard labor in this evil world where the world wants to pull all your time but we got to take time to labor for what's eternal labor for this great rest what good is it when you know the things in the world can't give you rest every day is a different problem every day is a different news report that will always interrupt you but this rest i'll be talking about is a permanent place it's a permanent state it's a permanent atmosphere it's a state of being that'll take you from this natural world into a supernatural world will take you from time into eternity you are over there what you are here you need to
