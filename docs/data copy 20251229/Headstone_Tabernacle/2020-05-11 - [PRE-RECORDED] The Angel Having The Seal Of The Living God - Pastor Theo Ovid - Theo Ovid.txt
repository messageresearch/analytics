really really something so this morning I have a what should I see booting up on my heart message a special message to you this morning so we want to get into the word you ready for the word this morning okay ezekiel chapter 9 revelations up to 7 we want to go to those two scriptures this morning Ezekiel 9 Revelation chapter 7 thank you musicians he kept chapter nine reading from verse one to six revelation 7 read verse one to four we didn't Ezekiel chapter 9 verse 1 he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice sin caused him to have charge over the city to join near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which led towards the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen with a writer's inkhorn by his side and they went in and stood beside the brazen altar and the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had a writer's inkhorn by his side and the Lord said unto him go to the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof and the others he said in my hearing go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spear neither have EPT slay utterly all and young what maids little children and woman but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the house Revelation chapter 7 when I read from verse 1 and after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the scene on any tree I saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the Living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth needless sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads and I heard the number of them which were sealed and they were sealed a hundred and forty-four thousand of all the tribes of the Chilam Balam may God bless his word you may be seated oh praise the name of the Lord oh thank you lord well have a title this morning and the title is the angel having the seal of the Living God that's a title of a subject the seal of God and an inspiration crying and sighin that's why inspiration crying and sigh now we know 1933 God gave the Prophet seven visions which he says must come to pass before the coming of the Lord and the fifth vision he said science will progress in such a way until they will make a car that will not have to be guided by a steering wheel and the cars will continue to be shaped like an egg until the consummation the end time I seen American family going on the road in a broad way rising in a car with their backs turn towards where a wheel should be look like they were playing checkers or cards and so on like that and then the six he said I saw a woman stand up beautiful looking just in a high royal purple I got a little parenthesis here she was a great ruler in United States and he has perhaps the Catholic Church a woman some woman I know this is a woman's nation this nation is number thirteen and prophecy she's got 13 stripes 13 stars she started 13 colonies 13 everything is 13 and it appears in the 13 chapter of Revelation she's 13 she's a woman's nation and now for the last vision he says now then I turn and I looked and I saw this United States burning like a smaller rocks had been blown up it was burning like a heap of fire in logs or something just set it afire and look as far as I could see she has been blown up and then the vision left me five out of tree has happened or 707 has happened and so on so this was the vision that the prophet have and we had in long no to that vision we know what man has built will produce that vision with Atomics on everything else so her message lunacy content for the feet he said notice let's get back to keen again let's get back to some faith in the beginning watch those spirits how do you begin to move it's the spirit of anything that does the work of it anyhow so it's not just the thing is the spirit behind the thing there's the spirit in your home there's a spirit in this church there's a spirit that motivate in your life this is a spirit behind the same that's why you have to get into the right spirit that it can work correctly for you not just teens but the spirit behind it you have to know what spirit is behind operation behind you could you say Amen the people here we go have got to be in this kind of a spirit to bring the latter days so the latter this is a spirit that's why Jesus said as it was in the days of nor as it was in the days of Sodom surely be because of spirit atmosphere was there and he is saying to them that spirit was not going to come back hallelujah to bring that prophecy to pass or glory to God listen this bride will not feel this bride will not fall despry understand because this bride will have a spirit which is de spirit which is the Holy Spirit this is what God promised I feel confident of these promises that the Prophet spoke we are resting on it Oh glory the poor do believe that so the people have to be in this kind of a spirit to bring the latter days the people in the spirit of the latter days the nations are in the spirit of the end time the God atomic weapons hydrogen weapons all kind of things because it's the spirit of the day and the people are in the spirit of the end time and the church is moving together under the power and impact of the Holy Spirit so what are you saying if outside is moving in their spirit you have to move under the impact of the Holy Ghost you have to move under your Newton or Gloria Nagar some a stoppie a minute I believe the people are in the preparation for the last great destruction this world will ever know I believe we are the endtime you can speak to people you could put a Billy Graham in every city in the United States they will drink whiskey they smoke cigarettes laugh at you and everything else they are in the spirit of the last days no hear this God cannot send destruction before the people are in the spirit for destruction God will never destroy anything man destroys himself so the world has got to get in the spirit of the last days before the last days can come and we in the spirit of the last days so the bride before anything could happen the pride after get in the spirit or do you believe that or glory to God because revelation 7 says stop the winds stop the wars stop everything because I'm a bunch of people to be sealed and the sponge watch was a hundred and forty-four thousand joules that's the scripture but before the Jews are sealed hallelujah there's a bride to be sealed that's you you are the 11th hour Gentile workers with the promise to receive the same pay that the first church received this is your promise or glory of God and God can't go back to the Jews on can you get your promise the customer can go back to the Jews until the tenth aliens is over so you got to be sealed and the fact that the angel from the east have the seal of glory of the Living God it means you don't have to go to no man no man touching you no man can kill you but chlorine according to lore - oh praise God hallelujah go rejoice them a shout unto God [Applause] if you see that no man have the seal of God no man could deceive if you see that no man no man on earth could deceive you know pastor no deacon nor Church nor cult nor teaching nor doctrine to deceive you when you understand this coming either from the east having the seal of the Living God hallelujah praise God praise God you ain't come to church a warmer church bench you come

he has a pen he could write he put in a mat but only on doors that silent crying Oh blow me I even begin sign are you getting crying are you gonna get back up burden the burden of the word [Applause] maybe season Jesus prophecy is one week left for the Jews the Messiah the Prince wishes Christ will come and probably sign the midst of that 70 years or seven years he will be cut off so Jesus preached three and 1/2 years and was cut off and the daily stock ever was taken away and then there's a space given for the Gentiles and then coming to this age and then there's three and a half years left for the Jews so in the mists of the week Daniel seventy weeks the Messiah be cut off and Jesus Peachtree and a half years after that - enough yes this the time of the Gentiles and after what squats the Kanchana for years for the Jews and it's over finished then - anointed many lies and Moses returns again and preach to the Jews - men anointed with the spirit more glory to God amen and the other Jews they come to preach and they could not blow one up or kilauea destruction until those Jews come back so there is no destruction could strike until them Jews come in position but before they come in position you have got the premiere position but as a bride-to-be rapture you see the bride will be on the earth for a little while the spirit will be drawn from the earth the bride will have the spirit itself there's no more spirit left except in the bride so the privalov the spirit voice to make the final call he said there shall be a final call because God unlock a mystery of a bride age which is a final age hidden mystery that the devil knows nothing about when the devil open the Bible because only read of the now this year but inside a deer there's a hidden mystery of the voice of God coming in Satan's hidden in a bride mrs. Jesus Christ to express Christ - the split Christ will be the manifestation of the sons of God Oh glory to God hallelujah that's what creation is groaning for that's what the travail and for the creation itself is travailing you must go in travail that's what mother is all about the reason somebody is a mother because they travel here to Braveheart I'm the bride it's mornin is growing in travail Oh Gloria come on come on [Applause] you know maybe season I wonder just haha baby it a baby astronaut right it's an ocean you know that when you're buying a shop but you gonna want another store a baby going to processes take nine months equal to green and travail and boot pains and contraction this is a whole piece of drama whole hallelujah because God tell them after default in pain you bring forth and childhood that's under Word of God no escaping for this travail and if we have to bring forth little Jesus if you had to bring foot Messiah there was no escape him so cut it out [Applause] this underworld whippings hallelujah but pains pains to bring forth Oh glory to God hallelujah and Ablett is a mess hallelujah but no socializing here no known as a mess screaming kicking fallen hallelujah it's a mess and you have to be prepared to get messy Oh your Commendation well done this morning it'll be a mess oh yes hallelujah the confident you know social in this way your mass you see me moving this way I come to get messy Oh give the Lord a short in the house you sit down like a watching TV or something there's no movie playing for you this morning you better participate you better get involved you better get in the spirit you gotta get in your promise [Applause] oh I'm coming to entertain you oh no no no I coming to bring you aware who love the Lord [Applause] Oh my Jesus hallelujah the Prophet said if that man with England where was the Holy Ghost we realize that everybody is a Bible so is the same angel coming again when the Holy Ghost the seal of the Living God Ephesians 4:30 the Holy Spirit of God sealed until the day of your Redemption just imagine that you are sealed left from service or service not from Sunday to Sunday let's seal this revival sealed until the day of your Redemption what Terral to take that seat [Applause] mrs. Tom is a mod is an identification [Applause] see a lot of people except Church they accept Jesus Christ so they're ready come to church they don't have a connection with Christ they don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ and I've already accepted Christ as I put in there no church they know the word you know what God see and they won't profit see and books and quotes but not Christ because if there is no church let's say we break up the church break up on or they say no more churches or no more preaching or whatever it is what do you do if your backslide because there's no church bell here nothing no choice Thanks hallelujah hallelujah you're not originally it again you stayin home thanks very cereal lead come on Yahoo and I give them a tip the other day dough study what time never come this division was time steady with time led rose yeah Kyle Livia give me those tender coming attend unless it being translated then you don't need transportation you just gotta say I'm here and even so you miss it because suppose I don't pre-op your service if you have praying at home at least come here and pray at least here impress some angel or something some some angel might feel at least the preteen church but you're interested a misinterpret I'm here if the condition we are in now we could be so blessed much less if people one bundle house layin ever see smoke coming out of your homes I wonder what kind of smoke is smoke a prayer the pun in the rough satoru know the wonder what supernatural there's a smoke on top the house because the only lighting fire pray you're lighter than your children you're lighter than your husband your lights on their wife they like to listen every room the kind of prayer give the Lord some praise these people breath so powerful this is pressed up over this changing mind I go to him a man guaca mental I'm on your time up man prepare such things in order time up your time finish he say Lord God save me all these years give me an extension go see you have it so even if even if God tell you time up you should ask for an extension something look like like you give already you dream accompanies the arcs because in the

wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept at a midnight there was a cry made behold a brand commit go out to meet him and all those virgins arose trim their lamps the foolish said to the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are going out but the wise answered saying not so least there'd be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves while I went to buy the bridegroom came and dateable ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterwards key most of the other

priests got in tomorrow as the Jews will receive the same thing that there are Pentecost just as sure as anything I thought if I stand here and tell them go pick us out a bunch of men or among you and bring them here and see we still Messiah then they were saying no upon the same grounds of your forefathers rejected the Messiah you receive him you receive the Holy Ghost and then we will evangelize the world something struck me and said do not go now for the hour is not yet the Gentiles isn't fulfilled yet daddy isn't finished oh I thought that was just me so I started again it got so bad that I just couldn't stand it I went out behind a hanger ball my head I said father is that you speaking to me he said do not go to Israel now the hour is not here I went in and changed my ticket rotated again the other way see cause the or is not yet but one of these days the message will go to Israel and God will send them Moses and Elijah in revelation 11 and they will do signs and wonders and you over sign why the Gentile is finished the day of grace will leave the Gentile church the Pentecostal age would leave no these wise virgins oil in the Bible symbolize Holy Spirit we all know that and we are known the sacred oil oil symbolize Holy Spirit so they were ready to go in at the wedding supper and we could go back in Ezekiel 9 and so forth now this version is a virgin this was a foolish version this was a wise version and virgin means sanctified and clean if there was some way I could just make the people see it just burns in my soul these churches are clean and holy as this one if all are virgins they're all virgins just clean the only difference was oil in the lamp the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost if it's in there it produced a very same kind of fire it did on Pentecost but they don't have no fire no oil in your lamp they have chose rituals just just a ritual fine ceremonies not against it Cree's that shake a conscience and songs like angels singing but you could put and you can't put your finger on your life you couldn't do it but that's still wrong it is part of it but not all of it that's the kind of misses the rapture clean people nice people but it's a hunger in there's no science there's no crime there's no Holy Spirit we read the other night these people will not be an organization they'll be Wanderers around the land dwelling in tents poor and humble don't you try to curse them because I'm with them these people believe the same rich what they believe in what did the same God see but they didn't have someone who's following them it really had a brass serpent smitten rock the jaw of the king divine healing prophets they were there with a blessing the same thing with a sleepin version and the wise version you were both sanctified people this one had oil this one did not have oil they said we are just as good as you were there's none of us good as far as that concern you're a bunch of holy rollers they had weakened but when they did this one could go in because they had oil in their lamps that was the difference this one could go in there was no ordinary lamp they went back to pray up to receive the Holy Ghost they were a matter what pray up to receive the Holy Ghost but while they were gone it was all over yes the sleepin virgin this sleepin virgin now you want to know what would become of her watch the create tribulations they will have to go true know let me get the rest of that they were casting out of darkness where there was weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth or praise the name of the Lord so watch these two spirits working almost alike right down here now one is the denomination the other one is the Holy Ghost and Jesus said they will be so close that they would deceive the very elect it is possible these here we go are you ready are you listening these two spirits are marking their people for future judgments so you are being marked by the word to be sealed well yeah do you get that right now this morning I
