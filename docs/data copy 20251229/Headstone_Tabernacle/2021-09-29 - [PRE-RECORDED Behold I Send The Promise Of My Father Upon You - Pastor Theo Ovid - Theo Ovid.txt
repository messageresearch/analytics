light of oh generally read somebody in jesus name [Music] just one more time [Music] mercies praise the lord this morning we have two scriptures we like to read luke 24 verse 49 to 53 and acts 1 verse 48 we want to welcome you again those connected to us on the hookup we say god bless you and welcome luke 24 reading 49 and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry in the city of jerusalem until you be endured power from on high he led them out as fast as bethany and they lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven and they worshipped him and return to jerusalem with great joy and we're continually in the temple praising and blessing god amen we want to turn to acts 1 reading from verse 4. and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which said he you have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence when they therefore will come together they ask of him saying lord will god this time restore again the kingdom to israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father put in his own power but he shall receive power after the holy ghost come upon you and he shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem in all judea in samaria under the uttermost part of the earth let's pray father we thank you for your word and lord we pray that you will come into it and speak through your word confirm your word with signs oneness and miracles and i'll pour your spirit upon the lies of your people in jesus might ask it amen you may be seated [Applause] i send the promise of my father upon you and have an inspiration holy ghost power from on high amen amen hallelujah but a branham question on the holy ghost i have got to know what i'm doing before i can have faith in what i'm doing why you marry your wife you had faith in her you tried her you watch her you've seen she come from who she was that's the way the scripture is with god that's what makes these visions this spill of fire all these things because god promised it god said so i have tested him by his word i know that is the truth and you follow his word and if there's a little confusion somewhere there's something wrong somewhere because god never did work contrary to his own lord he will never work contrary to his own laws the winter won't come in summer the summer won't come in winter the leaves won't fall in springtime and come against on the floor you just can't make it come on now let's go yes so i've said it last night about the artesian well what in your crop if you're standing out in the middle of the field it's black knight you say oh great unless city i know you in the field i'm lost i know where i'm going give light i can see all the walk there's not unless you slide to the field that's true but the light of the room but you got to know the government you might scream till you could scream no more it will never light up you have to work according to the laws of electricity in order to get light are you with me now oh that's the same way it is with god god is the creator of heaven and earth but he will only work as you follow his laws and instructions so it's not a viking electricity will not float through wood it have a certain material it will flow through and the spirit of god will flow through a certain material also and that's why he have you have you as a tabernacle as a vessel that he wanted to tabernacle himself in do you believe that now watch no it's watch he said no the method is the watch he said now the promise is the baptism of the spirit which is promised in the old testament and the new testament behold i send the promise of my father all will be talking about is promises this land of canaan was a land tight of the holy ghost that was a physical land that came out of physical egypt the physical canaan land we coming out of a natural land into a spiritual baptism the holy ghost is the promise canaan land was it in type are you with me so watch

when he was about to go he said make a pledge to me don't leave my bones in egypt oh hallelujah he said put make a pledge mr covenant when you're going because i know you're going because god said so god can't lie and when you're going to come out of here one day i'm not living to see it but i know you're going to come out he said but when you go in take my bones with you you know why joseph said that he no messiah coming in the promised land he no dynamics coming to the promised land he's no resurrection coming upon this land you're going not going to get messiah in egypt you've got to leave egypt and go into the promised land oh glory to god are you with me so jesus told them don't leave jerusalem stay in jerusalem until until until you get power from on high don't leave that word wait

glory to god so this promise of the holy ghost is the old testament is it a new testament isn't that right now he said let's notice jesus in luke 24 29 had commissioned the apostles after they have been saved and sanctified according to the word sin john 17 sanctify them to thy truth thy word is truth he give them power to heal the sick cast out devils raise the dead matthew 10 power which was temporary power [Applause] don't let that power fool you amen amen that that's the one that disappeared temporary power judas was there and they came back rejoicing lord even the devils are subject to us when the devil see us they're running jesus said don't rejoice for that that's not what a rejoicing for he said bring it back to the word now don't rejoice that rejoice look at your name in heaven rejoice because your name is in the book that's why everybody should be rejoicing this morning if you know your name is on the book you are the happiest person in trinidad [Applause] the prime minister don't have access to that book the little bishop or the pope nobody could take your name out you should be shouting that is encrypted [Applause] that is encrypted by god the devil can't get the password to get into behind god's computer to try to erase your name and destroy your life [Applause] your name is sealed oh hallelujah glory listen your name was in heaven your name was in the book but what the version 10 says i saw another mighty angel coming with the book open what are you coming with he coming with your name and he covered with seven thunders he showed his voices out and the devil looked in the writing the right he right into devil of his pen listening to the right and he had to seal it so he couldn't see it and god take it and put it on the seventh seal but it was silence but only for half an hour we have half an hour to get out of here half an hour to get transformed a special half an hour a half an hour acting god a half an hour the devil knows nothing about because only silence under there but under there we are in faith future knowledge temperance patience cognizably kindness under the air we had in the life we are in the stature we are in the world we gonna make it and you're gonna make it [Applause] you're going to be a real christian let's be seated hallelujah hallelujah have thousands and thousands of church members but you will be a real christian when you walk the devil is going to shake when you walk the devil is going to scatter here come a real christian we can't stand you know what the devil said paul i know some people trying in person paul i know peter i know but who are you those devils know when to see sonship when they see courtship when they see a predecimated elected seed a light from god [Applause] some of you trying to hide christianity high high living in the shadows of what it's almost embarrassing the place black if if a shiny spirit ramp is a dark screen and when you walk use a big big light never seen you big big big big pig [Applause] all you've ever seen is darkness i really like passing look look look one of them [Applause] you better wake up and shout and get more power to stand get more power to press because this little light are mine i'm gonna let it shine shine the light until jesus comes look at hi no more we exposing you hallelujah you're playing chicken by your eagle we're going to expose you [Applause] we're going to exposure you may be seated you come with some chicken coat on you you're big you're too yes you're too big for that you're not even fitting right in that chicken garment big i see your wings you can't play chicken and escape i see your wings you burn the shore you want to fly you born the lord lift me up where i belong come on know where the eagles fly on the mount list [Applause] glory to god glory to god hallelujah hallelujah oh praise god there's a virtue for you if you desired there's victory for you if you desire just have a desire and the holy spirit will pick up your desire write the newspaper but the whole thing will pick up you just get the desire and which will pick up your desire and speak right back to you oh glory to god he will anoint me to speak direct to you [Applause] he give them poor healers sick raise the dead they come back rejoicing but their names on the land book of life you remember but they were not yet convicted amen jesus told peter the night of his crucifixion after you are converted so peter wasn't an instant stun i could have instant milk instant coffee instant chicken instant everything instant and they want that tablet now pop given by the ministers open when you take that instant you feel like a son jesus told peter you will deny me three times don't die enough to get a man depressed because you were the disciple who was had this moat to say well you know notice that you beat me to come peter always forward and do you say you you deny me daniel yeah [Music] [Applause] you want to feel it all but [Applause] failure is not a problem to give up feeling is part of the life [Music] some people don't like to fail and when they're failing no no no that's part of life how much businesses went bankrupt how much men who flop and fail and come back and did much more better than what they did before it's only in christianity are people when people don't want to beat them up sit down like someone is a joy to beat people up to make people feel they're on top because somebody is down don't fool yourself not because somebody's done you are up if you beat somebody down you don't just like them if you are up you want to raise somebody where you are come on same as somebody you hear what i said if you are up you going to raise somebody up to where you are [Applause] you'll be seated [Music] the reason people beat people down because they're in the spirit they don't get to and wearing long dress wearing jacket and tie but in the spirit they don't get to look at the prodigal son my young brother went and spent all the money and carrying on what not come back home father happy to see your son always looking up to get back to son i look at you older brother who is that inside of there you better come back why you come back four then to hear the fatted calf get killed and here cause i'm bringing grass to heat feed that fatted calf he thought he was another feast so that'd be fatigue he could have killed the less less fat one but the fatted one the real one cut that one up how long he's priming priming for that for that guy call me brother that done coconut curry already he just depressed because the father rejoices my son was lost god does leave ninety and nine and go after the loss you stay there you stay there with yourself right yourself god does go after the loss [Applause] hallelujah oh give the lord some praises my god i hope you fall in love back with jesus after this service i hope there's a joy strike your shoulder when he saved you remember when he called you remember when he saved you it was you and him alone the preacher wasn't even involved it was god dealing with your own heart which man save you who can the lord i say i know of man and save you no man could fill you god is yet to fill you with the holy ghost [Applause] you ever think you're going too far you sin too much this thing and they saying they don't ever believe that once in an opportunity god could do something special in your life hallelujah you can't go fine enough praise god that you can study your children in your family i don't care what they're smoking what they're drinking what they're doing oh god your offspring will be there with you too that's a promise that's the promise of god that will be delivered somehow i can explain it praise god who can explain that jesus needs passion samaria who can explain that because that woman name was in the book she didn't know her name was in the book she didn't know she was elected and predestinated all she knows she's struggling with her children and from this man to that man into that man under but god of mercy god saw what was in her heart and god meet her at her need and she was delivered she was set free and i am believing god people gonna be suffering inside of here and you could go and sin no more that you could all set [Music] past masters my god let my people go oh glory god people gonna go free oh hallelujah praise god every demon bang in your life we're going to deliver you you're going to be delivered how's the hell going to give way to the name of the lord oh glory to god oh my god [Applause] you'll be seated if in the spirit realm god open your eyes among the demons camping outside your home and along the streets you wouldn't leave your home without praying if in the spirit realm you'll recognize all the forces loosed against you you wouldn't take things for granted you would recognize the battle is not yours it was the lord's is only because the angel of the lord and camp around those that fear him that you are protected come on now upon him you hear what i said it's only because the angel of the lord and camper wrong toes that fear him a lot of things going on in the spirit realm you know nothing about him [Applause] you'll be seated what about him said when daniel sought to seek the lord and daniel was praying asking god gabriel was fighting to come to daniel but david was battling backland and brown said daniel stopped praying the angels stopped coming this daniel prayer was bringing the angel so you know what praying going to do when you begin to pray if my people that's called by my name shall humble themselves and pray when you begin to pray the angels have to come deliverance coming breakthrough coming because you calling upon the name of the lord not by your might not by your power but bang my [Applause] so with the holy spirit before the holy spirit receiving the holy spirit you are believing unto eternal life but when the holy spirit comes it is eternal life you are begotten of the spirit of sanctification but never born of the spirit until the holy ghost comes in he's talking about in the mother in the mother's womb there's a bunch of muscles be beaten and so on in the mother's womb but when the baby comes out as life comes into the baby isn't that right but the same thing he said you are begotten at signification all the cells are being built up at time vacation but the holy ghost come and that is life isn't that right you say my dear measure is brother up in holiness nazarene the baptism of the holy ghost is different from sanctification simplification is cleansing which is preparation of life but when the holy ghost comes it is life preparation is cleaning the vessel the holy ghost is filling the vessel sanification is cleaned and set aside for service the holy spirit puts it in service the vessel that got cleaned up so that's all god trying to do clean you up turn your upside down shake you out do your got a good clean and then fill you and then use you for his honor his glory one more ride one more shake up oh glory to god you have one little space in his life to live don't waste it some people to wait too long to recognize wait a minute what his life is about trying to get a house car husband wife or everything otherwise wife there's life behind you and after said what have i done for the kingdom of god okay so we find out the holy ghost is god himself and you god was above and pillar fired moses god was with you in jesus christ now god is in you in the holy ghost no three gods one god working in three offices so god came down and dwelled in a sanctified body virgin born of a woman that was god himself you know what he placed his tent among us god dwelt in a tent called jesus christ [Applause] so jesus christ was god tent yes that god dwelled in i've been in cairo in egypt the cap never did come because it was the cornerstone the church in the church there was a cornerstone in the full church it was the headstone it never come it was rejected he said and that's where the bill is today that's why the bad the bride building here we go of christ is not ready for the bridegroom listen carefully so that's what we have to say with the deep sea you know oh we could preach a lot of stuff but see this is accurate this is god speaking that's why the bride building of christ is not ready for the bridegroom because the builders has rejected the chief cornerstone that was laid on the day of pentecost which is the baptism of the holy spirit so they could mystery mystery mystery mr mr machine what are your life mysterious you don't know what mystery connected with the life so you see mystery is one thing but life this is the holy ghost it has to come back to the holy ghost has to come back to pentecost same life same sensation same works same signs same wonders isn't that right watch see the people act funny but they don't come in order of our psychology our educational our lunar creeds they don't fit in there they ticked off you see people say you have the word the word the word of the word yes but the word need the spirit to come alive that's why jesus said tarry in the city of jerusalem until you endure it powerful and high what kind of power power to pray power to live power to overcome power to say i'm sorry power to say forgive me power to be humble praise god usually when people get blessed to get puffed up and we know when people are going up about a fall they get arrogant they get puffed up they get all up there how are you doing and afterwards god bring them down because the way up is down so anytime somebody about to fall just put the self right up then they just fall right back down but god wants us to stay in the dust he wants us to stay humble go to looking for somebody the more god bless you the more humble you can become that's a challenge that's a difficulty because usually when people get blessed they get puffed up but god warned somebody the more you bless god i want to open up the blessing and channel it through you come on you could do better than that come on say him and somebody go on to bless you glory to god hallelujah hallelujah but i'm talking about the rat egypt the little monks in egypt saying it eaten spiritually the whole band full of grain and like the most good on the diet eaten spiritually sparingly that's how we operate sometimes god gave that blessing you denies all of it you feel yeah i have more than that for you man god want to fill your entire being till you become a manifestation of god think about it now jesus said the same works i do shall you do also he was dropping promises on them because only promises will make the difference in your life for you to be delivered you must have a promise you get a breakthrough you have to get a promise payment your deliverance you have to get a promise it's by these promises you get faith and virtue and knowledge you can't sit here without a promise and you promise what you're looking for he gave ibrahim a promise come on all the brothers have promises joseph was looking for a promise of messiah the people of israel was looking for promise of deliverer and moses the people making the promise of messiah you have to be looking for a promise what are you looking for behold i send the promise of my father upon you you've got to be looking for a promise but your promise is the holy ghost oh glory to god he'll make a better wife a better husband amen amen hallelujah hallelujah praise god notice jesus said wait wait doesn't mean to pray me so wait they were not fit subjects to preach yet because they only knew his resurrection by his person of seeing them outside he commanded them not to preach anymore people look i guess they fight for money about that jesus told his disciples don't even preach stop preaching because to go in the new season you need power amen listen after they started preaching holy ghost they got licks in them and they didn't submit sick leave to stay from truth because they got licks could you imagine they're getting licks without the holy ghost after three months you don't know if anybody come back to church but when they got the holy ghost and they got licks and they went back to church they say lord strengthen us and send them some more power that we could go out and preach the word don't get licks without the holy ghost enough we know we're going to happen yeah man that's literally with the holy ghost so don't think holy ghost means no licks hallelujah they don't want to see amen i caught them oh you thought holy ghost mean no licks they got they had holy ghost and they got licks they had holy ghost they got stoned they had holy ghost and they got shipwrecked come on same as somebody and the holy ghost is god in them oh give the lord a shout glory to god you see everything don't have to work out smooth as you think but it just have to be in god hallelujah it doesn't matter if you put you in the red sea lions then sorry for this it doesn't matter [Applause] oh my god fools to the devil i can put one in the lines then you can't you can't shoot them off i can put them in the fiery footage you can't throw them off i can put them in front of red sea you can't show them off i can throw anywhere anytime anyplace under any condition come on no you cannot [Music] throw off my people it is my people dealing with jesus look what gordon's do when the people backslide let them king of babylon take them amen some king take them and then after they repent he shall punish the king you think god holding a long long crutch considering his people the deal with you he's straightening out but when you see a repent double that spirit holding you punish your punishing king of babylon don't mess with god's people don't fool with them my god my don't fool with them touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm hallelujah give the lord a shout listen going on a man that'd like it today and he'll like it tomorrow he love it today he not love each more amen are you excited about the united states he's got no calling you that fixed up already before who we knew he before he called who he called it justified and he had already glorified as far as god considers finish we just go into the motion it comes like you know you'll win the rock the whip you know you'll win the boxing match already that man don't know he's already defeated but you have to go into the ring tonight [Music] all right you can't down and defeat him in your mind you may be sisters i come like passing through africa one of the places we have to land there uh africa is drama i don't know yet and um so they asked for the yellow fever card and so on give them that i know how ten years and whatnot so the man called the brother who lived on the side outside i know some kind of thing like some kind of money or whatnot when did cars come out now because we get inoculated for something we don't even know without a needle they just put it in the book because you didn't need that but that yeah you know you have another p for that i said tell us that that's how the people they mark them you are the holy ghost you effectively inoculated you had to get a needle you had to get an injection but in africa they just put something inside your book and give that stuff and say well go don't take that not for christianity you know that you are good because somebody writes in the book you this you that know you have to experience it you got to taste it for yourself hallelujah so that was a joke for us we have inoculation we don't even know what kind it is but we never felt it we never tasted it it's just right on paper that's a paper experience and you know what you could pass all these stations with that you know because that would have seen the change they look at but you see god here coming to paper no coming up paper testimony paper this and paper that you have to have the real thing oh hallelujah hallelujah so peter didn't say save and go have my none such as i have hold on come up with a book hold that read that peter didn't have that he said something what i don't have but such as i have i give it unto you rise up and walk that is what we're talking about that's when talk is over come on same as somebody action time now we're coming for your family we're coming for your loved ones when you see your son my god in your spirit realm you claiming him you're saying deliver him you challenging demons and devils upon him you have the authority to do so by the authority vested in me for as a son under the seventh seal i said devil come out of the people in the name of jesus oh glory to god hallelujah glory glory glory watch your blessings blessed [Applause] is this real to you you may be seated god is real oh hallelujah praise god so they were not fit to preach they only knew his resurrection by his person i've seen him outside he commanded them not to preach anymore not to do nothing until first then you would pour from on high i don't believe that any preacher sent of god can be correctly ordained because god is infinite and once god does once he does all the time if god will not let them preach until they went to pentecost and receive here we go the pentecostal experience not a message experience your belief message or believe the words or believe the bible know a literal experience that you and you are alone knows nobody can explain it away from you because you have to have your own experience so you have to have a hunger in your heart for your own personal experience to meet god i remember as a 17 year old walking down san fernando asking god i don't know who you are but i want to meet you i want to know you there was a deep in my soul as a young 17 year old crying out 1975 hungering and testing for god oh and he met me oh glory to god fire praise god i encounter that fire and he will meet you too but there got to be a hungering and thirsting and jesus said blessed are the day that hunger tears after righteousness they shall be filled come on give the lord i shout glory to god so this word come together happy titanium come to give a desire inside of you come to bring an expectation inside of you to lift you above the movies above the styles above the fashions above the internet above everything around you about the cell phone above the social media to raise you up and keep raising you up praise god because you are born of the heavenly this power doesn't come from below this power comes from above it's powerful on high it's not poured from the pasta is that power from the minister it's powerful and high they heard a sound from heaven as a russian mighty wind and they were filled with the holy ghost something happened to them oh come on now don't just look at me intellectually say amen [Applause] this is serious because in ezekiel 9 the slaughtering angel was calling forward amen he began the slaughter and the inca and writer was among them and god said listen before they start to slaughter put a mark upon those that sigh and cry those are trapped in travail those that have a burden that's why you can't be light you have to have a burden for god for the word of god and the bible says utterly male we have that here female we have that here young we have that here oh we have that here start in my house but come not near any man with that mark so we have no time to play we have children to pray for we have husband to pray for wife to pray for seal seal seal seal put them up put them up put them out pull them out [Applause] the angel not asking who your pastor the angel are asking what group you belong like when the press come down you return the press come down saying what side in the message you believe what doctrine no the press coming down on this message yeah yeah because the prophet saw it we can't stop it the devil coming down yeah we're up front to see the the right the the the angel with the suffering weapons coming down also not asking who your pastor is how long you're going to church you've got to guess it as individual as that preach one take one left not one group taking one group left one taken we're here to isolate you as an individual and say you is who god's speaking to this morning not the entire group you the individual who god speaking to not your husband you not your wife you [Applause] between a bed one taken one left doing a field one taking one left the place we land on a place called gomer have a volcano and it's not active right now i think in 2003 destroy the whole place visit the big rocks which how far the volcano is our father healers and so on where the city is it wrecked the entire city i said lord jesus what a thing big rocks huge guys black they take it on granite and making the roads and whatnot and brown talk about judgment of god at arena ton coming down i saw forget what he called it again hill falling a ton judgment coming and striking the earth and the people like atomic father just material for the atomic bomb to strike what where are we at we're not in the beginning or the middle part we're at the end of back again it's just because god put us here right now the prophecy until the time come they have to wait until we can't manufacture anything to produce anything we have to wait till my change comes when the change come there will be no trying to say anything about it it will speak for itself peter peter peter just lived it out he manifested christ oh hallelujah so when your spirit come what will you manifest has to be jesus christ oh my god so therefore ephesians church eight cast that bear them with the evil that was tried and would see the apostles and found them to be liars these ephesians believed that god people ought to be holy they will not put up with sin in the church holiness wasn't a phrase with them or a figure of speech it was a way of life hallelujah brotherly kindness is a figure of speech right now a phrase brotherly kindness spirit of forgiveness honey you've got to leave nothing you don't forgive nobody just ball honey those try them let's see the apostles are not found them as liar's my that's a blunt statement that was try them who call themselves apostles is not presumptuous what righteous are people to try those who call themselves apostles how do they try them oh i love this it's in galatians 1 8 though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have already preached unto you let him be accursed are you ready it was the apostles who brought the original word to the people the original word could not change not even a dot or a dash of it paul knew it was god who had spoken to him so he said even if i come and try to give a second revelation try to make one little change in what i give originally let me be accursed so paul was saying i paul cannot come back and change the first revelation because god can't change his mind about his word oh god we give the lord some praise his people [Applause] you see paul knew the first revelation was correct god can't give a fullest revelation than a second revelation if he did he would be changing his mind he can give a revelation and add to it as he did in the garden of eden when he promised a seed to the woman then later designated that sea to come to abraham then later it will come through the bloodline to david but it was the same revelation it only gave the people more information to help than to receive and understand it but it was the same revelation but god could add more to give more information of how it's going to be unfolded god's word can't change the seed came exactly as revealed and see what those false apostles were doing they came with their own word oh hallelujah are you with me they came with their own word those ephesians knew that paul word was was those ephesians knew that word as paul had taught it they were full of the holy ghost by the land of hands of paul they looked those fours are possible in the eye and said you are not seeing what paul said therefore you are false so we have a prophet in this hour his name is william marion branham a prophet in the end time according to malachi 4 behold i sent you elijah the prophet before that great and terrible day of the lord so god sent a prophet with the original word and if we stay with an original word we're going to see fire fall you're going to see god confirm it we can't bring our own word we have to bring word on top of word on top of word it's not your feelings are you like you it's not a liking contest you don't have to like me it's got to be the word i'm not here for you to like i'm here to deliver a love letter to you glory to god your husband give me a message for you oh give the lord a shout in the house you are his wife you are his bride he given preachers to send his word to you [Applause] okay so you are not saying what paul said therefore you're false that sets my heart on fire get back to the word it's not you that really tries the apostle and the prophet and teacher it's the word that tries them we have to try people hallelujah bible said try every spirit every spirit not some spirit every spirit i don't get where they're from what country you're from oh hallelujah you see i have no problem with people getting fight and if i offend men i'll get a fight if i offend god i have no people problem people displeased with me i as long as god is not displeased with me i have no problem people walking away from me that's okay but i don't want god walk away from me i prefer to please god and to please men i people will please god and to please friends that's why i say friend or no friend hallelujah praise god i pledge when i was 17 years old that i wouldn't let money woman of popularity come between me and my god i wasn't married yet i didn't have any children yet i was young but i saw what happened with money woman and popularity and i pledged to god by the grace of god i wouldn't let that come between him oh hallelujah a friend or no friend family and no family i want that word i come too far to turn back now too many miles i've traveled too many roads i've been through i have too much to gain to lose i'm not going to back up i'm not going to give up i'm not going to let go i'm not going to turn around i'm going to stay the course oh glory i'm going to finish this race oh glory to god god paul passes the martin martin the luther looted the wesley they keep passing the battle and we have the battle in our hands we're gonna run with it we are running onto the resurrection we are running down to perfection we are running with it to see a perfect church where the holy ghost have the preeminences in that church when number six is detroit man is kicked out and number seven comes on the holy ghost itself pillar of fire resting upon the sons and daughters of the living god oh hallelujah number six defeated hallelujah number seven raised up anointed god don't have to take your ideas oh yes there's an idea of god like i said imagine two million people coming out and they don't even know they are carriers what god seeing them as carriers carriers of those who would inherit the promise that's right for when they came to the kingdom god said not one all you're going over just kill about joshua he said your children go over but not you praise god and when jesus came there was boasting our fathers every man in the wilderness and jesus said and dear everyone dead and brother said that dead means eternally separate from god hallelujah that's how bad it was the same people that god called god judged praise god yes so don't don't don't don't be careful amen be careful people serving the god i call it of the imagination of their own heart they're making their own gods that's not the god of the bible god the bible street not moses they got the bible straight not noah they called him by the street no joshua they got him by the streets of all them sons of god and they're going by my ankle straighten us out you've got to be kidding me that that is crazy god is the word no man can tell me let's go on let's move on there's a way to correct things they're ready to handle things the way to deal with this thing there's a way to see right until man and the way

miracles they saw science they saw wonders ready open they dance they eat everything else moses bring them up to the mountain of god and he'd gone up there to see god and the people finding staying too long [Applause] bring the earrings and then how they make a golden calf i said this is the god that brought you egypt and moses is up there waiting fire building all the ten commandments god taking his hands and writing in stone giving moses instructions to give to the people because the reason god brought the people out was to give them instructions as to how he lives how he operates that they could be blessed amen because if you break the rules and the laws of god you'll pay the penalty of that he wants them to know his laws know his will know his words amen amen and moses coming to having carnival they're dancing and whining they're carrying on the drinking the drunk man all right [Music] and they judgment again all choose judgment this is the god we serve now a god of judgment god as is you he is no respecter of persons he respects his word it is serious [Applause] sometimes i get messaged the preacher oh lord do i have to say that do i have to do what i do amen but then warn to me if i don't hallelujah i'm the kid for no crowd i'm not giving for nobody i'm kidding that's why i love when the brothers get here from god and speak what upon the heart you hear directly from god somebody i pray and seek the lord and get something from the lord oh hallelujah praise god man is still man hallelujah all look look i'm like in africa you know the roads not paved and nothing not even paved and so on and they see the hungering upon the people they're passionate about the people there's a clip we have on facebook right now of this of the of the worship after the last service just about three minutes you know was shouting and rejoicing and dancing and that was after about a two hour prayer line there were almost three thousand people passing through a prayer line that was after that and those people just energized as if the service don't start hallelujah all right listen tell them one time current went and if you see the music and you're singing that people are saying dragon america mcdonald's people leave and come make a spin and come back and then people stand up there and they're singing and they're rocking and they're singing and they're going man and they're going i say lord have mercy oh good lord the west have it too easy but in some of those countries the freedom the liberty the people they have much but they have jesus they don't have

hallelujah it had a whistle it had horn and had everything you think about it when the preacher preaches like gold same thing in the cricket stadium that's the kind of thing they had there while you talk about excitement you'll be leaving a football arena praise god the love of god and i mind but only one time reading the scriptures and when you read the scripture so it's just exploding i've never seen anything like it like like every script is like gold hallelujah like every script is yeah yeah every scripture man god these people was eating up the word forget about it we didn't have

the vulnerable before you had bills before your copy of the rent before you have this pressure and that pressure you were shouting the difference a liar tonight oh god won't you shouting god wants your worship and god wants you praising oh god want you happy how many knows that depression is a spirit god don't want you depressed god wants you to happy but you must want god's will to seek first the kingdom everything else will be added unto you because god know the end from the beginning oh hallelujah praise god listen god ask jonah to go to the neighbor to tell them people repent judah didn't want to go amen different race different people different country goku tell jonah if you tell them repent they repent god didn't tell jonah that don't say okay lord thank you lord but he going the wrong direction but all that god have a way of all things so work together for good to them that love god because those people worship before god do not don't know that so then they pose at a rock and then they say jonah say at least i like that part though do you know what's honest enough to say it's me the reason you're having trouble on this boat is me throw me off and everything will be fine doesn't a man recognize he is trouble all by himself all by himself stop blaming your wife stop living this one you are trouble all by yourself he said throw me overboard and i'll you'll be fine go ahead i prepared fish and jonah step up and repent and that king that kingdom everybody repent amen and jonah are waiting to see his word come to pass because patrona pronounced judgment and god wait and watching jonah and jonah getting vexed and don't get in harass because people repent and god repent of his repentance god repented what he was going to do then the people repent so much that god repent it's something when you repent you know it has touched god [Applause] you see forgive me i'm sorry lord it's something when you repent it touches god oh it does something to him oh glory to god so watch one of these days he is going to come for the prophet the loudest age you will know if he is a real one god sent or not yes you will for if he is of god he will be in that word exactly as god gave it to paul he won't deviate from that word for a moment not by one iota in that last age when there will be many false prophets appearing watch and see how they keep telling you that if you don't believe them and what they say you will be lost but when that last day prophet comes in the scene if he truly that prophet he'll be crying out get back to the word or you'll be lost he won't build on a private revelation or interpretation but on the word isn't that right so masterpiece he says he's tattered in their pentecost to bill another masterpiece the original word started the first church what was it the seed word the word manifested amen the promise that was being given that's how we started the church started with promise manifested amen do you get that what happened pentecost was promised manifested behold i send the promise of my father upon you wait for it so if they woke up without it the promise was going to be manifested but pentecost was promised say it say it manifest it say it loud the pentecost was the promise manifested so you have to receive promise manifested oh give the lord a shout all glory to god amen hallelujah so watch the word is a seed that i saw sowed the seed was the word any seed that abides alone does nothing it's got to fall into the ground so that perfect church fell into the ground and i see a room when she become an illumination now he proved to be right he christ was very light that they claimed they were worshiping they clearly worship in that light they claim they are worshiping it but their tradition they glare in their face okay okay notice his works was the living word itself what he did was the living word itself showing that he was the light that has been promised since the beginning of the world he was that light his light on the promised world of the age make it live exactly what the promise said it would do so when god promises in things light has to come on that word to make it live light has to come on that word to make it live or water the seed to make it live or shine in the darkness into the sea to make it live light has to come spirit has to come not by might not by power but by my spirit look for it expect it hallelujah live for it pray for it the spirit is what is promised oh glory to god hallelujah when the day of pentecost was come when the holy ghost fell upon those people they acted like drunk men and women staggering under the impact of the holy spirit and they walk away and walk their heads these people is drunk with new wine and so forth it absolutely was the light the word that has been prophesied made manifest think about it they were drunk walking like this and so on isn't that right but that was the word made manifest no signs yet no wonders yet this drunk looking people oh glory to god they have new wine it was new wine it was the wine of the holy ghost it was the wine of god it brought stimulation of revelation oh glory to god but there was drunk on something else it was the wine from joel prophecy it shall come to pass afterwards i'll pour my spirit upon all flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy your young men shall see visions it was that word from joel come turn upon them joel wood come alive joy and prophecy come alive joy prophecy made manifest that was the holy ghost the holy ghost is the word coming on your life being made manifest what's the kingdom of god the word in you turn into power oh give the lord a shout that's why where jesus said when they say come here go there god he said believe they are not behold the kingdom is within you give the lord a shout in the house oh glory to god that's what the devil don't want you to know the kingdom comes inside of you give the lord a scream do you get that you are walking with the kingdom that word is inside of you the kingdom is inside of you oh glory to god they're going to turn into power it's going to turn into power that's the kingdom of god the word turn into power you're going to turn into power that's the kingdom of god the word turn into power so in every age the word made manifest come to life is the light of the age so when god said in george 28 he shall come the past i put my spirit upon all flesh that was the light upon that word when the word has been manifest then it becomes light in all ages god has sent forth so much of his word for each age god always send somebody that that word can get into and show light of it so right now it's talk talk everybody talking everybody a microphone everybody can shout and see what they want see where they feel and whatnot but it comes out oh when the seasons change when there's character in the lives of sons around the world where the light will come over that and bring it alive then it will speak for itself no more to boast don't have to claim anything and boast anything like that don't have to get paper testimonies to see how great the ministry is or anything like that no nothing like that at all to give boost to the church and whatnot no it wouldn't need another it will speak for itself but it will speak for itself he will let it be made known among men oh give the lord a shout you see you have to know the word you have to believe the word he will let it know so you think all these years god just have us killing time having church that's not the objective of god we are sons not church members we are sons and daughters of god you have adams out there to go after it are people you have to go after only you could do it so you can't say you're shy you're not called you don't feel mad god want to use you to get that last one to get your fallen brother to get your fallen family god going to use you i'm telling you to your face but i'm going to use you yes you're weak but

weak the bible says let the week say i am strong let the week say i am strong because you have to say it before it materialize upon your life you got to speak it like the week say i am strong you've got to say you're going to make it because the man thinking his heart so is he also he is oh glory to god i'm going to be filled i'm going to be sealed i'm going to get a breakthrough going to bless

romans 8 20th that we know all things work together for good. god wanted joseph there to strip him because he had visions you have dreams you have revelation you have inspiration but god have to get that man in order and to get that man in order is to lose him and send him in the wilderness to let them dry out and die out they don't feel abandoned they don't think that god doesn't even care his prayer not even being answered hey man i don't know all right time running away and joseph spending time in prison seeming like a seamless life with buckland bacon chatting and vision and whatnot all of a sudden all right god waiting for a certain time all of a sudden god gives you a dream amen hallelujah my favorite tell his wife interpret that dream for me tell me about that dream interpret that dream and they couldn't do it they say we know a man a man named joseph he's in prison but you need to talk to that man that is the man that you need to speak to he has a god that could reveal secrets

partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world true lust and start aboving man i'm going to wrap up in building this monument building this statue it starts off with fate and virtual knowledge what they what does it do they are waiting for the headstone which is love for god is love and he controls and he is the strength of every one of those things watch and what is that the holy ghost comes down to christ see holy spirit is above all of this well in this together building a perfect church for the capstone to cap what's it been done again is manifested through seven church ages seven messengers here you are seven church ages seven steps god building this church is like one person into an individual into himself the power of god coming down through this wellness together therefore the pentecostal people that let out of the lutheran let all the wesleyan and things you see they live in this part of the temple that's the way but god say i'm going to restore and the way god is expecting us as individuals to grow the way he brought the church to grow just as the church ages grow we have got to grow the prophet revealed that when you ask to get closer to god what you're actually asking is that i want to grow in god because when you grow you'll say i want to be close to lord god give your faith amen i want to be closer to you god give your virtue god what happened to you there you're getting closer to knowledge and temperance and patience ungodliness i'm proud kindness and by the time you hit that spirit you're one with him at that time
