tonight I am this morning I'm here to introduce another speaker all the way from New York City man I've known for more than 30 years and before he comes just want to just read something and this some acts 28 verse 3-6 it say when Paul gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire there came a viper out of the Heat and fastened on his hand and when barbarians saw the venomous Beast hang on his hand they said among themselves no doubt this man is a murderer whom D do he had escaped the sea yet Vengeance suffer it not to live and he shook off the Beast Into the Fire Hallelujah and felt no harm how be it they looked when he should have swollen and fallen down dead suddenly but after they had looked a great while and saw no harm come to him they Chang their minds and said he was a god th small G amen you know is something when people leave you to die and waiting you for you to die and like you're not dying how I thank God for my brother Jesse here that shake off Shake Off Shake It Off Hallelujah shake off the Viper shake off the negative sake of what this one said what that one said and what the people said what this church said what this other minister say no shake it off oh give

feel free this morning yes we feel free where the spirit of God is there is Liberty we feel free this morning oh we going to have a time this morning hallelujah praise God you may be seated Glory Glory what is a shout in the camp we are on the word now oh hallelujah oh praise God you see with church membership comes emotions I'm talking about the emotion that belonging to this group or this thought or this whatever it is emotions but to the kingdom of God it doesn't have to have the emotions in it in the sense then that you belong to a body a international bright budy that nobody can put you in and guess what they can take you out and once you're in that body they can't pull you out of that body you will be a Christian anywhere you'll be a Christian in Trinidad you'll be a Christian in France you'll be a Christian in America you'll be a Christian in Nigeria you whatever part of the world you are from and you're going to beat that devil anywhere any time any place under any condition you're going to still have a Revival because your father promised it and they ain't have enough devils in hell to stop it you're going to have it regardless not even your sins could stop it not even your past stop it not even your failures could stop it be seated the little clip we have on the website what I'm say keep struggling keep struggling keep struggling until you break out yeah we are struggling you got to struggle you doesn't you haven't got it yet you're struggling but you're going to break out keep struggling until you break out amen SE morees the Holy Spirit overshadow Jesus and his rign shine like the son and God himself said this is my beloved Son hearing him in other words there it is what he says is all of it amen and then he was given equal of of course it was God but God In the Flesh of Jesus Christ manifested himself to the people God adopting his own son now when the Pentecostal church and these people in this last days here that's beginning to find a new birth being born again they thought that settled it no sir your ups and downs in and outs things like that God can't place you as a son but when you here we go when you stay in the Kingdom he didn't say stay in the minister Association he did not not say that am stay in The Minister's group and he did not say that he said when you stay in the Kingdom stay in the gospel stay right don't stay wrong stay right one of these days God not a convention Pastor God will call you out amen hallelujah come on and set you aside and adopt you as a son before the people and give you something that will shake the nation's with it Hallelujah not just to shake the church shake the Nations we wasn't called to prophesy to church we we called the prophesy the Nations we not speaking just to you here we are speaking International that's the voice that God put in a bride oh yes it will Thunder like they have never heard it before once more the world will hear direct from God not books and tapes no living Tabernacles living Epistles God walking on two feet you may be seated praise God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah so I want to introduce you to this morning not a bitter man but a better man oh hallelujah praise God hallelujah not a big man but a better man you may be SE Hallelujah it remind me I say better man remind me of of how Samuel God talk to Samuel say Samuel how long you mour Saul I done with him I fire him he don't even know he's fired he in a position but I fire him I found a better man go and anoint one of the sons of Jesse bring out David oh David is coming all right just one more adoption Bram says hereu God is waiting trying to place his church in position to manifest himself not talk Fest not more talk we had it for 40 50 years trying to place his church to manifest himself getting one he can walk through and says there is my spirit flowing freely I can work here here get another one over here and place him I can place him adoption manifest in him take him out there put a ceremony him visit him with an angel tell him something now if he's making up something it won't work we had a lot of that I mean manifestation of the sons of God when God manifest himself he sends him out what he does he go what he says is the truth what he does is the truth what he does he manifests Christ how do you judge him by the way he associate with the ministers Association no he did not say that how do you judge him by the way he stays with the word right with the word the last quote I have here is that we have lived through Luther's age Wesley's age all down to the ages and the Pentecost of age each age is given a promise of the word and the people of that age that manifest that promised word is the seed of that age you know it's almost comical when I hear somebody pronounce somebody a shock a shock this what is shock and who shock but the prophet said the ones here the people that manifest the promised word is the seed of the age it it have no verbal manifestation sorry it doesn't have no people manifestation the people that manifest the promised word of the age is the seed of that age according to what Jesus said right here they are the children of the Kingdom that's right the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operating through children is those seeds of the kingdom of that age oh praise the name of the Lord let's sing is the life behind the name that make the demons tremble as we stand and invite God's servant to the pulpit or the jest obl all the years I've known him I've never heard him preach false Doctrine like they preaching now never heard him preach some kind of cuckoo stuff that you can't find anywhere but here it is he's going to bring forth to you the word of God it's the light behind the name that makes oh it's the light behind the late you that in all things as a man he could live so he could give give us a life behind the name it's the light behind a name that makes the demons tremble it's a life behind a name that makes the proud heart humble it was God who devis a plan that in all things as a man he could live so he could give give us the life behind the name Hallelujah let's give him praise somebody Hallelujah to the lamb we thank you we praise your holy name Amen brother o had asked me what song I would like to come up on and I thought of this old song you know because we're back to the life amen a lot of people have skirted the life you know it's good I've heard many good teachings and many good preachings but you know unless the life is there that's the only thing that's going to shake the devil's cing amen preaching won't do it amen it's the life what we need in Jeffersonville Indiana today is thousands of live not preach voices but live voices that's the Thunder that shakes the devil hallelujah amen and if we have that life the devil is finished this morning Amen Hallelujah to the lamb amen and so while we sing this one more time Hallelujah let's greet somebody amen and say good morning I know we have probably done this before this morning several times amen but it's the life behind a name that makes the demons tremble behind a name that makes the proud or humble it was God who divis a plan that in all things as a man he could live so he could live give us life behind the name it's the light behind the name that makes the demons tremble it's the life behind a name that makes the proud heart humble it was God who devised a plan that in all things as a man he could live so he could give give us the life behind the name Hallelujah to the lamb praise His wonderful name amen hallelujah God richly bless you you may be seated just a moment while I greet you how many are happy to be in the house of Li you know we go to work during the week and we're tired and weary but David said one thing have I desired of the Lord and that will I seek after amen if there was one thing that you desired some would desire a million dollars some would desire this and that but David desired to dwell in his house all the days of his life and we're so thankful that God has given us this opportunity Amen to come in his presence I greet you this morning in The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ Christ amen I want to just sincerely say that I am delighted delighted to be back in Trinidad amen hallelujah I was very touched last year uh with the fellowship and the unity of the spirit that I felt and we have got to really work on that area of the unity of the spirit you know we've got to get started and uh we know that the the unity of the spirit can only come by the spirit amen but if we can get started then God can do the rest huh amen hallelujah so but anyway I am here uh to just give a little testimony and these fine preachers that have come before me brother Peter and brother Paul I I was thinking of changing my name last night I how on Earth can I follow Peter and Paul I was just trying to make a name up or something a silus or something or you know perhaps may have been more uh more powerful but amen uh fear not it is I you know you're not in a vision amen we are in reality here amen uh you you know I like what brother Theo ID uh spoke there in the book of Acts regarding uh Paul you know he uh Paul was of course God's man and you know of course there was some suspicion around him especially when the the Scorpion had bit him but it it didn't break Paul all Str he just shook it into the fire you know and what I want to say by saying this is that the devil could label you you could either choose to wear that label or you could choose to shake it off and and by the grace of God you see that label did not stick amen and I'm I come here humbly to put my uh shoulder to the wheel and uh because I always look at a man's motive his objective what he's trying to achieve and I like how brother oid um is inclusive and there's no denomination there's no I'm always I always say I love Brotherhood Hood I'm in nobody Circle I love Brotherhood you see Brotherhood is inter uh it's an international thing yes you see because uh it's one of the things that the that one of those caterpillars and Palmer worms uh ate up you know Brotherhood and he hates Brotherhood and I'm here to make sure that I stand uh with my brother and do a fine uh ministers who are here no doubt could have could probably do a better job than I can uh today but I do want to say that I'm happy I bring you greetings from original Faith Gospel Tabernacle amen and I Hallelujah I also uh want to thank God for all the specials that went forth and um and my wife who sang um charity amen God bless you Rebecca now I know she does not want this said but I will say it because um I just feel to say it it's her birthday today amen hallelujah and she's 18 years old you know I just don't know how I get older she gets younger I just can't figure that out amen but uh you know when you stop counting birthdays is well that's as as that's how old you are when you stop we're not living in this time you know we're living in eternity so therefore I appreciate my wife and I thank her for the song Amen may God richly bless you thank you once again brother Peter for that uh uh message Adam Where Art Thou I love that where do you hide a tree I never heard that in the forest amen the time for hiding has uh come uh is come to its end and we are certainly here to declare the gospel of God we have got to to the hour is late we cannot play with God Amen God is not to be played with you see we've got to mean what we say and say what we mean and brother Paul God bless you richly uh for the uh wonderful message the manifestation of a token amen we certainly do appreciate uh you for that message and how the Holy Spirit came down uh last evening so I pray that God would say say something today that would bless his people amen it's uh we're not here to see somebody or or any particular preacher whatever we hear to hear from God Amen and I believe if we come with that expectation God will never disappoint us see because we receive what we come expecting so therefore I feel very humbled and uh and I thank God uh for for my precious brother ID we've been friends for many years and one thing I just want to say is this okay uh brother ID and I we we go way back we we've traveled uh the world in many places and uh we've had a very healthy uh friendship and one thing that I appreciate brother oit is that he's always been a friend to me amen I appreciate that very much uh in spite it's not conditional you know you have uh people sometimes that are your friend based on conditions and those conditions changed and you don't no longer can find them but brother oit has always been around and uh I appreciate your pastor may God bless him this church amen this work and may the Lord Prosper it uh we ever Prosper him and prosper this world work here on this island May uh it reflect Jesus Christ because world is Longing To See Jesus amen we have we have uh heard many ministers many fine sermons The World Is Longing To See Jesus and I believe we are living at the time of the manifestation of the sons of God they're going to see Jesus amen I will guarantee you they're going to see Jesus Hallelujah where will he be it's the Jesus in you and I praise God hallelujah it's not it won't be that we are actually professing it it will be God manifesting himself amen that's the that's the Jesus that the world wants to see right so let's stand to our feet as we go straight to the word I don't want to keep you too long I had asked your pastor how long do I have and um I always have a tendency of going over my time and I don't want to do that this morning I know we uh have meals in between services and so forth so but once again I am happy to be here I want to draw your attention uh to the Book of John uh verse 15 and also uh verse 15 St John 15 verse one St John 13 verse 34 are you ready amen amen you know my world my words can fail but God's word cannot fail and if we did nothing but read the scripture we would be blessed amen uh St John 15 uh I like this this this thought I just want to give you a little testimony just before I uh get into it this thought came to me while I was packing to come here you know I had I had some messages and things that I had preached and packed and the Lord had uh dropped this thought in my heart and I you know how you speak to the lord well I'm packing I had have no but he he he gave gave it to me so I know that uh the Lord will bless so the title of my message if I would before I forget I am the vine and ye are the branches and I like how God distinguishes that because no matter how much God we become or like God we will never be God I am the Vine and ye are the branches so we'll get into this here just a few minutes amen St John 5 and verse one I am the True Vine not just a Vine but the True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that uh beareth fruit he purged it that it may bring forth more fruit so therefore don't worry about the trials and tribulations you have a few little fruits here and there God wants more fruit than he's going to purge it amen because he wants more fruit from you amen the trials of this life is more precious than gold amen and now ye are cleansed through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch oh listen to this as a branch cannot bear fruit of it itself amen except it abide in the vine now therefore you cannot join the vine you cannot uh you have to be born into the vine amen no man uh no more can ye except ye abide in me now let's read that again as a branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the Vine no more can ye except ye abide in me I am the vine and ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth uh forth much fruit for oh listen to this for without me ye can do nothing amen amen oh I like that position without him we could do nothing amen amen we could try be a good Christian but without him we can do nothing amen amen because God this is fruit time and uh sea time bride time and I believe that we are all looking for the same thing and we're all striving for the same thing uh but we have to use God's way of doing it see Hallelujah there's no other way uh to bring forth fruit he said I am the vine ye are the branches so therefore if a man abided not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burnt if now here's the condition of this promise if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you hearing oh my herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples amen St John Chapter 13 if we just go back two verses or two chapters rather St John Chapter 13 and verse 34 Verse 34 a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another now listen to to this next these next few words as I have loved you that ye also love one another now God's love is the highest form of love we know amen and he wants us to love one another as he also Lov us I'm not talking about ailio conditional love I'm talking about an agapo love amen amen as we are reaching and approaching that great headstone amen amen the stone of power the stone uh which the builders have rejected and refused has become The Headstone of the corner amen it's the universal Unconditional Love That Remains the Same regardless amen of circumstances and situations amen that is how he loved us am and by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if you have love one for another amen may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word let us just bow our heads in a word of prayer our heavenly father we have read your word Lord Glory any man who can read English and can read this Bible can read the context of it father but Lord we ask that the author father who wrote the word Lord would come down Among Us Lord and reveal the context Lord and reveal the meaning and reveal Lord to us that which you have in store for us this morning Lord we take ourselves out of the way and father we ask that you would bless your people and may the spirit of allmighty God move from uh cheer to cheer Heart to Heart father down in the uh basement in the lower level and out in the uh uh uh The Yards father may your spirit uh be felt all over the place father for we know that there's a prophecy that went forth this in itself shall make uh come to pass the tremendous victory in love divine father so we don't seek another message we don't seek another revelation we don't seek another anything this in itself shall make make Hallelujah come to pass a tremendous victory in love divine so we're looking for the tremendous Victory father God victory over ourselves victory over uh Lord anything that would keep us from dashing into the uh presence of almighty God so we ask that you would take control of this service and we ask it in The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you you may be seated amen well over the years I have become a slow starter uh but I trust that God would uh kick us into another gear just shortly here I have to uh I'm not as young as I used to be as you know I I used to run the pulpit all around and I still do that from time to time but uh the point I want to make today is really uh as I said the title I am the vine and you are the branches you know the prophet said that uh God had a beautiful bride tree yes sir on the day of Pentecost amen that was a wonderful tree signs wonders and miracles was was was Vindicated you know I mean God I mean he didn't just have a church that he called the church God himself went with them everywhere working amen these signs and wonders and miracles amen and no Apostle no teacher at that time anybody who was placed uh in the body of Christ and God was using them never ever took credit for anything that God did amen so if that be the case God is looking for a group of people God is looking for a bride that will come back to a place where we can get out of the way and God can use us in a way that he used the First Apostolic church amen I I I think I just think that we just get in the way sometime amen and when we learn how to get it out of the way then God can move and do the things that he promised to do Amen brother BR said what is a gift a gift is to know how to get out of the way praise His Wonderful Name Hallelujah they were spirit filled and word fed I like that spirit filled and word fed the word of God that was in Jesus Jus Christ amen who fed them amen for three and A2 years or so in his ministry and even though they didn't understand all the things that he was speaking but yet they were fed and it went in in a form of a seed oh listen you may say I don't understand what's going on you don't have to understand you have to just believe what God is saying hallelujah he never said do you understand he said Do You Believe amen and faith in amen the right attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass because God said so glory be to God explain that to me preacher I cannot explain it amen I just believe it because God said so there's going to be a Dynamics Revival God said so there's going to be manifestation of sons of God God said so I can't explain it praise God but I believe it because God T off glory be to God the world wants an explanation but let me tell you something I don't have an explanation but I have a faith in my heart praise God I like what the brother said one time I'm not here to wait for something to happen I'm here to make something happen glory be to God if we can get started then God can do the rest amen hallelujah amen glory be to to God she's spirit filled and word fed oh my think of it God all that God was he poured it into Christ hallelujah amen and Christ we know according to brother brandom how he spoke he said that Christ was the mystery of God revealed all that was in Christ all that was in God rather he poured it into Christ so he walked the Earth as a mystery they wanted to know who God was they had to go through Christ because he was unfolding that great mystery he came in the volume of the book Hallelujah hey glory be to God and brother Bram said he was a Mystic to the world so if he was a Mystic to the world Amen we today are all that Christ was he pours it into the church so then we are the mystery of Christ revealed and if he was a Mystic to the world so will we be Mystics to the worlden hallelujah hallelujah amen I like that now amen as we getting warmed up now praise God the same Spirit life that was in Jesus now I'm referring to those that were baptized with the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost amen I don't know what your teaching is what people may be preaching today but I believe in a good good old fashion back to God Holy Ghost Revival have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed amen back to the original Bible back to the apostolic teaching back to where the uh word of God is laying praise God hallelujah hey you know what brother R said it was the theme of every Apostle and if you are an apostle or you claim to be an apostle you've got to preach the same thing have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe amen hallelujah the Holy Ghost will change your life the Holy Ghost will change your walk the Holy Ghost will change your attitude glory be to God the Holy Ghost is fire fire fire our Natures need to be changed glory be to God glory be to God hallelujah oh my Glory that's what I want amen listen you can say anything you're this and you're that and you're this and you're that but what happens when a young man amen Falls and trips and say oh and and he made that and they heard in the convention amen that they were this on now does God fail God cannot fail what they should be saying Hallelujah is have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe that's where you've got to get started oh hallelujah amen glory be to God you know I haven't changed you know I sorry you may be you may be seated in a moment but we talking about Spirit life Spirit life amen the same life that was in Jesus flowing through the predestinated vine uh branches these branches were not on the tree they were born into the tree and brother brandom said if this bride tree ever bring forth another Branch it'll write another book of Acts behind her Hallelujah let me tell you the original Branch the early church they had the fruits they had the leaves they had the bark they had the sap life amen all of these things were working in harmony amen hallelujah and one beautiful thing that I like amen that uh the brother was mentioning it yesterday amen how God could so Tabernacle his people where they can say they can take notice that they have been with Jesus now you don't even have to say anything see we think that we are are are identifying ourselves by saying things it's not what you say is how you live that's a life that's that that's the that's what shakes the devil Hallelujah that's what shakes the devil Hallelujah you know you remember when Jesus was passing through the tombs amen those Devils shouted out oh Jesus have you come before uh to cast us out before time they recognize that he was Messiah hallelujah amen and God is going to have a church amen hallelujah with the same Spirit The Same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead shall dwell in a bride amen glory be to God that's what I believe we've got to keep it balanced you know amen hallelujah amen so therefore they had Joy amen they had Joy oh yes they did there's a lot of people don't believe in Joy today it's okay well if they don't believe in Joy let them not believe in Joy but they had Joy how many believe they had Joy how many still have joy amen hallelujah they had signs they had wonders they had miracles amen hallelujah but you see what I want you to understand amen but all of these things took place because there was a source of energy that was beyond themselves amen and the source the power the energy amen was in theine the life that Jesus had was in the vine if you abide in me and my words abide in you you will have that energy to do the things that he said that we would do glory be to God but you've got to abide in the vine glory be to God hallelujah amen that's just that's Zoe you know amen eternal life there's only one form of eternal life amen that's Zoe that's the life of Christ amen that's a life of of Elohim he had no beginning he had no end hallelujah amen and listen when you're filled with the Holy Ghost he fills you with Zoey and you can no more die than God himself can die glory be to God because in you is eternal life you come from God and you go back to God again glory be to God heyen we better start to testifying about that you know you know the we have got to brother said if we confess our uh the what we believe confess it amen that God takes that confession and he can uh be touched by the hearing by the feeling of our infirmities and he hears our confession then God has to intercede for what you just said you put God on the spot amen God shall deliver me God shall heal me you are positive that's your confession you're not negative you're speaking it amen because you're speaking his word now if it wasn't his word then he has he's no he's not obligated to that but if it's his word then he said oh my God hallelujah I'm going to make intercession for that son I'm going to make intercession for that daughter oh Hallelujah and watch God come down because he's backing up his word amen amen hallelujah glory be to God this Vine was a great source of uh Power Hallelujah Jesus made it very clear and let us never forget this church he said I am the vine and you are the branches Hallelujah to the lamb without me ye can can do nothing I like that you know why it puts God in his place and it puts me in my place hey Hallelujah that means me without God I am finished god without me he's still God glory be to God hallelujah which means that God does not need you me he's still God hallelujah oh praise God hallelujah he's still God Amen Hallelujah he's still in the fiery furnace today he's in the fiery furnace there's a song that was sung by somebody I heard some time ago and he says I heard long ago how how the fourth man come into fire and he ask his mama this is according to the lyrics where is that Fourth Man today he said he's still in the fire man he's still there he's in the fire that of trials that you're going through let me tell you something Hallelujah you don't even have the strength to hold on to God you're not holding on to him he's holding on to you oh Hallelujah because you're predestinated before the foundation of the world glory be to God Amen he has never lost one not one amen do the calculations brother Isaac that's 100% he never failed he's still the Undisputed heavyweight champion of the world what's his name Jesus and that's that's the person I'm here to brag about I'm here to brag about Jesus amen amen let's continue oh my hey brother it's been a long time since I've been worn out you wear me out already praise God hallelujah amen but I feel theol Holy Spirit moving amen hallelujah glory be to God but now listen the vine continues to live amen amen see even if uh uh without the branch if a branch should fall off that Branch dries up this is why I say never leave the word of God never leave the original message that was brought to us as from Malachi 4 never leave that praise God because it's keeping you alive who would have thought who would have thought 2016 when the world is going crazy you know that world is going crazy everybody everybody's shooting everybody out back in the States I'm not even going to get in into that this world is insane but who kept you amen it hasn't been my strength I tell you that amen the Lord is chasing me sore but he's not giving me over to death praise God that's why I love him that's why I praise him that's why I glorify him hey Hallelujah Glory we have to be dependent on the Holy Spirit not act like we're co-equal with him amen we have to be dependent on the Holy Spirit glory be to God and the acts of the early church was because Jesus this energy was in the Holy Spirit was in them okay my you have to abide in him and he in you the branch comes forth Amen to bring forth fruit leaves amenallah fruits listen I I've seen too many branches without Hallelujah fruit even without leaves you you know the leaves brother say it's Pentecostal clapping their hands but you see I I want to let you know that the leaves are still part of the tree when he restores something he doesn't just restored up to the fruit and get rid of everything below because now we're in Fruit time that's how you hear a lot of doctrines like that oh we have the fruit we don't need the leaves and they sit there dead as dead can be amen but let me tell you have you seen a tree amen that has a little fruit on the top and you can't even sit under it and get some shade the leaves is still part of the tree glory be to God hallelujah amen glory be to God it had leaves it had the fruit praise God and it had most of all the life now listen amen the original life amen that was in theine hallelujah hallelujah manifest it the fruit of identification amen I'm talking about original Branch you want to know what a tree is the Bible says by their fruits you shall know so the fruit identifies the tree and the branch cannot do anything without the vine so there must be some Supernatural power pushing out pushing out pushing through the branch pushing through the branch the next thing you know hey here's a little leaf come out amen thank God for the leaf you may not have the fruit yet but thank God for the leaf here keep pushing out and there's another Leaf comes out don't worry but God Amen can will keep on pushing and keep on pushing until the fruit is made manifest and then that will identify what that tree is Hallelujah Jesus said the fruit you shall know them see the fruit identifies the life in the branch and herein is my father glorified he in other words he loves fruits when we bear much fruit he's glorified the fruit is not glorified when we bear much fruit than he is glorified Hallelujah because that's what he put the tree there for to bear fruit that he may be glorified amen and this is why I said praise God let's sing that song it's a life behind the name amen it's time that we uh Focus back in that life amen hallelujah that life that comes that is actually in the vine and ye are the branches amen the see see because the bride see this is bride time and the shuck is dead and the Virgin word this is Virgin word time see back to the Bible back to the original now you can be seated because I want to read this quote that will probably help you uh uh because I I'm not just speaking from uh my mind here I just want you to understand where I'm getting this from amen that way you understand now the vine doesn't bear fruit does it he's asking a question what was he talking to the church I am the vine and ye are the branches the branches is energized by the life of the vine am Hallelujah I'm getting somewh here now therefore Jesus had no lips tonight on Earth but mine and yours am amen so you see he needs a body he needs amen he has no hands but mine and yours and he energizes us and we bring forth his life as he brings it through us whether in preaching the gospel by lips or seeing visions by eye see whether it whatever it is laying hands on the sick remember there's an energy behind that Hallelujah whatever it is is Christ working through the branch of his church every office listen every office literally electrified by his presence he said isn't it wonderful here we are now it's either uh told I either told the truth or a lie if I've told a lie God will never have anything to do with a lie see you know that see if I've told the truth then God is obligated to vindicate that truth amen so therefore we are speaking about see Christ was working through the branch of his church he has a church and every office and every in every Church there are offices and he put some Apostles some teachers some evangelists some prophets etc etc etc you know that that has absolutely nothing to do with man amen that's that's the work of God Hal work of God and we're all striving to be positionally placed pushing hoping and you know uh HH we're in birth pains as it were but you see this branch that I'm talking about and this uh Vine the vine literally electrifies the branch amen now if you notice the branch is energized by the life that's in the vine yes sir the branch has has no power in itself remember without the vine you are nothing so if a miracle takes place it wasn't a branch it was a life that come through the vine and into the branch that's the energy amen that God places in his church and in every office amen I'm talking about the Dynamics amen that uh Hallelujah that knows how to turn the word on for too long the word has been off you know amen sure God sent a prophet amen and he did uh God used him to do Mighty works like he's we have never seen and uh previous generations nor this generation but isn't it amazing that you go on YouTube and you find oldtimers oldtimers I don't want to listen to some of these young guys that going around putting their their their testimonies about what brother Bram all the errors are you kidding me there's no errors in brother Brown's message that mean look look look don't tell me there's an error tell me you misunderstood or you don't have any understanding there is no error in this message this message is Vindicated Hallelujah this message comes from God and goes back to God again praise God hallelujah amen brother brandom said you may silence this body but you never silenced his voice amen hallelujah what is that voice that voice is the holy spirit that's on the earth now calling the people back to the word of God glory be to God hallelujah oh I feel like preaching now come on now hey hey hey hey hey hey hey glory to God listen I want to tell you something we should all learn the message because brother Bram said in the church ages amen some of these ages lasted for hundreds of years and the messenger was long gone but they were still under the anointing of their messenger Hallelujah which means there's nobody that can f there's nobody that can make it more clear Hallelujah and this Malachi 4 was to do two things this Malachi 4 was to do two things amen reveal the seven Thunders amen and restore the faith back to the apostolic fathers two things but it will be these uh divinely reveal truths that will literally I was telling a brother some time ago I said you know what you preach just Prophet we preach Vindicated Prophet Hallelujah because a prophet was Vindicated by the revelation of the Seven Seals that made him St Luke 17:30 H that made him uh Revelations 10:7 Hallelujah in the days of The Voice the mystery of God should be finished finished what don't people understand what finish means should I should I Define it or something finito finished glory be to God they call me a while man but listen I'm a zealous for this word amen it has never misguided me it has kept me amen hallelujah amen Hallelujah why amen the branch praise God now listen the branch is the body the church brother brand up said amen so in this body the Holy Ghost uses our lips our hands and so forth you see and Christ is working through every branch and every office literally electrified by the presence of God amen amen amen hallelujah amen amen every office that's Pastor evangelist every office Apostle teacher could you imagine you walk into an office it's labeled Apostle is labeled evangelist you walk in open the door that's your office just making a natural illustration here you turn on the light the light don't turn on and you still go in there and sit and work in the dark you try the outlets doesn't work but you insist in saying in this office because you think this office is yours but when God has put in the church Apostles teachers evangelist whatever I'm going to tell you something there be know they walk in that office flip that switch there is a man that can turn on the light every office will be electrified with the power of God Vindicated praise God as I have often said it takes a whole lot more than going out to the print shop and printing your business card and say you an apostle you are a teacher and so forth oh the the the prin can say it but God has got to say there is my spirit flowing freely there's another one over there I have tried him I have proven him amen he has gone through great trials but there he is there's a son like me he has the right attitude he has the right Behavior glory be to God and we are not there yet but we're striving striving to be positionally plac Place glory be to God striving to be positionally placed amen so you see when uh some you can be seated if you can a moment amen listen there cannot be listen there cannot be amen an apostle and a teacher whatever God has to vindicate that himself no man can do that but God himself and just to show you that it has nothing to do with men pet Peter had a great idea yes the fall of uh Judas well we need to replace the office and they selected a good man you see Maas good man nothing wrong with you know fine brother he was a fine Brother fine brother and uh so you know they thought they had it all set oh we finally got 12 all of the sudden news come come news flash you know Saul was arrested Saul of Tarsus huh are you kidding me he had papers to arrest the early church yes yes he went out to get authorization from his denomination to kill out everything that was interrupting the Comforts of that day and what happened is while he went with these papers God looked at these papers and laughed because God had another paper Paul there's a warrant for your arrest Hallelujah glory be to God hallelujah there's an there's a warrant for your arrest and he did not know anything about it amen and he was riding his horse riding his horse riding his horse and boom wow what did he run into he ran into the pillar of fire he ran into the power that's in divine oh Hallelujah glory be to God amen amen hallelujah man chose maias but God chose Paul Glory Hallelujah glory be to God Amen Hallelujah and the hardest thing was for to convince uh uh ananas and ananas I have a man I want you to pray for yes Lord who who is he sa who Saul you mean the murderer you mean the one that has come to arrest me and put everybody in jail same one not another one Hallelujah listen he may not have been qualified like brother Raymond said hey but he was chos that that is why Paul the Apostle said Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ not by the will of man but the will of God hallelujah glory be to God if God adopts you if God places you don't expect man to be on your side but as long as he's on your side Jesus of Nazareth approved of God hey I want to be approved of God glory be to God hallelujah hey hey hey oh it's a long time since I've amen was able to shout and glorify God it's a long time but I know where I'm standing I know where I'm going this is a manifestation of the sons of God glory be to God Amen brother Cloud praise God glory be to God we got to get to that place we've got to get to that place amen don't let a devil shake you from it don't let a demon shake you from it have your eyes on the prize amen glory be to God Amen the responsibility the responsibility now is on the bride they without us cannot be made perfect we have got to come to Perfection amen not it would be nice to come to Perfection we've got to come to Perfection hey Hallelujah Glory hey Glory hallelujah hallelujah amen said that to tell you this I don't care what you've done I don't care how much you feel you're unqualified Hey listen amen uh uh we have a plan and God has a plan and his plan is very different than our plan Hallelujah as long as there's breath in your body there is God hallelujah who can Implement his plan and it's contrary to man's thinking and and I finally responded Lord this man is this man no he was that but I'm I I I I have chosen him and I will show him what things he must suffer for my name's sake Hallelujah you know where he sent them he sent them to Straight Street I like that street because the first thing you have to when you come to the Lord go to Straight Street get your life straightened out get all the Crooked places straight straight straight straight straight straight straight straight and he told ananas where to find him Hal Hallelujah to the lamb and what I like here's the bomb here's the bomb here's the bomb he said he brother Saul no more enemy saw but brother saw hey Hallelujah he didn't ask anybody else he didn't go to the uh amen corporate headquarters he had a revelation that he was a brother in spite of all that he did hallelujah hallelujah amen Glory Hallelujah the Dynamics come to get the ball rolling amen hallelujah that's the word turned on Hallelujah the D the Dynamics is the word turned on watch what happens when the word is turned offen that's when the devil the shake you know oh then cripples walk in the blind see and the dead is raised up because it's not you it's a life that's in the vine oh thank you thank you and the word is turned on this morning Hallelujah glory be to God Amen the Dynamics of this church what will it be a refilling of the same original measure that come down on the day of Pentecost amen the same fing the same Holy Ghost glory be to God hallelujah amen oh listen to me Hallelujah glory be to God Amen God takes his man but never his spirit amen the spirit that was on Paul oh is here today the spirit that was upon brother brandom is here today the spirit that was upon Apostles in the form of the Holy Ghost is here today who is that Spirit that's the angel of God the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah hey Hallelujah hey hallelujah amen hallelujah I'm going to close with this musicians I ran out of time my watch is telling me I ran out of time amen but I want to tell you something I believe with all my heart hallelujah amen I believe with all my heart uh uh let me just read this statue of a perfect man now in building The Virtue the building this Monument this building this statue see it starts off with the foundation stone Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience God brotherly kindness now what does it do do then they're waiting hallah for the headstone which is love for God is love and listen and he controls he controls control no no Bishop in another country not this church he controls Hallelujah and he is our head he controls and he is the strength of every one of these things he was referring to Faith virtue knowledge temp patience you know that's the electrifying power that brings down virtue through your virtues I have I have to I have to just read one more thing one more thing because I want to show you something amen just one more thing for the oit is that all right just one more thing amen hallelujah amen I was telling our church you know when you go to Africa different places you can't preach an hour they'll pull you right back into the pulpit and I'm beginning to feel that way now oh my you know but amen there's a one more thing I wanted to just uh drop in God bless you richly amen you see that is my belief but I have to stay with this word amen this original word which cannot fail you see and all that we have benefited from and we appreciate let me just say this we appreciate every every man of God everybody that have uh went before us to help us better understand certain things we have to salute yes sir and give credit to where credits do I would like to I would like to believe in staying on the positive side we are better people today for the works of of many of these brothers some will say oh we're we're worse whatever but we are better people you know why we're wiser every trial comes your way to teach us a lesson oh we know things today that we didn't know years ago and it can only make you stronger it can only make you more mature it can get you only closer to God Almighty amen hallelujah amen but anyway I what I was looking I just can't find it right now but what I was looking at at uh when brother brandham I often wondered in my heart when brother brandham was giving the testimony hallu of the resurrection of that little fish I want you to catch that now the resurrection of that little fish Hallelujah little fishy I give you your life I always wondered why he tied in the voices to that experience but if you read it and you could study it and you know this story is true he said that the Lord told him that there was going to be a resurrection of some creature see so now just before that happened listen brother Bram said an anointing an energy come down on the lake yes it was so powerful Hallelujah that those that were with him felt oh it is good to be here is they almost felt that they were being raptured but what did Brother Braham said he said I couldn't keep from uttering those voices and he said it wasn't me it was the uh Vine using the branches using the the Church of the Living God that anointing is here now by the grace of almighty God and that is my testimony amen everywhere I go listen I am not afraid to say seven Thunders give Faith seven Thunders is a bride's Revival because brother brandham said that and I SC cannot skirt around that praise God whatever it is it it is Gospel truth even though uh you may have your opinion about it this and that I don't care it's going to happen because it was spoken amen and it's going to be some people say well we have Revival all along amen but I'm not talking about this you wait till them Thunders utter their voices to that group that can take the word with God a and hand it there it'll slice and cut and everything else but listen you have got to have the right character before he entrusts you with that sword amen or else you'll cut the ear off I want to let you know there's nothing humanistic about what is about to take place right it's totally spiritual Peter said I'll die for you oh really amen I'll go to the death for you I believe he was honest but he lacked the power to do it Hallelujah and the only thing he had was a sword and he cut the ear off Peter put your sword away amen he that uses a sword will die by this sword amen hallelujah and even Jesus told pontious pilot if my kingdom was of this world my people would fight I want to let you know your kingdom is not of this world so don't get in a fight with people who are trying to get you in a fight love your brother love your sister amen it doesn't mean you agree with them but love them anyhow be a better person I like what the Bible says he I I love him because he first that's a big word for me he first today we say oh I'll love him if we have a whole list of things that we want people to make right what if God had a whole list on you I love him because he first loved us with what kind of love it wasn't filial amen it wasn't conditional amen amen it was a gopp love unconditional and that proves and shows that we are expressing the right character and the right Behavior we don't hate anybody we love everybody and everywhere I have gone I have pre I have had to preach what my conviction is but at the end of the day you know what one thing that shook me several months ago and to tell you something I was listening to a tape uh across the banit of time and brother Braham said beyond the curtain of time brother Bram said nothing but perfect love we we'll make it there he didn't just make that statement he said listen to me thus sayith the Lord he said because there is nothing but perfect teaching perfect Revelation so in spite of whatever it is that we believe whatever we've got to come back to that perfect loveall and that put A New Perspective in my uh understanding that's right amen the Bible says love your enemies amen it didn't say you're not going to have enemies because you have to have enemies to love not that you make them enemies but I've met some people they're predestinated to hate you that that's just about it they don't like you they're not impressed with you I mean you can do Somers Sals back flips anything else you can preach the fire of God down by the grace of God they just don't like you that's not you see and that is your trial to love him to love the unlovable when God tell me something when we were in the world and when we were not even in a position even thinking of God his mind was full of us his mindful he was mindful of us his mind was full of us and he thought and he loved us in our condition only God could do that and not only only God can do that but he's trying to teach his church too love the same way because here is I'm going to close now you uh brother are you going to uh uh you know I'm just uh I do this all the time I'm sorry somebody in the field was counting how many times I said I'm going to close out I think it was eight times or so but listen this let me get back to the scripture a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another amen as I have loved you you that ye also love one another and by this Hallelujah Hallelujah by this by what by this love that we express by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples amen if he have uh love one for another another I'm closing with that God bless you let us remember friends we living in a strange time we're living in a time that you know there's a lot of different opinions and things like that but there is a truth as as sure as there is counterfeit as sure as there's error whatever some are uh well we have to remember to pray for one another because if it wasn't for the grace of God we too would be in a situation that we cannot so it just helped me to understand that we must love one another the fighting and all the name calling and that's not God let me tell you something that's not God a brother a brother uh he put me on a group text just before I left New York I didn't ask him to put me in a group text but he did and uh in WhatsApp some of you know the ministers know that uh what's what's up app so the next thing I hear is D ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding I said wait what is going on here how dare you post that on my page I did not post that on your page I'm going to call the police okay call the police you have I call my lawyer huh is this a is this a come on is this where we have come down to when the son of man cometh will he find faith on the earth I asked somebody some time ago I said you know when the son of man cometh I'd like to I'd like to uh hope that he finds anybody at all you see we are doing sometimes the devil's work and when we do the devil's work then the devil don't have to do that part the devil is working sure but let's let's let's put him back to work Satan there's an opening there's a job
