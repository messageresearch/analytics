the for Jesus Christ have your we I pray in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen you love him designed amen god bless you and welcome if of your Bibles I like it a turn to Acts chapter 19 the wall I read verse 1 to 6 I want to read Matthew chapter 5 one verse verse six and also Matthew chapter 25 really from who's wanted the team first quickly reading tonight reading from acts 19 first one came the past while Apollo's was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper course to came to Ephesus and financed certain disciples he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since he believed and they said to him we have not so much as food any illegals he said unto them under what then were you baptized they said unto John baptism and then said Paul then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance seen and unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus and when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and when paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they speak with tongues and prophesied so this Holy Ghost that came upon him was an experience that he received it was an explanation it was not teaching it was not edification and trying to show them what inside of them it was an experience that I receive and from Matthew 5:6 he said blessed Adi which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled our last scripture from chapter 25 of Matthew then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom five of them Elias five of foolish D that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried and the oil slumbered and slept at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answered and said saying not so pleased there not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and a door was shut afterwards came also the other virgins in Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily unto you I know you not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh may God bless his word you may be seated or praise the Lord yes aw always a privilege for me to be in the house of God first I come into God's presence and be looking forward to see what low' will do tonight our title tonight bright material wise vigils strange combination of words but which see what will or will do bright material wise verges have a context scripture and this is from Acts chapter 5 eat by reading from verse 5 Acts chapter 8 from verse 5 then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them what did he preached Christ unto them and the people with one Accord give heed unto those things which Philip speak hearing and seeing the miracles which he did for unclean spirits crime but a loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with policies and that will lean were healed and there was great joy in that city so this was hopeful it was preaching the gospel this is all the world was being confirmed this is all the acts 16 was getting into accent oh praise got another scripture we harvest from sin john 12 verse 22 24 and there was it in Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast the same came there for the philip which was of the taste of galilee and desired him saying sir we would see Jesus and Philip cometh and telleth Andrew and Andrew and Philip tell jesus and jesus answered them saying they always come that the Son of man should be glorified verily well I sent you except a corner wheat fall into the ground and die it a battle own but if I died bring it forth much fruit oh praise God so he ready to smoke tonight okay let's go no this is from silver see Jesus where I'm saying some stuff he said knowing that there was some God somewhere told many Greeks and they had thousands of them that they worshipped the hood of a historical quad that none miracles and among the Hebrews and I also heard that this God that used to be a miracle book in Hebrew God was over here in the land with them again so it attracted the attention so they came to see Jesus now notice usually the way people want to find Jesus is to find somebody who knows how to take them to him a leader or one of his servants is do we define him there we go so Jesus if he ever chooses a servant he always chooses somebody that will bring the people to him because it is his purpose to serve the people now they brought unto his presence and I guess into his presence these Greeks Philip they consulted Philip and Philip said no here is someone that wants to see our Lord so it wouldn't be just right for me to have the honor to introduce these Greece to my lord I'll go get Alan's you to go with me so they went got Andrew Andrew and Philip boat came and presented these Greeks to Jesus now here is a greeting and a text that's unusual just as soon as these Greeks was pointed to Jesus Jesus did not point to himself oh this is big you know I know you notice already but this is what Jesus did not point to himself nor did he make himself known to them because you cannot know Jesus in that way jesus is known in that way we see in the scripture that when these Greeks brought brought up to Jesus and won in his presence it looked like Jesus could have said well I am the Messiah of Jewish race has been predicted by the prophets by inspiration down to the cemeteries and I am here now and I am born of Nazareth I'm a Jewish of a Jewish mother my father is God I'm here to make myself known to you Greeks no that would be more like the 1961 version of it but look as soon here we go as they are brought in his presence that's the main thing get the people in his presence and as soon as in his presence jesus said except a corn of wheat falls into the ground and die it abideth on what an unusual thing instead of accepting the introduction the thing he done was to point them to the place where they could find him except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abides alone what did he do here he pointed them to that great truth how to see him they could not see him in the way of eternal life just stand-in there though he was he was a man but he pointed them dear in his presence Christ pointed them to the truth he said to see him was to go to the cross that is where it is at at the cross except a corner it falls in is a basil oil and if he did not die he would have to abide alone himself if he did not die but him being a corner week that fell into the ground and then if it falls him to the ground he said it will bring forth abundance it will fall into the ground and dies first it had to be a zoomit eyes green or glory to God what he meant is watch if I live my life alone and die this way I just live my life alone well then there is no food after me here we go I already but if I fall into the ground under the will of God I will bring forth a new bullet and that new birth will bring forth another nobility and another new birth until the whole world will be missionary and gospel preached so he was pointing them that the cross will produce the new birth because his water blood and spirit said of cross will release the ingredients to produce the new built whole glory of God and the new blood spreading from one to another who glory to God so that is right porker asks a question have you received the Holy Ghost since we believe because you're supposed to receive it after you believe or glory to God not when you believe after you believe you receive something to confirm you have faith in what you have received as belief or doodlee that glory to God so listen this now so if we ourselves in our ministry you know what thoughts are in our life if we are bad as we are we can do no good we got to also die at the altar or we will live alone we will live to some other denomination or some Creed we will live to some organization but if we die to ourselves then the Holy Spirit here people will be spread for everywhere by our lips we have got to die all glory to God what happened Peterman's at the house of Cornelius while Peter yet speak these words the Holy Ghost fell upon them that heard the word and they were baptized with the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost was coming out in my mouth out of the lips by the word of God being spoken so the world coming out the man mount and go taking a wood and trapping the spirit straight long in the people's heart being baptized by the Holy Ghost this is what God promised in the last days we believe that all right so we must realize Oklo be we must realize that we have got to die in order to bring forth new life this not read this book or document these not listen to tape and press and plainly not attend this is different this is you understand that you have to die you have to die - what you think - what you feel though you opinion and the ideas you have to get rid of that and say Lord kill me that the self that tell your human spirit die hallelujah you have to come to the spot where your hunger and untwisting after righteousness you can't stand the world no more because it will sit for something higher and to even get there you have to be blessed not everybody have that blessing you know if you are hungry for God tonight you are blessed you actually men dysley blessed and this hour here with all them Devils loose all the hell binding the people up and you free to be hungry none tested for God you shall be filled you have no question about it you shall be filled or glory to God bless her that day that hunger and kiss after righteousness it means you are unclean out it means you give in lumens is for God Oh hallelujah you can be filled with your thoughts and filled with the Holy Ghost to fill with you always and sleep with only goes to you're always that again boot out your totally get boot out your ways as they get boot out and then there's a space inside a dear for that white light to pass through your being or glory the quarter leave a portion of himself inside of here know what I said you have no ready for that white like the past Russia and drop a spark inside idea Oh hallelujah let's go now so we must realize that we have to die in order to bring forth the new life he said so much in this if you want to see me you must die you'll come to this Tabernacle no joint Church you have to die to see him or glory the God says you want to see what he passed oh Jesus we want to see Jesus and Jesus pointed away you will see him at the cross Oh glory to God you see people people want a priest because they don't want to die when Cannavale come Monday on Tuesday Nov badoon they jump in and

now the other nice priests who give me a thing to stimulate your head on top here but nothing written through here because going to come for here you know the devil the devil a stake here but God has come to take here that very first thing goes our new house I'll give you I think of Gastonia I'll give you a heart of flesh that corrupt yatta have this wicked you know you have a heart towards me what have to give your operation and change your heart to give you a hat towards him you ain't ready yet without half you just have a hat to turn towards them so no you have to give you a new spirit you have to chop fire and sanctify your own spirit that spirit you have your time agree with your wife with a neighbor with the boss yeah thankee of critical what kind of demons and that human spirit he can't live with that you have to sanctify that you give me a new spirit a spirit out to work with the holy spirit or get the Lord a shout new spirit is still not the Holy Spirit yet although he has

you want to see him if you ever expect to see him if you you will never see him by joining a church or some book of laws or keep some crease you soon you will see him when you die not when you believe this doctrine and the briefest option can I believe this doctrine are you that is it I know unbelievers no I am NOT big believers now I'm talking about the seed church and in deceive Church have two classes why is vision and foolish vision so we're not talking about poop room I will say Putin Russia Catholic Church we not talk madam we love my Pentecostal Baptists we talk about the message people some staying back to assist others in the Tribulation Period and some going up you know you have to decide which you wonder join or wish you want to get involved with if you will become right material because boy I will cut your clock until is the right kind of cloth you have to become right material I only get the bread material you can lay it out and then bring the scissors because you're dropping no room I'll just wrap yourself in some old clothes it is not working so you have to get cut this material will be cut so if you think you will sit down intact as you are in your human spirit so perfect and so normal as you complete your dead wrong that are working now I know this is not the Canada for people like what is the enzyme evangelism is shaping spoons because a spoon is a confession a spoon as a rock no Johanna relation that's a wrap but they have to be cut to be fitted in God's program to be fitted in the bully go shut or glory glory to the Lord a show after going Claudio the loudest there's a swap Mac Holy Spirit you have to be cut to fit in there and go out to find you're worthy to be cut well let me change those words or to be placed or put in your place of trying oh god help me tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah considered worthy to be put into your place of trying not everybody go in there people mr. Schine you don't miss a Chinese Jesus was led by the Holy Ghost after he was filled with the fullness of the power of God the Spirit led him into the wilderness he wasn't doing nonsense and stumbling to the wilderness the spirit say go so he didn't know what is presently leading straight into the wilderness because he had a visibly Shifa you have to overcome the lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life before power is released him from ministry we say some things tonight did you get what I'm saying before he could get power from ministry he happens to overcome self not overcome in a group where they see a man of this will you know when he came to Satan the Bible says he returned in the power of the Spirit hallelujah to find a structure to manifest the word for yahwah or get a lot of shout he can't just manifest anything you have to find where it is written the Spirit is upon me and it was all glory the corner we have a promise revelation 2017 the spirit and the bride before the bride becomes the word identified what Gloria's got the spirit leads the bridal to the wilderness to overcome Lucifer or glory we have to overcome Lucifer because he set his kingdom on this earth and we about to preach the kingdom of God therefore we have to have backing from the kingdom and the kingdom must be within you and the kingdom is not a word or gay the Lord a shout the kingdom is nothing with the kingdom is in power and you shall receive power when after the Holy Ghost come upon you honey tend to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers to do what to bring down the Holy Ghost or give the Lord a shout the object of the faith is to do I have a nice Church no to bring down the Holy Ghost sobota Berlin says them disciples before they did anything they took these Greeks into the presence of Jesus I like that in the presence but in the teaching and the presence I had a doctrine in the book and if you Rosita's this see new fellowship then many presents yet we have not body missing body but not presence Oh hallelujah you see what I'm saying that is si Mussina possible dicey Messina pasta Creed that's the same as Saint eleméry unto our Father that makea Catholic does he say Mass in all of that God want you to come into his presence not the presence of the pastor his presence the pastor has to get in his presence - I'm not hearing you tonight everybody after coming to his presence Oh glory to God hallelujah Oh glory to God let's go watch and they took these Greeks into the presence of Jesus and if he's the same like Obama if he's the same yes is them forever he will have to act the same today if you are brought into his presence disciples today is so much different today they bring you to some other place to some church some organization some doctrine laws we believe it so watch but never get you into the presence of Christ there we go almost done this afoot in part a real true disciple would bring you right straight into the presence of Christ are you ready and from dear Christ will show you what you had to do alright let's cut you know so we could get you here question but a Balam are the five foolish virgins of much each one if I counted as the Gentile remnant I understand that the five foolish virgins were saved but have to go through the great revelation period is this correct if so what will be the final destination could there be the sheet that was divided from goats and matter 25 worms it a pretty good to loot illusion you see he said now that they are the remnant the sleeping version is the remnant spoke of in Revelation of the woman's seed that keeps the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ a woman will take a piece of goods which clot and lay it down and she takes a pattern unless anywhere she desires which way she's going to cut that and then when she has left overs call the remnant but she chooses to cut it from a certain place by our own free thinking but what is left over is called the remnant and if you noticed that there were five foolish and five wise virgins all of them was virgins made out of the same material but by election here we go God chooses bride by election before the foundation of the world hallelujah put their names on the Lamb's Book of Life slain from before the from this world before the world ever began the day in the funeral that I did the money I was talking about considering the end he said the Bible said that at the end of something than the beginning hallelujah and to consider the end in your decisions and actions consider the end game where you want to end up what the end will be is not where you start because because Joseph started kicked oten and and shunned by his brothers but he ended up as the right hand of Pharaoh Oh glory to God David was a shepherd boy that's when he stopped but he ended up being king of Israel it's not like your status not where you are is very gonna end so you have to consider help me turn on my DS I can on my end but God knows that for the beginning he stuff on the end he know that's why you can say all he foreknew he call or we call it justified all each other he know where you're going already hot already glorified so he finishes already and then coming the beginning and start the story then Satan is trapped because he don't understand it's finished already okay the Lord has shout because he starts at the end Oh Gloria already in the Millennium y'all ready inner city you already have a new body Oh everything is covered already already glorified I mean coming back and roll back the tape here and put you to struggle so God is not rolling dice I saw quad I hope you make it I want to look tonight not because he way they behaved last night no no Gordon up that kind of right mode God know the end from the beginning well glory to God if Israel were to consider their behavior they never they never said we can take it or glory does God didn't understand why bring them out the same father brought him out judge them because it wasn't consider the end and the Bible said decent happen for examples for whom the ends of the world are come or glory the costs and learn from their behavior learn from the attitude not God is a good God all the time that's a phrase what is the core of the word Oh hallelujah Oh get a lot of shout praise God praise God hallelujah little chorus not him who starts and finishes these little sprit is a long distant race is yourself Gloria don't have patience with God have patience with yourself pace yourself this race is not for the Swift but him doesn't go on to the end or glory that God be in for the long haul that's right be not tired dice why be not weary that's why we could stand on after the promise of God to on the leaf but stronger than praise for God because we in this thing for the long haul we're not looking for shortcuts there are no shortcuts you have to die to yourself or - oh we don't want a shortcut I believed if I have it as a shortcut there's nice Baptist doctrine in glorified mode hallelujah is a Baptist doctrine on table when you believe it you have it when they receive the message daddy holy goes I could pop this doctrine Paulette preach that is not what Paul preached he said have to receive since you believe they say we are nobodies Holy Ghost in you're talking about we have no more aspire we hand over this power we have no borders demon Chasen's and killing heaven high hell hot or Kobe and over this kind of thing is a yeah yeah yeah we have it you have to get it Oh glory the core and they were filled with the Holy Ghost celebrated maybe ceases so tell me something Legion fill with the toes endeavors because your humble limit with them Devils get take you away if a man could be filled with Devils a piece of nicotine also not queasy stuff like a fella with Cody goes then you'll receive a man doing all kind of stuff we kind of stuff Jesus did because you see this a most I do shall you do also when you have my spirit inside of you like no game thing bored fella Mahmoud is Holy Spirit hallelujah demand not talk and talk and talking Philip wasn't talking Philip Wendell do miracles he cast out Devils He healed the sick he wasn't asking them ministers Association permission to preach the gospel with signs one of the miracles the Bible said these signs shall follow them that believe the Bible said the Lord Himself well everywhere with them confirming the word with same man doing that God doing that or give the Lord a shout because God was working with damn who's down till early church the Alpha Church or glory of God the book of Acts church the church he sent the professional hats back to or till the Lord are so vain on those modern singer or glory that's why I say get on fire or glory no God bring your fire with you I come and fire every time I come here as fire coming bring yours Oh hallelujah Luud like a wonderful minds you bring yours bring yours bring your fire toreador God hallelujah hallelujah my glory said the bride is it it shows my election it's not right so then the fullest version was the one who did not have oil in their lamps they had the Box the Hattie tapes they had the preachers they have the ministers they have for 50 years but no oil so the oil is something different then if the butcher is oil and as the oil just piles in the Bayesian stuff it in your clothes sleep on it a would wrestle I'm just I'm just this book one book and wrap yourself up in it would make a word hat it cannot be that he's talking about that's something if you're preaching the world is the word you're preaching we can't priests a turn on Venus and Mars even though they see Bible up there you have to preach the word but then the Bible was also the pyramid so in a preach the word you get the parameter in you but the perimeter is not at board but with nice colors in it with Rachel in it no this has to be a little fit and live in virtual if I don't call it a written epistles rather known of all men is the same writen but the writen that becomes flesh so then you yourself become a written word you know John was John was the voice of one crying in the wilderness that weird voice of one kind of illness when that make flesh is that a man called John before I send you Elijah the prophet when that was the first it was called William Marion Branham and when the word for you make fresh is you what you say Marvin you have to be the word made manifest a knight he say by unto the bride will be fulfill all not by the church people so you can look at church members that is them they on the own I by unclear the bride will be full of fill all that was promised in his last day so you can look at those member and expect some

cotton just remembers be heady highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers gone cheese because in the church Liars in the church in the church jealous people in the church back biters in the church wreath disrespectful in the search a great solution came to me early and said I believe God it was imputed on differences I said that is true he said what more can a man do by belief I said that's all he could do he said but where do you go for this Holy Ghost stuff I've said that that no you know he was a Baptist he said where do you go with his Holy Ghost if a man believed the minute you believe you poverty believers I said no no you make a contradiction in the scriptures the Scriptures no contradict themselves Paul asked them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed I said it's true Abraham the father of faith he had promise of calm believe God it was imprisoned him for righteousness but he give him the seal of circumcision as a sign that he had received his fate and if he have never sealed you with the Holy Ghost yet he's never received your faith in him you've got some loose places you might believe but there's a lot of loose places but when you get all the book news places back right then he sees where the Holy Ghost until the day of your Redemption that is God's confirmation that he has received the faith that you possess in him professing him oh my the church will see with that Dogma this is not good this is not good when God gives you the Holy Ghost it is settled you know where you stand you know what happened you are sealed all the day totality of your Redemption your destination on this earthly journey that oughta make anybody just have faith and believe God and rise up in the power of the Spirit now these versions did not get the Holy Spirit the only thing the luck was all in their lamps they had the books they had the mysteries they had the knowledge they had all knowledge but not the oil they had the best dishes they had the greatest revelations but not the oil some bring any always a different ingredient and yet the word is spirit and the spirit is life you know why they couldn't get the oil because the word of the Spirit is what they rejected and last service I quoted it for you my voice was gone I didn't have it here tonight to see it back but he says the church the bride that rejected the head pact of the bride would have to suffer it if that be so then the thunders capped the pyramid then the seven thunders is the head part of that the seven thunders is in the Holy Spirit slot beneath that is the seven churches but God put that slot there and LOV is Christ coopera body coming down and then on it is his spirit coming you have to be caught up into this spirit soul hours you are you have to be magnetized not by

we believe living in a band would make you a pig no more we believe living in a king spires will make you a king we believe how we go dance about we believe that you receive the Holy Ghost by an experience I want a nail Adama we don't believe this mental intellectual message sting Baptist doctrine that they have on steroids merely that you receive the Holy Ghost by our experience not by a mythical intellectual conception of the Scriptures but by an experience that's you oh no no no if the one can over it was the Holy Ghost watch all your life patterns after that and it will tell the kind of spirit coming to you because spirit has come into people or glory to God I can't tell you have a praise God you got to know and you'll see the life you live I'll take at the experience but I'm experienced is a mas not going to intellectualize it what I want to explain to you yes even his soul and I see a real king and Holy Ghost not the real thing don't know look on me that you had a coming up with a revelation than that like that Lucifer all over again trying to intellectualize this experience have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe there is a Holy Ghost a real Holy Ghost it's the horse of a man a man called price Jesus when he died Uli's disclosed the spirit to come upon you and transform your life disclose Holy Ghost hallelujah so this church believes they receive the Holy Ghost by an experience hallelujah you can imagine I get my passing water I imagine Jesus name Amen the Catholic house our subject at this print area and Mo Farah so no it wasn't a sprinkler

intellectual preachers what they love the explainers but I love this Holy Ghost it's good enough for me Oh glory dope I'll make you stop your lyin it received it when you're dying if I stop the devil flying it's good enough for me wrap up here all right Jesus live in a world that no one note about here's an odd person he lived in a wool of perfect feet and a perfect God but she was he if we lived in a perfect faith of a Christian to what we are will be mystic to the world the people wouldn't understand you you would walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what it forbid you will not do see that's the way it has to be all believers they are mystic the people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves Jesus live in a world nobody else could touch the disciples couldn't understand him when he spoke to them he said they use riddles you see so when a man here we go lives by faith walks by faith I mean substance faith so he's bringing it that you were going to do reality live by faith walk by faith then he defines it substance feet he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ dear now you are getting into bright material there is where you getting into bright material see see you see all the intellectual thing for example brahmam servicing was 65 he said I believe the church has been hearing a message intellectually he said but your feet isn't ripe enough you have to lay in his presence until your feet becomes ripe so he understood that what he was presenting to them was hitting them at the intellectual level but he understood that it will take presence to get defeat into ripeness do you understand that it will take what presence to get the fit into rightness now watch this he said no minutes ago very revival they don't pack it with them it you revive I have to come from the people so the people have to get the vision that they could see to run right the vision make it plain that he that readeth may run so it means somewhere along the line this vision has to be activated into you to push you into action and don't leave the burden to the minister because he can bring the revival when you see it you could run with it when you could see it you will pray on it when you see it you'll fast and you will be twisting and hungry for it and when you see it you will see a revival brick in your home your house and in the church you will bring the revival from your home to this church or chlorine accordion we have a big blonde a revival that fire would explode and what do you think gonna happen the power of
