god bless you my Bible and I get it into the one scripture Luke chapter 24 you want to read from verse 49 to 53 thank you so much for coming out tonight and creating such an atmosphere amen Luke chapter 24 wanna read from verse 49 to 53 and this is Jesus words in verse 49 listen read Luke 24:49 and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tyre in the siege of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high and you let him out as fast a Bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them and I came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven and they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy and we're continually in the temple praising and blessing God Amen may God bless his word you may be seated oh praise the name of the Lord thank you Lord Jesus tonight our title is the attitude that brings the results is the attitude that brings results and I have an inspiration in the atmosphere of juda perfection I want to encourage you tonight to stay in the word stay in the atmosphere of the word if in the wrong atmosphere you cannot get the results that you're looking for so we want to share some things we tonight that we feel upon our hearts that would help you and strengthen you and edify you and the Prophet was spoken about a message a personal experience with God 1954 and he was chained about Moses how Moses has been a bit had been a bit of failure for yet knowing that God is going to deliver the child of Israel by him yet trying to do it within himself 40 years before that become a failure had lost all the vision of victory and of the freedom of the people enslaved see when you lost a vision you just doesn't have the burden anymore to do what needs to be done because it got collie qualified job he called you to enlist you into his program his plan of redemption isn't that right and the promise I wonder sometimes if we the church knowing that God is promised to deliver the tears from its sin from its sickness and the makers of people are salty people that the earth will hunger and thirst after I wonder in our human efforts in our t ologies and so forth our great fine buildings and so forth as we try to present the people many years ago he found it has failed because we took it in ourselves to do so we took it upon ourselves to have new schools educate ministers we left off the real principle the real thing that God told us to receive was to let the Holy Spirit lead the church we have left that off you have lost our divine joy and the vision is done now so when that joy is there you can't wait to come to church you can't wait to be in service you can't wait to be in the presence of God because this is your source this is your inspiration this is where you're getting your drawing from isn't it right people are not looking for the coming the Lord yet atomic bombs hanging everywhere people have lost their vision of the Lord because I've said times that the Lord will come a certain time and I've done all these things how can we do those things without Holy Spirit Moses have been a bit of failure but out here we see the tension attracted to a burning bush isn't that right fire attracts the people now watch feet took a whole right quick when Moses turn aside to consider this building tree God spoke to him a fresh vision by an angel so when the division get dull something brought her to give you a fresh world a fresh anointing a fresh inspiration a fresh fire Amen that still you up again did the vision of God that God has put inside your soul that's what the church needs a night watch watch watch no watch fate take a whole right quick the old things pass away Moses no has a new vision he has a revelation he has an experience vision revelation and experience he had met God he had talked to God before that he had not met God he only read and known what his mother had told him by hearing what his mother told him by what the pastor said but now Moses had a personal experience so you read this record books and oh gosh and a prophet be all I send you Elijah they were you read it that's what you receive that's what you understand but no you have to get your personal experience with God not reading a book not listen to a tape but with the same pillar of fire or glory to God the Koran pillar fire come to activate the sons of God Oh glory to God could somebody say Amen that pillar of fire come to activate the sons of God so you should want to be caught activated oh not intellectually activated thought out that every Scripture is God breathed the breath of God is upon this world Oh hallelujah that's what the church needs tonight is stop studying so much theology and get down to the altar and pray until a pleasant experience billion down in a human hat and builds out all the dullness and gives a new vision or glory the global either fresh or to call every man adult every man repentant every man crying out why I said enjoy let the priests hold on to the horns of the altar let him cry for the wine and - oil and then court said enjoy - and I will restore to you the years that the locusts are deeton the Pamela man-eatin when after they cry out Oh glory to God he said what will ease the pre-meeting they say Lord send on the adoption Oh glory to God we are teaching for 40 plus years it's time for fire it's time for power or glory to God we have to create the atmosphere because the atmosphere is what you're gonna get the results [Applause] hallelujah glory the government may be seated praise God praise God amen fit in God it's a staggering to many people and we ought to be a more selves to confess we don't have faith in God first there's cowards who die ten thousand deaths while they're here on earth and here never dies his memory lingers on for heroic deeds and usually young people who are feet are people who have experienced experience brings faith or glory to God you hear what intellect experience brings fit so when Moses met that pella fire nobody could stop Moses to tell him I'm talking out of going back to Egypt and if you asked voters where you're going you said to take over or chlorine of God what he couldn't do in 40 years he was doing instantly because he met the pillar fire I'm gonna when I'm stood and prophesy he said God will do in one year what all theologians fail to do in 2,000 years you wait till that little remnant that clogs on the gift Appalachia wait till Dakota : god damn national shodam there'll be a power strike attached like I've never seen before you wait it's coming it's coming it's coming Oh God these are not plain words every wooden succeed these are wait till m-72 miss are the devices that people could pick the one on hand the dear oh boy it will slice and cut it shut the heavens he'll do whatever they want to do we don't have to ask permission for God to deliver your family we left in your family go we send you our free tonight loose them and let them go Oh glory to God hallelujah but the preacher experience is your experience you have to get your own experience and in experience benefit when then go see enough profits is on us back to the faith of the fathers that we have go back to an experience that the father has had because they had an experience hallelujah and Jesus send them in the upper room the killing the promise of the Father and the Bible said they were in the upper room they were praising and blessing God continually what were they doing they were creating an atmosphere and it was staying in the atmosphere it all depends upon your attitude da cunha bring the results but we have to create an atmosphere the atmosphere is what makes a difference or the song leader was singing tonight and he didn't know what to do you're 19 and building it's an atmosphere it takes over the Blues it remove your frustration it effects the bad day I had today it corrects all of that what this does it is the atmosphere the Aquajet the holy spirit that was real power definitely I was gone we leave that atmosphere you want that atmosphere you want it in your house you want it in the kitchen you wonder when you leave out when you leave the home atmosphere you want to bring your home under atmosphere let's continue the wood is a seed my secure fellowship 1955 undersea won't grow unless it's placing the right kind of grown so the sea is not the problem is the atmosphere or the grown right grown if you produce it on top of yeah it's not growing at all because I is not for seeds like that is something else see you have to go any right gun drawn isn't it right you know madam I see you got if you are afraid to show it the seed will do you no good but listen to this every will have go to the CTO Setsu and every promise of God will come to pass if you will receive it and don't doubt it and can place it in your heart and believe it come from God and water it will fade it will spring for of its kind don't never forget the statement and make this from my heart the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of God will bring it the past don't forget that don't forget that or glory the right attitude that woman Jesus call a dog instead fit to take assurance brennan casa the dogs she stood right there she didn't move she our holy building JK's expert or the pasta or the elder she acts because of her Jesus tell her she stood a gun right there she said even the dogs get comes off the master's table she was locked in she was focused she had the right attitude she was in an atmosphere fate that nothing was removing her nothing to talk nothing can affect because she had a need that debtor was upon her daughter and she wanted a little off or get the Lord a shout do you have an easier tonight do you ever need I need a break Shore neither deliverance neither healing I need a restoration and either the joy of God and neither the Holy Ghost I need a revival I needed a fresh vision whatever your need is tonight we can supply your needs tonight or glory to God hallelujah hallelujah the only thing you have to do is to water the season and your water to seat by worship you wanted to see by praises that's why a lot of churches don't know they just sit there dead not see their water in the only hearing word word word word but they think I atmosphere praise god of water in of worship that's why we every time he comes and give the Lord a shout of praise [Music] because some point in time we have to have this continually you can help it it's like automatic once your comments header here you decide to worship God you don't care who either side of you who in front of you if you're just lost you pay or you fire you that I'm not doing it the devil is a liar praise coconuts you're not serving God because you're getting paid you're saving go because you keep calling you to serve Him oh god your loss ensures your loss yells ha that does not matter you here to praise God you alo wonder what's happening tomorrow you're gonna take care tomorrow you don't even know if there's gonna be tomorrow but get the Lord our show tonight know [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] not tomorrow right now no let me see this only a little water the scene you put me on record tonight in these recorders I have no apology for this remark I'm fixin to make I believe and can prove that the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of God will bring it to pass the right mental attitude but you've got to have the right attitude the attitude is what brings the results the attitude is what brings the results elijah elijah walk after with woman who went on take some stick on it one bit more big fashion she's on today and he said big me a kick face she had a choice she gotta say listen this this little brainer gonna make it is for me and my boy this is our final supper that's it she could have said that she said but she went and turned in obedience to pick that man i've got a big face and when she turned she had just said the lord what little you have to multiply whatever you got album artist [Applause] and that was in a time of famine [Applause] [Music] [Applause] olia the attitude is what brings the results Martha Mary law is a husband here my brother had not died she pushed and she pushed him she pushing first scared setting it but even though I when she pushed that get even now and she's trying that gear Jesus couldn't help it we have you laid him my god you anointed me but resurrection power you anointed me but the dynamics or the mechanics [Applause] [Applause] [Music] glorious attitude attitude a push god the fauces god that pushed this issue maybe see that praise God praise God the attitude is what been the results Jesus in the wedding wine run out under come to Jesus what he has to do with that he's a guest like everybody else but his mother said whatever he say just do it don't question it don't argue with it don't fight it just do it these are get some water puffs enjoy it and when it's at the pour water you see water you see wine he could turn water into wine you could take your word and the revelation and give me the stimulation of the revelation of the wine of God oh come on same as somebody you could be a jazz a biscuit but if the Lord took my loss he could turn the water into wine [Applause] water into mine praise God but appearances is the attitude homolytically supernatural the attitude of the people is what brings the results the attitude supports America made a bad spirit you see because the religious man the carnal man have a religious atmosphere on him did not sane only come in the church you spirit on them they don't want to stay home they come in a cheap medical my shirt to get trouble we just atmosphere they like a worship but when you see a fossil water correct up the fly out the cata construction because they rebuked the tactic correction but every scripture is god-breathed and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction because jesus said as many as i love i rebuke and chasten we are here to pamper your spirit your straight after get busted and broken up because you have to get a replacement of your spirit [Applause] listen listen listen justification is the atmosphere but know that you are saved I'm going to save you God bring you internal atmosphere that's what Luther did sanctification bringing a higher atmosphere know you are Savior sanctified then the Holy Spirit coming to baptize you to begin to have Michelle and then the proverb or the word to drop Georgia perfection it comes downward into the Holy Ghost atmosphere that cap your lives we have to press on brethren from Jacob place in the Juniper section we have to press on he's only out to get them to the resurrection it's predictable section to get there okay the Lord I shoot in the house that protects our atmosphere no wonder he said the bride has to bring the atmosphere because no minister completely revivals the people has to bring the revival let the people shout right now you you my brother you my sister you have to bring our atmosphere and you have to bring it from your house you have to bring it from your home you can't bring it here you have to bring it from home gotta bring it from home Blue gets a lot of praise offering [Applause] [Music] that's a big order tonight but we're saying you may be seated I'm saying this atmosphere have to be in your home of course they have to be in your home you have to have the right attitude what we've seen because this is what it must want you must want the atmosphere in your home and you just add fire on it you add to it you're meditating on the Lord blessed is the man Oh glory to God hallelujah whoo water and the tongues are then cut Lea no stand in the way of sinners nor sit in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the Lord and in that law that he meditate day and night what's happening to that man he's in an atmosphere or glorious blessed the world is around him he's in a world atmosphere Oh glory to God brother Branham was in the atmosphere when that maniac man was coming to beat him up ministers run off the platform but paradigm steer the atmosphere he didn't run because that develop backing up most son of God nor devil a backing up most son that calmness aw come on via here the bottom Devils up when I'm still in the atmosphere Oh glory to God he said because you challenge the Spirit of God you shall fall on my feet and demanded that was fear [Music] why you think the devil has initiate corals and fusses and family colors in home to show you all the atmosphere when you already atmosphere you don't want to come to church the effects you're angry you can sing nothing he don't kill you or any because you miss his objective so instead of cooling longest one and coolness what you had in fewer the fire and recorded ha to do the first getting higher higher the frame going more your job is a cool on the flame and the white altitude gets in tune if the husband altitude be sweet sweet them with his foolishness they create an atmosphere gets him out to that he had a hard day grumpy here you wanna come home sweet you create the atmosphere when he came he say I'm happy to be here but you must x10 he because you studying you know you had a tough day home I didn't call me for that I come to talk body atmosphere I didn't come here to go into that I come to talk by the atmosphere and I find myself going down inside a dear Oh hallelujah praise God create the atmosphere drop it drop it little off the answer back you don't have to pick on every little thing because you have a mode shut up keep us still oh not the perfect man he could bite his tongue or kill the Lord I'm choked on the line I'm sorry tonight but I'm in Saturday already or Chloe don't got a good handle a pawn or glory to God that toca speak better life speak life speak deliverance speak prayer true speak learn speak fire speak pear true [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it's the reason around the reason I Pentecost they had to go in an upper room and pray until the Holy Ghost came pause they got in one place I want to call it it's the atmosphere that brings the results aha alright at achieving the results and the building results so God send them there to wait until they have the right atmosphere because Holy Ghost a Carmel Andre Holy Ghost I come down on a dead church they take an atmosphere to meet that atmosphere [Music] listen listen when Jesus died those guys were under depression and frustration and all kind of thing like that because a master gone who crying who's sad and all canting later even if woman his sisters had more revolution in solution than some of them brothers because the Angels tell them sisters go and tell them I'm not dead then let me read from the dead let them run away the message and brother same if except a touch and I feel I will not believe you know what talking about like Gretchen and who fall in Jesus and he said that touch I feel just as I feel nothing they say we seen him he's risen we see him they say I believe die oMG has appeared and he said come come you want to touch come and touch come and touch don't touch is it I didn't afraid so when you meet them talking and negative talk and Jesus didn't hear we built them he saw fools and slow of heart to believe all what I said these were showing you only time that I have to suffer these things I even tell if I don't go recover that will not come know that I'm here I'm showing you now because of their coming no they happy because confident about that come so when he tell them behold I send the promise of my father then you exactly what they was going to receive power you shall receive the Holy Ghost you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost the comforter the token the dynamics Rebekah's male come upon you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and they returned to Jerusalem half the press I'm frustrated know with great joy I like that not joy great joy happy you should be happy Prince what are you happy I show you happier than the present audiences of America Donald Trump don't have joy like you I'm joy right now he don't even know what he has right now he has problems and other problems and other problems but you enjoy because you coming into power you coming today your promise you coming to annoy 10 or Chloe they're caught there'll be a super race yes super Church that's a prophecy hallelujah Oh glory to God the bride has not a revival yet it will take them seven thunders to pick up that prize that's a promise laid over you what we see it to make a church that should make revival that we will find them everywhere that's it a seven thunders of Revelation 10 is being made manifest be closed in the talking part of the message I'm removing into the manifestation part because in the talking talking talking but the manifestation will be the interpretation of what the Prophet said this is that we need to hear this is that but the Prophet William branham's water [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] but I wanna let every man and woman in this building this morning boy or girl get everything from their minds but the Lord Jesus and believe that he is standing present right now and you will see something happen that will cause headlines in newspaper in the morning he said that's right it's the atmosphere if we kept it right the headlines will be made because a pillar fire hung right over this building [Applause] yes sir I really believe that same pillar fire that's hung by night cold by day to hang right over there [Applause] let the well know he's with you that the whole a trend I know he is with you that's a God we serve he's a living God he's a different God he's a supernatural God he still heals he still seals he still delivers he still prick the bands of wickedness he still read the pangs of evil he still deliver sisters from bullhead spirits he is God and God [Applause] he says it could take an egg from my hand and put it on that puppy it was hot he said it's the warmth of the puppy's body it is big o glory you know what he said put that egg on the puppy you're gonna hatch and produce a chicken because it is the utmost fear Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God it is the atmosphere that brings the miraculous and wonders and the powers of God among the people it is the atmosphere of the people and when people get to a place that the reasoning and wondering and xuan and tinkin and the old talk and don't know where they stand half of them are even scripturally taught how can you expect the atmosphere to be right so for this world to be fulfilled it has to bring an attitude in God's people that would create the atmosphere that he could spend it do you understand what happened in the upper room my god Damon the day of Pentecost was fully come they were in one man do in one Accord Mary wasn't playing more spiritual than brother James and she's the mother of Jesus no God gave Mary some days to get that thing off of her shoulder all these stuck-up English she is more of a Jesus shattered I owe to that every man-jack had to die Peter had to die everybody was under promise in that rumor of pasta and pasta and prophet and teacher every man Jack Witten's of fire every officer was waiting for power every guest was written to be placed glory to God hallelujah get a lot of shout or nobody had in this one I'm bigger than this one if Peter was in his human spirit he never stepped out after receiving the Holy Ghost but Peter knew he had the keys Peter no he was placed so he step out and said these people and not job does you suppose but this is that that the Prophet Joe has speaker oh my god one day we're gonna identify the manifestation of these coats it wouldn't just be caught in the prophet it'll be same this day this scripture is being fulfilled in your ears you have people being set free and when when John the Baptist was getting all and uh his eyes isn't dim and John disciples and Jesus are you don't want or should we look for another you know what Jesus Ella go tell John tell John the blind receive their sight crippled walking dumb speaking yes a I am he just tell him the manifestations that is taking place tell him about the supernatural working power of the Holy Ghost Elia [Applause] [Music] I trust a knight will create a twisting you for a reality a manifested reality of the glory of God money but medium but a band I'm talking about the woman with the blood issue she had a bloody shoe and she told herself if I could touch the hem of His garment money ran out husband telenovela small churches they'll have noisy people rantin and Ravin and carry on thing like that though but she had enough are this blood loosen things she know she time is gonna be short she told us that when she create a promise with yourself she never see that no scripture she told ourselves something instead I saying I got there I got there tell yourself something now tell yourself something nice something right delivered you forget the breakthrough let's not forget the Holy Ghost don't sit there a bomb no no no don't don't talk like that come on come on now have the right I don't speak like that my situation all messed up no tell isn't going to sort out your situation you can sort it all but he can [Applause] [Music] [Applause] listen an S yes a woman touches garment she was healed with the bloody shoe I sold your spit in his face and put her crown upon his head and felt no virtue they roughing up Jesus no vote you come on to them and I'm warm under blush you just said touch the hem of His garment and would you flow right down and hit that woman there is a it's your approach the attitude is what it takes and that is what it says tonight dear friend it takes the attitude are you ready we are and believe we are in the presence of Jesus Christ but as the attitude of bring the results are you ready the mechanics is here and so is the dynamics if you can just get started global leader s so this service tonight is to get you is to get you is to get you give the Lord a show because of your get started [Applause] my god I feel like jumping I feel like Schulten because I believe me getting started tonight if you only get started told you the rest maybe season that's what David did when Goliath coming down David ran to me glad I didn't put this thing in his don't always not know David not a food son David it's not a food some use in stone you know give a sling and bird big

have to get the experience so you view the trials differently you view the situations differently your shoe judge your view situation in your life differently your things are overcome things are stands things to back up that takes a break you but to make you give the Lord a shout your experience and child's system to make you to shape you to form you into the word image the mechanics is here ensue the dynamics if you can get started go over do the rest oh my my hallelujah praise God what's the matter today my brethren is this we are letting down we are letting dunk mental theology molesting don't intellectual faith when we ought to pre until God moves in the audience and does and goes to do something for us at once service brother man I'm came to a meeting he never even pray or preach he said as soon as it's walk into the service because I'll come with a wheelchair he said the angel was present the atmosphere was dear sometimes I see boron talk about this milky-white anything had happened all things are possible till a fire moving feet reaching up everywhere demons calling out to other demons for help because they don't want to go and a prophet with authority dear to cast out devils and those demons no this man is signed and assign the cast amount and the a save a backup I praise God routine on demons easy right and treasure asking each other for help oh because they don't want to leave you think that devil have on your life and influence in your life all these years you want to just give up on your just like that we have to break the power of the enemy you have to pray and the world does that the winner does that the world does that the atmosphere does that brick them Devils offer you then you're raised up to praise God people don't wanna praise God his demons have them done demons have them bunk but then God break that off for you up close doors hands because you were born to worship you were born you were created [Applause] what around I'm the greatest pleasure I know is the pre until I realize that I'm in the presence of God and recognize it I think that ought to be the trill of the church is the presence of the Holy Spirit seeing the God hath made a promise standing among us felis presence see his word see it vindicated it ought to give faith a makeup let's walk blind see death here and don't speak oh my hallelujah God
