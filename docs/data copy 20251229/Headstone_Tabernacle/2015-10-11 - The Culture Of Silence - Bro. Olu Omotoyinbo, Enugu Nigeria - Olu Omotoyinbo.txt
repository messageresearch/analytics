of scripture Acts chapter 4 Revelation 8 St Luke amen amen Acts chapter 4 I read from verse one and as I spake unto the people the priests and the captain of the temple and the SES Came Upon them okay uh being griev that they taught the people and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead and they laid hands on them and put them in whole unto the next day for it was now even TI how be many of them which heard the word believed and the number of the men was 5,000 and it came to pass in the tomorrow that their are rulers and elders and scribes and anas the high priest and cers and JN and Alexander And as many as of the Kindred of the high priest were gathered together at Jerusalem and when they had set them in the M they asked them they asked by what power or by what name have you done this then Peter FW the Holy Ghost said unto them you realiz of the people and Elders of Israel if with this there be examine of the good deed done to the impotent Man by what means he is made whole be known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom ye crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him this man stand before you whole this is the stone which was set at not of you Builders which is become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is not the name of the heaven given among men whereby we must be saved now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were un unlearned unlearned and ignorant men they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus and beholding the man which was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council they confered among themselves saying what shall we do to these men for that indeed a notable Miracle hath been done by them is Manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem and we cannot deny it but that it spread no further among the people let us strictly threaten them that they speak hence forth no more uh that they speak hence forth to no man in this name and they called them and commanded them not to speak a all not teach in the name of Jesus but Peter and John answered and said unto them whether it be right in the S of God to Heen unto you more than unto God judge ye for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard so when they had further threatened them they let them go finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people for all men glorified God for thou which was done for the man was about 40 years old on whom this miracle of healing was showed Revelation 8 chapter one I mean verse one I'm sorry and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour amen and Fin St Luke 4 verse 16 and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the accept of the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fasting on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears amen may the Lord that is blessing the reading of his holy words amen shall we our head prayer our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for Grace to be back here in your house Lord we thank you for the privilege to be together again Lord Under The Canopy of Life Under The Canopy of the Holy Spirit gathered together by the voice of a seventh angel father we thank you Lord for these meetings here for the blessings so far and Lord I know that hour is gone and I just pray Lord that you'll help the people and strengthen them and help me also Lord that together both the speaker and the hearers Lord will make one sound all to the glory of your Holy Name Lord I pray now Lord May the thoughts of my heart the medic of my heart the words of my mouth be acceptable oh Lord God in thy sight and may the people receive the word like those on the road to I mean like those on in b barer and check these things of themselves if they be so and may you pour your blessing out upon the word we have read your word is already blessed may you bless the people as the word Goes Forth may you take the wordss as we speak them and bake the wats into bread to feed the souls of your waiting children with bless us and strengthen us now father and we will be careful at the end of this service and all the Days of Our Lives to give you alone all the praise honor and glory for we ask with thanks in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated bless you good afternoon amen um well before I go any further I want to say to brother Charles and sister Di and the um little flock the anointed brother of Christ assembly I want to say thank you for inviting us thank you for invitation to be here and it's been a blessing already and just the atmosphere amen and thank you also on behalf of my wife and the family and the believer inos we thank you for making us feel so welcome and for the speciality and it's such a blessing to see our brothers and sisters again and it's a special blessing to brother zigma in Niger for amen amen amen and brother also um Johnny Was Here 2013 and it's so good to see all of you to see all of you and brother martin an who spoke last night we grew up together in Pentecost when we were much younger man and when I heard him last night I said brother the m still has the fire what a bless God bless Martin thank you for bless you so this morning I want to uh um speak um I hope briefly well it's realtive depends on what you mean by brief what I brief right lunch is with anyway so um you know when you leave here for lunch I want to speak on the title the culture of Silence and I must say up front I must say up front I'm sorry about you're not hearing me is not walking oh okay okay so I got to I got to look at you all right all right um um the culture of silence and this is a very difficult message for me to speak because brother Charles told you I'm actually taking brother joh space Johnny the serian he found a way to trick me into this because I was relaxed I was sure I had escaped I was sure I had escaped and brother Johnny calls me Bishop Bop brother oid calls him Bishop I said no you didn't get it all right you miss the ACT it's act Bishop just in case you've forgotten AR Bishop so if I'm Bishop so if I'm Bishop why brother listen and just come to preach so they can defy the words of this bishop every once in a while so this is this is tough for me really and when I preach in Nigeria it's different for the simple reason that I feel a [Music] responsibility in Nigeria because I am one of the people and I say that very humbly with all sense of Consciousness that the Bible said Let each one of you not think highly of himself than he ought to think and I'm conscious that he can talk and speak so much about what you have done and brother bam taught us not to live like that as a matter of fact brother bam taught us if you want God to bless you brag on somebody else put yourself on the ground where God can put his hand upon you because God resist the proud but gives grace to the humble and when you raise your shoulders up God is not going to struggle with you because Jesus said I am meek and lowly of heart he's lowly when you raise your shoulders up he's not going to raise up to try and put his hand on you if you want God to put his hand on you you got to stay low on the ground he can put his hand upon you you so I'm very conscious of my words but just so I don't make anybody feel [Music] nervous brother is Niger is a wild man he's not the same person again why didn't he just preach why do going do all this trouble for the simple reason that that I feel a responsibility obligation to the people in Nigeria in particular because as well as anybody else did I pushed out the Revelation and the inspiration of the seven thunders in this country a young man I was a young man in my 20s in medical school I gave up I I CAU a revelation by the grace of God of the seven Thunders brother colan wasn't there but when I got a revelation I knew that's what that man has been speaking words and I saw what he was saying brother words I was not good anymore my medical school career ended at that spot I lost all interest in everything else I had my final year exams in medical school haris was coming I sneaked out on my mother to go for the convention of course of course you know the result when I came back I had to receive the exam but the point making here is this I give my life for this and I'm sure you can relate because you did the same thing not just me because brother said when you catch this Revelation all your Ambitions of the worldall is gone you only one that's Christ amen amen so I push the inspiration out in this country anybody else the brothers today who are tagging me all kinds of names they they called me Coleman's boy they didn't even have the decency to put a brother to it they call mean Bo for giving out the tapes which I didn't ask to to do but I was asked to do that and I gave that out I went everywhere in school I mean from school we tried to push this out not so that you will follow a man but we found a prophet who revealed the entire mystery of God back side of the Bible and I felt it was worth given your life for it was what the cost of the oil in your Alabaster Box I thought this was worth everything forgive me for getting personal but just so you won't feel nervous about what I'm saying because I always all my life I wanted to be a doctor but once I cut a 700 Revelation that was it all my ambitions changed and I influenced with other people not me alone with other people believe the seven Thunders as the real Revelation message raled revelation of prophet message the back of the Bible seven thundering Angels open up the entire word seven angels open the book of life to you seven thundering Angels you a revelation of the personal life of Jesus Christ so that Jesus Christ might be born in youth in you so that you can grow Grace to Grace glory to glory and become like Jesus Christ because brother said this here this here age personal life of Jesus Christ the chemicals of his body through justification I mean real true justification you never the first open up the Book of Life you how before the foundation of the world chose you your name in blood can never Beed on saved you you are sa for All Time and Eternity tration revealed baptism of the Holy Ghost to where the mystery of the person Jesus Christ steps into your life and changes you makes you a brand new [Applause] person you know lately there's a lot of attack on brother bam on the internet and all that and even Among Us there's a rebellion against the word of God like brother R say yesterday morning a pastor 50 years in the message joh is back on the message and brother Ray said that man never had a revelation of the message never did you ever come in contact CHR of the seven seal if you ever came in contact with Jesus Christ that William preached brother it makes you a brand new your life can never be the same let the whole world walk away let the whole world walk away let your husb walk away let your wife walk away can't deny your experience the blind man said the blind man said whether he be a righteous man an evil man you judge for yourself but one thing I know I was blind but now I see an evil man do that to me whatever you make a brother Bram your choice my testimony I heard the voice of God sping through a prophet 20th Cy Prophet say the Lord and his words turn my life around I never be the same again if you ever come in contact Prophet message no matter what anybody say you can't deny your [Applause] [Music] [Applause] testimony amen amen so anyway you may so I just want to be clear with a recent history when I go out of the country I preach but Nigeria 2013 zma had a convention in Germany and in that convention spoke on 304 because lies that g out that we don't believe page 304 it's brother brenham's promise to the bride nobody has a franch amen amen no [Applause] man so anyway see the man here in that convention the first chice I don't think I ever said this before I don't think I ever said this before but zigma spoke sister zigma Daughter s a special and I still remember when this uh the intro was going for the special turn around like this and B her head and bow ahead at that point I felt for me something Ste into that meeting beside me and I knew it was going to begin to heal my hurt and my disappointment of what had happened Among Us you may like to fool yourself but I don't like to deceive myself I don't like to deceive myself the toughest thing to be is to be around people who will not take responsibility for their [Music] actions anointing you should not just be anointed in the pit should follow you home when you talk to your wife when you talk to your children when you talk to your parents M should go with you and in that meeting when brother zma was speaking I give testimony to many brothers way back in Germany at a point in the message while he was speaking I felt something breaking my heart I began to feel again that God is doing a restoration among us is going to heal our backsliding God is going to bring back them happy days again and I still feel that way Nigeria I'm here to cause trouble not to give my testimony I wasn't going to preach do a brother con he's taking a lot of a lot of lot of flack for with me and we together together and people say Joshua Moses Minister there and they say brother come's Minister you know stuff like that what are you going to do you may be seated so Nigeria I'm going to give my testimony I feel because I wouldn't talk if I thought other people were doing it but I nobody doing it in this country and I this country has become a Battleground ofss B of ss and I thought let me not let me let me be a man when God is looking for men let be a man that's going to stand and face the fire man and stand up and confront the enemy let me be a man to God Amen Oh Glory you may be seated don't worry when I when I say I leave amen am brother said on message amen was speaking about men of principle said here you pray for me

the kingdom of God Amen am and that's I'm for one Kingdom and that's the kingdom of Jesus Christ but but how in the world did you ever see a bunch of Puppets like we go there now why they say whatever

of Jesus Christ for heavens and earth will pass away but it will never fail word on this rock I'll build my church the gates of hell not Prevail against tell your neighbor never Prevail against Church neighbor [Music] I [Music] amen amen all right you may be seated so Nigeria I'm sorry amen so in Germany 2013 at that spot I fell in my heart if I ever get a chance in Nigeria two messages preach Christ and inject the prophet and the culture of Silence along the way and calab preach preach Christ Prophet that's that's for Nigeria we know ourselves in here oh come on can I get a witness come on Nigeria can I get a [Applause] witness you may be seated when the visitors come from outside we can put up the show we can put up the politics thing we can act and do all that but after are gone we come back down to BR we know ourselves come on Nigeria can you give me a witness she along the way God give me another message Lo when I saw Mal first message was to tie up the Los end and I began to see the Los that he tied up before the Thunders will come to the prophet even the prophet Malachi 4 could never come to the seven Thunders until until until he went in the world and searched for all Los end and TI them up when he did that then and only then and only then could he come to the Thunders and here I saw as well as you saw if you want to believe in reality and be realistic all kinds of loose end are coming into the message at the same time we having a seven found manifestation totally against the word so God gave me another message Los I you T your losing as an individual or a church you are going nowhere you can preach for you want you have got to T those Lo end because even the prophet of Malachi Paul could not get away TI up the losers in the world Hallelujah so here it is friends here my third message to Nigeria on this whole thing here the culture of silence and after I preach this done you are not going to hear from me again ever on that thing not in a Convention of course in the church in Lagos if ises crop up stra because right now the plan is to get Legos the action Legos so partos I don't start a fight but I don't want from a fight either I'll Stand and said to not only discern the negative Spirits it not my words brother words bless you oh glory amen amen glory to God Amen and I know and I know in my this message here I know it's going to upset many and I'm conscious of the time and I'm I spend like 30 minutes already so I apologize up front it upset you but because my intent my purpose is not to offend or upset because friends when Israel was coming out of Egypt and those guys Moses went to the into the mountain to bring down the Ten Commandments they could wait for the promise they began to say where is this man Moses now wait a minute Moses the great prophet they could refer to him as this manes in the person it was so rude it was so ungodly it was so unchristian it was so against the spirit of God where is this man Moses of the land of Egypt thank God they admitted he brought them out but they told Aon make us gods and Aon said a wish was made them he said go bring your earrings Aon not know it was wrong of course was wrong and said bring your earrings and he made them a cal and Israel said behold Israel your God that brought you out of Egypt oh come on now no you can't be serious you may be seated Israel you cannot be serious you mean this C here brought you out of Egypt you know what it was they were fashioning a God in their own image a God that will suit them a God that would obey them a God that they will serve when it was convenient a god they will disobey it's convenient a god they will put what in his mouth and you can't say no a god they will defy his words and nothing will happen to them they'll feel no condemnation own image they said these be your Gods oh Israel and God told Moses God hears everything you say everything I say God told Moses go down quickly your people have corrupted themselves making this God in their image corruption finding a God that would obey you rather than you obeying him a what in his mouth you anything and the word of God whether it's in the Bible whether the prophet said it or not it's God's word it's some heting stuff that brought that's a God in your own image not the god of not the god of the Bible and I'm telling you your face on theet everywhere [Applause] hallu apprciate I promise you I cut off when I need to cut off if I pre long you responsible years and all God pres him his wife family Church brother Johnny will love you God's Mighty servant not brother Minister God's Mighty servant glory to God you may be seated glory to God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah but Malachi 4 did not reveal a God in our own image a god who made us in his own image Hallelujah we do what he wants we his word where the word of God says yes we say yes where the word of God says no we say no where the word stopped We Were Made In His Image he made in our image hallelujah hallelujah yes and you know that Moses came down was the anger of God pass into Moses heart and that's where I disagree my brethren because I he this talk let's go on let's move on let's be love so when I'm talking like this I don't have love I have hatred in my heart God in heaven is my witness I hate nobody I don't have any shes with anybody but I'll show you from the Bible we are fooling ourselves thinking that nothing has gone away oh yes everything everything has happened only that it has not gone away Julian Brunell is riding another horse riding another horse see the white horse rider change that horse different color but one thing you got to know he's got a ball he's got no Arrow all action and no movement all backing and no biting got to bite just empty words ening words of man's Wisdom I'm telling you to your [Applause] face you the message the seated Jesus three times in the Bible be seated I I just preach three times the Bible be seated three times in the Bible Jesus came across Blind Men Matthew Mark and Luke recorded this the the um the the in incident and one of them said was two men another one said was blind BOS another one said but it was two men really if you put all together just happened to be the one who was most aggressive because the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence told us and the violent taken by force if God said it let me tell you Church there's a faith moving into the Church of the Living God yes all these distractions 2010 11 all up up up until now is been clouding what's really going on the heart of the tree the heart of the tree the heart of the tree is still growing make no mistake in the matter it's fing down it's been H down but the heart of the tree is still growing amen so anyway Jesus he saw those Blind Men and they cried out Jesus was passing and when Jesus is passing you want to cry out because what a difference it makes in your life makes your home it makes between the husband and the wife it makes between the children and the parents what a difference it makes when Jesus passes by nothing ever Remains the Same when Jesus passes by Hallelujah where there is where there is anger he'll turn into Joy where there is war he turn to peace he brought a brand new language speak speak not as the scribes and the Pharisees even his enemies testified never a man speak like this man never a man did the Miracles on this Earth that this man did he was different he was in a different class he was separate he was special because he was God and this blind man knew Jesus is passing by they were not like who are sleeping who are hungry looking at our watches they cried out in desperation son David have mercy on us you may be [Applause] seated and when they came to Jesus Blind Men what do you think Jus would do they already asked for Mercy come on Lord Heal them it's obvious that's what they want but not the Lord he's trying to show you something he asked those men what will thou that I do for you people stood around this man is is he so dump doesn't he know already what they want have known they than Jesus isn't that what happens many times the pastor the man of God or whoever people do their parents a lot this is dumb stupid why should he say that that's not very smart and that's what they all felt Jesus said regardless of what they F what will thou I do for you they said receive our sight what's the lesson Jesus was trying to teach a lesson Clarity you you need to be clear on what you want be very clear on what you want can you say amen hallelujah you may se you can't just hang around and say God knows what I need you got to be clear on what you want Hallelujah hu amen amen of course he knows what we want but it still to pray and come believe in so Jesus he taught the lesson clity got to have Clarity you can't be double minded and in this day and age day where be neither day nor night it's evening time even time the light is haing Sun is going down moon is trying to come up you don't know what light to live by even time shall be light that light of Mal gospel in this en so there's Clarity on the word we're not confused about anything if you are confused it's your church to be confused Malachi 4 brought Clarity on the world days of the forest of a seven Angel When shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished no IG about that is a [Applause] finise god GL GL GL GL So when you say let's leave this here you may be seated but all leave his thing you have anything else to say let's move into the future full of love prove that to me from the Bible show me from the Bible where you're coming I want you to show me from the Bible I will back off because God the only way we relate to God Is by faith now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen through faith we understand that the worlds were fashioned by the word of God out of nothing look into the Unseen from The Unseen God fashion this great world Hallelujah and said without faith it's impossible to please God the only way we relate to God by faith and every man has Faith you came here because you belied you are going to come here you come here you believe you going to go through the road and you won't have an accident you come here because you believe you'll be here you sleep in your hotel room you wake up the next morning if you are not so sure you will not sleep all night thought you will die but you just know you will wake up the next morning even though he's not promised to you that's how great a faith we have even when it's not promised tomorrow is not promised to us but we have faith to pull down tomorrow and wake up the next day how much more the promises of God how much more the promis of God that have been given to us how much more with fith we can pull those promes to ourselves and say that is mine mine mine mine and you children like Isaac you are children of promise we live by the promises that's what we live by that's what you live hallelu [Applause] Glory so I get accused and CJ people like me get accused of living in the past leave alone but faith is go by and yes Faith looks forward faith is long range Vision but notice notice some men spend their lives looking back to what was and they are so bued down what happened yesterday they sacrific their present and their future and some men live only for the now they don't care where they're coming from they don't care about tomorrow like the Rich Young Ruler he said eat that F eat drink and be married and God said you fool tomorrow so some men are like that and some men are so focused on tomorrow they don't care about the present they don't care about the future theast and that's what we're talking about when you say jul all alone you're only focusing on the fure but that's not Faith Hebrews 111 is the best definition of faith that we have anywhere in recorded history let you know faith is present now faith is present hands talking about the now the evidence of things hoped for so faith is both present tense and future doesn't just look at tomorrow tomor but it's not done yet subance amen amen of things hoped for the evidence of things not sinen when you talk about not sin we are talking about the past and the future because the Bible say we understand that the walls were made from things that were not seen so that's talking about the past the Bible also say I had not seen the things God has prepared those that love him all of that is in Hebrews 11 taking care of the now Tak care of tomorrow Tak care of the past faith is right in the middle of the road CH there it gathers yesterday us tomorrow us together chran fa Hallelujah you can't just say leave it and let it go you got to address it you've got to confront it hallelujah or you'll drag that past into the future with you shout hallelujah somebody hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you hungry are you hungry lunch is waiting seated let me let me keep it to of my time here oh I mean like 50 minutes already you may be seated brother M will say please sit down please please sit down you may be seated you may please be seated amen yes sir you may please be seated all right Faith you understand Faith now not just about tomorrow not just about yesterday faith not just about now fa gathers together today tomorrow and yesterday and that's why the message message is different people are talking they never had a revation of prophet M it went over their heads that Prophet BR down Faith he said tonight represent the faith faith that went back to the Unseen to the things not seen before the foundation of the world brought down went to the Future the things which were which are the things which are to come the things that are to be the prophet W them together into a message of the Seven Seals and the Seven Thunders and Faith Message it takes care of yesterday takes care of today Tak care of tomorrow hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah glory to God Amen and that's why that's why we have a faith that helps us to understand to walk with God you can't just say Lord I'm ready now I'm ready now to serve you now he wants you to look at your life where you are coming from it's you got to repent of that past life yes I I'm not going to hold against you anymore but your respons ability like Mal for said to repent and follow him baptism and your repentance it's all about your past sins God hold you accountable for your past sins when you repent and you confess it it drops it in the of forgetfulness never to be remembered no more and if anybody's remembering them you can look them in the ey and sing to them you may remember and remember and remember all that I have done but Jesus with a special Lord forg me of every one of them but you have got to clean it up first it doesn't just go away it does not just automatically go away you have got to address it that God will address your past life repent and follow him in water baptism you may seated and then start to live for him today to live for him today so that you might obtain in the future a better Resurrection so you might inherit etal life that's Christianity that's Christian fa that's why Mal first message is so different from every message out there Mal 4 the only man that had the revelation of Jesus Christ the things which were which are the things that are to come went back before the foundations of the world went into the man of God down the word of God day AG I reveal to you the entire mystery of Jesus Christ hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God amen amen amen and the very very fact of our Christian faith forgiveness any Christian talk about forgiveness forgiveness forgives your past for let you know right now you're forgiven forgiveness don't forgive your don't forgive your future at this point in time when you ask for forgiveness when you're forgiving your neighbor you don't say I'm going to forgive for all you going to do to me in the future what kind of what kind of talk is that I forgive you and you forgive me for we I wronged you yday in the past so please let's drop that theology oh let's leave it and let it go it's like

from heaven comes a bright shining Angel what he's speaking of what he's speaking of a revelation a revelation that's the angel because angels are from God Min Spirit to minister the word to God's children because Paul said if an angel come speaking something different from what I have spoken what you heard before is false so an angel comes it's a revelation you are God's Sons and Daughters you have the authority check out every angel in Jero Joshua was there saw the captain of the Lord's host the captain himself are you for us or against us don't let no man put in bondage Ministry you shouldn't check this out challenge any Angel this is the word of [Music] God all right yeah an angel from heaven comes a brush and Angel what he speaking of a revelation blessed be the name of the Lord it don't matter how good your Revelation is you remember the first of our service this morning the and if something comes and reveals it perfectly he's a liar reveals that not the truth he's a liar he's a false Angel and here is the bomb an any a man who will pack his message is a false prophet all the brothers who pack jul br's handw on the W message false prophets Propet the only way they are released is they repent and get that evil offer them until they repent is that same angel that false anointing Spirit that's still riding and to theel from Heaven check the Revelation out God can I get an amen glory I got contest scripture forgot to read maybe see that I'm almost done I'm leaving my notes I'm just preaching you may see Glory Glory Glory you may seated see brother bam he taught us too well amen and said don't ever get personal I'm not personal against anybody I'm not and I'm calling L the message because I don't want to hold you too long I'm already holding you too long but brother bam taught us too well take your on the word don't attack personalities that's what our brothers do but preach the word stand on the word puncture the false teachings and that's what I'm saying all those Brothers Julian couldn't have strength even know that he had ministers carried his gopel who Ed that gospel they took brother Bam's words and f that lie all those lies 21 year old all those liesing all those making a God in their own image got to say whatever they wanted him to say hallelujah see let me tell you like it is it doesn't matter to me what you feel it matters not to me but I know you believe I'm talking on the hookup I know they're watching everybody going to watch it doesn't matter you [Applause] feel I am not even interested in what the brothers are saying I want to know how they clean up the false prophet anointing upon them they repent of it when you repent quickly God forgives you have you heard lately they said the fivefold ministry must not [Music] repent that's what they say and I heard it too they said and they said they said it publicly what do I have to repent of repent of all the sorcery sorcery that you pushed out that you told people they had an evil spirit for not believing that sorcery it's on tape can you [Applause] [Applause] imagine and people masquerading around is a sh and I where other the men be ashamed of ourselves brother us too well even the brother that they're talking about Tau us too well to know these brothers until they repent they don't even belong behind the pit I have never preached repentance gospel to them but my name has been taged around you're telling us to repent what's wrong with telling the Christian to repent how you become a Christian in the first instance how is repentance how is repentance a new gospel what chran that that is against repentance but I'm telling you today I'm telling you today you need to or you don't belong behind the pit I don't even care what you are talking about because the false anointing Spirit from Julian Brun that's still speaking still speaking and that's why all anointing because it was never cleaned up just riding on and turning out all kinds of filthy Revelations from the god that made in their own image not the god of Mal not the god of Mal fall either is right or those are right but is a prophet a prophet when Samuel died he was still a prophet for today is still a prophet the voice of the seventh angel hallelujah hallelujah yes you may hit me for this but I'm telling you to your face that you might be delivered who are you who do you think you are I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody they need to repent or that you fness or you are going nowhere I'm nobody I'm no big boy I'm just one of the Brethren I'm Just a Nobody I'm telling the big boys I'm telling the somebody I'm God's nobody you are God's nobody we don't have to be [Applause] [Music] [Applause] anybody all those fness a baby without blood a bath without blood contradicting Malachi first word the scures and you don't repent and you have the angel keep your angel brother keep on walking with your angel I told Angel unlike many people feel like the three Hebrew boys we are not careful in this matter either God be God this TR is God but this is God they made in their own image but not the god that out of Egypt not the god of Malachi fall hallelujah hallelujah his words don't change hallelujah hallelujah 54 Ministry what brother said the Dynamics comes down God will begin to place them into the church into the body and then and then you are going to see a Ministry we going to see an apostle a prophet an evangelist until that time we are doing the work off and that's why we say there is a Min yet now potentially leaving the work off of the Dynamics will put them in their places the voice of the Archangel in a manifested son is the position in Jesus Christ to speak the world for signs wonders and miracles for The Bling of a son for Sons and Daughters of God Son of God coming back speaking the world and flashing like lightning don't fail it there's a man that can turn on the light [Applause] can I have 20 more [Applause] minutes you may see hallu Nigeria to you to tell you whatever you do with it is your business I trust they won be so Bound by the spirit of man when Israel left when Moses came down he was so angry all these things going on are you angry or you making like love let's love let's drop it off those Spirits are not interested in love they're interested in their agenda they have a control driven agenda you are talking love you are being a simple thing you being naive they interested in love they want to conquer your territory and make you to the god they have made in their own [Music] [Applause] image and mo got angry he thre the two of stone at them they C fire God didn't tell at that point why you angry that's not good because God was angry at them and the anger of God it transfer into the heart of Moses just like the breath pains God has it trans pastor's Min preaches to you comes after you in your sin with with a heartache going after you even the Lost in the PS to bring you back to your senses so that you will get away from your sin or and Moses he took the crack tablets he got it together he mix it with water water forced them to drink it that's Moses me and humble and Lon mes he saw the evil they were doing to the word of God he was angry he forced them to drink the water the the bitter Waters of their repentance in other words he he lied on them he told it to them till they got tired of hearing it so that or the when they tempted to that fness again they know they not they know they not get off easy this easy gospel we preach do anything he's a god of love he's a god of love but he's a righteous God too love is the justice of God when you do wrong or God Judes you at the end of the road amen may be seated so right after that a few a few months after that they went further down like us Israel picked up again K raised up with their own meaning Rebellion they had a major Rebellion the word of God raised up against mean Rebellion proping to be standing and defending the word of God Moses read through all that charade Moses was an agenda driven by selfish motives go in your Bible and Moes confronted that thing he challenged it the word of God we now jul and everybody so angry it Rees a spirit of deception w we all there is that what happened and we never clean it up you may be seated since time since since other time a culture of Silence has been hoisted upon us has been forced upon us don't talk about it and even even we who don't agree with all that stuff we get swept away by this culture of Silence we don't talk about it we being we're sing too much we let it we should let it go culture of Silence you know in Acts for that we read the San Council thear the Bishops the hars they call Peter and James and John like what is going on the people on the pit and say show me where I ever try control [Music] anybody that's for politics that control is going on getting people why won't you use that inspiration for your convention all those filthy stuff trying to control churches churches have lost their sovereignity they must take permission brother just said from some headquarters to do anything at all the council called them [Music] together and they they found out they they figur they were ignorant and unlearned men that's what they think about you you don't know what the gospel says you don't know what the message says you you stand for any tummy rot you'll be afraid they say don't talk against the angel which Angel the B bring out the sword let let that angel show me there is a right type of angel from theur but some are afraid they're afraid to talk against the angel don't talk you be talking against black success show me that success line in the Bible show me in the Bible back to the Bible back to the principles that were L down P show me from the Bible [Applause] the culture of Silence the culture of Silence got us here are ignorant uned men one would tell you you obey so they told Peter and John and the brothers because they saw that they saw Jam 20133 wow something's going on here let's make sure nobody talks about this chall warn them they threaten them are afraid that their churches will be broken up because are afraid the church will be broken up they cow under these spirits falach will say those church that the seven [Music] Thunders can break up that church will be broken up what are you trying to hold on to what are you trying to hold on to minister are scared we are cowards I'll tell you again we are cowards afraid said God call I to take God at his word to stand on the world as [Music] [Music] aard so the cult of silence and what is it about don't say anything again in this name because they were afraid that if they talk about this name here everybody will go after this men and it will threaten their position of authority that was that was the issue they felt threatened wasn't about protecting the word of God they were trying to protect their positions they felt threatened their positions their integrity their influence was threatened don't speak anymore about this here how many of us we say okay and you know what the weapon they use if you ever say anything contrary what they saying they say you against the Apostle and people are scared sff they don't want to be SE against the Apostle you are cowards [Applause] because if these things are right the word of God is wrong then and when you say this things are right you are saying the word of God is wrong you are saying the words of Mal is wrong amenu I'm almost done so Peter James and John say you judge for [Music] yourself but we cannot help speak coning we have seen and heard you are not going to put me under the culture of Silence the culture of Silence put the first instance you stood up if you

devil says and that's why Brothers in the message the seventh seal should not be spoken about it wasn't written spoken about they make a mistake there a book of symbols the Bible a book of [Applause] [Music] symb silence is a symbol it doesn't mean inactivity the devil lets you think SS to you silence don't talk don't see anything but that's what it means let me show you right away reation 81 silence on half an hour but the lamb actually opened the seven SE and the Bible said silence in heaven Mal that great Elijah told us what was a silence to keep secret what was going on it shouldn't be it shouldn't be spoken about it doesn't want the devil to know it the silence doesn't mean inactivity a lot of stuff was going on but but the Lord cover what was going on with a silence many scriptures us understand that he said be still be silent and know that I am God still and Silent God is showing his goodness God is showing his mighty powers under the Silence of your Stillness

on and under the silence a lot goes on they write examination in progress silence people are doing exams they're walking and the devil understands this I can fool this ignorant and UNL people them silence and they'll keep quiet but I know I can go on doing my job because he understands that that the silence is only a symbol to cover secret to cover what's so jul don't talk don't say but the evil spirit still kept on doing his job on hatching out after Doctrine and you mustn't talk if you ever talk you are coming against the Apostle if you ever say one word how dare you cause the Apostle I'll never the that's my spiritual father I know I don't care what say but you are not going to justify the making me the evil person you are not going to going to the word Adam sinned Paul brother

reflection we pray that you strengthen everyone as we we come back lord tonight for the final kill Lord I pray that you bubble our hearts and speak to us once again we thank you Lord we bless you father in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you you appreciate brother hu you may be seated quickly I want to make a few announcement the first announcement actually I realized and I want to remind us we need to study the word of God we need to read the Bible I found that the major problem we have is that we don't study study the Bible study the message when you get these things you cannot be deceived amen now I just want to put this down is something you know but for those who do not know amen I guess it was brother to that sent this message across I've read this message earlier sometimes last year and the brother Braham in all these things that are going around the churches and so you know there was a time we have to sign documents never to go to speak the things that were preached to us in church that's right amen I signed because I have to stay you know in respect to church order I will not be hold held responsible for that I knew it was wrong and I still know it's wrong I mean in this city that's why when you see me shouting I'm free I'm free and free you don't know why I'm singing that if you are not free you may not understand what freedom is so I'm free amen but the gospel the commission that Christ gave to every believer is go e all the whole world and preach the gospel and the gospel is being preached to you in church and you are being asked to sign a bond never to go to propagate that gospel that's witchcraft that's occultism that's Antichrist spirit amen it did happen and uh why I want to read this thing again is that I believe thought of the Lord can never fail all these wrong doctrines are going on and if you let your child in into the midst of these wrong doctrines the spirit guesss on them one brother in my church he he traveled and the little boy had to be left behind and the wife had been also in these churches that are preaching all these wrong false doctrines and this boy for one Sunday alone he spent in that place he came back again to church and in the cry room this boy was shouting I am the Holy Ghost I am the Holy Ghost I am the Holy Ghost I am the Holy Ghost very poor young innocent child why because that is the dogma and the doctrine and the shouting that this group are having are you following what I'm saying but what I want to just do here is that I want to say that I called a young man and told him I said you are not the Holy Ghost I lay my hands upon him and cast out that demon that's what we should be doing When You See It cast out the demon because you have the authority to do that and since that time he never did that anymore praise God why did I do that because I know that I know and your Prophet say this in Divine Healing Divine Healing is a message that the prophet preached in 195 54 in the month of December 19th amen listen to your Prophet I'm reading from paragraph paragraph 144 but the main Center Point is 116 Thomas looked at him or Phillip rather and said Lord show us the father who who is this father you are going to he said why I have been so long with you you don't know me he said when you see me you've seen the Father the father is in me believe that I and the father are one or believe me for the very work's sake that the father is in me it is not me that doeth the works it is the father that is in me doeth the works now this is the point now and brother AB Braham now now spoke and said I am not the Holy Spirit full stop amen William Braham said I am not the Holy Spirit and then I believe I wasn't there but I want to read to you the next thing he said he said you are not the holy spirit amen but if there is anything amen he is not the Holy Spirit but those message he preaches was not of him why because of the father that dwelleth in him so let th say the Lord settle the case I am not the Holy Spirit Malachi 4 is not the Holy Spirit you are not the Holy Spirit but the holy spirit is that Spirit of the Lord Jesus that spirit that was in the Lord Jesus Christ that made him to do the works he did here on Earth do you believe that amen don't shut your ears now this is thought say the Lord so you go with this in your heart close up every other thing because we are Marching onto heaven and let us hold on to this word of God the revealed word of the hour if we keep on that we will make our journey to the end because this is the only provided message for this hour there is no other one praise the Lord you love the Lord you love the Lord you love the Lord therefore take this message take the name of this Jesus Christ with you amen child of Sorrow every
