something special for you tonight you believe that amen amen thank you Lamb of God thank you Jesus amen so just as we switch over if you have your Bibles I'd like to ask you to turn with me to the book of St John chapter three reading a couple verses there oh I'm excited tonight I hope you came under expectation for the miraculous to take place I hope you came with a shout in your heart and a worship on your lips I hope you came to meet the Lord tonight in the book of St John starting from chapter 3 3:1 a very familiar scripture and it says from verse 1 to 7 there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews and I'll read it all the way through and then I'll come back to it the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God and no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he's old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered in verse 5 verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee ye must be born again amen let's just bow our heads as we pray one more time oh Heavenly Father tonight I've paused and read your scripture Lord Lord and any man could read it but I pray that you would Breathe life into it Lord that you will come and you reveal it to your people Lord Lord and the few broken up words that I have put together Lord I pray that you would sew it weave it Lord bring it together how you want to deliver to your people Lord Lord I pray that you take me out of the way tonight Lord and Inspire the things that that that will go forth tonight and Lord I pray that it'd be such a blessing to your people that people could definitely walk here and leave this place Lord with their heart burning within them knowing that they would have heard direct from you lord lord I pray that you will do something special for your people gathered together right here in this Tabernacle and those who will connect even afterwards Lord Lord I pray that the fire of God and the presence of God will ignite people in their homes Lord in their cars wherever they are Lord that the power of God will go out Lord Lord L and signs wonders and miracles will follow Lord Lord I pray that we come into a season that we could see the manifestation of your word and be made so real among us tonight Lord Lord I pray that you have your perfect will over everything that will be said and everything that will be done Lord I pray that you anoint me Lord Lord I pray that you inspire me I pray that you would guide me Lord I pray that you would Lord bless your people in such a special way in Jesus name we pray amen amen you may have your seats at this time Glory Hallelujah you know for for a title I'll just give him a title and inspiration one time the title is Born Again Believers amen amen not average Believers not not make Believers but born again Believers amen and the inspiration is you must be born again we put we going back to basics but brandham describes it as Jesus first Doctrine you must be G be B born again amen so so you can't reach your second round or you can't reach standard two without passing standard one amen and here in the scripture and I revisit it starting back from verse one it says there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews and I want to pause there for a second because a couple things were identify there it identified where he came from or who he was because he was of the Pharisees it called him by name so he was important he was significant he was well respected because it didn't say you know a old guy or somebody came to to Jesus the identified him by name and then they said he was a ruler of the Jews so even among his people he was a leader he was somebody that was well respected he was somebody that people followed he was well taught he was trained he was educated he was somebody that could give you guidance and counsel so in this verse it clearly identified who he was in verse two it says the same meaning Nicodemus came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God you will clearly observe that he didn't say I realize that you're a teacher he said we know that so it was discussed before it was decided and agreed upon that you're teacher come from God not from the back of some some school or some Seminary but you come from God we have already discerned and and and we explored it and we could confirm who you are for no man could do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him so they were very very familiar and aware of who they were dealing with amen amen amen in verse three without a question being asked Jesus started to challenge he said verily verily I say unto you after all that listen here what going on no matter if you are the boss you could be the CEO you could be the mayor you could be the teacher you could be a professor you could be whoever the the the society and the world say you are this is the word I have for you because I am God made flesh you hear what I'm telling you he say except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God so your Works can cut it your experience don't really count in this Kingdom who people say you are or who you think you are or who people or or what people say about you doesn't matter here because there's something that you must do and that's the challenge we have in this as described by the prophet as Jesus first Doctrine you must be born again so there's something that you need to do and of course he had his questions and a run a little more and he said except a man be born of water and of the spirit so he expounded a little more so not just born again you're born of the water and the spirit yes you can't even enter so you can't see the kingdom you can't enter the kingdom unless these things take place and then he went on to say listen what is born of the flesh is flesh born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee you must be born again and that's where I want to start you must so in in in in other words you don't have an option it's not a choice it's mandatory is essential it's critical so this is not a suggestion to you you know I want to make a recommendation you know sometimes some people they say you're strong L recommend this is not one of those this is a very clear specific instruction and in a message you must be born again same title brother brandham in in paragraph 30 he said now so now remember it didn't say you ought to be born again but you must it's absolute it's absolutely you got to do it see it's a must not you ought to or you'll be better off if you did but you must be born again oh if we could just take that word this morning and break it down what it means how it's totally impossible it's essential it's that great it's totally impossible to enter the kingdom of heaven or even see it until you're born again and so many different interpretations of the word plain intellectual thing I wonder what this mean and and what the interpretation of this but it's very clear we ought to seek it out with all our heart to find out what it means amen so tonight I want to take a few moments a few minutes to explore what is this challenge that Jesus gave gave here he said listen in essence no matter who you are or who you think you are there's something you must do you must be born of water and spirit before you could even see the kingdom before you can enter the kingdom these are the things you must do these are foundational this is Back to Basics as I said this is before you do anything else if you don't have have this you're nothing it don't matter it don't matter how good if you give arms if you you know you treat your brother well and you're forgiv listen you must be born again am must hallelujah amen amen now what what what does that really mean you know another message he said no matter how much we try to think about it no matter how how we try to think we are right in saying a Creed or joining a church you're still what you were until you're actually born again of the spirits of God it doesn't change you your Creed joining Church coming here on a Wednesday and a Sunday doesn't change you you know if God do do something for your life you're the same person know coming Sunday Wednesday Friday come to a prayer meeting you service you're clean around the church you do this and you're a good person and everybody have positive things to say about you that sounds nice but if God don't give you a personal experience and you go through the process of being born of the water and spirit you're not seeing the Kingdom of Heaven you're not entering the Kingdom of Heaven that's what the message say it's very clear is English we talking here for now amen so this is something you must do you say listen it doesn't change your Creed joining Church changing your idea or your good intentions although as good as it might seem it's still not right there's something got to happen that's what we here tonight for I'm not here to talk you know I'm not here to preach and to share a good opinion and idea I am here to stir you and challenge you to tell you listen no matter how much you come to church and go back home if you don't settle and have an experience with God you have nowhere to go all you're doing is going through the emotions all you're doing is is is warming a bench of being a good church member at the end of the day we called to be much more we called to be born again Believers not make Believers and unbelievers true believers who could see this is a promise for us in the word this is something we need to do this is not an option this is not an opinion or interpretation this is something we must do we must do it's essential and critical that we get it done so it is not that that brings the new birth you said there's something got to happen New Birth is an experience something that takes place it it doesn't bring the New Birth now the different churches they say well you accept this or believe that or or it's all right it isn't now to begin with to base back the reason we have to be born again is because the Bible teaches us we were all born in sin shaped in iniquity and come in this world speaking lies then that shows us that our nature to begin with to sin to start with so we know good no matter how much we paint it up ande pretend and we do nice things and we we greet people and say God bless you and we walk and we put on a suit and a tie and a dress and we think we okay we born in sin it's in our nature it's in our nature it's in our DNA to do wrong it's in our nature to to to to go contrary but he's saying listen there's something that have to happen and if this experience could get a hold of you you could be changed and when we change then we now entitled to his promises then we entitled to his Blessing then we entitled to what he laid out for us amen so it it it goes on here he say let's base back we born in sin shaped in iniquity come to this world speaking lies then that shows in our nature to begin with it's sinful to start with we know good to begin with so we cannot claim anything by our shrewdness our sincerity or how great we are how little we are you know some people they claim meekness they want to claim that and say listen I do interfere with anybody you know I am the most humble person around I really don't want to mess with anybody and mdle with anybody say listen even with that that might be your personality that might be the way you carry about yourself or the way you feel you still have to go traditional you still have to apply this say your life it doesn't change requirement is the same in moses' time it didn't matter if you fasting and praying every day when they say listen put the blood on your door post that was the token for that day that was the requirement for that day so listen God takes no excuses it didn't matter it didn't matter who you were how long you're there listen you're Elder you're a Dey or Usher you going to church for 20 years or 60 years it didn't matter the requirement was the requirement and that's what you had to do in order to pass the test God test is coming still amen amen he goes on here he said listen you can't claim anything by asness or sincerity or how great we are how little we are or whatever more we are all together wrong to begin with and there is nothing at all that we can do about it you cannot Jesus said who by taking thought can add to the stature one measure one cubit anything an inch you you you can add a foot to yourself no by your thought you can't do that he said listen read it study it examine it meditate upon it think I I I could add to me I could add to myself I could do this and he said no it wouldn't work you can't help yourself one iota so that just throws it all out I'm so glad it does because if it laid in the thought of knowing something then only smart people could could do it he said we poor illiterate people would be left out so we wouldn't have a chance but God Chang it or never had it that way in the beginning the churches always make it complicated God makes it simple simple so it it brought down into a place where we can all all of us can see it all all of us have it it's a whosoever will that came from the message you must be born again amen it's simple it's not complicated and know it's not dramatic and complex and and we really do understand it so if you break it down a little more listen this must be so simple that the most illiterate person that the little child the mother the housewife wherever you are could understand listen you mean when I look at myself I must be born again I want to be born of the the the water and of the spirit and if I don't do that there's a consequence to that it must be so simple that everybody could understand you don't need a degree and a masters and a doctorate to try to figure it out you wherever you are should be able to understand amen that's just the way God is that's the way his word is his instructions are clear what he's saying if I paraphrase all that is that listen you need to die you need to die to yourself you need die to your thoughts and ideas and what you feel and what you think and what people say about you and if they wrote a you about you now it will be really fine that sounds good but at the end of the day God has his requirements and if you don't have that requirement that he requires if you don't have that it doesn't matter you have nowhere to go amen amen amen listen at the end of the day you have to die in a message God's way that's been made for us he said listen there are two ways man could go just two not three not four just two he said that's his way or God's way and that's right way or wrong way and your way is always the wrong way so if you thought about it cancel it one time tell yourself listen there's my thoughts and ideas is my way this have to be wrong I want to trust God's way Faith could tap into God's way that's what you want to do and your way is always wrong it's not it doesn't stand a chance God's way is the right way you can't be in your own way and in God's way at the same time so you got to get out of your own way so God could have his way in you that's right God makes a provided way God has man has always wanted to make his own way always want to do their own thing in the Garden of Eden God made a man so he didn't have to shift for nothing God made him perfect but man wanted his own way he wanted to Tamper he wanted to find out he he he was curious about this and that and the other he wanted to find as soon as he did that he fell we've went through that this week and and this is the pro Prophet speaking he said we study it in scripture he made himself a religion he didn't wait for God to make him one he made one himself and he found that that his religion his covering wouldn't work that's always been man way they tried to do it for themselves until they realize wait no I do have this figured out I do have it figured out because it's not God way that's always been man he wants his own way but God had a way so man made fig leaves and put them over him and his wife but when he come down to face God he found out it wouldn't work and I tell you friends there's been many a man and is tonight that's coming down the end of the road we'll find out that little shallow religion that you're holding on to won't work nothing short of being born again will work Jesus said except a man be born of water and of the spirit he will no wise enter into the kingdom no wise no matter if he's a Methodist Baptist Presbyterian whatever he is he'll not enter in un until he's born of water and spirit and he says born means he's changed that's it that's it he has to die before he can be born so you got to die to yourself be reborn again in Christ Jesus that's right so it can't be you going and 20 years later you still the same because you are brother this and sister that no no no no no if you're not following God's way and God's instruction goes nowhere so there's a simple for formula here brother Bram said he say listen here's the formula if you want to know it the first church was inaugurated on the day of Pentecost they were all screaming and Jesus to told told them listen take it easy don't scream Don't Preach don't do nothing just be quiet is that what he said no no no no no he didn't do that Luke 24:49 he said t in the C of jerus Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high amen after this the Holy Ghost now talking about the Holy Ghost tonight you know talking about the promises of God you know talking about the things that you have to have there and there to your heart and fight for you know this is not because we feeling to talk something we feeling to share something no this is imperative is essential and critical that you fight for this you know yes sir he say listen T until he endure the power on high after this the Holy Ghost will come upon you and you shall be Witnesses of me in Jerusalem Judea Samaria and the uttermost parts of the earth amen they went up how long to wait how long 2 days 5 minutes 5 days no they went up until something happened it's not they went up and they had a a talk with each other and they decide well I wonder if Jesus meant it in a kind of figurative way that we kind of wait and wait might be an acronym for something and no no no they went and they waited under expectation that God's word is the same yesterday today and forever amen they were all in one place and one Accord one they weren't arguing they weren't fussing fighting now I'm Sanhedrin and and I'm a Pharisee and and and no no no it never come on a group like that not a bit never come they're just waiting brothers and sisters together women went in there with them they were all up there for 10 days waiting one Accord reading the Bible a little maybe someone stand up preaching and they waited and waited and waited and they saying the blessings of God has been promised now God said he pour the Holy Ghost Joel said he would do it and we're waiting for the word to be fulfilled so that's the way we need to be we need to know these are the promises here these are the requirements here and we waiting on God to fulfill the promise amen so we have to be under expect expectation doing what we need to do and allow God to operate and work and see his word come to pass in our lives amen amen glory so in a message hearing recognizing acting on the word of God I know it seems like a lot of quotes but when you talk about born of the spirit paragraph 139 it says the Holy Ghost is a new birth we know that it's being born again of the spirit of God that's how you're born by Spirit born by the spirit that's a new birth all right you're begotten of the spirit then when you're born of the spirit you're filled with the Holy Ghost amen that's why we we come to church you know you don't come to church to sing a song and Shake Hands sure that sounds good that feels good to to have a social community that sounds good but the main thing have to remain the main thing the main thing is you have to be filled with the Holy Ghost you have to be born of the water and the spirit you have to have what it take takes that when God looked down he could say there is my spirit flowing freely there is my adopted Sons and Daughters there are the people that apply the promises and the words that I leave that we could see it manifested in them because they wait on the expectation they they they accept the Promises by faith and know that he will bring it to pass amen amen glory I know we listened to to that tape recently adoption part one and from paragraph 4 6 in there I mean that was so powerful that was so tremendous it was so timely from from paragraph 46 it said but the Believers talking about the land of adoption you see all this is connected together you know because you can't have the land of adoption if you you don't Del into the Holy Ghost and you don't pray and cry and sigh to get it and to ensure that you are filled yes sir he said but the Believers the Caleb and Joshua outfit that was going on to the promise they moved on over in the land and took the land and settled along in the land as a possession and we never stop at justification sanctification let's go onto the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's where we want to go tonight let's not stop at Believing on the Lord Jesus being baptized let's not stop because he's cleaned us up from a life of sin but now we press into a position to a promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost for Peter said on the day of Pentecost for the promises unto you and your children and to them that's are far off even as many as the lord of the go of God should call so Ephesus here sets us like Joshua positionally so that promise is yours tonight that's not just something you read and you know God promised the Holy Ghost he promised it to you tonight you could be filled tonight you could receive the Holy Ghost tonight he says so Ephesus here sets us like Joshua positionally you notice Joshua after crossing over the land and taking the land divided the land Ephraim here Manassa here and and and one here God here Benjamin here he divided the land and notice oh this just burns our hearts each one of those Hebrew mothers giv births talking about birth pains here now to those children she spoke the very place in her labor pains where they would be positioned in the Promised Land by inspiration she spoke where they will be oh it's a great study if we could only get into the details which will take hours so we wouldn't do that tonight but he say you know each of those mothers when she called out epim when she was in labor positionally placed him where his feet were setting in oil just exactly every one of them wherever they were at and look at this now Joshua not knowing this but by inspiration led by the Holy Spirit after being in into the promised land give each man his promise exactly LED of the Holy Spirit after being into the promised land give each man his promise exactly what the Holy Spirit promised through the birth back there so although he he wasn't there by the birth the same Holy Spirit was able to inspire him so he could now allocate and and positionally place people exactly where the bird said that they should be amen how that God has set into the church through labor pains oh they get tremendous sometime when a church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world Believing on the Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost and we know it is just as real to us as it was to Pentecost how they groan and cry on labor pains but when they are born and positionally Born Into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set in the church some Apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists then he give into there speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues knowledge wisdom Gifts of healing all kind of Miracles so it goes to show it's tied together this Promised Land This adoption land that we speak of is tied back to being filled with the holy spirit being born and positionally born amen so we want to look at that first doctrine of Jesus and see how can I I I apply this to my life is it applicable now yes because you need to be filled you need to be sealed if the goal is perfection and adoption and every promise that he has promised to you you need to do the things that he require of you to get it yes sir Glory thank you Jesus Hallelujah going back to that message hearing recognizing and acting on the word of God this is just just to look out a little bit people come up and say got the Holy Ghost too say look the way they live it doesn't last from one Revival to another from one meeting to another it's made manifest they haven't got it so they get exposed they could say what they want but when we look at the actions the actions must line up as well so I have a note here no imitations we not looking for imitations we're looking for the real thing we looking for the real silver dollar we don't want a fraud we don't want a fake it says if a man is born of the spirit of God or a woman they have fruits of the spirit they walk Godly they live that life see they keep away from the things of the world God moves in them and makes himself manifest and proves that he's God working in there the other is impersonating see impersonations that's what's been all the way down impersonating look at ishma and Isaac and all the way down impersonating look at the prophet Moses and look at the prophet bam see see how they come down look at Judas and look at Jesus and Jesus predicts that this Holy Spirit in the last days would be the Seal of God now what would be the mark of the beast would be to reject the Seal of God for all that didn't have the Seal of God had the mark of the beast and if it's two spiritual marks one of them will be the true Mark and the other would be an apostasy can you see it look at the Mark the Old Testament when the trumpet blowed the Jubilee every so many years the slaves went free because the trumpet sounded well everyone that wanted to be free could go but listen some of them they love to be slaves so when brother Bram speak about three kinds of believers they sit together know they worship together they go conventions and meetings and thing together but some of them love to be slaves in church good good church members you know love to be slaves he said listen everyone who wanted to be free could go but some of them love to be slaves so they took them to an altar and in the post of the church they bought their air with an owl and they were marked forever they will always serve their master and today you'll hear the gospel message on truth now you can be free if you want to and I say tonight you could be free if you want to you could receive the Holy Ghost if you want to you could be born born of the spirit if you want to but there are those who like to be slaves you like the Taskmaster you like the relationship in bondage right so they bore your air and he says he BS you in the air and you'll always be an intellectual believer Hallelujah he didn't say you'll be a sinner no he didn't say to throw out the church but you're intellectual believer Hallelujah you'll be religious soundss familiar second Timothy talk about that having a form of godliness but denying the power amen he say listen You'll Be always be an intellectual believer you'll be religious and you'll go to church so it's people sitting in the message we're talking about we're not talking about other denominations and other groups no in the church you go to church but never receive the Holy Ghost why see then you serve that for the rest of your day now the mark of the beast or the Seal of God we getting so close this is the prophet message this is his words so so don't be surprised you find it not resonating with you this is what you need to fight for he said because there's a next group too a next group who are slave they they are bondage they listen they are so bound that they come into church Sunday Wednesday prayer meeting they fasting but they slaves they will never receive the Holy Ghost but they come back and forth nice easygoing church members we want to fight against that we want to to stand up and have a opposition against that because that's not what we call upon that's not what we call on to we call unto a higher level we call unto the manifestation of the sons of God Amen my my my we we want to be called out ones we want to be special we want to live up to our calling I just kind of skip through here in a message five definite identifications of the True Church of the Living God come on right he say you don't know nothing about it until you receive the Holy Ghost so let's just pause right there he say you don't know anything about it until you receive the Holy Ghost so it doesn't matter how long you're in the message it don't matter if you have a reserved seat or if you're well respected and we shake your hand a particular way and celebrate your birthday and your anniversary it doesn't matter he say you don't know nothing about it until you receive the Holy Ghost you say I accept Jesus as my personal savior that's all awesome brother have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe if you don't you can't even call him Lord because he's not your Lord amen he's a historical being that you by faith have accepted but when he's come into you by the Holy Ghost then he is your lord no man can call Jesus Lord only by by the Holy Ghost until you're born of the spirit that's where we want to go tonight until you're born of the spirit and the Holy Ghost is in you then if you are you're born into this Kingdom and you're part of the church you're the called out ones amen then you become called out not not not not not by saying a Creed and saying two lines and you could quote two scriptures and a paragraph in the message no no no when the Holy Ghost in you then you could become one of the call out ones then you can acknowledge him as your Lord amen that's when he become real to you he said Can Life come out of a corn except the corn have life in it if a grain of corn is put in the ground one is dramatized and one is not the one that is not dramatized can it live again the answer is no not by no means because there's nothing in it there's no deep on the inside calling to a deep so there's nothing to respond there's no life in there there's nothing in it although materially it make just as good it look like corn you can make corn flakes it it it's it's all right it has some usefulness but really it have no life it'll make listen he say you can make some cornbread as the other it look good on a shelf as the other one will but if it hasn't got life in it in it it cannot Rise Again a man that's good and and we highlighted this earlier you could be a good man can be just as as good a church member as any Christian a man that's a good man can be just as good a citizen you you you could be respectable in your community you could be some somebody they need prayer they call you you're the first person to think of love and that sounds good he said but you could be moral when you die that's it unless he's born again of the spirit of God because everything that had a beginning has a end God is the only thing that's Eternal therefore we are part of God by receiving his life Jesus said I give unto them eternal life the Greek word there is Zoe meaning God's own life the only way you could ever live again is to be raised up again amen because God is eternal and you've got eternal life and skipping Dre he said he that believeth on me has eternal life and I'll raise him up at the last day raise him up again so he not raising your flesh you know he he raising the life that in you that eternal life that he plac in you that is what raising up he said listen Jesus you can't go to Heaven until you're a member of that church you can't be a member until you're born and this is where it gets good and now let me smother you a little you can't be a member unless God has called you to be a member am how happy you ought to be for that to know that you were predestinated before the foundation of the world and your name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life for such a time as this called unto Perfection called for these Pro promises to be made real in your life so this is not by chance we don't GA in vain we don't we don't get together hoping that God have a special promise for us no no no no no he chose us before the foundation of the Earth because he had a special mission for you but to accomplish that he needs to give you special tools he need to make sure you trained and you have special skills so he send Special Love gifts for you so he leads special promises just for you it skipped the wise and The Prudent it skipped the proud it skipped the the intelligent and smart and those who try to figure it out and he chose you for this time to send this message to you you have a part to play because many are called you know few are chosen you're one of the chosen ones as a result he chose you and lay these promises for such a time that when it revealed unto us we hear that like a eagle call so it resonate in us and we realize wait now what we doing all the time I'm not a chicken I don't belong here I in this world but I find I don't feel like everybody else I don't dress like everybody else I don't look like everybody else because I'm not meant to be here my father is at a higher level he he called me onto Perfection and adoption and he gave me the Victory and he give me tests he give me trials and guess what he sent a tutor he sent go Governors to ensure that my signature is like his he want to know that I'm about his business he want to know that the things he lay out for me I could pass it the test they set for me I could pass it and guess what he is just and fair he say if I fail the test now you know what going to happen do it again you fail it again do it again listen he don't believe in failures he believe in success he want you to overcome he say you're more than conquerors he say you're more than Overcomers so he know you have what it takes but you and I are not the same you might be faster than me you might be slower than me but at the end of the day we all have to come through that's why the writer say some through the water some through the flood some through great trials all have to come through the blood in Egypt it didn't matter I say that it didn't matter who you thought you were it didn't matter if you were old or young if you're rich or poor it didn't matter what your position was whether you thought you was a low slave whether you were in charge or a supervisor or a manager it didn't matter when he gave his requirements you had to yes sir I'm reporting for Duty that's what I'm required to do because a certain trumpet song and freedom was under way and I'm here saying tonight just like I said last week this is the Year of Jubilee freedom is under way so you have something to do we don't want to be slaves we don't want to be in bondage we don't want to be bounded we want to have what it takes so when we hear that eagle call when that trumpet sound we are ready we are ready for our March and orders because we train for this we prepare for this we have been in the vineyard day in day out night in night out not in vain not wondering listen we have this message and we've gone through the message it has taken years the prophet has come off the scene but his message is still here and we have gone through and pulled out the things that are applicable to us yes it's our responsibility to know what our inheritance is it's our responsibility to know what God left for us if we don't somebody else might take it I don't want to give away my inheritance because of ignorance I want to ensure that whatever he left for me I want it like like Joshua and Caleb when Caleb say listen give me my Mountain don't look at my age it don't matter if it's left for me I want it if the Holy Ghost was left for me I want it if that promise is mine I want it it doesn't matter what you think or what you feel it don't matter if I ball and scream and cry if this is what it takes I wanted because it's mine This Promise was left for me and I'm not playing I'm not not putting it a chance I'm going to apply this to my life and ensure that this promise is mine I claiming it by faith I claiming it knowing that he who left the promise is more than able to make a way to ensure that that promise could come to pass amen my my my hallelujah thank you Jesus blessed be the name of the Lord thank you Lamb of God what we need what we need at the end of the day is not more talk it's not it's not more Ling is not fancy fellowships what we need is a guide we need somebody who know the we when you hear a guide it assumes that you gone before you know the PA you're not trying to figure it out if the guy trying to figure it out he's a fraud he would have gone the way before and say listen come this is the way to go don't go there this is the way if you take this way this way will lead you to the promised land that's a guide brother brandom in a message Hallelujah a guide Hallelujah paragraph 39 he said a guide isn't going to take one over this way and one over that way he's not going to send one East and send one West that's not how they work he say he's going to keep it together and if we let the Holy Ghost keep us together we'll be one if we just don't let the devil pull you off on the wrong road we'll be one heart one mind one Accord by one Spirit the Holy Spirit the guide of God that will guide us to all truth that's right but you got to follow your guide yes sir said look at Nicodemus he needed a guide yet he was a smart man he was a teacher about 80 years old he was of the Pharisees or the Sanhedrin Courts of council Ministerial Association he was one of the greatest men a teacher in Israel a master at it think a master teacher yes he know the laws he know the laws he studied it but when it come to being born again he needed a guide yes sir he was hungering for it he know there had to be something different his expression to Christ that night proved it it proved also this the feeling of the rest of them but none of them had the the very audacity that he had there was none of them that could come up there and do what he did you all people condemn you know sometimes we condemn Nicodemus we say you know he come by night because was he was so embarrassed and Afraid and ashamed and he didn't want anybody to know what he was doing so the scripture say you know he went to Jesus by night brother brandom said you know although that might be so listen to this he say he got there he arrived so tonight somebody might say I don't know you're going to church on a Wednesday night Sunday same way looking the same way I don't know what wrong with them they could St and and hook up you know they could connect you know but you know what they went anyway they came anyway because they were determined to Touch the Hem of His Garment that night he was hungering for something so he didn't stand a far off he did what none of the others was willing to do they say he got there he arrived I know some people won't even start day or night but he got there he needed a guide and he said Master we from the San hedron Court we know that you are a teacher come from God why did he know it he was Vindicated see he wanted to know what this new birth meant and he went to the right one because God had Vindicated that this was his guide Jesus look what he said Master we know thou art a teacher comes from God cuz no man can do the things that you do Les God be with him it was a Vindication there that there was a living God inside him keep in mind this was an educated man a well respected man a learned man a great man in society he was an elder he was somebody that would have seen a lot that would have experienced a lot that would have been exposed to a lot and he needed a guide so who am I and who are we tonight when we have such a guide when we have the holy spirit to guide us to all truth to guide us from day to day to guide us to our promises amen he said listen he said no man could do the things that you do lest God be with him it was a Vindication there that there was a living God inside of him what he testified not me that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me verily I say unto you the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing that doeth the son likewise the father work it and I work it hither too in other words God showed him what to do that's what a guy does he showed him what to do and he went and just acted it out he didn't do anything until God told him to do it amen that's a real Frank facts of it if we just move and wait till the spirit moved us to do it that's it and then be so completely lost in Christ that he don't have to shove you around like he does me but the first little knot of his head you're ready and nothing is going to stop you because because you know it's the will of God that's how we want to know God God just have to nud and we know what to do we know that's his will that's not my thoughts and ideas that's not your opinion or your recommendation but that's the will of God because we in tune and in sync and in line with his thoughts and his idea my my my God isn't he wonderful tonight amen amen amen it said listen wonderful he know the Traditions that he had served maybe by the Pharisees Sadducees and whatever more he had served those Creeds all along and seen nothing happen but here comes a man on the scene saying that he is a promised Messiah of the Bible then he turns around and does the very works of God Jesus said if I don't do the works of my father then don't believe me but if you can't believe me believe the very works that I do for the testify of me then no wonder Nicodemus could say master we know you're a teacher come from God for no man can do the things that you do without go God being with him see he needed a guide though he was a master of the thing he was a master of his church he had dignity and he had prominent places he was a great man no doubt respects from all people through the country but when it come to being born again he needed a guide so do we we need a guide amen blessed be the name of the Lord the musicians could get get ready as we wind down Hallelujah in that message you must be born again Hallelujah wonderful says now remember thank you Jesus I believe that Jesus Christ says this to every human being Hallelujah on his first Doctrine Yes except a man be born of the water that's the word washing of the Water by the word and of the spirit which is the holy spirit confirming the word he cannot see the kingdom of God kingdom of heaven do you do you believe that amen see by the water washing of the Water by the word word and Truth he is the truth water and spirit the spirit coming with the word to confirm the word play Lead Me Lord I'll follow hallelujah hallelu hallelujah making God live in me see we cannot understand the Kingdom of Heaven till that's happened till we go through that process and that experience then when that begins to happen that we see the word in US born of the word and spirit manifesting itself leading me not away from the word the spirit leads me to the word and the word living in me making God manifest in your life you'll never understand the kingdom of God and can no wise enter into it God bless you let's stand Hallelujah you love the Lord [Music] tonight he's so wonderful to think that in such a time as this Hallelujah he would leave his promises there to Born Again Believers Hallelujah he is seeking out tonight those that are sincere in heart those that hunger and thirst after righteousness those that want to be drawn closer to him those that want more of him those that want to be so familiar with his will and his way that they want every single promise that he left for them he's saying You must be born again it's not good enough to go to church and go back home it's good it's not good enough to sa I'm associated with a certain group is not good enough to live the same way day in day out we must have an experience with him we must be filled we must be sealed we must be filled with the Holy Ghost we must be born of the spirit amen thank you Jesus let's just
