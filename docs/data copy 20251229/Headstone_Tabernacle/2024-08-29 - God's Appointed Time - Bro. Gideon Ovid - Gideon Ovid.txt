sounds like a come under expectation like you come to cause something to happen sounds like you come excited about Jesus tonight amen thank you Jesus Hallelujah good evening at this time I want you to uh if you could open your Bibles with me you open a scripture from The Book of Ecclesiastes chapter 3 a couple of verses there reading from verse 1 to 8 and it says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to we weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to Cast Away stones and a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to Cast Away a time to Rend and a time to swow a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of Peace may we bow our heads as we open a word of prayer oh Heavenly Father we thank you for your words that we have read tonight Lord I pray that you come and you would Inspire it tonight anybody could read the scripture Lord but I pray that tonight you'll take me out of the way and speak lips of air to your people Lord Lord I pray that revelation will come down and you will Lord Minister unto your people gathered here tonight and those that may hear it in their homes in their workplaces wherever they are on the internet Lord Lord those that are gathered together I pray that you specially would visit them tonight May no one leave this this place the same way that came Lord Lord I pray that you will anoint me Lord we thank you for the the the song service and the musicians and the the deacons and the ushers and the the the the people that put their shoulders to the wheel to to cause this thing to happen Lord Lord we want to be careful to give you all the praise honor and glory in Jesus name we pray amen you may have your seats at this time amen blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah we read that scripture about time and seasons and purpose and the the title tonight is God's appointed time so we're going to speak a little bit about time tonight and we want to take our time to do so amen now I just want to start simply by saying as we as we put a context to it that God's time is perfect he doesn't make mistakes he doesn't have accidents he doesn't have mishaps he doesn't have things that are out of his will and out of his plan because he is God time doesn't wait on anybody it doesn't stop it doesn't need you or me it doesn't depend on us it doesn't matter our opinion time is time it doesn't stop for us it doesn't pause or slow down or speed up even if your battery and your clock fails time continues it doesn't matter where you are time still rolls on even if you don't believe it or you deny it time is Time and Time continues it might feel like it's moving slow but you can't slow it down sometime it appears to be running away you'll say the time is moving so quickly but that doesn't depend on you your belief doesn't influence it that's good that's good there is always an appointed time and God always has a time appointed to achieve his purpose and to achieve his will amen and that applies to your life in every aspect no matter how you feel tonight whether you were tired coming here tonight whether it's Montana and you have bills du it still is time that God has set aside to meet with you tonight nothing happens by chance so even people that are looking at this right now it's your opportunity to hear this right now he has selected this time for you to hear it amen he has predestinated you for this time amen you know some in school a a a student may go whe whether standard one or form one or what whatever grade or whatever stage and you feel like it's a long journey it's a long process the beauty about school is that there's a very specific time that's appointed beforehand for the test to come exam time be it end of term end of year end of the period so in in in in our context here we may have CXC or Cc or something like that after form five that time that doesn't change if the teacher stays home it doesn't change if there's a holiday or or school over early it doesn't change the exam date the exam date Remains the Same because that is the time appointed for exams that's the time in which you'll be tested on whatever you were supposed to learn it's just like with God he selects his time in advance the difference is he doesn't tell you when the exam coming exam could be tonight exam could be tomorrow it could be next year there could be next month but one thing for certain is that it's coming you're going to be tested you're going to be tried and we'll see it he said he never promised to make it easy he never promised that it'll be a bed roses but he promised that you'll be victorious he promised that you'll overcome he promised that you're more than a conqueror that whenever that time comes his word will not return void and he will fulfill his purpose that he has set forth for you amen amen so he always operates with a purpose in mind he doesn't do things by chance it is not random or haphazard not viky VI and he didn't come to call a group he came for individuals so you'll be tested as individuals he's calling individuals he didn't call you out of leysia into the bride age to just leave you there he didn't just call you for calling your sake he called you out for a purpose he didn't just bring you out to the Methodist Church and the Baptist Church the Anglican and Catholic church and wherever you came from to put you into another denomination no no no no no no no he called you out with a specific purpose and he has an appointed time for you to become a manifested son and daughter of God to prove to the devil that you're not like Eve that's his purpose that's his plan amen now if I were look in in in in the Book of Genesis Chapter 18 and you're familiar with the scripture because we talking about abraam abam from verse 10 it said and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son Sarah heard it in the T door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of woman therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I shorty bear a child which I'm old and in verse 14 he says is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son so I want to tell you that when God visited Abraham and told him you'd have a son by Sarah his wife God dropped time on him that was a promise when God leaves a promise for you he drops time like a time capsule he just leaves it there and walks away because he knows if he made the promise he is more than able to bring it to pass whether you believe it whether you clap tonight whether you say Amen his promise is his promise and it will be achieved amen now in a message the junction of time I just want to want to want to put this here he said when in paragraph 68 he said when lot and Abraham another time when Abraham was to be the ruler of the world his seed was to scatter over the Earth so this later on he had lot his nephew with him which was a relative as we know and what a beautiful picture today of the cold formal indifferent Church to the spirit born elected called out separated Church of the Living God so that's the contrast we have there Abraham and lot they dwell together on the same plane but it finally come to a time where lot took his great group and went down into Sodom and Gomorrah where they'd be popular where they' take a choice of the land and Abraham stayed in the will of God and took the poor of the land Sarah his beautiful wife and Abraham stayed on the pore of the ground in order that they could serve the Lord God doesn't promise listen he doesn't promise a flower bed of ease don't falsify a Christian and don't falsify the message by telling them that everything is going to be all right there's nothing going to harm you don't tell them that there's nothing going to ain't no trials or nothing don't tell them that that's wrong as a poet said must I be carried on to heaven on a flower bed of ease While others fought to win the prize and sail through bloody seeds no sir God doesn't promise ease and prosperity this is not Prosperity Gospel tonight this is not just a jump and shout and shout hallelujah and you go back home no no no this is the word of God he promised Grace to endure in every time is the grace that we look to that's what you need to overcome to be able to accomplish that that that he set out to you amen so when God gives a promise and he sets a plan in motion he drops time on it I want you to remember that he drops time on it at that point nothing could stop it no word no necromancy no obia nobody say and I I don't feel that that I don't feel like work out to know I tell you if somebody tell you it don't feel like it that's one sure sign that God probably made that promise because if man could understand that you don't need Faith you could just do it of your own accord amen so I just want to quickly look at Noah in Genesis 6 verse 6 and it says and it repented the Lord and you know it that he made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart so God was upset he couldn't believe that man had become so evil and in verse 7 said and the Lord said I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the Earth both man and Beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repented me that I have made them but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord so it doesn't matter if a thousand on your right side or 10,000 you could find Grace in the eyes of the Lord you could live a life pleasing to God it doesn't matter what your wife think or your neighbor think or your boss says about you you can have a testimony that you please God Amen that was Noah's testimony tonight and in verse 9 he said these are the generations of Noah he was just a man and perfect in his generations and he walked with God who do you walk with tonight who are you walking with tonight are you walking with the radio walking with a book or magazine who you walking with they say he walked with God and in verse 10 he begat Three Sons Shem ham and jaffet the Earth was corrupt before God and the Earth was filled with violence and God looked upon the Earth and behold it was corrupt for All Flesh had corrupted his way upon the Earth and God said unto Noah the end of All Flesh is come before me for the Earth is filled with violence through them and behold I will destroy them with the earth now I'm here to tell you that when God told Noah his plans to destroy the people of the Earth God dropped time on that promise he made the promise and he dropped time no I going to destroy everything I'm upset I'm vexed I can't believe the violence he dropped time and he walked away the rain was coming whether Noah's family believed it or not whether it took 10 years or 120 years it was coming at the time appointed in the message of statue of a perfect man paragraph 250 1 he said speaking of Noah Prophet said he had patience cuz he had Faith yes sir he had virtue he had knowledge that God was right he had Temperance he didn't fly loose say well I don't know what it's all about I've lost my popularity out there no no people don't care for me no more I'll go out there and start all over New again no no he had patience God promised God will do it God will do it cuz God said so what has he said about you tonight God said so and I could see his son coming around and say dad you know stroke his hand over his long gray hair you know and he was hundreds of years old you know sitting there said I know you're a old patriarch that sounds like a compliment to me you know Dad I know you're old and responsible and you are the head of the house and the family and we look up to you and we respect you I love you Daddy but could it been possible that you could have been a little bit wrong oh no no no no no why God said so well Daddy this is six days that we sit up here and and you know the door closed and and everything exciting is going on outside that we can't see at the end of the day his Fai was pegged and pitched on the fact that God said so and if God made a promise to him God just Dro time on it am just drop time on it setting up there with his big old dry Ark sitting right there it's all pitch inside and out and we've been all these years building on it and you stood out there and preach till you turned gray and bald and here you are up here now trying to say such and such a thing and the people are laughing and throwing Rotten Tomatoes and things against the s of it look there what you're doing why you know be patient son that's Noah's encouragement be patient son amen sometimes the vision might take longtime the promise don't unfold just yet but be patient son God dropped time on it it must come to pass be patient he went on he said are you sure it will rain his daughter in law said father you know it will rain but we've been all these years waiting we've been preparing and you told us it's going to rain a week ago and we were in here and the doors are all shut and here we are walking around in here and the the sun just scorching right down like it was but it'll rain how do you know God said so now when you get that way add it but if you ain't got it that way don't don't try at it it won't work it won't work on healing it won't work on nothing else see it's got to blending with the materialist vulcanized to that's right got to add it patience with God's promise yes sir Noah believed it and he had patience with God 120 years which is why when God give him the plans to destroy the people of the earth God just dropped time on it am although 120 years pass that was time God dropped that on it in the Book of Genesis chapter 37 speaking of Joseph he said in verse 27 come let us sell him to the Israelites and let not our hand be upon him because the brothers didn't want to kill him let's sell him into slavery for he's our brother and our flesh and his Brethren will content that sound like a good idea sometimes you try to rationalize it and you figure it out and you think you know what I have the answer I don't want to be coming across too bad so I will do this or I will go here instead or I'll do it my way he said in verse 28 then there passed by midianites merchantmen and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to the Israelites for 20 pieces of silver and they brought Joseph into Egypt Egypt you know what the brothers didn't know when you look at Joseph when the brothers dropped him in the well and sold him into slavery the clock started God dropped time on it because God knew this is where I want him and this is the beginning this is his season here this is where his Journey Begins not in his father's house in Egypt because it was just a matter of time for him to become a ruler in Egypt but he couldn't be a ruler in Egypt in his father's house so when he reached in there and he was sold God just dropped time on it and watch it watch that promise unfold and manifest itself in Psalms 105 verse 17 it says he sent a man before them even Joseph who was sold for a servant whose feet they hurt with feets he was laid in Iron until the time that his word came the word of the Lord Tried Him the king sent and loosed him even the ruler of the people and let him go free he made him Lord of his house ruler of all his substance and verse 22 to bind his princes at his pleasure and teach his Senators wisdom this is the the byproduct of the timing of God when God has an appointed time or a time appointed for you there is nothing that could hinder that that that that process nothing could stop the journey it might seem long it might seem slow it may seem outside of what you think it should be your mind may not even conceive the journey itself but once God dropped time on it it's over it's over if you could only get a revelation of that that you may feel down tonight you may feel like I've been burden for so long I've been crying out for my children for so long I'm looking for a breakthrough for so long I've been calling out I've been crying out I want to be filled I want to be healed I want to be delivered this sickness has bound my body for so long but God dropped time on it and when that time is up it's like an alarm nothing could cause the alarm to stop nobody could change the time time is only God Alone could adjust that only God Alone could fix that once the time is set the judge J M is sure the outcome is perfect nothing could stop [Music] [Applause] it switching quickly in the Book of Judges I know it's a lot of scriptures but in Judges chapter 16 verse 21 speaking of Samson it says the Philistines and we know we know the story with Delilah but in this case this was was after the Philistines took him verse 21 put out his eyes brought him down to Gaza and bound him with feets of brass and he did grind in the prison house listen to verse 22 very very significant verse it says how be it the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven from the time they cut his hair God dropped time on it amen was just a matter of time before his hair grew out again it didn't matter if they laugh if they make Sports if they talk about him if they write an autobiography God had already placed his time and once that time run out it's almost like I forgot what it's called you know there's a little time clock with sand falling and the sand will fall fall fall fall and when it's empty at the top time is up once every grain Has Fallen yeah there is no no no object no element no body external that could change the outcome of that the time is over it has elapsed there is no more space there there there is no more room to change he that is filthy is filthy still he that is Holy is Holy still he that is righteous is righteous still because time has elapsed and you have reached the appointed time that God has set before the foundation of the Earth Amen in verse 23 it says then the Lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice on to dig on their God and to Rejoice so they wanted to have a party wanted to gather and rejoice for they said our God had delivered Samson our enemy in into our hands what they didn't realize is that from the moment they cut his hair God dropped time on it and he sent him inside like a secret agent inside the enemy's Camp he said imagine we want to have a party because we've captured and listen listen listen what it say our God Deon has delivered Samson our enemy into our hands Hallelujah you see how perspective could be skewed they're not seeing that God Almighty took Samson and put him in the midst of the enemy's camp in verse 24 when the people saw him they praised their God for they said our God had delivered into our hands our enemy and the destroyer of our country which slew many of us you remember he took the Jawbone of a donkey a brittle bone and he killed a thousand Philistines with steel helmets in verse 25 it came to pass when their hearts were merry that they said call for Samson that he may make a spot and they call for Samson out of the prison house and he made them Sport and they set him between the pillars talk about put him in putting him in the right place between the pillars they put him reminds me of Jesus has often said if if Satan only knew that the blood will make the difference they never crucify him if the Philistines only knew that putting Samson between the pillars would have been the demise of all of them they never put him there and Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand suffer me that I may feel the pillars where upon the house standards I don't want any post any random pillar I want the loadbearing walls I want the ones that holding up the structure the important ones the ones that can't do without if I knock it down everything falls I want to shake it from the foundation and Samson said listen I want to feel the pillars where upon the house standed that I may lean upon them now the house was full of men and women and all the Lords of the Philistines were there and they were upon the roof about 3,000 men and women that beheld while Samson made spot and Samson called upon the Lord and said oh Lord God remember me I pray thee strengthen me I pray thee only this once oh God that I may be at once avenge of the Philistines for my two eyes and Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which a house stood and on which it was borne up of one of his right hand and the other with his left and Samson said let me die with the Philistines and he bowed himself with all his might and the house fell upon the Lords this is the big boys now and upon all the people that were therein so the dead which he slew at his death were more than that which he slew in his life am we talking principality Powers wickedness in high places those were the Devils that he was shaking those were the ones that that that he was fighting against the big boys the the the the the the ones with the high titles you see he had his day he was a well-renowned hero killing a thousand Philistines like we said with the Jawbone of a donkey when his hair was cut and he lost his eyes God dropped time on him and the growth had begun and it was just a matter of time before he could push down the pillars and destroy the Philistine and we go on a little bit in a message absolute paragraph 255 just like David he was a chosen King when he was a little Ruddy thing he wasn't a a a man that you would look from a fan say that stature boy look look look at that character walking there you can tell boy the qualities that that is a king in the making no no no no no he said just like David he was chosen King when he was just a little Ruddy thing see all them great big fellows speaking of his brothers won't he look pretty with a crown on his head take the older son Jesse said Samuel said God refused him so it doesn't matter the way you feel tonight you know it doesn't matter when you look in the mirror what you see you know what we matching here is what God's seeing God refused the ones that look stately the ones that look Burly the ones that look strong and bold and brave God refused that you know but God chose who he wants God had an appointed time to see the king he want in position so they say God refused him he brought all his sons up and Jesse when you bring all the son Samuel said haven't you got any anybody else because the God I serve is the same yesterday today and forever he wouldn't lead me astray he wouldn't guide me wrong so if he tells me go to the house of Jesse and anoint one of the sons to be king and I do get a testimony based on the one to show me it have to have one or two or three missing are there any more perhaps those that seem insignificant is there a little group that I could look for and find that I could pour my spirit upon is is there somebody sing and crying in a corner that that might be a little humble sister tonight that I could visit so it doesn't matter the outside appearance now hear this he said why he's a little bitty stoop shouldered Rudy looking fellow so that is not really the one you want but we have a next one this one little bitty you know he kind of small he he does sound suited because according to the thinking that I grew up with according to popular opinion he is not the kind of person you will look for to be king he don't really fit the criteria after all he he dressing modestly and she wearing long dress and she not cutting her hair and and he not smoking and drinking that's not really we were looking for somebody a little more social that's not what he's saying here he said listen this don't fit the the natural mold that we might be looking for but you know what go get him that is the one we might be looking for and as soon as he come and walk before the prophet the spirit fell on him he ran with the oil he didn't walk and say come come come you are the one he ran with the oil amen and poured the whole horn on his head and said this is your king that's it yes sir you see that's the way God is that's the way he is so even before that he had having the encounter with Goliath and he showing that H he really made us something boy he really know the word boy cuz he come and he with bravado who's that uncircumcised Philistine David was taking care of his father the Sheep that's what he was used to from the time Samuel anointed him and the Horn of oil was poured on his head God dropped time on him it was just a matter of time matter of time before he was King it didn't matter his brother's opinion you know that's right it didn't matter well uncle say he heard what took place and you know he have a different view of how things should go down it should really be the firstborn or the second born is the tallest you know so he should really be no no no no no no no God dropped time on David from the time he was anointed that was it it didn't matter what you think or what you said or what you felt or how you move or what somebody say it didn't matter What mattered is that God made a promise and dropped time so you just had to wait just had to wait and you would see the manifestation of it amen switching quickly around in a message God manifesting his gifts speaking of Moses he says then we find him one day Hing his father-in-law's sheep coming down an old familiar path he was accustomed to that and all of a sudden his attention was attracted to some great phenomena that was a bush that was burning with fire that was not consumed and Moses he never question the bush as we would today he just drew aside and walked up to it and wanted to find out what was going on and when you approached it reverently God spoke to him amen amen God spoke to him when he approached it reverently and when we approach God in the same manner God will speak to us but never in a critical way can we approach God and expect God to speak back to us we've got to approach him in a reverent way perhaps what if Moses would have said being that I am raised up as a scientist keep in mind he was the son of Pharaoh's daughter he was educated in maths and Science and and every Egyptian culture and methodology he would have been familiar with that's what he would have gone through he would have had the best tutors and governors and guidance so here he is if he were to use his own intellect this might have been in his opinion he said you know I raised up as a scientist and as a master in Egypt I've mastered all the Arts I will wait and find out when the fire goes off the bush perhaps I'll do a little test then I'll take some leaves take it to the lab and find out just why those leaves did not burn what kind of a chemical was on on those leaves that would not burn in that great heat if he would have approached it in that standpoint in a scientific research God would have never spoke to him that the reason today that people doesn't get along with God as they should is because they are trying to scientifically prove everything and God is never known by science if you can prove God then it's no more an act of Fai you cannot prove God by science you've got to accept him by an Act of Faith so he grew up as the son of Pharaoh's daughter well trained you know he was trained to rule and to fight but you see when he saw the burning bush and had an experience with the Almighty see that is when God dropped time on him so you could run your run all the time but you see after that experience the clock start that's when it now start the action and the drama now start because just a matter of time before you have a Exodus because God said way before that my people will sour in a Strange Land and they'll be enslaved and I will bring them out but at the appointed time which was burning bush season right God come down to tell Moses hey I ready appointed time reach I want you to go I want you to take them out take them to a place that I will show you don't worry about it you don't have to discuss the plan with anybody I will give you the plan as I heard recently I am the driver you are the conductor amen I have the plan amen hallelujah just moving quickly along you know there's so so many examples that we could go into I remember the story of Mary and we all know it you know she lived a simple life a devout life doing what she was taught this is the Virgin Mary and she was following what she was expected to do this is what ladies at that stage and that age would do on a daily basis when the angel appeared to her it interrupted her natural flow it inter interrupted what she was accustomed doing cuz it's not every day an angel will appear to her but you know what after that encounter God dropped time on it it was time it was now the appointed time for something to happen because way back there was a prophecy that a virgin shall conceive and when that time arrived Hallelujah this is the time when hey we had to interrupt the normal living we have to interrupt the regular flow of things we have to interrupt the program because time reach and his word Can't Fail when he decide time up it don't matter your opinion don't matter he don't care where you are because in his mind he give you time he drop time on it amen the foolish virgins is the same case I have you they all they all had access to the same books and tapes same books and tapes you know nothing different no new material yeah no new and improved or revised Edition no no no same books and tapes and God dropped time on everybody you said listen I have an appointed time he dropped that leave it alone they all listen to the same messages but theirs weren't mixed with faith they never got into action to access the extra oil that was needed to take them out so when the alarm bell rang and the check give us of your oil that we might have some to and at that point is when they were told listen time up time is over the Bell has rung you know often times when they have contest and stuff they will tell you look look the clock there you have two hours or 1 hour whatever and you could do what what you want you could make mistakes and do over you could try to fix it you could try to adjust and you trying to do this because it's a competition based on time but you know what every time that clock hits zero they tell you time up hands up walk away this is examination time we're going to evaluate what have you done because we give everybody the same time so in this case the foolish virgins had the same books same tapes same messages same ministers same information access to all these same things yet they didn't have the wisdom to get extra oil time had run out and they couldn't change at that point in the upper room even before they went in Jesus would have spoken to them and said listen I know all you're excited I know there's a lot going on some of you all very emotional some of you all can't understand what's taking place but here's what I want you to do I want to give you an instruction with a promise so T in the city of Jerusalem so don't wait here I given you an instruction T in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power amen up on high so you can't like me so much that yeah listening to the instruction given you can't hang on to my C tail and well I'm following Jesus what did what did Jesus say that's good that was his promise you know he say go and T until so you know what he did he dropped on it he didn't tell them go on a I will send a comforter tomorrow he said go until until so go by faith go in obedience go and have patience go and T Go and wait and know a brother might upset you and the Deacon or Usher may tell you something you don't like but it doesn't change the instruction I give the instruction is to you not the group because I coming to see who Aran until everybody have the same word hallelujah it may have taken 50 days but the Holy Ghost was about to pour out upon that 120 predestinated seeds that were in the upper room amen at that point if you were outside it didn't matter you were too late because the appointed time had come for the Holy Spirit to pour out so it didn't matter that you were there on day 49 and you're just feeling to go down the road because somebody a little hungry you know so I believe I want to go down by the bakery my lindas and get two pie for them cuz I have a good heart and I want to make sure what Jesus say t it's not your opinion and your idea he give an instruction and and it's up to you by faith with obedience and patience to act upon it and see his promise manifest because his word will never fail he has an appointed time to be able to do that you know in a message Look Away to Jesus and it's all too familiar as we talk about sister hatti right and the preamble to this is that the prophet had shot the squirrels three of them and he was given an account yeah and as he was giv the account it was new to them it was brand new cuz who created squirrels before who had seen that before who had seen spoken word Creation in action so he sat and he was telling the story he said listen this is what I did one two and a wait three and he say you know how I knew it was going to happen because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and at that point she sat there and she says that's nothing but the truth and the prophet said she just said the right thing so much so that it interrupted the flow God spoke to the prophet at that point and said listen give her anything she ask anything she want like the woman with the issue of blood when she touched the Hem of Jesus comment and at that point it didn't matter who was around Jesus at the time he says virtue left me who touched me something happened so the prophet at this point say listen God spoke to him and said give her anything she wants and in the message Look Away to Jesus I'm just going to read part of it for you paragraph 92 she was sitting back in the corner and when I said only thing I knew is he is still Jehovah Gyra and little had she said the right word she said the right thing amen she said that's nothing but the truth and when he said that brother Banks would hear Brother Banks would hear is one that was present that room felt like it was coming apart and the Holy Spirit said the same voice that spoke about the squrrel said give her what she asked for and I said sister hatti as a witness before God this is it now if there is any doubt in your mind you ask what you want to and if it ain't laid in your lap then I'm a false prophet that was how convinced he was he was willing to put his reputation on the line his experience on the line his history all his years all his messages up to that point he said if it isn't if it doesn't come to pass if this isn't your time I'm a false prophet she said brother Branham everybody was crying said what shall I ask I said you are poor and you live on the hill over there with no money you might ask for that you got a little crippled sister sitting here Edith that we prayed for for years you might ask for a healing I said your father and mother is old and broke down you might ask for them whatever you ask for sister hati see now if it happens or not right now and I said he has just told me the same voice give her what she ask for and she looked around said what shall I say brother brandom now after getting options like these she is still saying you know I'm not sure what to choose I'm not sure what to ask for I understand the words that you're saying you're telling me ask for anything you even give me some options but what really should I ask for she looked around and said what shall I say brother brandham I said say what your desire is think of your greatest desire and say it and at this point I want to ask you what's your greatest desire right now if God were to ask you right now what's your greatest desire right now that you can have what you will right now what would that be that's and she said the greatest desire I have is the Salvation of my two sons amen I want to tell you that when she said those words God dropped time it didn't matter where they were what they were doing what they did yesterday or last week it doesn't matter how far gone you think they might have been or your family your friends your children your neighbors it doesn't matter if you think your boss is unfair at this point when she said the greatest desire I have is the Salvation of my two sons Prophet said I said I give them to you in the name of Jesus Christ and there they went and I just want to backtrack a little bit you said her boys were even snickering and laughing and she said said the greatest desire I have is the Salvation of my two sons I said I give them to you in the name of Jesus and there they went and they've been faithful in this church with communion them little fellows sitting there washing feet with a men and things like that we are all Witnesses of [Applause] that the musicians get ready you know in the message Oneness we seek to wind down paragraph 183 it says now the coming of the Lord Jesus is so imminent the coming of judgment he's calling his elected together in Oneness with himself with the same kind of ministry he had you know how I shaped in the church ages here not long ago just like that about the big tower that was built called the per but the headstone was never put on it remember how the Lutheran came then the wsans in the minority and then down to Pentecost and now what he's doing calling from that what did he do he called out the elect to make the Lutheran he called out the elect out of the Lutheran to make the weson he called the elect out of that to make the Pentecostals now he's calling the elect Pentecostals out to make the headstone to come into it a very same kind of a Ministry dropping down sir dropping right in on it calling his children from all denominations and all walks of life just play where would I be amazing grace what has he done he has placed with them a true teachers true prophets who stay with his word the Bible my sheep hear my voice said Jesus if that was his voice then it's his voice now anything contrary to that voice it's not cheap food they won't they won't follow it oh brother from east from West out of every

Of Love was a hopeless case an empty space if not for Grace sometimes it may seem long it may seem like you've been holding on for such a long time all through the 80s 90s and time is going time is running it doesn't change the fact that God has placed time on his promise the prophet had seven Visions in 1933 it doesn't change the fact that God just placed time on it it might take 5 years 10 years 20 years 90 years 100 years who knows it doesn't matter what matters is that we have faith we are obedient we are patient and we hold on to his promise knowing he's the same yesterday today and
