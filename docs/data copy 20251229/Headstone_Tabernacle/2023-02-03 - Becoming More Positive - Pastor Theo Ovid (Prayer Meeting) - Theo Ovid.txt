opportunity in this Modern Age where oh there's so much distraction there is so much things to try to catch our attention that we could still be caught by fasting and praying we can still be caught by commentary throne and seeking your face father I pray tonight that you would so Inspire word and bless tonight and a special great touch sister Vivian touched wife in a special we visit them with your hidden virtue and strength in Jesus amen amen God bless you and welcome to be here tonight in our I'll try to make this one parameter and I want you to turn the Bibles to Romans chapter 4. the title of what I want to exhort you tonight is becoming more positive this is the thought I want to share with you tonight becoming more positive and we want to look at Romans chapter 4 which of your Bible books and just to be sure before we get on into prayer Paul speaks what shall receive them that Abraham or father has put him into the flesh had found for If Abraham was justified by works yet were of the glory but not before God but what said the scripture Abraham believed God it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that Wicked is the reward not reckon of Greece but to him that we get not but believe it on him here we go that justified the ungodly his fate is counted for righteousness even as David also described the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputed righteousness without work saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven the Muslims are covered blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute sin Commit This blessedness Then according circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that Faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness or was it then reckon when he was in circumcision or in consecration not in circumcision but in uncircumcision and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of defeat which he had yet been uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe do they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed to them also let's read that verse again and he received the sign of circumcision and Paul went on to identify what that is a seal of the righteousness of the feet when did he have his feet which he had get being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they've been not circumcised that the righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father of circumcision to them who are not obviously causation only but who also walk in the steps of that fate of our Father Abraham which he had been yet uncircumcised note all is emphasized the position that Abraham was him the fact that he was uncircumcised and he had the sweet for the promise here we go that he should be heir of the world was not to Abraham or to receive through the law but to the righteousness of faith for if they which of the law be is Faith is made void promised made of non-effect because the law will get right and where they know where no law is there is no transgression therefore this is the crooks of it it is a fate why that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not for that only which is of the law but that also which is the feet of Abraham with the father of Allah so this is the part I want to get to who's 17. as it is written I am needy a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quick met the Dead I'm calling those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in Hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall I see be and be not weak in faith this is a pattern of in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he when he was about 100 years old neither yet the deadness of serious woman he's Target not but the promise of God through unbelief what was strong in feet giving glory to God and this is our anchor point tonight and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform because three that God promised you Deliverance healing Breakthrough Revival Holy Ghost Dynamics adoption being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness no it was not written for his sake alone but it was important to him but for us so you're taking it to yourself now for us also to whom it was imputed if we believe on him that raise up Jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised up for justification like God bless his word I'm going to bring when Jesus of Nazareth was here on Earth he never used his power yet he was God manifested in flesh he never uses power when Satan come against him he said it is written he had to do that because he broke down on that and what he lost Christ with him where evil had done Christ fortified again it is written man shall live by bread alone it is written Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God it is written it is written what is it he stayed with the original artillery but Eve let down she began to listen to reason you know there are people today who can almost reason you write down and prove to you that the thing is wrong Satan was very successful with Eve what does reasoning do it makes it appealing now please don't get me wrong now sorry a man come to a place he wants religion he wants to be safe he doesn't want to go to hell no human being wants to put that up please it wasn't made for human beings it was made for the devil and his angels it wasn't meant for human beings but the human being sends himself there go through every red light he can across it and the people fight right on Beyond it before you can become an unbeliever you have to bypass fate and God's word fist before you can become an unbeliever you have to run the red light of god notice Satan needed appealing and sin is appealing so sin is not just but I said no no it's a pillar it's attractive it draws you it pulls up to you it's appealing he makes it educational intellectual and then the prophets that did not the Holy Ghost tell us II Timothy 2 chapter that there will come an intellectual group in the church heavy I mind it love lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God in the church Jewish Breakers in the church false accusers in the church in continent despite of those that are good you see them as Communists who know them is so-called Christians having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof and the power is the word made manifest the power is what the word made manifest one more time the power is what the word need manifest he said the gospel come to us not two word only but to power and demonstration of the spirit Satan makes it appeal and certainly it's appealing sin is appealand but the enemy keeps finding a better deed he will powerful woman do this do that don't worry he will never make a completely naked but he'll be horrible then he knows just what to do but Satan keeps bringing sin in and that was the original sin now watch here we go there's a part we want to get to know but God doesn't have to do anything more to his to make it any more appeal the only thing he has to do is just raise up a standard of his own word against the enemy when the Bible said when the enemy come like a flood the spirit of God raises the standard against it what does he do he he makes here we go the same word that he already said more positive taken his same word and making it more positive and I will interject here when the time is not yet so in other words when uh Elohim came up here to Abraham he didn't come to change Imam body there and then he came to make the same word Abraham 25 years ago more positive by telling Abraham I was certainly return unto D now think about you know you're waiting for 20 something years for this world to be manifested that God promised and here the angel come down and speaks to you and said you know what I will return unto thee according to the time of life so in other words he run you down 25 years and introduced time of life because a God we serve is declared by time and season on the under this one for everything season and time I I said that to fulfill my word so I hope you get out tonight so watch this now he take the same word and make it more positive because the time is not here another scripture it connects pretty fast in today and what Daniel saw and and this is Daniel chapter 9 you don't have to find it I'll read it in the year of Darius the son of persuas of the seed of the meats which were the king over the realm of the challenges in the first year of his Reign I Daniel understood by books the number of years where of the word of the Lord in the Jeremiah the prophet that he should accomplish 70 years in the desolation of Jerusalem and I set my face under the Lord God to seek like prayer and supplication with fasting and Lord and Ashes so to seek the Lord it it takes some stuff it takes other things and Daniel was seeking the Lord because he saw something written by Jeremiah the prophet that stood him and motivated him that drove him to pray in that season was nearing the end for that time it was full and I pray unto the Lord my God and made my confession I said oh Lord I wouldn't read all the great and Dreadful God keeping the Covenant and mercy to them that love him and them that keep his Commandments we have sinned committed iniquity I've done wickedly and I've rebelled evenly passing from the perception from the judgments leader have we happened unto thyself of the prophets I'll stop right here through six if you have time that I need chapter nine you can read the whole thing okay so he went long and Saturday notice he didn't say I'm Union right just one Lord I go to church and I'm this and I am that no no he was pleading for God's people no chapter 10 of them Daniel in the year of Cyrus King of Prussia a thing was revealed unto Daniel whose name was dirty father and the thing was true but the time appointed was long and he understood the thing and had understanding of the vision you know brother Brown didn't present like topics like people tried to present it as if he read about Supreme what he brought was a vision what a prophet sees is a vision and all the historical mysteries that we wasn't clear about but that wasn't his message that was just something to be done as prophesied and promised but he says you will be given a message that would for run my coming that message have to do with preparation getting a people prepared that message is not about joining Church the investment about staying in church that message about getting prepared for the community lord ifura said the angel of God is on it now fixing things are wrong for his coming so when the thing is true and the time is long let me go again Daniel says a thing was revealed and the appointed time was long he understood the thing and he understood the vision now if we understand this thing that was revealed by this market for Prophet because he said when you see the mean thing the rest will just fill the material it's kind of like a gift and you have a watch or or some perfume or cologne in a box and have all kind of free things around it the fruity things is part of the gift packaging but the thing is the cologne or the watch or whatever it is that's the real thing so when you see that thing everything else is full of material it's just like Cyclones so when the thing is true and the time is long God raises the standard by making the same word and making it more positive oh is the vision is always from the point of time then you have to wait for it you should write division sneak it clean that he had readers have been run for the vision is for an appointed time declaration ten people like to step up so it's seven in the days of the 47th Angel when he shall begin the song the mission of God will be finished but the scripture doesn't end there in verse 8 it says I'm the voice which I heard from him speaking to me again said go take the little book which is open the hand of the Angel which stands it up on the Sea on the earth and I went under the angel and said unto him give me the little book he said unto me take it eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy emotionless honey and in this scripture here John was tight and bright it was typing you and I there's not Pastor Prophet teacher evangelist and who up there who calls so-called up there this is for all of us to take the book and eat it up not eat some that that uses that chewing gum and and both instead take what you want and leave up wait no eat the whole book is it it shall make that very bitter it shall be like most honey I took the little book out of the Angel's hand eat it up in my mouth sweet as honey as soon as I've eaten it my belly was bitter here we go and he said unto me what thou must prophesy again before many nations peoples Nations tongues and kings and he Amplified that verse 11 says then they said unto me you are to make a fresh prophecy concerning many peoples and reasons Admissions and language and kicks so now with all these years by echoing what the prophet brought the prophetic utterance that was released by this prophet of Malachi 4 we were prophesied that that Dynamics to the mechanics they're going to be a 700 Revival they're gonna be a perfect Church there could be a faithful Ministry all these things are prophecies because the time is not yet because there is a standard by making it more positive especially after the thing has been revealed and the time has been known for people get wary because they get tired they can't afford to get very untied right now we are nearing the corner he's taking the same word the same word in the spoken books the same word in the Bible and making it more positive now he was talking about job here Joe had no bible to read in this day he only went by inspiration he was a prophet For Whom the word of Lord comes to he had only to be inspired because he knewed his position he was God's Prophet the only thing had to happen was for the inspiration to strike him then he knew what he said would happen because it was by inspiration they said what do you drop here drop a bomb right here and he said that is what the church if it is in order settled order it's got the mechanics ready it only needs the Dynamics tonight if we will get the mechanics ready and the first thing he said is not about vials and wolves a woman in his son and they see you let me come there's no he said get our hearts right the things that we can do follow every word follow me baptism follow him in every order he told us to do get every mechanic ready and stand there then we are ready for Dynamics to be lit off and only God can do that that's to drop into your heart that faith that says I am now healed okay question tonight have you done all that you can do if there are still things outstanding you are actually falling short you have to know that you have done all that you can do with what God has given you let me say that again we've seen again you have to be clear in your heart that you have done all what you can do and you could not wait and if God doesn't respond you can still read in confidence and in feet knowing that God can't lie because it had to have something in Abraham's that brought him to the spot where he was fully persuaded and the words expressed in the scriptures it's not by chance uh you know as a term that I love very much they probably said well Abram came into the fullness of believing so there are stages of believing we grow in feet we grow in believing we grow in that World Cup we grow in maturity we have to grow and as we really learn we grow the growth we really learn if you're not growing you're not learning anything you're just stagnant so Abraham had to come to that place where he was extremely positive that God was going to fulfill what he promised and that is where I get the inspiration from tonight to share with you becoming more positive some people are negative beasts and God help them the first thing they see is the glasses half empty as opposed to the glass half full they just see people Negative they see tush Negative they see Minister Negative they always have something to pick up find fold with and God help them because that's not how we're gonna get in channel of your confidence but the band said that job had a Channel of communication to God and required by inspiration he had a way of moving himself out and letting God move in he know he was justified it was a gift it was a gift for the people not virtual for the people and that's all Divine gifts are the three of God's people Everyone is not ordered to be a prophet all is in order to pray for the sick all are not ordered to be pastors and so forth but it's the channel that God has opened to them and even as we had this morning no man has no business deviating in the next man's Channel no matter how inspired it seems like David was inspired all the people shouting and glorifying God for a reason that seemingly exactly scripture but he was the wrong person that inspiration should have come to Nathan not David and the devotional Prophet with inspiration it's not books it's on tips and we have to get of the same anointing and fire and presence and Holy Ghost I was upon that Prophet to see on the kitchen and work with it let's continue I want to keep it too long all right so what he says now watch Joe was the product for his day the only thing God had done to you was to give him he gave him wisdom and his word and inspiration he could get no inspiration so there's this position towards him but he node all his mechanics he had offered the boat offering he had done everything he know to do was right but he couldn't get a word from God get his part but the devil couldn't move him you can't hear from God you want to go to our party a career from God you stop reading your Bible and stop praying you can't hear from God yes yes you're weak you're kind of a hot water plant you need some water and we just drink some water and something like that he said he couldn't get away from God but the devil could move him there you are now there you are when you prayed for you don't have to run back to a line or get somebody else pray for you when you know you have done exactly what God told you to do then wait for that child of inspiration to open up to you and now I'm Healed when it drops in there it's all over you don't need no prayer line nothing else praise the Lord so friends I I was excited to come to share this with you today tonight because I got this morning but after four or after three or whatever and I got this thing to share with you so that's why I want to see what the Lord will do with it what the law will do it in your heart and I trust him that God will write something in your soul that will draw close to him and I read this quote and I read it again a minister trying to bring a Revival that's why you here tonight is so important there's no preacher on breaking Revival he doesn't attack it with him the only thing he can do is just to be loyal to God and his word and the Revival has to come by the people in your home in your life your Revival is not new members it should revive means to bring back all right let's go the hope is wanting and feet is another faith is a positive sense it is not guesswork you don't imagine it it's just as real as any other sense of your body just the same as sight is sight is real hearing is real see teeth smell feel here the five senses of body that control the body they are real faculties to you if none of them is injured then feet here we go is just as real as any of those other five senses and more real because it will go in and above those five senses praise God do you believe that tonight but about you continue now I Believe In All My Life by God's grace he brought me to confirmative deep call into the deep I have found two wires it's not carefully since I have found two wires that will bring the visible power of God for Divine Healing into the individual the two things I find one of them is love the other is feet and they are sweethearts When Love gets married to feet love always accompanies feet when you love God enough to know that he can't lie to you glory it will create a fate and dear that will make you believe his word and every word he said is positive truth and you accept it with unadulterated feet and you won't say no it will produce exactly what he said it would do the Deep call to a deep forget not all his benefits who forgive thine iniquities who heal it all like diseases and if you expect him to get help from God and that's what we're here tonight God will meet your expectancy he always does whether you go whatever you do will you will expect what you expect brings your feet if you come say well there's nothing to it that's just the way you will go back home with nothing to eat if you come tonight and say well if I don't get prayed for a gum and I won't be healed that's just the way you will go if you come in tonight and say I come for one Soul Purpose that is to contact Christ for my body or my soul he will go home just as happy as you can be for you will contact him now no matter what the opposition looks like Christ is the answer oh glory to God faith brings Christ notice 80 years old white beard right here yet the old man went around telling people he wasn't going to die until he seems the Lord's Christ talk much Simian what a beautiful picture of the Fate knows no defeat fate is perfect fate brings things when there is no things to be brought Faith creates Faith takes doubt away takes negative and make positive oh it's a bit Dreadful thing to hear the levers talk negatively and when they talk negative and their negative beings they create an atmosphere around them that you don't feel comfortable with and you do not like to be around that person you do not want that person to be around you because they generate we will see this with negative Vibes but so that means that person is really short of feet they are talk they are talk they are complaints and complaints and they will bear you or whatnot but they don't have it because what happened faith is positive they takes doubt we takes negative and makes it positive how beautiful the old man had a basis for faith faith is not mythical something mentally worked up it's an absolutely fundamental result that happens in person's heart when feet is appropriated then it is something in the person's heart it can't be based on well and 133 or while pray to our post is got to have a foundation or praise God hallelujah how much more Foundation could you please your feet on in any level than the word of God Jesus said heaven to pass away but my word will never pass away then it is a fact that God's word is eternal and the Very world that we are sitting on on top tonight is nothing more than the word of God materialized he spoke the words that let there be and the world came into existence all things that you see was made by faith in the spoken word of God let there be and they believe his own word well after Redemption and a taste of God in our souls and heart how much more are we to be through our feet on what God give us the promise for and send Jesus to die and redeem us to that promise here this big one here there's some Dr Moses for the ground no my work for the Lord is to try to bring that person up to this level where their faith becomes not negative but positive oh this is the language so you can finish here tonight he says work is to bring the person up to the level where their feet becomes not negative but positive I have seen people come on the platform say hi do you believe I've got all Faith by the problem no I don't mean to be belittling them I respect that but they're supposed to be up here and here they are way down here but do you know what it is it's hope instead of faith state does the job right now hopes hope for it but fit is the product Faith really does it we have lots of Hope but not much Faith so we want to change from Hope to day positive feet and there's only one way we can get positive defeat that is by positive thinking of positive things can I read it again for you so we want to change from Hope to day to positive fate and there's only one way we can get positive feet that is by positive thinking of positive things when that intellectual feat comes down in an intellectual in a little compartment here it becomes positive so you remember you remember sometime you hear he said most of our feet is intellectual feet heavy mental conception of God God is good God is right God is love and everything else but until it drops from the head to the heart it's kind of problematic somebody could all talk you somebody could tell you something and convince you and set you off way it was what you thought you were strong on and the least so there wasn't really a real Uncle deal that's why Jesus could say Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the geese effect cannot reveal against it because he knew when that rock or Revelation strikes in the human heart even though devil could take that out it is Uncle it is permanent it is fixed no church nobody no pastoral talk no negative no gossip nothing could shake that because if the father has revealed this unto you that's what the Revelation is not you read in a book or your study or you have the information but you have what they call Divine Revelation on the line that would divine all right so let's see how we could just wrap here quickly so you talk about the intellectual feat and he said if you're really sure that what God does he moves right in and takes that intellectual feet and speaks it down into the human heart and when it comes into the heart here we go it becomes positive a way that is God himself moves into the human heart and makes that a positive fact when that faith comes out of the Mind into the human heart you see what I mean and then he said like Abraham we call the things that were not as though they were he took God at his word the reason he was able to perform what he had promised the trouble of it is with the church today we come with hope instead of feet feet is positive here this big one Faith needs no booster fate lose what he's talking about faith is strong faith has hairs on the chest it speaks and the rest of them shut up symptoms can't even speak at all when real God if it speaks it's it knows where it's at hold on about a thing about finishing up but your feet when feet is positive here is what you cannot you cannot be too positive I think I think that's the ending believe it or not you you cannot be too positive you know there are some people the a problem come up and you if you listen carefully you're only talking about the problem they're only talking about the situation only talking about the conditions they are not speaking Solutions I mean I mean corporate free to my soul and I just thank him for that I'm grateful to God and I'm a person that always looking for what's the solution okay this happened that happened what do we do how do you get out of this what is the next move I cannot just stay with all all negative negative oh this is so dread it's so black the sky is black there's no ring there's no sound there's no this there's not that right but when you get through all the negative where is the Positive Vibes that that identifies that you trust God you know come like but I'm talking about the man with the horse horse and buggy riding riding he said he had feet until he he will break he said that he turned down feet when things go wrong this is what show what kind of feed that you have so this is it tonight I trust that it was and you find it helpful to you that you have to become more positive if you're a negative person and say God take that negativity over me and help me to see the right pictures and then you see Regina's bedroom you will see people who not strong as you or weaker than you as your brother and sister and there's not to beat them up and rough them up they haven't got that whole effect like you have and that's why the Bible institutes it on a summer's compassion making a difference making a difference between brute peace and bad attitude and bad spirit and those are the weak and struggling and they really love the Lord and they just can't seem to master that kind of faith that they need to have in this hour we need God's strength people are getting weary tired Fed Up why because the promise is true but the time is long we have been prophesying of these things for so many years we have gone from black here to gray here and the promise is still true God can't lie Abram who is the father of Faith he proved to us that we could be have that seed of the righteousness of the circumcision of God by the Holy Ghost by the living and trusting God and I believe about all my heart you could stand there as a Christian and the other son rain come Sunshine whatever it is if you think your tongue is a soldier he said dying on the hospital bed is still going on as a soldier you're not going on at somebody who is you know I mean you never believe all you never had an experience with God but you come to the place where you could trust the Lord so don't be wary don't be tired don't give up don't let go right now let your feet grow take that that if it become positive you become more positive you have to become more positive because you want the people that is fully persuaded when they come to the church when they come to the provision that God is set this meeting up tonight god Set this time a prayer tonight if you pray for 10 minutes five minutes three minutes may it be a faithful prayer may it be a positive prayer say God I'll be negative on my life it's almost like if you expect things not to work for you you have had so much negative experiences that you believe that your life is like a living blight a living negativity that you haven't seen nothing positive nothing you're working out and as long as you keep saying that talking that nothing will work out but if we could just change your spiritual tonight and say God I'm not going to work or become trusting me I know I'm going to work out because your word that by positive attitude positive thinking positive a reaction everything else I will get a positive foot from god let's borrowhead heavenly father thank you tonight for all these Believers gathered here to hear this exhortation that I believe you give me to give them and I did what you give me I give it to them Lord to become more positive Lord made me forget the past all the negativity may they drop it tonight it's a night be a night of dropping pass dropping their fears dropping their weakness dropping everything behind and say God I come to you we hear the word and I believe in barakati so testimony a couple of weeks ago he shared what the Lord told him in his weak and low hour and father your Prophet identified as long as we are on the earth sinner drunkard prostitute doesn't matter the blood as a bumper covers Us it's only when we cross the other side if we are not saved that's a problem but as long as the blood is over over this world Lord we have an opportunity to repent to make things right we believe there's still Blood On The Mercy Seat we believe there is still salvation Deliverance Redemption and healing restoration Unforgiven substance we believe that once there's a thirst and a crime the spirit people can get the British that they need father God May release power here tonight power in the homes power in marriages power and feet power in the families May each position is a night become so positive it will be shocking to the friends and family but I mean a completely changed this trajectory of Faith tonight and made hit that number where you could come down and said I've heard that cry I know they want me now and I could come down lord you let the disciples wait in your room until they were ready and when that day of Pentecost was fully come something began to happen we know it's going to break up you said when the power
