may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins good about with truth and having on the bl the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod

hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hey many many man so we're in a war tonight isn't that right hallelujah there's two warring factions here tonight the power of god versus the power of satan hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right praise god amen amen there's only two sides tonight so tonight you have to choose this day whom you're gonna serve praise god hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right choose which side you're gonna be on amen isn't that right the bible talks a man about in revelation 12 and the brother branham said that the book of revelation was actually wrote before the foundation of

when michael and his angels fought isn't that right hallelujah fought against that dragon fought against lucifer amen isn't that right amen lucifer wanted to be high and lifted up above the people above the congregation he wanted to exceed himself isn't that right and become more powerful than even god himself amen he wanted to become god-like but in order to become god he had to be worshipped isn't that right oh isn't that why we come to church tonight isn't that why we come to worship we come to make him god tonight oh hallelujah we come to make jesus lord and savior tonight by our worship and by our praise is that why we come with an attitude is that why we lift our hands up is that why we shout and say man is that why we come praise god oh to worship and thank god oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah we come to identify who god is tonight by our worship and by all praise we come to identify yourselves with jesus christ the night by your worship by your attitude same as somebody same and somebody how many come to worship tonight worship god worship god tonight oh give him a shout and pray hey many many men hallelujah so it's okay to worship it's okay to praise god you're letting the devil know whose side you're on you're letting the world know who he is tonight you're letting the world know how much he means to you tonight when you shout and give god praise even in your trial even in your tests you still give god praise because you are not in a natural atmosphere which you are in the atmosphere of the presence of god and in the presence of god no flesh out glory in his presence amen no worship for satan no worship for lucifer that's what we're saying tonight no worship praise god hallelujah hallelujah hey

lucifer and what happened amen heaven realized michael realized everybody realized that there was no place found for him the bible said it was no place found in heaven for that dragon in other words there was no place for foolishness there was no place for selfishness there was no place for no praise demons there was no place for unbelief there was no place for doubt there was no place for fear there was no place found for that dragon hallelujah because heaven is a place where god is glorified heaven has a place an atmosphere holiday that god created for worship god created it for praise and glory and honor unto his name isn't that right who was this dragon who is this uncircumcised fellow to tell us who we can worship and who we can worship hallelujah hallelujah and back there before the beginning amen amen in the beginning you draw your sword with michael your angel was back there representing you down here the attribute of who you was in god you draw your sword and when michael drew his sword you draw your sword and you took your stand hallelujah hallelujah you understand what i'm saying tonight you have already taken your stance hallelujah you have already taken your stand michael recognizes the stand that you took with him in the beginning and now you bypass the autophagy you drop down here into flesh oh you feel all corrupt you feel all defeated and down and out but you already took your stand you go through this trial you go to this test your children walk away but you already took your stand your wife walk away your husband walk away doesn't matter what happens you stand always because you are already taken your glory to god before there was a moon before there was a star same and somebody before there was a molecule say man you already took your stand where were you in the son of god shouted where were you when the morning start standing together you already took your step so tonight now that we have connected back to our attributes stand therefore having done all to stand stand therefore glory to god hallelujah oh hallelujah that's why you're standing tonight because you already took your stand in christ when he died you died when he rose you rose or when he overcame you overcome before you even manifested the flesh you have already overcome how greater is he that is in you tonight that he that is in the world that's trying to stop you he can't stop you because you already took your stance glory to god take that to the trial take that to the test take that to the bank satan doesn't matter what you throw in the bride's direction she is going to stand god knows where his seeds are and in that time they will manifest christ in the hour oh hallelujah give god a praise oh my god oh my hallelujah oh glory to god oh you already took your stand tonight so you might as well shout you might as well praise god you might as well act like it's sunday because you already took your son satan is already too late he's millions of years late because before there was a mood before there was a star you already took your step oh my oh hallelujah amen man that's why he's jealous of you that's why he hates you hallelujah he cannot change but you have something to go back to you have something to connect back with he has nothing to connect back with in the beginning he fell and he cannot go back to any amen state of redemption is not right there's no atonement for him but for you there's atonement tonight for you there is a blood atonement tonight holler every day you're living you have a chance to overcome every day you're living you have a chance to change every day you're living you have a chance to receive the holy ghost that's why when you wake up in the morning satan gets a headache because he knows the day could be the day this hour could be the hour maybe tonight compete at night that that seed inside of you begin to become activated hallelujah hallelujah maybe tonight could be the night that that sea could become quicken quicken quickened that word quicken means to come alive means something becomes active and i recently learned that when a woman is about to have as having a baby there's a period in the growing stages when the baby is in the womb that something happens the scientists call it a quickening it's called a quickening because that's the first sign of movement that the woman feels in the womb it's called a quickening she feels a kick she feels a flutter hallelujah feels like butterflies but she knows that something inside is moving something inside there is alive something inside there is kicking maybe it's not manifested yet but it's coming on to something it's coming on to something oh hallelujah glory to god brother sister tonight you are coming on to something you're not what you want to be you're not what you ought to be but you're not what you used to be you are gonna be perfect oh hallelujah praise god oh hallelujah you're going to be quickened tonight you're going to be activated tonight you're going to come alive you're going to start moving in the spirits you're going to stop being anointed oh hallelujah hallelujah there's a power coming now to bring this scripture to pass there's a power coming now oh how to bring acts 1 8 into action to bring oxygenated to a manifestation my my god my god hallelujah hallelujah praise god hallelujah hallelujah hey many man oh hallelujah i want you to call here and coast a little bit am i feeling it's cool amen praise god okay here's a there's but a coleman here blessing our blessing said now the mother she's more tender get around her why said there's an angel spirit waiting to receive that natural body amen just as soon as it's born the breath of life comes into it and god breathes it in there and it becomes a living soul and now just this baby is being born then the spiritual body is there to receive it amen amen it's not right and now when this body is dropped here in the earth like the baby is dropped talking about your natural body now let me read it again he said no now when this body is dropped here in the earth like the baby is dropped he said now we stop and bring this out to you he said in the mother is a natural body isn't that right a little baby amen the germ and the egg come together that's muscles he said it's a body jumping around and jerking said do you get that did you get that but there's a spiritual body a soul with the breath of life the spirit waiting to take that little natural body in the mother said you got it amen amen so there's a supernatural spirit hanging outside of the mother isn't that right waiting to catch that natural baby when it comes out and when it breathes its first breath of life in comes that supernatural spirit and comes that little angel spirit amen hanging around the mother and even the prophet said we're not mother doesn't matter what kind of characteristic she has doesn't matter what kind of woman she is amen there's a sweet spirit that comes around that mother every time she's getting ready to bring forth something every time she's getting ready to bring forth a child into the world there's a sweet spirit that comes around the mother isn't that right that's brotherly kindness that sweet spirit getting ready to bring forth charity isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah is a supernatural spirit amen amen get ready to inhabit that body isn't that right said that there's a a soul with the breath of life the spirit waiting to take that natural body in the mother said he got it okay he said just like now listen to this listen this carefully amen he said just like the natural little body is in the mother he said there's an immortal body on the other side a theophany a body without an inhabitant yet isn't that right jesus said i go to prepare a place for you if it were not so i would not have told you in other words i don't tell lies i don't tell fables i don't tell stories these are not commonly devised fables but this is the truth that was speaking here tonight jesus said i go to replay a place for you a mansion for you that where i am there you may be also what was he talking about a theophany party what is he talking about a supernatural body somewhere out there yonder waiting for a soul to come and inhabit it in its time and in its season isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's why you're going to receive the holy spirit here's why here's why he said okay he said just like the natural bodies and the mother there's an immortal body on the other side he said i've got to go to you where i want you he said do you see it he said a natural body is in the mother he said the immortal body on the other side and that baby to be born here from the mother it's got to get the spirit in the soul isn't that right hallelujah for it to be a living soul isn't that right and for you to go there you've got to get the spirit here to go there same and somebody so just like a natural body has to receive a spirit so does a supernatural body have to receive a spirit in order to go and connect with that supernatural party oh holland what are we saying tonight the holy spirit amen amen hallelujah the baptism of the holy spirit is gonna come into you and dramatize your word seed and out of you isn't that right we comfort seven living spirits and that spirit is to go to inhabit in that supernatural body out there yonder isn't that right that body out there is perfect you cannot be in an imperfect spirit and receive a perfect supernatural body that's impossible it won't work you've got to have a perfect spirit to go into that perfect party that's why the seven tunnels will release holla into out all the earth praise god amen amen hallelujah and it took a profit to go up into the supernatural i just show you what those seven spirits were isn't that right to show you the mystery that was laying under that seventh seal seven spirits come out bang bang bang bang what was it it was a secret the secret of the life of christ to be manifested in this hour and in the season hallelujah and that supernatural life is what we need to go to that supernatural body out there in the atmosphere oh hallelujah hallelujah oh praise god that's why it's not good to stop you can't stop praise god adjust a little birth my god we have been called to perfection we can't stop at virtue we can't stop a knowledge we can't stop a temperance we have to go all the way shame and somebody you cannot be content to just sit back and wait for somebody to bring something to you no no no no he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him you have to diligently seek him and when you seek me he said you shall find me when you seek me with all of your heart and somebody so let's let go of all these natural things tonight let's let go of all these natural things and let's hold on to those supernatural things they shall never pass away oh hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah oh the prophet fought to bring these virtues isn't that right here come by the coleman fought pointing towards christ pointing towards the statue of a perfect man tonight the bride has to fight and enter into those labors tonight and to receive her portion to receive her supernatural party same in somebody same mental body you have a supernatural body you have a supernatural body saying man hallelujah but you can't make it in yourself you can't make it in his human spirit you can't turn over a new leaf and say that'll be all right that's why god releases holy spirit hallelujah hallelujah put you power for service he said you shall receive power he breathe upon you receive ye the holy ghost hallelujah to give you a perfect spirit to go into a perfect supernatural party amen do you believe that amen so tonight is not good enough to sit on the sidelines and watch what's going on you can't sit on the sidelines and wonder what's taking place you have to claim your inheritance you have to claim those virtues tonight those virtues are yours tonight they are the vitamins the spiritual vitamins that the baby is calling for on the other side hallelujah when a mother is craving for things she can't stop that craving if she have to burst the piggy back she'll find the money to spend for the pinnacle or the pineapple chow or the ice cream soda or whatever it is she has to get but she will fight to get it she's got to get those vitamins she can't stop or that baby will perish well tonight you have a supernatural body and you cannot stop until you get all of those vitamins until you get all of the food value amen amen isn't that right oh it's calling for fate tonight calling for virtue calling for knowledge calling for temperance calling for patience earnestly contend tonight oh hallelujah somebody give god a shout of praise oh hallelujah hallelujah oh i say tonight you are going to receive your portion you're going to receive your inheritance you are predestinated to receive it god in his mind in his thinking put your name on a lands book of life hallelujah hallelujah he put you in there and when he put you in there you were already perfect same man somebody when he put you in there you had already taken your stand hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right oh praise god god is not now choosing you when will you save amen today you come to the lord on this natural earth no no no no no before the foundation of the world god already slayed the lamb in his mind knowing that you would come forth in this hour knowing that you would be striving towards perfection he slay alarm in his mind to make a way for you so that you can come forth in your hour in your season he made sure that the devil had no chance at all at stopping the bride in this age he made sure he made sure he made sure that the devil had no chance if it were possible he would deceive the very elect but tonight it is not possible because time is short and saturn knows he has but a short time to work hallelujah god is not now choosing you this is not google search this is not facebook god is not now taking names okay brother so-and-so looks nice sister so-and-so is just in a certain time now trying to find somebody to be a christian no no no no god already chose you in him god doesn't have a facebook god has a lamb's book of life slain from before the foundation of the world that is his database and when he goes back to his database in his database you are perfect in his database you are healed in his database you are sealed in his database hallelujah praise god oh hallelujah god's got a profile for you in heaven they went through this trial come on now they went through this chest they faced the lions they faced the tigers and they overcame in their age oh hallelujah oh you have already overcome oh get a little prey hey many many men hallelujah praise god god is not haphazard say man god doesn't run his business like how some men run their office no god is different god doesn't have a aha moment god doesn't wonder oh wait a second i didn't put this in place no he already put it in place that's why you shouldn't murmur that's why you shouldn't complain when things happen amen all things work together all things not some things not when you feel like it not when you're feeling feeling all things work together for your good because of who you are it will work together you are son of the king oh hallelujah how can it not work it's got to work together for the purpose of the living god amen amen hallelujah just like your natural name represents your family on earth your supernatural name represents your family which is in heaven praise god isn't that right amen amen and every portion of the spirit that each saint believed in and received in their day was a portion of their name being manifested in the book luther had a dip of it wesley had a dip of it isn't that right that was a portion of their name being manifested in the book and brother branham said your name is lovely vale come on now the name is not john jones your name is not all roberts but your name is a mystery of what the book is while it is calling those names it's not a natural book with pages we're talking about a life isn't that right it's a life that is to be manifested in each age isn't that right amen amen hallelujah there are certain words that's pertaining to each life that goes out there's a word for that life there's a word that they have to manifest look at mary a virgin shall conceive when god looked at a book he saw a virgin shall conceive isn't that right and it took 100 years 200 years 300 years 400 years maybe they didn't see a sign of it but that word was circling in the air that word was circling in the atmosphere a virgin shall conceive a virgin shark and thief she was from before the foundation of the world but she had to come forth in a certain hour at a certain day at a certain certain time that name had to be manifested whoever that mary was she had to be manifested in her time and nobody else could respond to that name in the word when it was called out hallelujah there was only one blessed mary there was only one highly favored mary the angel couldn't say that to just anybody the angel can proclaim that to just any woman the angel was looking for a specific name on the book and when the angel checked his database when the angel checked his profile he said that's the one come on angels let's go down and talk to mary because she is the virgin that shall conceive and tonight you are the person that shall conceive the full body word of jesus christ oh give a lot of shadow pray you are that brother you are that sister that god is looking for tonight nobody else nobody else he couldn't find nobody he shuts all over couldn't find nobody he's such high he's such low he scraped the earth looking for you because of who you are glory hallelujah oh praise god and many many men oh hallelujah he was looking for you was like that quick mother eagle the brother brandon was talking about she lost one of her eaglets and that little eaglet was in a barnyard and he was scratching around in a chicken coop trying to fit in trying to be like brother so-and-so trying to be like sister so and so just not fitting in is not right confine himself confine his own identity struggling to fit in hallelujah one day hanging on the fence in the barnyard isn't that right but this story what i love about this story is that that eagle never stops hunting that eagle never stopped searching that evil never stopped looking that eagle searched they searched high she shuts low she looked up she looked down she looked in every crevice she retraced the steps over and over for years she said i've got to find this eaglet she is mine she is mine she is mine hallelujah and i don't care how you feel tonight you belong to god and he belongs to you what can separate us tonight from the love of god amen i don't care how you feel i don't care how long it takes god will find you in your hour in your season prepare for your day of visitation oh it's coming down the
