than that here just died to save him his sins he died to get this book this book is the Buddha animal lost because God can't let a sinful man have that book so when Adam fell he lost the authority he released the rezonings that was supposed to be in him he was supposed to represent and bring sons like himself and sons like Adam was like sons of God which is men with dominion over the creeping things over what creep upon the earth men that was dominating that was in charge that was rulers over the situation that's the kind of man that God made in the beginning God wanted a dominant powerful man to govern the nature cover the earth that is what God wanted reflect that he is powerful but he conquers everything that rules everything he wanted a man in His image and his likeness having his intent having his the bus having his mind having his will that's the kind of man that God wanted and he's gonna have that kind of man Oh glory to God the Meseta again he gonna have that kind of a man Oh glory to God no you have your will and you have your choice because what I put robots on the earth and that's the core them in and said press play and you just do so when you're walking left right

choose to forgive or you could choose to holy or that's your choice or glory to God hallelujah yes certain names we could do under significant we can't determine who won't be in present of America you can't choose will be this primary key God has raised of King and put down Kings God is setting that up we have nothing to do with that you should want the particular man and don't want the particular man but you got in charge of that but what you're in charge of they want to take charge of - I am L in the house you're in charge of reading the Bible every day you're in charge of brain that's you that's you like not God business that's your business or give the Lord a shout you're in charge of if you're gonna worship this morning or if you're gonna keep your mouth shut but there is no dumb dog in Israel walk with your motors give God some prison eyes open the house Oh glory to God don't pick up inside I had a double mistake the capital of the world hunger just wanna hear [Applause] [Music] the Bible said let the weak say I am strong that's what we're talking about go to even wonder confess your weakness but when to to confess change that quarter come back behind you yes son I see you in

wasn't born did you say when I said your mother wasn't even born when God saw you now I said leave I hate Heights any Pam oh my generation but that was so you're on a miscarriage i'ma stop by luck by chance yeah born man your mystical love each other and eyes that's how I come so I was unloved what kind of fish is that that's your human spirit and your mind must never mess with me here boy my father mother was in love and I bought you see them babies I'm sorry babies like they belong here then babies that were regional they recovered a smile knowing milk comment dis comment that comment and they'd know starting to live I want to be a seed in anger in season I'm growing season anger and feeling I'm going when you come to church a season if milk was chewing them and the baby will eat you in that gum and spitting it out a bit later so you can tell this word like this chewing gum in on your chew a spot you like your truest yet they take Pat you don't like because ya like it so I know like it's so you know take the ball eat the book don't pull book you catch all the peers and take what you want you get in the phone book and I'm had the book and see if I was in trouble certainly you couldn't mess with Adam maybe sees anomalous prey animal spirit - and the gadna even then God said there was no man to till the soil picked us and blew you up and then that spirit man step into this dustman and I'm living on he's had a work until this soil he already of the world and when go check him out you ready for wife ya know work ya know would and you wonder wife I know wife SW in overseas work so when God Adam was ready he put Adam to sleep pull Eve out when Adam come out of a sleep discernment is there today is there who is that standing in front of him he's a flesh of my flesh he sa what denomination belonged in a lady went to petition you belong to know he's a flesh on my face Buddha my bone because these ailments ought to be active in Adam they said this came out of me so this up is a man with a warm a woman forget the different kind of gender they want to kind of carry with me but this is a man this is woman and that's how we come here because man fell come

just feel it in my hands almost look like it's right here that's what I've longed to see waiting for the time when we walked on the street girl is a crippled lame from his mother's womb silver and gold have I none waiting for the manifestation sons of God when God will make himself known when God will make himself known what will that be that will be the unfeeling of God and you cannot unveil what you have not filled so if God is veiled in you and I then that has to be unveiled and that's why we ready to test in John 14:12 he said he that believed in me the same works that I do shall he do also why because the same God is filled in you so what the unveiling of that God is God making himself known listen carefully by manifestation not by revelation not by teachings that is all good as part of God's plan but by manifestation this is what you have to look for when God will step out the pages and fulfill his word between Malachi and Matthew there was a space of time there was no profit there was no manifestation of God but the prophecy was one comment to manifest Christ God is not right so when John the Baptist came he was the same that Messiah is near God always bring us

see the oil multiplying he see all what was going to be done it finished the woman brought know she is under a commanded blessing that man of God come to testing said baked me a cake first what if she was selfish what if she was bad behave what she was out of tune in the spirit say no I have one last meal I am a song what Eden we were dead I ain't no old man no she didn't do that as she turned to

seed of God that is what we are striving for now to get in and be positionally please into the kingdom of God before these horrible plague strike are you striving friends to get into the kingdom and the Bible said the kingdom is preached and Men come on and say it out say it again men press your way into it what you present to a church and to the kingdom let's continue I will keep you long but Galatians 5:1 a success stand fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage behold I Paul say unto you that if he be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing for I testify again to every man that is circumcised that he's a debtor to do the whole law of God Christ is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law your fallen from grace so he was bossing them who own this legalistic thing of the law then he says but for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by feet for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision are you ready but faith which book at my love's so what am I talking about d faith is not a faith by itself this quality of faith we talking about now is a faith that works by love so that brings the feet in a different category you've got a fear to move mountains and don't have this they've got no oil mysteries and don't have this love you could give your body to be burned you can give your things it goes to the poor but still don't have this thing in you have to have this thing we're talking about God want this love to come upon your feet or glory to God and I say again God want the love that come upon the faith hallelujah Malachi 4 came to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers God wants a faith that books my love he rebuked the seasons just not for words but for falling from the first love you have to get back to the first love to have the correct fit that God wants till the Lord our show could we go a little deeper and faith and love is relation because you can't have fit unless you got love Oh glory to God give the Lord a show Alleluia is a big one but earth-friendly it and love is relation because it can't have failed unless I got love because your feet isn't God who's the very essence of love faith and love who works together or glory to God so when byron went to India and he saw the man blame for worshipping the Sun plus he was barefoot it the first thing you do was to take off his shoes to see if his shoes / cornerman feet he's awkward him and Bane what to be barefooted is it's just terrible so he took off his shoes he said because you have to feel for them you have to put yourself in their shoes to correctly pray to effectively prayer you have to step into your brother's shoes and that is right to exercise forgiveness you have to put yourself in your brother's place on the matter to effectively forgive them not your side they hurt me hurt me they hurt me you're talking from your side but why don't you put on your brother's shoes to see where he got hurt the see when he was in pain or give the Lord a shout all blowing of God let me drop the bomb on you right now see it is this unforgiveness so your time approached Lord for charity unless you have forgiveness because when you stand praying for the love of God for the power of God for dynamics or glory to

knows you love her then you've got confidence faith in one another if you can if you've got faith to another if you didn't you're better not marry her or glory to God so that is always supposed to

made perfect in our weakness because it's not our ability it's not our doing it's not our effort law but it is your grace that has reached out to us and your love that has reached out to us in so many ways and time and time again we have approached this sacred desk with prayer requests and seen them come back Lord time and time again as no surprises as you a said it would be so we are walking in a story that's already written father and we thank you for what you have done for us long before the foundation of the world Lord and so much that you will tell your own disciples don't rejoice because we have power but rejoice because your names are written so we thank you Lord for choosing us Lord one in a million Lord you can call us out of our families our backgrounds or situations and to show us as you did a lot a way of escape Lord to those that want to take that way of escape Lord and to remember Lot's wife as with all we reminded us who had the opportunity to escape but looked back one last time and that price that was paid it was not worth it so he comes your throne Lord as a people knowing that you have the answers knowing that you have the solutions knowing that you can pick up the broken pieces of our lives and put it back together again and lo we bring our sister raised before us about the travel load me you go before her you go with her love me you go have to harm me your

buried that it's hard for us to disconnect when it's time to leave here that was the problem and Lot's wife you know she wasn't disconnected so as you're walking out her connections were pulling her back we want to live life in such a way that if the Lord said it's time to go and leave everything you can be ready to say I don't care about this world I'm ready to go go to a different place a place where there's no more crying no more sighing no more bills and it's not because you want to escape from these things but it's because there's something even greater and you have ever experienced and
