tonight in a special way and Minister and meet the needs of your people gathered here tonight in this virtual room I pray Lord for the desire of the heart or what's upon brother Kelly Sal's Heart Lord Lord may you intervene in a special way may a hand of Mercy Grace and protection and most importantly your Supernatural Grace strength and power minister in this particular situation I commit it into your hands and ask for an intervention just by you Lord in your own special way in the name of Jesus we ask it amen and amen God bless you and again thanks for being here tonight and I trust that all of you would have heard the service this last Wednesday and I listened to it I believe that God is releasing a key how we could access his prayer how we going to access His blessings to prayer based upon forgiveness and something God highlighted on Wednesday night was that resentment that feeling that emotion towards someone that will make you want to cross your road don't want to greet them don't want to talk with them don't want to relate to them so when you overcome in your own spirit in itself and I am not just talking words I'm talking for my own personal experience is it's a complete change Al together how you view things you're not viewing what are they thinking about me therefore you have to be cautious with your word no you are being what God made you to be and you are free and you have love in your heart and you have your concern for others so tonight before we start this scripture brother Joe sent me this um Joseph Williams this poem that we had read I don't know some years ago do not judge too hard and I want to read it back tonight before we start pray don't find fault with the man who limps or stumbles along the road unless you have worn the shoes that hurt or struggle beneath his load there may be taxs in his shoes that hurt though hidden away from VI or the burdeny Bears placed on your back might cause you to stumble to don't sne at the man who is down today unless you have felt the blow that causes fall or felt the same that only the fall know you may be strong but still the blows that were his if dealt to you in the selfsame way at the self same time might cause you to stagger too don't be be too harsh with the man who sins or Pelt him with words or Stones unless you are sure ye doubly sure that you have no sins of your own for you who know perhaps if the tempter's voice should whisper as soft to you as it did to him when he went astray would cause you to fter too so I think that is something with while reading to you encourage your heart to tonight so the script we want to read tonight from 2 Corinthians chapter 10 1:5 Paul speaks second Corinthians 10 1: 5 he says now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ who in presence I'm base among you but being absent and bold towards you but I beseech you that I may not be bold when I I am present with that confidence where it I think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh so he was addressing the fact that his boldness his confidence his presentation some of the Believers thought he walking according to the flesh listen to these words in verse three for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh the weapons of our Warfare and not carnal But Mighty true God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ so the title I have tonight is the weapon plural of our Warfare and not caral title is the weapons of our Warfare and not car caral that word caral a manifestation of a person's lower nature fleshly it relates to feelings passions and appetites and Wars of the body instead of Fai caral will use the eyes feelings and emotion living in a fleshly realm there is no way you can do battle in that realm or in that way there is no discernment there there is nothing spiritual there just natural complaining and murmuring now Paul continue in Romans 8 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in other words weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and force sin condemn sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who who who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so Paul here was distinguishing the carnality the natural nature from walking after the spirit verse five for they here we go that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is Deb but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but he are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ none of his so therefore from the scripture Paul saying the weapons of warfare is not caral is not my car better than your car my house better than your house you have more money on this one you are more things than this one you a better career you better position better title you up somebody's down that's irrelevant that's just natural stuff that doesn't count now in the Amplified this same scripture we read it says this here now for those who are according to the Flesh and a control okay so that the righteousness and just requirement of the law might be made be fully met in us who live and move not in the ways of the flesh but in the way of the spirit Our Lives governed not by the standards and according to the takes of the flesh but controlled by the holy spirit for those who are according to the flesh are controlled by its Unholy desires set their minds on and pursue those things which gratify the flesh but those who are according to the spirit and are controlled by the desire of the spirit set their minds and seek those things which gratify the Holy Spirit now the mind of the flesh which is sense and reason without the holy spirit is debt debt that comprises all the miseries arising from sin both here and Hereafter but the mind of the holy spirit is life Soul peace and now and forever because the mind of the flesh which is carnal thoughts and purpose is is hostile to God it does not subject itself to God's law indeed it cannot be so a canal minded person rebuked they blow up a canal minded person corrected they get a fight from face they got upset because they are in the flesh they would say you know what there must be a purpose behind it all things work together for good the Reason God could boast upon job because he knew knew what job had in his heart that job wouldn't curse him in it was justified that job was blessed above others it was justified that job had a hedge around him but the Hedge wasn't based upon canal and just flesh the Hedge was based upon the Fai that job had in him and God had the confidence that Under Pressure job would stand and that fate would hold and this is the same thing God want from us when things are fine when things are working out smoothly for you when things are working out just as you having in your heart and everything working out so nice and whatnot that is okay but the test come when the tables are turned and things come against you and things come contrary to your expectation and God sits back to look and see what his sons and daughters who supposed to be growing onto maturity how they will act and how they will behave that is why I ask a question on Wednesday night why would God tell a prophet who have been saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost and bring his attention to brotherly kindness how he was condemning a woman and he said I forgive you and you condemn her why would God do that because two things one we get tested before power and then we get tested with power sometime power could destroy people if they don't have the character to manage it so later on when the test came in the church with the two people carrying on trying to make love and different things and God tell if they say blind they'll blind if they say die they will die but AB Bram said I forgive you what did he do there he actually took the place of God he actually expressed God's kindness to people who from a natural standpoint should be judged could be judged and just Sting the stands up to be judged but this man because of the maturity because of the growth because he's growing in Grace and knowledge he came to that mature spot where he could say I forgive you Holy Spirit poured out and God was pleased God was pleased not to say you see my word gave indicated and I speak the word and this and that no no not that not that drama but he said I forgive you and he acted like God so listen friends I want to encourage you tonight that we are in a Warfare not a picnic Paul said in Ephesians 6 We R not against flesh and blood and I know we we touched this many many times but I don't know how much it's sinking into your spirit that sometimes your home under attack you under attack your body under attack your marriage under attack your job under attack I was listening to some people that get converted out of Witchcraft different ones and how they attack Christian homes and churches and so on and the testimonies you keep hearing all alone those homes that under prayer they have to back off they have to keep off they can't handle because that prayer brings a covering that they cannot do this stuff protected under the covering of prayer and the prophet said you'll read it before we close tonight that prayer is the greatest weapon that God could give man and that is why the devil want to shut your mouth that you will open and pray and you tell yourself you pray before and you don't want to par God like if God has a flesh and blood and you don't want to tell him again you don't want to remind God and God want to be reminded he want you to remind him of his promise he want you to remember his ways and his word and that you to express to him your confidence that you believe he has the ability to take care of the situation around you take care of the situation in your family take care of your situation take care of your life could we say Amen Wherever We Are Tonight blessed be the name of the Lord so the Bible says we ration not against flesh and blood but against principalities and he Amplified it says God put on God's whole armor the armor of a heavy armed Soldier which God supps that you may be able to successfully to stand against all the here we go the strategies and deceits of the devil for we are not wrestling with flesh and blood contending only with physical opponents but against deism against the powers against the master spirits who are the World rulers of this present Darkness against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the Heavenly Supernatural sphere so listen the Bible says weapons of our Warfare is not just weapon but weapons plural humility is a weapon love is a weapon kindness is a weapon forgiveness is also a weapon you keep what says you keep uh things SP by prayer and you you get sweet you sweeten the temple with prayer you you you actually get rid of mean spirit and stingy Spirit by giving giving is a choice you could give and you could keep stingy and mean you could hold on to what you have or you could share and as you share you see things come back to you and you get blessed that's how you get rid of spirits that's how you get rid of things you're doing something and this channel of prayer give you an opportunity to ask God to intervene on your behalf tonight I want to challenge you not just to pray for yourself but pray for somebody else tonight pray for somebody else pray for some Ministry pray for some brother some sister pray for somebody else with a burden with a concern watch God blessing come back upon you don't just stick with you and your family and and bless me and that's all of it all right let's continue now all right the Bible speaks of the weapon plural of our Warfare Warfare refers to the violent conflict between our armed enemies in modern times is usually conducted by Armed Forces so friends I have this written here it can't be only one side is arm the devil shootting you devil beat you up the devil bounce you the devil something the devil and the devil devil it cannot be one side armed we will assigned weapons but they are not carnal and that's why I say my house bigger than your house uh you have more money than this one and you're comparing natural this neighborh house is 2 by two you make your own 4x4 so you know that is foolishness spiritual warfare here we go refers to the believer's struggle against evil spiritual forces and we as Believers have to rely on God's power and putting on the whole armor of God almost done and these are some on the prophet prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the hand of mankind and now to heal I have no powers nobody else does there's no power in man to heal the only thing we can do we can pray and prayer is the most forceful weapon that is ever put in the hands of anybody what God calls great man calls foolish now this on different places so I have it in a flowing way what God calls great man calls foolish what man calls foolish God calls great so what we have got to do is to get back into the program of God and find out after all what God wants us to do and the only way here we go I know to do it is prayer prayer is the key that is the answer Prayer Changes Things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in control of human beings there was no atomic bomb no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer prayer will change the mind of God this is so powerful to me and let me stop here a minute I was listening and I started to listen to The Grace Battle of a fort and the prophet said an astonishing thing and he was showing why organization cannot win the battle or fight for God you know why you know I have been in that book so many times but this one struck me he say you know why because because the Battleground is the mind so here it is ministers and pastors set the people up to believe that belong that they belong to the right group because they in their churches and whatnot but the battle is in the individual mind and you as an individual if you don't bust through break out break through you'll be defeated in a church that has deceived an individual to let them know you're safe in here so the church is not fighting your Warfare we have a Warfare we have a war that is going on I cannot fight for war for you I could pray with you I could intercede for you I could ple for you but at the end of the day you got to fight now fighting these with soldiers these with boots these with training because the devil have ranks that why the Bible say principalities Powers spiritual WI this is not that the devil just have a a club that have no order in it it have structure he has a kingdom do you understand what I'm saying God have a kingdom God have structure and God have order now to you here who are hearing me tonight that don't like structure that don't like order that don't like discipline when your battle not M when you have to contend with your big fight you will be in serious difficult difficulty because to fight you have to be trained you have to be able to follow instruction you have to be able to follow guidance so let me drop up here right now and close listen to this now you see here we go when you go to praying for somebody something goes to taking place there is where we feel friends not praying prayer is the key note ask and you shall receive you have not because you ask not you ask not because you believe not ask abundance that your joy may be full ask and believe that you receive what you ask for then hold onto it don't leave it if it's a promise in the Bible it's been revealed to you that God is going to give it to you hold to it so let's close with these words prayer is the greatest of all forces evil are conquered by the power of God through prayer prayer is the weapon given to the Saints prayer is resistance to pray is to confront Satan to defy his claims and to reject his lies Satan trembles when he sees the weakest Saint upon their knees let's bow our heads heavenly father I thank you tonight for your precious people here goiv and I pray you would visit them those who pray for their sons daughters children and they give up because they seeing with their eyes from a carnal natural position that nothing has changed the children are the same way same behavior same attitude but may they reject what their eyes see may they reject the Lord just being they're thinking that they're being repetitive but may they hold on and believe that they're going to pray again they're going to pray once more like how Samson said once more may it be special tonight may this prayer session tonight be a special present procession of visitation family where you would visit them with this Spirit of prayer and supplication as they cry out as they cry out for deliverance as they cry out for breakthrough as they cry out for their health as they cry for their family as they cry out for others that they will see victory in other lives of the children of your people father there people struggling in church there are families that are struggling we pray for them tonight we pray you would visit them and you would Inspire them and increase their feet sometimes we in a dry spot sometimes we in a dull spot and we hear something and we hear a testimony or hear a song a special something and it inspires us and it brings us in a different atmosphere it happens Lord like when we have the blues and somebody speaks something and it just shake it off all the depression all the negativity just get shake off Lord shaken off father God May that happen tonight in every home in every family in every life Lord gross Darkness you said will cover the Earth gross Darkness you said will cover the people but yet light will come and we will rise and shine father May light break through tonight the light of God the love of God the mercies of God because at the end of the day we are what we are by your grace oh Father visit your people with your presence visit the people with your power visit the people with Deliverance visit the people with healing visit people with a Revival visit the people with expectation visit the people with Fai tonight may they be inspired and anointed take control of every brother every sister every mother every father every husband every wife take a hold upon them Father like never before and give them a personal experience of your presence and
