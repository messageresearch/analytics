worship now we want to switch over to the word now and um let's take our Bibles we want to read just one small portion of scripture in Genesis and um praise God we Genesis 22 okay um from Genesis 22 reading from verse 10 this is Abraham open up Isaac right and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called out uh called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fear is God seeing that thou has not withheld thy son thine only son from me and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold him a ram caught in a Thicket by his horns and Abraham went and took the RAM and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son and verse 14 for a text and Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Jireh as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen may God have blessing to the reading of his wound let's just pray one more time as we get ready to have a seat Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word Lord that you have given us throughout all ages father and even to

Lord bless the people that gathered here Lord you know the different needs Lord you know the different things going on in our lives but I pray father that you give us a word in due season Lord I will

see something tonight Lord that would hope change us for the better grant us almighty God now as we enter into your word now and Lord we pray for a few minutes that you take a hold of us Lord in Jesus let me pray and ask it amen and amen you don't have your seats praise okay praise God well feels good to be here tonight we never we never take it for granted amen uh serving the lord amen and it means so much to us here how much more will it mean over there Amen on the other side when you take your stand with Jesus then he'll take his stand with you amen so we certainly thank God for the privilege to be called the sons of God amen so now I have a title tonight and my title is the god of testimony the god of testimony and um that's reading this scripture here was just to give us a context of it and we know that there's many other places in the Bible where God revealed himself where God showed himself to be strong to be a provider to be a protector and we know that before everything was created God sat Alone by himself and he always desired to want to do these things but there was no way for him to do it because there was nothing yet created for him to perform his work on and to show that he had the ability to do it isn't that right but when things unfolded on the earth we see now God can now step in the Gap as it will and become the things that we needed the most when we needed a Healer he was there when he needed a deliverer he was there when we needed a provider he was there so to me what I'm seeing is that God isn't just calling them himself these things because he feeling to call himself something it isn't just like a job that you print on a business card he calls himself these things because he has done it once and he will do it again he's the god of testimony he is the God of all lives isn't that right and God actually proves himself by his testimony in our lives in the lives of His prophets and the lives of his handmaidens in the lives of his servants in the lives of his people he actually proved himself to be the things that he called himself isn't that right so we're not it's not a frivolous activity it is not by chance we call him a Healer but we call him a Healer because he has performed healing before and if he has done it before he can do it again if he has healed in times past he can do it again tonight if he has delivered in times past he can do it again tonight if he has healed if he has restored if he has created in times past the same God that spoke and created a human body is the same God that can fix what's wrong with that same human body he is the Creator and we call him Creator because he has created oh and he will create again created me occur a clean heart he can do it tonight oh because he is a God of testimony oh Hallelujah glory to God is so we understand even the Ark of the Covenant that the Israelites carried isn't that right throughout their Journeys and and Jordan Jerusalem was also called The Ark of testimony and in that Arc we're artifacts isn't that right the tablets of Moses and the rod of iron isn't that right there were things in there and those things that were put in there wasn't just put for style or just because we were feeling to to to to throw some things in there to because it was empty but those things are in there because those are realities those things are there to remind us that God with his own hand wrote in those tablets of stones thou shall not kill thou shall not covet your neighbor's wife and so forth right thou shall not commit adulthood the hand of God come now and wrote unto Moses praise God and said give this to the children of Israel and those things are in there as a testimony that these are the Commandments of God oh hallelujah hallelujah and it ought to give the Israelite such a fate it was there to give the Hebrew a reminder that the court that was with them in the desert is the same God that is with them in the promised land the same quarter was with their fathers the same God I was with Moses when he transport is Rod and split open the Red Sea that God was real then and he's still real today that God could still deliver your family that God could still heal your children that God could still provide for you that God could still make a way out of nowhere when all hope was lost and when the children of Israel's back was against the war when there was between a rock and a hard place oh and it seemed like there was no way out when there was Mountain on both sides when there was a Red Sea in front of them when there was an angry Pharaoh behind them that same card come down in the form of a pillar of fire and that same God opened the Red Sea that is not a choke that is not a fairy tale that is a reality and tonight we are moving into a reality that same God is going to manifest himself one more time in a bride on the Earth in our people on the earth there's gonna be a Revival if God has moved in times past I am a hundred percent sure tonight he's gonna move again if he moved before he can move again if God answered prayer before he can answer prayer again he's a prayer answering God he is a miracle working God he is a way maker he is a deliverer he is a restorer he broke the back of the ungodly he broke the back of pharaoh and he can break the back of the enemy that is upon your family tonight that is upon you tonight oh Hallelujah praise my Hallelujah Glory oh he's the same God he's the same God he's the same Jehovah with the same power with the same Dynamics with the same Pillar of Fire moving the same way like he did in the early church he's gonna move the same way you're gonna see the same signs same wonders same Miracles same Holy Ghost same baptism same outpouring same Devil's running same anointing that was upon brother Branham it's gonna be upon the bride that pill of fire is gonna divide himself among us one of these glorious days I'm looking for it I'm under expectation for it that the Mighty God of universe gonna come down in 16 elements and step into your flesh and you are gonna know oh Hallelujah that you are the sons and I've gone Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's what this world needs a real card a supernatural card not a paper God not a God on paper but according point and say this is that that the prophet spoke about here he is healing the sick here he is raising the dead here he is casting out Devils oh oh do you feel away tonight amen Hallelujah my he's real [Music] Glory it's a god of testimony throughout the ages they give testimony hail the name of god Jehovah calls himself he calls himself to become whatever we had need of Jehovah jvhu is not right praise God I am whatever and he filled in the blanks by each prophet's testimony by each servant's testimony by each Witness by the witness of Hannah isn't that right praise God he was Barren praise God but she believed in God oh she was parents she couldn't bring four children she was grown and she was crying oh Hallelujah she was under pressure oh Hallelujah pressure from her family praise God because the other wife was teasing her bitter teasing her sore because of her barrenness pray but I admire Hannah she didn't take it out on the other way she didn't become a mean and nasty and bitter person she went to God with her trouble she went to the temple with her sorrow she went to the temple she didn't go to Facebook come on now she didn't go to the website she didn't write a letter she didn't complain to the Ombudsman that she didn't get what she asked for she went to God with her troubles that's what we need to do we need to turn to God when things not working out oh Hallelujah when things not going our way oh Hallelujah I worry we can't seem to see our way we need to bring it to the Lord and Hannah brought it to the Lord oh with weeping with Cronin to the point of which she couldn't even express herself and then the priest comes in what's wrong and she poured out her complaint isn't that right and he gave our word in due season he said go please be no more trouble isn't that right and from that time on she changed her attitude from that time on she changed her approach nothing can happen yet but it was something happened in her mind something happened in our Spirits from that encounter something took place and the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass and all of a sudden at an appointed time another point today she was visited isn't that right Praise on she brought forth a son isn't that right oh Hallelujah and then she gave up testimony isn't that right praise isn't that right oh the Lord high and lifted up he's the one in charge he bringing down Kings and he raises up Kings for his name's sake hallelujah's God can do whatever he want to she knew that God was in control because she experienced something she went through something and God uses the Pains of our experiences to bring out certain qualities in us that are down deep tongue inside you don't even know what is inside of you tonight but God is going to use the pain of your circumstance God is going to use the bitterness of others or let it persecuting you reviling you God's gonna pass you to Destroyer pass you to this test he'll let you stay here for a little while and suffer it for a little while so that you could learn the patience of God that you could learn the tenderness of God that you could learn how to have forgiveness how to have love in spite your situation and sometimes God will ever let you move on until you learn the lesson he don't ever let you move on until you learn to be obedient until Joseph's work came the word of the Lord Tried Him isn't that right I'm sure Joseph show up his hand many times and say Lord I understand no I get it and prison head I get it I learned my lesson I'm ready to come out now already already Lord I think I stay long enough I know this person inside out I know every wall every crack every crevice I know where every room is I can do it blindfold I think I learned my lesson and God's still saying wait some more time with some more time wait a little while longer because he's trying Joseph because you have a position for Joseph to fulfill in order for Joseph to go into that position Joseph himself have to be qualified for it because God not going to risk putting an unqualified man in a job praise God where he's unqualified for that job God had to qualify you for that you can't just walk in there just land under this take up whatever position no no no God's got to make sure you pass through all the tests and you have to do well to get to the next step and to The Next Step you're not there yet but at every trial he's shaping you with every trial you're learning new things with every trial you're getting more mature you're getting more ripened you're learning how to lean how to lean on Jesus how to lean on his word god take a material things away from you he take house away from you you take this away from you somebody remove family members for his name's sake because you are the elect of God oh because he loved you before the beginning oh Hallelujah the porn knowledge of God knew that you would pass through trials pass through tests pass through discouragement pass through persecution pass through hatred though he slay me yet I trust them something inside your soul oh keep standing a test I will keep holding on to the reins despite the storm that the enemy may try to send in your will oh Hallelujah by God used in circumstance to bring out something special locked up inside of you oh hallelujah's night my so what what when inspired is thought tonight was a you know I was listening to one of the things right I was listening to um some scientists interesting I listened to some scientist debate and quite recently I've discovered that there are two schools of thought in the world of science there's a group that believed the evolutionist Theory which is that man evolved from monkeys and the Big Bang Theory and that whole thing that you'll hear but then there's also another school of scientists who believe the Bible and they believe everything that it says and I believe that science proves what is written in the Bible every single time praise God unable to prove it and so forth and they go back and forth with different arguments and different discussions and they have really interesting discussions because here's one scientist bringing the word of God God created the world in in seven days and so forth like that and he's showing in the scripture and then another one is saying when I look at science look at the stars look at space look at that look at Anatomy look at astronomy praise God all these things are telling us different things and they can't seem to put it together and I thought to myself while listening I said my God isn't God amazing isn't God incredible he praise God because with every argument they kept presenting I was listening to it and saying look how amazing God is look how incredible God is how many planets there are in the universe and yet God chose this planet how many people there are on this planet and yet God chose you yet God throws me God Accord of the universe he still know the time every flight uh every uh uh fly but its eye he know that His Eye Is on the Sparrow he knows how many feathers on the wings of an eagle amen amen he knows where you are right now he knows what you're going through the great God that created everything knows what's going on with you tonight and one of them one of them made an argument about uh Noah and they was talking about the ship and they were saying that how they was asking the question how is it that a man with no formal ship building education a man who was supposedly a farmer a sheep Hooda some guy out in the desert somewhere how was he able to build a ship that big to let it float on the water 40 days and 40 nights how was it able to stay afloat they asked the question how was it able to stay intact as far as they know there was a ship just a little less bigger than the ark they say the best mines tried to build that ship and the waves still cracked the ship at the center they still trying to figure out how a sheep heard her how a farmer was able to do that he had no formal education he's not a scientist he's not an engineer what intelligence gave that man the ability to build a ship to house eight people and all of the animals on the planet I said that could only be God oh Hallelujah all is not your mind it's not your education it's not what you have done it's what he wants to do in you you've got to surrender yourself oh come on now oh it's not about your education it's not about your ability oh oh hallelujah oh hallelujah oh yes yes yes that's why he bypass the learned it that's why he bypassed the wise that's why he bypassed the prudence and he revealed himself to babes such as would learn that's why he bypassed the pig I know high and mighty in the world and he come to you tonight because you had the ability to hear from God that's the only reason you could hear from God tonight is because he predestinated you tonight science is still trying to figure it out they can't figure out how a ship floats and they can't figure out how you are here tonight they can't figure out how your behavior is changing they can't figure out how your nature is changing you once was a sinner but you step out of that something in your heart heard the gospel they can't explain that that comes from God anything that you cannot explain is Supernatural activity and that's what's going on upon you tonight there's no science there's no School of Theology there's nothing that could figure out what's going on in here tonight it is God that is doing the work it is the work of the spirit he can turn water into wine he can turn your old try hard he can take all that Stony Heart Like We heard on Sunday isn't that right we put our eyes like over it he can take out that Stony heart and give you a heart of Flesh I have to love him in the work oh science can't figure it out there's no math book there's no copy book there's no internet text there's no phone you can figure it out the fastest fastest fastest computer can't figure it out tonight that's God at work that's God on the move and one of them explained he said he said they're trying to figure out the god of the Bible saying where's this God and what does he look like what is he made of he said well you're talking about the wrong God the problem is you think this God is in your mind but this God is not in in this natural realm he's in the Supernatural praise God there's no man and he said there's no man inside the computer trying to to move it around to move all the numbers there's no man running around inside here trying to change everything the man that created his computer is outside of the computer and he just operates the computer every time he need to well then that is how God is he is outside of your world and he intervenes every time he needs to praise God hallelujah he can go within without he can see the backside the front side the upside the downside he can see your hand he can see your beginning he could scroll through the pages of your book and see where you are now see where you will be see where you was oh Allah is good we're talking about past present and future all the same to him tonight you only living in an instance you are living in a moment but he knows every moment he knows every instance he is caught Almighty tonight you're just coming through it but he knows you overcome the battle you're still coming through it but he knows you overcome the test he already sees you Victorious he already saw David with a sword in his hand before God ever stole the Goliath I'll jump his head off oh my he knows everything and just like we are able to read the stories of the Bible the stories of the lives of these men of God and scroll through and see how God brought their expected end it's the same way God is going through your story tonight and he's gonna bring you to your expected end it's going to be glorious it's a vision that he's unfolding to you tonight and regardless of where you are of how you see yourself let that Vision inspire you this this evening to set a path towards that Vision praise God and don't let nothing distract you tonight God wants to deliver you God wants to restore you God wants to free you as far as God is concerned in his mind he has already done it he's just waiting for you to come to the reality to come to yourself and when you come to yourself you recognize whose you are you recognize who you are and you recognize who God is and then after that nothing will stop you there's no obstacle that can stand in your way you'll fight through every devil you'll pressure every trial you'll get the service you'll get there on time you'll pray you'll do what you gotta do you'll worship oh Hallelujah because you've got a revelation tonight amen oh my so it got me thinking listen to all these scientists I realized that this is the world we live in highly intellectual age now more than ever we have access to information children have access to information that we never had at all age some of us are limited encyclopedias if we had encyclopedias you know homes or whatever isn't right are we able to go to the public library now it's on a cell phone a smartphone just pull it up so easy it's at their fingertips I know it's so easy to question things now children question things more than ever they want to know why they want to know how I could serve a God and I cannot see how is he that is he as real as he really is and all these questions isn't that right and they begin to make me think that God really needs us because by our testimony by our lives he proves himself to be real faith is not something I can explain praise God hell is not something I could show you on a piece of paper I have to live it my Works have to show the faith that I express because faith without works is dead so if I say I have faith and I can't live this thing brother then I really need real Faith because real faith will stand on this word regardless of the circumstance regardless of the situation regardless of my feelings I lift my hands and I worship God hallelujah because it comes from inside of me because something Supernatural put it inside of me there's nothing that I can explain that there's nothing that could theorize that takes God to do it and the same God that did it for me is the same God I'll do it for you it's the same God I'll do it for your children it's the same God will do it for the young people the same super anointing the same pillar fire that touch your life after touch their life to the fire after come down and burn the devil out and burn the demons out burn the loss out burn the lies out we need the same fire oh Hallelujah that same fire to come down in The Souls of men to bring about a real change oh Hallelujah Hallelujah prison cannot change you can't transform people they try to reform people back into society but those same Spirits are there and sometimes they get worse when they come to prison all right oh that's so sad you tried to do all of the systems try to do to change man to make him different and better and make them contributors to their community and to education and to Society at large it has failed it will take God to change the hearts of man I understand when the Holy Spirit fell in Azusa Street the judges were wearing white gloves and judges and lawyers and so forth were wearing white gloves and that was to signify that they had no cases to see about there was no crime in the district isn't that right was the street I wanted to Revival isn't that right there was no crime there you know why because the Holy Spirit was moving in such a way that it was repellent demons it was repelling things Spirits upon people people even couldn't commit crime because waves of Glory was coming out from the Revival and I tell you Church there's gonna be such a Revival that will have an effect upon natural things God is gonna wake awaken us with such a supernatural move that is going to begin to affect natural things missing limbs are going to be restored people are going to be spoken to and they're going to be restored without any hands being laid on God has gonna move in such a way upon planted wood oh Hollow let's be a manifestation of what the prophet planted it'll be Sons and Daughters of God on the earth speaking a word flashing like lightning Revival after Revival the sick is being here backsliders being restored the blind is seeing the is walking I see no reason tonight why we can't have it tonight he is the god of today he is a god of testimony oh hallelujah oh and they overclaim him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony it was a word of testimony in Ephesus in Smyrna in titeria oh he was afraid of testimony in every Church in every age and there will be a word of testimony coming from the bride for this age oh Hallelujah we'll speak it prophesy again oh Hallelujah a little materialize Oh Glory it'll be according to the prophet's word this is that here it is right here in reality amen who am I my God I haven't got any I haven't even got anywhere yet but praise God I'm enjoying tonight amen bye the Bible is a book of many things the book of Prophecy it's a book of anointed book of inspiration isn't that right but it is also a book of stories stories stories of Abraham Isaac Jacob it's not a stories of the accumulation of the lives of men and women who walked the Earth they were people just like you and I but they were influenced by something Supernatural they encountered and it was real that's what these young people need the today and so the people of the world need today they become so dry the world has become a routine to them church has become a routine to them they need to see the god of reality the god of living testimony the call that helped me when I couldn't be helped the God had shranked me when I was weak and low the God had pulled me up when I was so low the God had Raised Me Up oh when I was weak in town the God had put strength in my ankle bones the god that healed me of my diseases the God had told me I was going to be all right when nothing seemed to help the god that helped me in my depression he is the white light that comes into my atmosphere oh Hallelujah when I feel like I want to give up when I feel like insanity wants to slip in and take me away or something got a hold of me in the midst of that darkness in the midst of that circumstance in the midst of that situation though hell can pass about me one thing about it is higher David said and that will I seek after that I'm dwell in the house of the Lord forever oh hallelujah hallelujah point a time of trouble he shall hide you in his Pavilion oh in a secret place he will hide you hide you away from the Troubles of this world oh you're in the world but you're not of the world you're from something higher your calls are something higher and every once in a while that's something higher grabs you and pulls you up out of your depression a part of your frustration come up higher come up hither there's something I want to tell you something I want to show you yeah there's something you calling you higher tonight that is where you belong you are not a chicken you are an eagle tonight oh you can hear the Eagles cry and there's something new to respond to that cry to that deep quality it's the noise of thy water sports all thy billows all over me Hallelujah James 5 7. these people are just like you and I isn't that right 5 17 sorry James 5 17 Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are and yet he prayed earnestly the Bible said that it might not rain and if a man like with like passions just like you and I could pray and shut up the Heavens how much more tonight we who are like passions we who are the bride on the earth for today can pray to the Lord that it might rain upon us if Elias shut up the Heavens with his prayer how much more tonight can we open the floodgates of Heaven tonight with our prayer of peace should your prayer Pray tonight like a missile into the heavens and watch and see if God don't answer tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah oh God wants to honor your faith tonight but you've got to step out and believe God Amen many many so God Is Made Real by an experience he is what he is because he proved himself to be that Pine experience he's a Healer because he heals isn't that right and in order for you to have a testimony you have to pass through a test it's not right he's a god of testimony in order for you to have a testimony you've got to have a test first that's how you get the testimony isn't that right how can I overcome the prophet said now we're expecting to be tested that's a good lesson for my brother back there he said oh he that coming to God must first be tested tested Prophet seven what tested it what with the word that's God's test what can we say Amen he said he said you believe it Congress says amen he said he said well either coming to God must be tested that only shows a true child then he said that see that could be tested so you are a true child when you are tested that's right he said when the test comes on you can't overcome unless there were tests give to you and when the test is given it is to see what's the purpose to see whether you can overcome or not that's all it is God hold a challenge at you to see what your attitude will be God hurl a challenge or two to see if you'll overcome Jesus told the woman of the well go call your husband and sat and waited to see what she was going to say oh and by faith that woman said I have none and he said you spoke the truth oh Hallelujah honesty reach up oh Hallelujah and God is able to connect with that oh Hallelujah be honest be sincere tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right Jacob and the angels wrestling the angel asked him who are you yes I am Jacob Hallelujah isn't that right he gave a testimony he opened his mouth he told him the truth about who he was this is me I am Jacob I'm struggling I am Jacob I'm wrestling I am Jacob I lied I cheated I did the wrong thing this is me Lord no false pretense no cover-up I'm being honest I'm being open no more lies no more covering up no more Fields no more fig leaves no more man-made religion Here I Am Lord standing in need of prayer that's what we got to be tonight that's how we got to come we gotta come on this we gotta come open we got to come within put off your church spirits and get real with God get desperate with God or you'll get nothing at all you better come and come desperate to hear from the Lord and He will answer you God don't play games so don't play games with God come real or don't come at all pray real or don't pray at all be real with God mean business and he'll mean business with you because he knows what's in your heart anytime you say something that not what in your heart he knows it right away gotta be real it's not mine where was I yeah so a test see to see what you'll do with it and then Jesus said to him that overcome it the test the test is the greatest thing wow the greatest thing that ever happened to you is the test you believe that's a nine I believe it's written in the scripture Peter said that all trials a word more to us than precious gold that parachute isn't that right a part of the Bible said gold might perish but your testings your trials that is the story brother that is the testimony brother when you get over to the other side you can't show them gold you can't show them silver but you could show them your tests you can show them your trial you can tell them about the mountain that you had to climb you could tell them about the valley that was so low you can tell them about when you lost this and when you overcame that and when you had to give up this and when you had to give up that but God was shaping something in my soul I didn't know it I didn't know I was going through I was hurting I was pleading I felt caught I felt bruised but it's only when he finished what he did in my soul I look back and I see the work that he did in me and you dance like David danced when you see what God has done in your life brother there's no more shame you're gonna dance like David turns when he saw the eye coming up the road when you see all your sins in the sea of forgetfulness when you see God break the devil off for you when you see God do something real in your life maybe not the person next to you maybe not the person in front of you but you know in your heart he did something for you brother you can't take my praise you can't take my Hallelujah every Hallelujah belongs to Jesus then oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah Hallelujah when Miriam saw all the Egyptians all the dead Egyptians floating in the Red Sea she got all the tambourine and she began to dance she began to shout she began to praise God when you see God deliver you from your enemies you can't help but praise God you can't have a child from your fall shop oh I don't know how else to say it but brother my Oh Glory one time Prophet said to God that is rich in Mercy he might be rich in other things gold and cattle and a cattle on a thousand hills but Prophet said I'm so glad that he's rich in Mercy Mercy stood in my place Mercy said no I'm not gonna let you go I'm not gonna let you slip away when the devil said look I got him I got her she's a sinner she deserved to die he deserved to be killed Mercy step in your place and said just a minute devil just hold right quick devil I've got a word for you I've got blood for you here was Mercy on the cross oh Hallelujah took your place took the keys of death and Hell shook everything oh Hallelujah one time one time Jesus asked his disciples he said which one there's a man who was forgiven of a small debt a man who's a favorite of great debt I'm paraphrased right he said which one do you think would praise him more which one do you think you'll love him or serve him more and he said he wondered who's forgiven more isn't that right praise God now I don't know tonight whether I was forgiven more or whether it's forgiven less but I know tonight how much he forgave me I know how much tonight he's done for me and my life and I'm gonna praise Him according to the good works that he has performed in my life because I've seen him overcome the enemy I've seen him take over the situation I see him save my life seconds before it happened I see him save my life he saved my family how can I help but praise him how can I help but worship when I see the hand of God the hand of Mercy oh Hallelujah and according to my testimony yet will I praise God while I have my being oh Hallelujah oh my God so we gotta have a testimony so that's why it's scary if you're not seeing the devil trying to destroy you because that's what he's supposed to be doing so if he's not after you tell yourself something is wrong pray with your Christian experience praise God Amen isn't that right and he will come into God must be tested and tried isn't it please go on Hallelujah so thank God for the test because it proves that there's a God out there somewhere who can fulfill his word to me praise God and give us the overcoming power isn't that right Oh my he said so Genesis 20 22 14 Abraham call out today call that name the place name that place Jehovah as it is said to this day the Mount of the Lord shall be seen it's not right Exodus I'll just give a few scriptures here this is the god of testimony isn't that right all throughout scripture he proves himself to be the things that he said he is isn't that right Jehovah Rapha he is the god that healeth all die diseases isn't that right according to Exodus 15 22 it says who Moses brought the children of Israel from the Red Sea and they went out to the Wilderness of sure and they went three days in the wilderness the Bible said they found no water and when they came to Mahar they could not drink up the Waters of Mars for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called Mara and the people murmured against Moses saying what shall we drink the Bible said and he cried unto the Lord oh for the answer praise God there's no water anywhere what do you do you got to do like Moses tonight let him cry out to the Lord tonight and he cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed him a tree which when he cast into the waters the waters were made sweet and there he made them a statue right there when that happened Moses and then made them a statue and an ordinance and there he proved them and he said if thou diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God and will do that which is right in his sight and will give heir to his Commandments and keep all his statues amen the Bible says I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought thee out from the Egypt from upon the Egyptians for I am the Lord that healeth thee amen right there in scripture he proves himself to be Jehovah Rapha and from that time he's still Jehovah Rapha oh he's Jehovah Rapha tonight he can heal you too much of every diseases I am the Lord that healeth Thee I am Jehovah Rapha oh reach up and grab him tonight if you need healing healing for your party healing for your spirit healing for your soul for the prophet said I'd rather see my soul where than my body well every time oh Lord send the power send the birth of Dynamics send upon the holy spirit to make you well in your soul oh Hallelujah that you can meet God Amen I am the Lord the Amen in the rain again God proves himself to be Jehovah Nissi isn't that right he's our protector praise God isn't that right the scripture says yes so did so Joshua did as Moses said to him and fought amalek and Moses and Aaron and her went up on the top of the hill and it came to pass when Moses held up his hand that Israel prevailed and when he let down his hand amalek prevailed but Moses hands were heavy and so the Bible said it took a stone and they put it under him and he sat there on with his hands up with the stones holding the hands up and Aaron and her stayed up his hands the one on one side and the other on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun they made sure of their testimony they made sure that that praise was going up brother I don't care how where you sketch keep those hands up I don't care how dark it gets keep Hills hands up I don't care if the Sun is going down brother keep the prayer up keep your hands up keep your worship up keep your praise up tonight don't let nothing stop you don't let the devil deceive you out of your praise keep praising keep worshiping keep pressing the battle keep calling on God keep crying out to him oh be like blind patamas they told him Jesus can't hear you although he cried higher he screamed higher he said Jesus help me oh and his voice didn't do it but his speech reached up to God and pull Jesus on the scene and tonight do something different cry out a little higher reach out a little louder and let your feet reach out tonight and grab a hold of Jesus while he is passing by tonight oh Hallelujah Oh Glory kept his hands up and the Bible said Joshua discomforted amalek and his people with the edge of the sword and the Lord said unto Moses write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in The Heirs of Joshua but I will utterly put out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven wow what a proclamation amen and Moses built an altar here it is here's the testimony and call the name of it Jehovah Nissi and he said because the Lord had sworn that the Lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation he proved himself oh to be their protector to be their soul to be their Shield to be a defense isn't that right oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's not right hey many men Psalm 46 says God is all refuge and strength a very present help in trouble and therefore will not we fear though the Earth be removed until the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof raw and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling mirror of Salah but there is a river tonight the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God the holy place of the Tabernacles of the most high God is in the midst of her and she shall not be moved God shall help her and that right early oh Hallelujah do you believe that tonight the Lord is with us our refuge amen here's this last script trying to close all to this amen you close out a few things here Joshua Tree says and behold so Joshua 3 verse 11 hear this testimony behold the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of all the Earth passeth over thee into uh over you into Jordan now therefore here's God's commandment to Joshua take you 12 men out to the tribe of Israel out of every tribe as soon as the souls at the feet of the priests that bear the Ark of the Lord of The Lord of all the Earth shall rest in the waters of Jordan that the Waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from the above and they shall stand upon an Heap God is going to do something no one has ever seen before he's gonna stack the water as a heap oh my mind he said it come to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass over so this is God's instructions to Cross Jordan is that right and the priest bearing the Ark of the Covenant before the people and as they bear the ark they come to Jordan and the feet of the priests of that very Ark were dipped in the brim of the water for Jordan overflow it all his Banks all at the time at that time of the Harvest so this was a time when the Jordan was at his highest Jordan was Bruce and his Banks going all around there's water everywhere but God spoke to Joshua and gave him instructions doesn't matter how Jordan looks I want you to take the ark and go down there and you watch what I will do isn't that right that the waters which came down from above stood and Rose up as a heap and far from the city Adam that is beside zaratan and those that came down towards the city of the plain even the salt sea the Bible said they were failed and were cut off and the Bible said and the people passed right over against Jericho they come right through God did exactly as he said he would isn't that right and they saw a miracle he's not in the priest that bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan and all of the Israelites pass over on dry ground oh Hallelujah stood right there they stood in the midst of the water while the children are crossing over God is in the midst of your trial tonight while you are crossing over while you are crossing your Muddy Waters tonight God is standing in the midst he won't move until you cross over he went in first and made a way of Escape for you God don't give you attempt until he provides a way of Escape oh for his people he does it every time oh they believe it tonight until all the people who passed clean over Jordan my is not right here's Joshua 4 and it came to pass that when all the people were clean passed over Jordan is very descriptive now the hole is clean if you had an aerial view you could see that the only thing left here amen uh of the Arc of the Covenant isn't that right and the Lord spoke under Joshua saying take you 12 men so the waters are still piled up and God speaks to Joshua and say take you 12 men out of people unto the people out of every tribe a man and he said and command ye them saying take you hands out to the midst of Jordan out of the place where the priest feet stood firm 12 Stones that you shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you shall lodge tonight in other words take 12 Stones and carry it home with you carry it to your temperature he said why he said on Joshua call the 12 men who had prepared out of every tribe and Joshua said to them pass over before the Ark of the Lord God into the midst of Jordan he said take you up every man out of you a stone upon his shoulder a big Stone his nine according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel why did God tell him to do this he said that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come so God knows there's a Time coming where the children would not have experienced the swelling of the Jordan Hallelujah but he's saying time to come when the children are saying what mean ye by these Stones then he shall answer them that the Waters of Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and when it passed over Jordan the Waters of Jordan were cut off and these Stones shall be for Memorial unto the children of Israel forever [Music] right now there's a stone being built inside of you oh that's not right God you and you continue shaping you as a Lively Stone to be fit into the headstone all of us tonight are stones that are being cut out that are being pulled out corn is doing the shaping God is doing the cotton I believe they always come where God's gonna make you a memorial God's gonna make you a testimony of the goodness of God your life will show these rainbow truths your life will show that you went through something and God gave me Temperance I went through something and God gave me patience how to deal with my enemies I went through something I went through a painful experience I I went through a cutting and God gave me godliness he shaped me he molded me as a stone oh Hallelujah and I'm standing before you today as a testimony that God keeps his word that he is able to provide for your every need he is able to heal you out of every disease oh God it's raising up Stones tonight Lively stones singing for the Praises of his glory oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah to get ready that's my conclusion tonight God has raising us up as individuals each one of us in our lives God is using us think it not strange concerning a fiery trial now come into your life Sometimes They Come unannounced sometimes they can't unaware sometimes you don't know but there is an intelligence behind all of that behind everything that happens in your life there's an intelligence behind it it is not just confusion the devil walking to and fro over the Earth causing confusion but when God permits things in your life he do it with a cause he does it with a purpose he uses these things he uses these hard things these hard sins these hard experiences to bring out something in you to give you a testimony oh hallelujah it's not right Enoch walk with God but before he left what did he have he had a testimony that he pleased God that he walked in such a way that God was so pleased with his walk that yesterday that he was here and by tomorrow he was gone he was missing they couldn't find him because a man could walk so close to God oh hallelujah hallelujah I'm telling you Church let's come in for the bride that's going to be missing one of these days Adam died isn't that right this one died and Seth died isn't that right but when Enoch came along he was the only one that did not die because he had a testimony what a type of the pride many have died throughout the ages but there will be a pride on the earth who shall not see that oh hallelu but she's gonna be raptured in the sky some bright and cloudless morning when this life is over sometime between six and nine God is getting ready to Rapture a pride out of this Hutch under reflection will be the Perfection on the earth upper come Luther upper come Wesley up will come Malachi 4 rainbow after rainbow Hallelujah will strike

this one said and I hope I hope may God help us tonight I don't want you to I want you to see this so bad he said that you can slightly kind of slightly doubt any of it you've got to just take it as it is uh brother Stephen you can play some softly amen it needs no interpretation the Bible says that the word of God is of no private interpretation God doesn't need any of our schools to interpret his word when he vindicates it and makes it live that's the interpretation of it and when God said let there be light that don't need to be interpreted when he said a virgin shall conceive she conceived it doesn't need to be interpreted we don't need all this it's seminaries and things that gets men he said well we got the interpretation we got that interpretation that's what he's saying now he said but God himself interpret his own word he doesn't need anybody to interpret for him he said it'll happen and it happens he said in the last days he would pour the spirit the prophet said I don't care what the denomination said he did it anyway because he said he would do it so it doesn't need interpretation for God does his own interpretation these things that you see that seems to be mysterious to you now if you you remember your ministry your Pentecostals back there yonder he said it was just a mystery in the Church of the Pentecost and so forth to you this day but now we find that in the word I'm trying to show you like he's trying to show them that if God turns around and says it so in the word he then confirms it to be so and that's God's own interpretation we don't need any other interpretation isn't that right praise God he will interpret himself it's not right thus say the Lord praise God is not right he'll interpret his own with us let us stand amen praise God oh
