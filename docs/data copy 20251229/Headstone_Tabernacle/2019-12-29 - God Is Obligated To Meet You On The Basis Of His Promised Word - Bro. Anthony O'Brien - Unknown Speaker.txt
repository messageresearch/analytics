holily is not a feminist powers rising from pollen all these things Russia moving into their place brought is breathing until a special carnivore is long to sit on the throne of men's hearts he did it once before in the early church he will do it one more time hallelujah hallelujah pick it not strange that you are here this morning you couldn't call yourself you couldn't choose yourself you couldn't raise yourself up you know yourself this morning we are full of doubts we are full of flesh but the face of God's resources and he says fear not behold I am with you always even to the end of

said through God said so hey glory bells are ringing hallelujah Who am I so this morning we're here to talk about something here's my title God is obligated to meet you on the basis of his promised word I'll say it again God is obligated to meet you on the basis of his promised word if God said a certain thing or if he promised a certain thing he cannot go back on his promise he cannot go back on his word he's got to do it because he already spoke it and it was perfect the first time hallelujah when God thought about you you are perfect forth in his mind hallelujah and you bypass your tearfully come along into flesh here so you didn't know all of that you come now in a state of ignorance in my eyes but God allowed it that way so that you could grow in God hallelujah hallelujah into existence but grow and learn obedience by the things that you suffer learn how to be gentle how to be patients have temperance hotel prod leanness how brotherly kindness how did they give your brother things that happen in your life to shape you and to mold you things that happen this year it had to happen it happen so that you could come for the way you come for halleluyah halleluyah what is it it's a trial of your feet trial of your fate tried enough fiery trials hallelujah of tests and temptations hallelujah work at patience holiday waiting on God waiting for God and the Bible tells us this is more precious than gold that perishes this trial of your feet is far more precious than anything in your pockets it's far more precious than the house and your car than anything that you've ever seen is the trial of your faith take that pebble though he slay me for his flaming baby's flaming the trial of the faith it's getting stronger your fish caught him Florina Connelly what feels good to be a Christian it feels good to be chosen of his you are not a mistake you're not accident you didn't just burn God didn't just do something one morning just get up without maps I knew it was created God is not of ups God is not a fight he's like God God knows what he's about hallelujah hallelujah Oh quite a subtle oops oh hi earlier when he says something Oh hallelujah let's get into this here now I know many times we talk about God before the beginning talked about before the moon before the sons but let's talk about who is going to be let's talk about God as he is right now God as he is right now in the end of 2019 hallelujah let's talk about that because it seems like the world has forgotten about that seemed like America kicked God out of their hands and of the schools and of the nation almost all together it seemed like they kick him out of everywhere that's a prophecy because he'd be standing on the door knocking say let me in and I'll come in and stop with you and manifest myself to you he's telling on the outside knocking this morning looking for hearts looking for souls looking for willing servants looking for a willing host it's not because as the Prophet taught us a spirit is useless unless it has a body to be to use any search whether it's a foul spirit whatever spirit from God it is useless this morning unless it has someone that it can use to fulfill its purpose to do its bidding here on earth oh and this morning we want to be willing servants willing servants to be used of God the devil has found a way through technology and through the media and to television and to music to influence the minds of young people to make them willing host for Lucifer an activity for demonic activity for a cult activity I love to music and to the media the devil is able to do that then what can God do this morning under the influence of the voice of God what to go through with people who are willing to surrender themselves to the power of the Most High God we don't come at all we don't come in on name but blessed is he this morning that comes in the name of the Lord blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly not standing away of the sinner nor sit in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of God I mean law he meditate day and night the blessed man the righteous man many plates upon that law and his law is his word man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God that is what we were meant to live by is to live under the law to be blessed by that law to be covered by that law to be protected by our law but some hour man come out from under an law because the devil slip in and it is juice introduce something to Eve that was not below it was not what God said and God had already proclaimed he had already declared by his mouth that the day you eat thereof not there you die is not he had already spoken it and he couldn't take it back so I'm sitting in the Garden of Eden his word came into effect it's night and God pronounce judgment he say forms and thistle shall the earth yield unto you because you have not obeyed my word by the sweat of your brow you shall eat bread Holland is my judge notes proclaim why because they couldn't keep his law because they couldn't keep his word isn't that right oh my oh my oh my so what is caught today who is caught right now God is the absolute power and is the absolute authority over all the earth over everything over every creature holiday it is under his feet this morning Sheen John 1:3 says all things were made by him and without him was not anything that was made he made everything he made the trees he made the Sun he made the moon he made the stars and he made you this morning the Bible says you were fearfully and wonderfully made or they made you a little lower than the Angels I'm crowned with glory i loving-kindness and renews your youth like an eagle put not your trust in Princes where there is no help I look into the hills this morning my help cometh from God I don't need no man to help me what score is on my side I shall be able to drive out the enemy ass alone I said if God is with you this morning you can live a holy life if God is with you this morning you can overcome the demons Oh hallelujah hallelujah come on now same as somebody isn't that right caught today is that absolute authority once he speaks holiday that's the law that is his decree hallelujah what's a lot daughter smoking it so Shannon P it's not it's not right he has a power as unto a king Halle is nine there's a king of Syria the king of Russia the king of this the king of that but God is a king of the earth hallelujah hallelujah a man is only in authority because he's under authority but sometimes man forget the authority sometimes man forget who they're supposed to answer to right but why don't you forget or not whether you know it or not the law is still the law hallelujah you still have the answer to it you are still subject to it it's not God's Word is his law what word is this decree what word is hallelujah whatever it is it's shuttle in heaven forever whatever he speaks his trunk whatever he speaks is as good as finished or you can hang your soul on it it's not Ecclesiastes chapter 8 and verse 4 says where the word of a king is there is power and who may say unto Him what do is done in other words who is going to tell the King what are you doing why are you doing it you can't do that he is the absolute authority whatever he choose to - he could do it if the King choose to let you go he can let you go and of course he'll be with you I'll be in you who is minor the question not who are you to question the king oh who are you to doubt it who are you to question it who you

reveal himself to whomsoever he will I'm so glad he chose me he bypassed the high he went past AHA no lofty ones and he revealed himself he chose that many fiims help this morning with pageants Oh hallelujah praise God always do that he always do what is contrary to man's will and to man's idea the Prophet always had the scribes and the Pharisees missed Christ because he didn't come the way they thought he would come he come a different way when they were looking for a rebel somebody to overthrow the government here come a man speak in peace say to unto others hallelujah hallelujah Saint turn the other cheek holiday is not see my kingdom is not of this world if it was of this world my men will fight for me but because it is not of this world will do hope some things eternal Oh Connor Oh Connor but don't think that our spiritual Hollow [Applause] Florina hallelujah oh my take him a different one what time they come to him and say their mother and your brothers asking for see for these said well mines was my mother who is my brother who is my sister damn that to the will of God hallelujah he disconnected himself from on full affiliation even on the cross he looked at Mary looked at Lazarus on the phone he said Behold my mother is my ride behold my son it's not right he disconnected himself why because he come from another place he come from another space hallelujah hallelu the will of God hallelujah on this morning I challenge you to disconnect yourself disconnect yourself from earthly relations you come from somewhere else you going back to somewhere else we are asking through here Oh hallelujah hallelujah for testimony that poor is still the same [Music] oh it's not right okay so let me read a city sovereign amen that's what he wants no question it's not right hallelujah he's and you know what prophet said something very interesting him let's just zoom in on it he said people think that God can just do anything . very interesting i read this real slow so you can catch it people think that god can just do anything free really a man but no that's not that's not it he does what he wants to do he is he the only thing people think that god could do just anything he wants to see but god he said god cannot do anything he said god is obligated to his word did we get it now so he dropped from thought to an expression would so before he even created a world we are taught that the logos is what comfort food is now because it was the expression of his flock you can't bypass that process it's not right you can't jump the creation or not having the word first because he's obligated to that you understand the logos word is the expression image of the invisible god that you couldn't see for eons and eons of time do we don't know how long he was in existence there's no measure to that time only came into creation from in the beginning it's not right but before that he was caught forever he was an even call call but we call him that it's not right but he was Elohim the self-existent spirit entity from before there was ever time your mind cannot even stretch that far but that is what it was I'm not gonna tell you anything else because that is what it was he was called Almighty all alone by himself is now arrived but an out of this what you couldn't see spirit then came logos image and then out of that logos was spoken the word let there be let there be let there be it's not so the spirit now created something now channeling he the work through called a local school and then from that came creation came in the beginning God created the heavens and over no that's how we get Genesis 1 it's 900 that is God's process that is his modus operandi a man that's the way he operates that's a way he does it's not a man see so he sees he said God cannot just do anything he is obligated to his word he is compelled to it he has an agreement with that with his word he may not have an agreement with your thoughts with your ideas or what man is thinking or with man's way of doing things the only thing he can agree with is with his word so he said my prophet said now God cannot lie the Bible says he can't so there's one thing that God cannot do it's like there's one thing that he can't do this morning is he cannot lie he says is the truth it's the truth it's the truth and if he says you're gonna make it that's the truth if he says you're going to be filled with the Holy Ghost that's the truth if he says he's coming back for you and that's the truth and you say [Music] if there's one thing he can do he can lies glory to God a man wonderful Wow okay Amen hallelujah oh my he said no he says you can't do it see there's one thing I can't do and when God says anything and makes a promise God God cannot take that promise back because he's God I'll read that again one more time so when God says anything because he is the absolute authority because he is covering up all things when he says anything when God makes a promise to you God cannot take that promise back hello he's already spoken it Florida it's a Word of God it's like an our data shot from the bow once you pull it it have no grabbing it back it's already spoken it's got to reach especially the Word of God shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I sent it on to shuffle pill that's which I please shake hello hallelujah that's why the most powerful thing is his word because once he speaketh the miraculous trust take place once God says something the devil all know that his time is up because once the King has spoken it once it is declared once it is decreed then it's brought to take place and listen it does not matter at a time that word could have been spoken a hundred years it might have lost its juice so to speak man I might have forgotten about it it might be laying there may be on Scrolls may be on books on tapes but one scroll spoke something it's got to take place hallelujah because that word has got a German and it's got a life in it and it's got a prophecy in it that when it finds good ground it's gonna take on life of its own hallelujah so nCore eternal God spoke in the beginning I have thoughts in his mind thoughts of what you are going to be thought about where you're going to live thoughts about how you are going to grow up how you were gonna find Jesus oh you are gonna find the gospel and he spoke it that word went out from his mouth and it went I don't care for thousands of years your word I've been circling but you are here this morning and the word concerning you is going take on life we are gonna find hallelujah hallelujah the word concerning you oh my god hallelujah so we're just kind of building something now he said now when God says anything he cannot take it back see because he's God and he's sovereign hallelujah even the Devils are subject to him it's nice hallelujah when the sons of God came to worship hallelujah is now right even the devil came also to worship and God called him to I said have you considered my servant children he is suffering he can say whatever you want to he drew that there was attention to his own son why for purpose because he felt that job needed some trials because they felt some scriptures needed to be fulfilled that though he slay me and I trust him if that some scriptures needed to be fulfilled some scriptures needed to be written and the only way you can write it is through the righteousness of job so God in truth was tried this way we tried that swing it's nice and that is how we get the scripture I know my redeemer liveth though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh will I see clawed for myself it had to be that way but trials had to come the boyars had to come so that we could get that blessed holy scripture do you see it now do you see it now that's why things had to happen to you and brought out so beautifully the continuation of the book of the generation of Jesus Christ and then that book had all kind of faults it had people affairs failures mistakes all kinds of short comments they had their stories but God crafted into that story all kinds of isms and schisms but he was coming down to a perfect one a sinless one that would redeem them all even come to redeem people who was perfect think about it the great Redeemer is coming to redeem one perfect people people even spongecake insane hallelujah glory know they had trials they are testings some are prostitutes some were distressed holidays some went to all kinds of different things something wrong hallelujah some repented some turn aside hallelujah I made a new move some might went to some venture out on faith hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah all for the glory of God hallelujah hallelujah waters some to the flood some to great trials but all through the plan when Christ Saddam was slain upon that cross and he said it is finished brother I could imagine in a supernatural what a shockwave that sent out throughout all yet hallelujah hallelujah finish all the temples flange all of the temples ideas all of the gravels traps all that the devil tried to do the Pirates had the grave shook loose and people who are bound in sin came up and was seen of many walking around the streets God set them free instantly oh my I'm going this way and that pray for me this morning I'm a man okay so he said he said he can't go back on that promise he said now how many believes that's true he says so he says he says therefore there should be no more arguing he said which can prove it and he minister and the gospel can prove is that the divine healing was included in the atonement is no promise that he was wounded for our transgressions with His stripes we were healed is that right oh he said that just settles it on one line he said if it wasn't in the atonement if it he said then if it wasn't in your tone men and God's Word says so he said then it's right anyhow he said cause God is obligated to his word he's obligated to it man it's not but about tells the story I said brother Baxter the other day in a discussion he said give the most beautiful illustration illustration he said that in a certain land listen to the story he said it was a righteous King he said on a king was going to execute a slave he said on the laws of the land said that this King must kill the slave and the slaves standing before the king was trembling a new verse and the king said now don't he said he said what do you require before I kill you what do you require before I have your life taker and he said the sleep said a glass of water and so the King K game gave the slave a glass of water and he was standing and he said and he was so nervous that he couldn't get it into his mouth because he's gonna die see so he was just it was just spilling out all out like that and the King said now look straighten up said I'm going to take your life he said no the King said I'm not going to take your life until you drink that water and the King looked up at him the King the slave looked up at him rather and throw the water out and the King had to let him go for it was his word the Prophet said he was a righteous king he was a good man and a prophet said and God is more than just a good man he is soft operator saying this morning he operates by a certain law a certain framework it's not all like Eva he's operating my sitting law is not right that's why when you were lost in sin he had to come a certain way in order to redeem you he had to subject himself to his own law in order to redeem you he had to bring himself into a state like yours into a condition is not a flashlight condition in order to redeem him he was without sin yet he took sin upon himself and went on the cross and died like a sinner hallelujah because it was the only way to redeem you back the great mighty King surrender himself brought himself to a lowly stage you he rode into Jerusalem so symbolic riding upon a donkey showing his humility while they cried Hosanna Hosanna blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord they worshiped they sang and the Pharisees didn't understand it the scribes didn't understand it they said tell those people stop making so much noise stop worshipping so much stop praising so much stop thanking so much sounds a lot like the devil but jesus said if these people don't worship if these people don't make this noise the rocks themselves will begin to cry out because they recognize who this man is and when you recognize who God is in your life you can't help but worship you can't help but shout you can't help a praise God Almighty for his goodness for his mercy for his love for his power for his forgiveness for his serenity Oh hallelujah [Music] hey man what's my time here all right wonderful she said God is just more than a good man he's sovereign and when he says so in his word the Prophet said whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe you receive it's not as that's whatsoever things you desire she said these things that I do shall you do also on because I go unto my father it's a decree he has declared it by his mouthpiece Oh hallelujah anything in my name and it shall be given unto you holiday if you shall say to this mountain be therefore removed and be thou cast into the sea you can have whatsoever you ask hallelujah hallelujah so it's time this morning lost have confidence and I pray by this service this morning that we have a renewed faith in the promise word of God and what he says hallelujah knowing that it's going to happen this would concern in your family a word of deliverance hallelujah hallelujah that has already been shot this morning that never cannot stop it the devil can't take it away I don't care how much doubt I don't care how much fear I don't care what befalls you this morning the Word of God shall remain fast forever and forever and forever the flower fadeth the grass withers away but the beautiful God shall stand forever and ever ohto he slay me yet I'll trust him hallelujah God is still the same his word is still the same and his promises are still the same hallelujah praise God Almighty hallelujah women it's not hurt see that's true he can't take it back it's true God has made a promise he was wounded for our transgressions and with His stripes we were healed bad sense I don't care what sickness befalls you this morning plead the promise of the King Jesus who took his stripes upon his back for your healing even today even right now he didn't die for you just yesterday he died for you today he died for your tomorrow he died so you could make it he paid for that your future could be to unexpected end that you will receive the Holy Ghost that you will receive your sonship your kingship hallelujah it's now right okay would make Word made flesh the word became flesh prophet says 1954 he says when God speaks anything it's going to happen it's not right but it is his thought first then his word is expressed thought to a perfect world that's spoken into existence how can that feel what a perfect word is let's you and brought you here hallelujah hallelu oh it cannot be passe Oh hallelujah perfect we're perfect feet to believe a perfect card for anything hallelujah praise God Almighty Oh hallelujah my he said it's thought first then his word is expressed see then then it's nothing no matter what comes or goes it's got to happen oh you can see the infallibility of the word holla except no matter what comes or what goes no matter what comes in your life no matter what goes in your life no matter what people say for you no matter what people speak against you the Word of God is above that it's above curses it's a prophet people think it's about people's ideas people opinions about you it's above it's above your family on the Word of God and above that above your fears above your failures above your shortcomings it's so good of God and my thoughts are higher than your thoughts his ways are higher than your ways it's understanding acknowledge him in all our ways and he would I recognize it's a higher power though the winds blow contrary don't you remember what happened when Jesus was in the boat he was there sleeping and the waves were blowing contrary at that point the disciples are scared but just imagine trying to be a tiny little dinghy in a sea or ocean of roaring waves waves going back and forth to create this of the ocean roaring how deep below them they don't know hallelujah some of them can't swim is now they fear for their lives in that moment they seem to be in the hands of something monstrous something deadly something that seemed to consume them something I was flattered powerful that they could even understand or fathom the rain was falling the lightning was flashing the Thunder was worried the sea was walking back and forth like a great time Norma's body of water you can imagine that they were frightened but they said go away Jesus I went Jesus woke up he rubbed his eyes and he looked around holidays night and he spoke to her in and he said peace be still it's not and somehow another all of that great wind all of that lightning all of that fun all of that great cloud but here was someone what the power another wind high wind something that blows away too strong don't you worry this morning there's something greater than you could see greater than you greater than I that voices creature greater than your touts greater than your fears that voice goes to pass your feelings wash your shortcomings hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so here's the thing what we have to do is to anoint or faith enough to see only God's Word and to encourage your faith enough to see God's Word only and no other word concerning your life because if you see anything else it will distract you it'll shake you from your purpose that's why you've got to remain single life and single motive and single purpose on the word concerning your life if you keep your eye on the prize if you know God is going to deliver your family keep your eyes fixed on that word don't care what condition don't care what happens on the Left what happens on the right keep your eye on possible and what he said hello the devil cannot shake you once you're dead eye on that word hallelujah I don't would have never fallen he would have never fallen if they kept eyes on the road but it first had to lay down the world in order to take up the enemy's interpretation it's not and when they did that then they fell but as long as they were in our word they could never be defeated hallelujah because they were covered by his law by his decree by His Word and what he said isn't keep that word ever before you it's now I shall not be moved David said go ten thousand fall on my left hand ten thousand of my right whatever doesn't matter like the pastor says step over the bodies don't let them dis wait you it's not right be fully persuaded this morning the Bible is a book of the stories of men and women who are fully persuaded by the things that they have seen and heard they were fully persuaded by it hallelujah so persuaded with him but they feared not their lives unto death but they swore hallelujah that what God said it would bring it to pass and they stood with it isn't that right glory to God a partisan Abrams Telenor the promise of cloth or a little to unbelief what was strong giving praise to God though his feet was trying though he was wearing though he was slain this way and that way his freaking standing because Karl had spoken and revealed to him he didn't speak to Sarah but he's fooled Abraham and Abraham's faith stood for 25 years believing believing hallelujah that God would send that promised son Oh hallelujah is now so it's time for a faint to begin to rise up in the wood of God to be anointed towards the wood of God I know it sounds common it's not like somebody we say all the time but there's a real result there's a real genuine results when you remain focused to your objectives to what you are trying to achieve people in the natural to amazing things when they remain focused and what they're trying to achieve it's not right when Thomas Edison is now right was making it a lightbulb it's now right they found a hundred ways how not to do it but what was he doing trying and trying again why because they believed that it could be done and they kept on pursuing pursuing they kept on persuaded that they could somehow harness the power of electricity and because one man sacrificed and tried and tried and tried again we have lightbulbs in this building right now as a progression of the original technology that they created back there in the beginning all right but many early times and if man could achieve so much in a natural how much could you achieve this morning when we treat the road with diligence Harlan when we treat the world with industry I love with motives with objectives on a single eye single motive Oh swim in on your prayer focus in with your prayer and with your face this morning on the promised Word of God if you focus enough what we're saying this morning is God is obligated to fulfill Halloween his promise on the basis of his promise to fulfill upward this morning that's right no matter what comes or goes it's got to happen got to happen he said oh can you see the infallibility of the world Amen oh my he had blinded their eyes he had hardened their hearts that they should not see with their eyes nor understand with their hearts and be converted and I should heal them he said look God through his prophet Isaiah a man who had his ups and downs like we do hallelujah they were men of like passions you think you have trials they lived in a time where there was famine and pestilence and soared while we drive an air-conditioned cars it's not right a man see there are trials see a man the ups and downs like we do had his mistakes like we do but God got that man so yielded and by being a prophet got his words he said God's thoughts hallelujah he said God's thoughts expressed through those mortal lips of Isaiah a man with sin and things I have with his ups and downs like I have like you have he was but he was a yielded vessel to go and he expressed the thought God's thought through word and no matter what they done Isaiah's words had to be fulfilled for it was God's thought expressed through Isaiah that's powerful isn't it so hail Isaiah speaking and God is going to back up what Isaiah says because it's God thoughts being expressed through Isaiah and one day God's gonna have a people on the earth who are going to be the thoughts of God express you have no thoughts but his thoughts hallelujah how to speak his word only and then when you speak it'll flash like lightning hallelujah amen that's what slicks in a take place it's not right Express rise here there you are hallelujah o God upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it oh my when the world is no more the heavens and the earth will pass away but my words shall never pass away oh this capacitor way that capacity your job your future no career but my world shall never pass away isn't that why he was expressing in word the thoughts of Almighty God had a prophet says now he says and when we by faith can accept that word now it's got to become material when we by faith can accept the Word of God as it comes to us then it become material then it will become real then it will take on life he said oh how it thrills my heart to think the I word forever in heaven Lord is confirmed what God's thoughts is he expresses them in words and here is the Living Word of God but around him not to pop it several times that Jesus said he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life and shall not come into them condemnation but has passed from death unto life hallelujah oh not under condemnation but passed from death unto life how about a word of God not that he goes to church not that he put his name on a book not that he professes not that he shouts not that he heals a sick not that he opens a blinded eyes not that he speaking with tongues not that he prophesized but he that here at my roots and believeth them or are you hearing the word this morning more than gifts more than prophecies but the word of Almighty God if you could hear the word this morning he not here at my words I receive at them Oh hallo and receive it in that sent me hath everlasting life and shall never come into condemnation but has already passed from death to life oh brother let that face anchor one time in that heart until then words will be true before God he said then the heavens and the earth will shake and go away but that eternal wood that thought that is in your heart that is expressed by God oh don't you see this morning it is not you but it's the eternal Word of God that is in your heart by fate that is what brought you here this morning you are not to believer but the world in you is to believer don't wear it in you ohana is what is being tried the trial of your faith of faith in you all is being tried to small

material and dwelt among us hallelujah tell me 10 million years maybe before the world was ever formed but God's taught seen his body tabernacle and flesh to take the sting out of this email prophets dance oh my it will again falling apart I read this chord here this is where I get my title from said we're like Abraham Abraham received the word and anything contrary to the word he called it as if it wasn't and if any true born child of God receive God's word he said I don't care what anybody says what system speaks against that word the word is true anyhow and he says and he says God is obligated to meet you on the basis of them promises Oh hallelujah if he makes the promises then he meets you there if he makes a promise he'll meet you there my brother he'll meet you there my sister

caught does not desire a legs of horses or the power of men holler he has his own power he is his own glory oh he's looking for souls and I willing to surrender themselves that his word could work through hallelujah hallelujah right oh they're all tired of them promises he can't meet you outside of them promises he can't meet you you're on your own why he says because because you don't cut yourself off from him oh so he's connected to this very daily promises that he has made concerning you so connected as he that if you cut you if you pull this up away from his promises you cut yourself off from him because he's not obligated to anything else but his promises but his word what is law and what he said he would do because if he's big enough to speak it he's pretty enough to bring it up ash oh he said I will deliver and he will deliver he said I will restore and he said he will restore he will restore this morning make no mistake and numata hallelujah when God promised Egypt promised the children of Israel down their deliverance town in Egypt land what did God do he sent a baby hallelujah cause it's his night it's now right even though the story hallelujah

my anointed and to my prophets no harm no I'm not harm his banner over us love this morning think it not strange that evil has not come in your direction because God shields you from the left shields you from the right things you don't see things you see it doesn't matter God is in charge and sometimes God let you see to show you that in His grace and mercy and it's still with you even though you fall even though you make mistakes but that's what the blood is for it's for an atonement then you can always come back to the throne of God and surrender and ask for forgiveness I let it spill out

under tutors and governors eatin grapes hallelujah until his time came until it would come Moses at the best of the best oh my how God cares for his believing children Moses wore handcrafted leather boses dropping Lincoln's and Bentley's Moses wore gold right but like all Eagles they come a time when they gotta come out to the nest a cushy Nance that is there for them to preserve life until the prophecy has he got to come to your prophecy Casillas can't stay forever when you now come to the Lord it's so wonderful it's so wonderful you feel good you feel victorious but there come a time when you got to get out of the nest gotta get out of that cushy place gotta get out of that comfort zone a lot got to push you out of there into the reality into the unexpected into the unknown where you are unprotected oh but in that in protection you are protected by God oh you can only see God's protection when God pulls a mask off of it hallelujah let you face the trial let's face the storm hallelujah things begin to happen and mousses begin to realize that boy his childhood was wonderful he got all the toys he always wanted for Christmas every year huh but they come a time when that had to fade away when are we gonna identify himself with these mud doublers with these lames with these holidays this is these diseased Hermits these people who seem to have no home I have no nation to call their own but God was about to deliver God is about to do something but God needs always needs one he could work through one he could get his hand on his Kongo smooth all the time borders how to offset change turn things over in your life turn it over your heart turn it over your spirit to give you a new desire to give you a fresh outlook a new perspective he let it happen that way but we could have these wonderful scriptures how could we have it if someone wasn't tried if someone wasn't tested to see the grace of God in their lives yet it be written in a book that it would testify the goodness of God man hallelujah hallelujah is now right he composes he ran kill one man ran away that was his story that was his part to play that's all he could attest for that's all he could account for it's not right and they stayed in the desert he got married settle down and told himself this is my life c'est la vie hey my I will stay here and I will a man tend to the Shipman and do what I'm supposed to do and be a good boy and and so on that was Moses his plan but I wasn't God's plan God's plan is different from your plan sometimes I think God even laughs at our plans because we think this somebody think that and we imagine a very different future for ourselves and for children and for all life and I'll walk but God has something better in store for us hallelujah that be without us are not made perfect Oh hallelujah so here was Moses was out tending to the fields when he saw what it was a burning bush and he said I'll turn aside to look and see what this attraction is upon the mountain I went Moses drew closer and when he drew closer to this attraction a voice spoke from the bush and said take your shoes from off your feet hallelujah our Moses did it I'm glad this voice began to speak to him how do you I'll tell him some things that he had never heard before challah is nice and he said Moses I am calm down I have heard the cries of my people I have come down Moses and I'm sending you to go and deliver them hallelujah hallelujah someone to represent me I need somebody to speak for me and I've chosen a man and I've chosen you to do it and Moses had every written excuse in the book hallelujah isn't that right I couldn't talk stutter oh I didn't have a confidence you know he didn't have the wherewithal and God said go on go on with the excuses continue let me know when you're finished already was finished God said you still going hallelujah because I've chosen you I've already spoken it I can't take it back when I look to the book I see that you didn't want to have to go down and do this thing so I don't care what your human spirit says I don't care what your thought says I don't care how much doubt you have in your mind but what if God has already spoken but what I've got declares and I'm gonna send deliverance for my people therefore you go down there hallelujah hallelujah when God has finished with Moses Moses countenance was changed his walk was changed his talk was changed how after a burning bush experience and that's what we need this morning to meet that burning bush to meet that pillar fire to meet that Holy Ghost anointing that's annoying thing that changes that anointing that rearranges and removes your doubts that removes your fears that dispels the darkness and the chaos in your mind to give you a clearer picture let you know who you are and who you are who you are okay so Hebrews chapter 2 and if you if you witnessed anything he said now let me read some things pull these things out I said now if you witnessed anything you're just as guilty as being a partaker of it irena again if you are witness to anything you are just as guilty as being a partaker of it he said so if we witness and say oh yes they ought not to have done this and so on and so on he said be careful what you say because you're guilty the way or judgment goes that's what I Bible says if we should judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord it's now right and to show his debt till he come he said the way of judgment goes on all right he said if you can't decide don't say nothing he said just leave it alone he said but then many when you testify that you are a Christian he said then you are guilty see he said you're guilty of being a Christian and he said you must live to that professor with your mouth you say I am this then you have to prove what you are your life proves what you are that man will see Alleluia a my what your works are because your work to tell praise God your fruits will tell of what you are is now right by your food Jesus said you shall know them isn't that right no please he tell everybody I'm a Christian he threw out the hatchet first amen so people knew what to expect of him it's not right I don't do this I don't do that right now people looking at you see you already professor with your mouth so you can go back on that now let's do something else you've got to live up to that expectation it's not right Amen that's the way it is he he said you're guilty of being a Christian if you profess you claim to be a Christian he said you're guilty of that because you claimed it you professed it isn't right he said you must lift it up he said and when God makes a promise here Islam in the Bible he said he said I see men here no wheelchair he said but when God makes a promise he said he is guilty of that promise unless he brings it to pass the Prophet here said God is guilty when he makes a promise so just as you are held accountable for your words God is held accountable for his words and for his promises and he is guilty of that promise until he brings it to pass God is guilty when he makes a promise he said and the Scriptures are guilty until they 4/5 he said see there there right best there as a statement at quarters made its got to be fulfilled he said or God is guilty something else my mine said see you listen to this he said listeners also he said if God doesn't at the scene no we just expressing what God operation is right he said listen this if God doesn't act the same when the same circumstances arise he says then God is guilty of being partial to his people no God serenity demands of him to work in every case like he did in the first case oh he was wrong when he worked in the first case and we know that God is not wrong so if he did it once before he's got to do it again hallelujah that's why we know the Holy Ghost is gonna pour out because if your faith it's just like what the early church had then crawl we'll do it again if you've got faith for your healing hallelujah like what he said then caught scrunch it to it again hallelujah once your feet meets the same condition it's got to have the same reaction we're proving God by the scriptures here my heat many man hallelujah see but God is a judge and he's not wrong so when he makes the case it's gonna be that way it's now oh my he said if God is not this way the same way he did in the first case then he if he will not different to the second case then he acted wrong when he acted on the first case so he said if God healed the sick in the Old Testament the Prophet said he has got to do it in the New Testament and today hallelujah that's why right now you can claim your healing to the shed blood of Jesus Christ because if you heal them back then he could do it for you today what he did for them back here he'll do for you the shame oh I'm glad that I could say I'm one of them Oh hallelujah hallelujah oh he can heal the sick he'll do it today if he raised the dead up he'll do it today if he delivered a captive you to it today if he opened a blind eyes he could do it today if he open the Deaf here he could do it today if he make the lame walk if he made the plans here if he did it in time posh he can do the same for you if he's safe back there he could save you this morning if he delivered back there he can deliver you this morning the Word of God is the same yesterday today and forever he has to do the New Testament today or he did wrong when He healed him back there he's got to do the act the same every time and he will do it when when the same faith meets the condition the Lord but over all possible of its last Sunday he mentioned this quote here and it struck me while I was sitting there listen to it amen and I want to read it back for you in the third seal he said now that's the reason today now the revivals are supposed to have we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring no no no no no sir don't think we've got revivals we have not yet prophet said or they've got millions and millions of church members but not a revival no way no no the pride hasn't had a revival yet see there's been no revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet he said see but we're looking for it now it'll take those seven unknown thunders back to wit to wake up again see yeah he said you send it he promised it now watch he said no she was there he said and now here's the party's talking about he said now if the churches would forget their Creed's and forget their dogmas and just take the Bible and plead the promise then it would come effective to them take the promises he said he said he'll deliver he said he's party spirit upon all flesh he said you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you hallelujah he said he said plead the promises this morning Oh God is still the same and he promised to deliver he promised to restore he promised to open a plan eyes he promised a fiver ojala we promised my people shall humble themselves and pray i'm turn from their wicked ways that they were here from heaven he promises and therefore we live upon God's altar the Lord sent a fire notch and the power lots and the anointing you promised that my people shall sojourn in a change land but you bring them out when I'm mighty hallelujah God I made a promise he is able to fulfill his promise this morning he is able to keep his promise word to fulfill it let the caller answer my fire let my court because this morning I let him burn evil eyes creation me revival but a fire the Holy Ghost glory to call a man that's what I want that's what I need that's what I'm gonna expectation for amen forget your Creed's forget your dogmas and just take the Bible and plead the promise then it would come effective today but you see Jesus said you were taught traditions make the Word of God non-affected to you he said well that's the same thing today with spiritual ease see the spiritual bride today the so-called church that she takes a word of God but she won't accept it and she accepts dogmas instead and therefore the word is not effective to her because she tries to inject her Creed with the word and it won't work anything else don't take anything else don't accept anything else but what God said but what God's Word says who is now right
