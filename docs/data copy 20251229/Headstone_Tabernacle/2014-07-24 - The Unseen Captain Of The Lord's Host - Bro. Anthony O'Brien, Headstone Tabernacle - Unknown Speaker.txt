And Joshua uh fell on his face to the earth and did worship and said unto him "What sayeth my lawn unto his servant?" And the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua "Loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place where on thou standest is holy." And Joshua did so amen now turn over St mark 16 and verse 20 will you just read that scripture quite shortly there amen and then we go over to Revelation 10 amen praise God see Mark 16:20 just one verse there at the last says "And they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following."

He said "I am the angel of the Lord sent from the presence of the Lord to tell you that your strange and particular birth is for a purpose." Hallelujah glory to God oh man could speak to you your mother could speak to you come on now your brother could encourage you your sister could send a word of advice but it's something else when the angel of the Lord speaks to you personally that's a whole other thing entirely we try to encourage people we try to keep on pressing but it's something entirely different when the angel of the Lord makes his appearance when he makes his presence known to you when you know for yourself that you didn't come to church just by chance but you were summoned by an angel to come into the presence of God to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire that's what you come for and I'm not going home without it i'm not going back without it i come too far i cannot turn back now oh hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah satan cannot discourage you he's too late from discouraging you tonight oh you already know the truth you can't turn your back on it when you already know there's another dimension how can you go back to being normal i don't want to be normal i want to be what God wants me to be tonight oh hallelujah oh give him praise tonight amen my God hallelujah amen amen i'm beginning to love Thursday nights thursday nights is for the water lappers thursday nights is for them who really want it for them who really need it for them who don't mind ripping their shirts for them who don't mind busting their buttons open but give me my promise give me my mountain give me my inheritance hallelujah thursday night is for them who want to challenge Satan praise God just because they can do it just because they have the ability to do it let's go up to Satan oh let's let him know something tonight we are not alone hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah you're not alone tonight you're not alone in this fight you're not alone in this battle daniel 12 says there'll be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time look at what's going on in Syria look at what's going on in Israel a time of trouble it keeps getting worse it keeps getting worse they shoot down a plane in in Malaysia or whatever amen wars and rumors of wars but the end is not yet this gospel will be preached and then shall the end come hallelujah i wonder who God's got tonight to preach the gospel god's got some elect seeds tonight praise God who are going to live something hallelujah brother Abraham said "You don't always have to be a preacher you don't have to be an apostle or whatever but live your sermons." Hallelujah you are called to live a life worthy of the gospel that when people see your light so shine my God they get they get thirsty they get thirsty hallelujah hallelujah they want to know who is the God that you are serving who is this unseen force who is this unseen person that is walking with you that is fighting your battles that is opening your doors that is making a way for you hallelujah i can see the unseen captain tonight when you leave here tonight he's going to go before you he's going to shield your way tonight there's no poisonous dart of the wicked that can touch you or your family hallelujah there's a promise in there for them too at that day you shall know I am in the father you and me and I you are going to speak for your family praise God hallelujah by the spoken word of glory [Applause] [Music] oh hallelujah my I'm getting ahead of myself amen but I feel so excited tonight because I know he's right here among us oh hallelujah it feels good to know that we have a confirmation hallelujah hallelujah evidence what is the evidence what I can see what I can feel what I can touch no no no that's not my evidence my evidence is a faith tonight my evidence is a revelation h of God's predestinated will for our lives hallelujah i evidence is a revelation that God give praise God amen that he would send his angel before us to lead us in the way hallelujah hal isn't that right [Applause] amen amen so who is he tonight he is that mighty angel of Revelation 10 1-7 that we spoke about isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah bible said Amen saw another mighty angel come down from heaven amen amen in other words the Bible right off from the first verse is declaring that this is not just an ordinary angel hallelujah isn't that right angels are servants angels come to bring messages angel come to bring message amen isn't that right to bring word from the Lord hallelujah but this this book declaring here Revelation 10:1 said "I saw another mighty angel come down."

And when John turned to look for a lion there he saw a lamb bleeding and bloody hallelujah hallelujah praise God seven eyes seven horns he come forth to take the book oh hallelujah hallelujah no wonder why we worship no wonder why we shout no wonder why we scream we have a right to shout jesus didn't just save you he come to take the book hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah oh hallelujah so that book is not closed tonight now that book is open hallelujah hallelujah all that God has promised for you all that God has in store for you your promise of adoption your promise of the Holy Ghost your promise of your family coming in before those terrible plagues strike that promise was in that book but there was no man found worthy to take that book but here come the lamb of God to take that book that was in the hand of the him who sat on the throne praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen amen amen amen and what happened oh heaven erupted oh they were shouting and praising and worship and dancing oh hallelujah and singing oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right hallelujah and the first seal open hallelujah certain things begin to happen but there was nothing under there for us yet the second seal open and the third seal open but there was nothing under under there for us yet we still waiting for our time here come the fourth seal here come the fifth seal here come the sixth seal hallelujah with judgment and so on amen isn't that right but there was nothing under there for us yet oh hallelujah but Revelation 8:1 when he opened the seventh seal there was silence under there isn't that right this secret was so glorious this secret was so precious this secret was so so so meaningful to him that he couldn't just let anybody have it the prophet said if the devil knew about it he could do great damage hallelujah god knew that this secret was too precious to let out just to anybody and the Lord would do nothing unless he reveal it unto his servants and prophets and God had a man on the earth at that time hallelujah gathering all the mysteries up together hallelujah getting everything ready for a special visitor that was supposed to come on the earth hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah amen isn't that right 1933 pillar of fire drop down on the earth what did it say as John the Baptist for run my first coming so will your message forun my second coming hallelujah hallelu early up brother Brandham had a heads up amen and what his ministry was all about it was to prepare a way for him to come down who is he the Lord himself hallelujah hallelujah he is that mighty angel he is the one that come down amen with deliverance isn't that right praise God hallelujah oh give the Lord a shout of praise oh hallelujah hallelujah oh something fixing to happen tonight something fixing to happen revelation 8:1 god literally shut down heaven amen when the seven seal open he pushed the power button just when Satan thought he was going to get something shut everything down nothing moved he looked for a secret here nothing moved he looked for a secret over there nothing moved and by the side the angel come and he whispered to six other angels and he said "I got a message i have something to give to my servant the prophet."
