this morning hallelujah [Music] do you know that song jehovah is your name can we sing that song [Music] your created [Music] is [Music] vincent [Music] are you happy to be in the house of the lord this morning [Music] so i'd like to invite your attention to the wood if you would turn with me thank you musicians thank you brother anthony to three portions of scripture reading isaiah 55 reading malachi 3 and reading hebrews 13 for scripture readings this morning isaiah 55 a familiar passage of scripture seek ye the lord while he may be found calling upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our god for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts and not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts and your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not feather but water it the earth and make it bring forth and bud that it may give sea to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth fought out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing where to i sent it reading malachi 3 and verse 6 for i am the lord and i change not and read in hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning i have a title this morning my word shall not return void my word shall not return void hallelujah and that word void means empty so the word cannot return empty the word cannot return with a result once the word is spoken something must come out of it even if you don't understand what comes out of it something always comes out of it my word cannot return void but it shall accomplish that thing which i please so there are things that would please god and it shall prosper in the thing where to i sent it so once god speaks whatever he says it has got to prosper it has got to come to pass and god through diverse prophets and times and dispensations and epochs and heroes have sent prophets and messengers and preachers because the mouthpiece of god are his prophets so when god speaks through his prophets a true prophet cannot lie a true prophet cannot inject his own ideas a true prophet cannot put his own perspective on things a true prophet is commissioned to say what god put on his heart to say and to use his mouth as an instrument and that is what makes it a true prophet and when that true prophet speaks and it comes to pass then you know it's a true prophet and if you read scripture you cannot find a prophecy that came from a true prophet that did not come to pass it could happen in a month it could happen in a year it could happen in five years or it could be 400 years that's a prophecy that came from isaiah that a virgin should conceive and be a child it was not an immediate manifestation of the prophecy but the prophecy had to come to pass because a prophet spoke it and once a prophet speaks it it has got to come to pass oh come on somebody say amen [Music] and even when a prophet comes off the scene even though another prophet is there and another prophet may be there if there's anything that's hanging over the fulfillment of it could still happen it must still happen in fact so when peter walked out of the upper room he didn't refer back to the malachi he didn't refer back to zeddika he went straight back to joel and said this is what joel was talking about it couldn't happen in his day other prophets came after joel but this prophecy that joel made it apply to us can the church say amen so god because he operates in eternity and is not limited by time the way we see things is not the way god sees things and before god got down to giving the word about my word shall not return void he preface it or laid a foundation about the difference between our thoughts and his thoughts he said my thoughts are higher than your thoughts so what i'm about to tell you is because my thoughts are higher than your thoughts and my ways are higher than my ways so even if you don't understand them my words still shall not return void it is not based on your thinking it's not based on your understanding it's done based on your experiences it's done based on your emotion it's the peace and how you feel it's not based on what happened to you if not based on what happened this morning it's not based on what the doctor said it's not based on what sin you did it's not based on who your father was it's the peace and who your mother was it's some place in how long you're in church it's based on the one factor that if god spoken it's got to come to pass [Applause] it's very simple this gospel is not a complicated gospel once god speaks it it's got to come to pass somebody preached back to me oh hallelujah you may be seated for a minute i go back to when the prophet preached for the blind man he prayed for the blind man and he prayed for the blind man but the man had no feet so the man came back to the prayer line he came back to be prayed for and by the problem said i don't have to pray for you again i want you to get that this morning he said i don't need to pray for you again i already prayed for you and when i pray for you it already activated something in heaven the praying is not the problem your faith is the problem so he said go back to work go back to what you do and begin to say by stripes i'm healed because you're already healed i can't take it back you don't need to hear it again it's already the truth the world has already gone forth your healing has been declared your deliverance has been declared your breakthrough has been declared when god said receive you the holy ghost he was not just speaking to peter he was not just speaking to john he was not just speaking to paul but he was speaking to you jesus himself said receive you the holy ghost and when that word left his mouth that word waited until you came along and waited until paul was there and waited until oh come on somebody preached back to me [Applause] don't try to lock my god in any day and time you can't lock him in there you can't lock him in time he's an eternal god he doesn't understand our limitations his thoughts are higher than our talks up his ways are higher than always oh somebody preached back to me this morning [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah no wonder but the brandon said we ought to be reckless and fearless in faith meaning you have to have a kind of attitude that you don't really care anymore because your faith is what's propelling you it don't have to make sense to you it's not supposed to make sense everything cannot make sense as brother terrance say god loves to do foolishness the match don't have to add up when jesus came the match didn't add up five loaves two fish feed five thousand remainder twelve baskets the match does not have to add up we have to take god at his word stop trying to figure it out stop trying to look at your past and say i don't think you're gonna make it your past have nothing to do with where you are now and where you are going god is able to take anybody fill them with the holy ghost he could take your sadness and turn it into gladness and he does not need permission he does not need permission he can do it this morning and he is doing it this morning [Applause] [Music] you may be seated your healing is not based on merit of your understanding your healing is not based on the merit of your revelation your healing is based on one thing that's faith it's just one condition god requires to heal and that's faith so you could walk in this morning in all kind of condition that's why the prophet said prostitutes would come into the tabernacle but they had faith and they were delivered they didn't know the scriptures he didn't they weren't there for the long preaching but they had faith to see god in the reality of a present tense ministry and say yes that's me i have female condition i'm going back different i have arthritis going back different high sugar finish low sugar finish high blood pressure finish low blood pressure finish my child in trouble finish finish finish finish you've got to speak it declare it walk in it [Applause] may be seated so the man who the prophet prayed for to them but just keep saying by stripes i'm healed it was looking crazy brother alexis listen people could see that he was still not seeing but he's seen something that was contrary to what they were seeing he was saying something contrary to how he was feeling he was saying something contrary to what the doctor was saying but he did not care because something spoke to him just keep saying it just stay in faith worship god has nothing to do with your feelings nothing to do with your tiredness nothing to do with what happened [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it has to become real to you this is the first thing you have for the week that's real when you come to church that's when it's real everything else is imaginary everything else is fake everything else is temporary everything else has nothing to do with the real picture everything else is deception everything else is lies because the devil is the father of lies technology is a lie system is a lie traffic is a lie what traffic you're talking about what are you talking about philip was caught up and there was an ethiopian eunuch and he needed to get from here to there what traffic you're talking about he didn't even need a camel he didn't need a horse one minute he was here the next minute he was there what existence was he in what plane was he in what dimension was he in what are you talking about somebody preached back to me this morning [Applause] hallelujah the doctors want to know what this thing is when this centurion come to jesus and say good master my servant is sick [Applause] my son was in trouble he didn't come to a family member he gave her a servant he said hold on i'm not worthy for you to come to my house i'm in trouble my house in trouble i wouldn't want to bring your your majesty into my house but i have fear this morning somehow i believe because i know when i tell one to god he's supposed to go when i tell one to come he's supposed to come just speak the word and i know my servant will be healed where are the mothers in the house who have faith like that just speak the word this morning and my daughter will be delivered yes speak the word this morning and my son will be delivered just speak the word this morning and my family will be delivered [Applause] can the church say amen hallelujah and his faith was so real that when he was heading back to the house but at jason he didn't ask if he was healed he asked when what time because i checked the time i checked the time when the word was spoken i want to know how fast the signals work i want to know how fast the signals work can the church say man it must become real to you it must become life to you that you are creatures of eternity trapped in time what does your bills have to do with how you feel this morning you come the chair but the random piece of message why are we so tossed about your mortgage trust in you your bills toss in here the doctors report this is a lie is tossing you what are you talking about because the woman with the issue of blood she had went by doctors and they had tried to help her because they were taking her money it was only when her money was done and she was her walrus against the back or backwards against the wall however you want to put it and she will be in a rock and a hard place and she have no other options sometimes that's what god love you know when they have no other options some of us have too much options so we ain't get desperate enough yet oh somebody help me this morning so when it came to the spot that she ran out of options she started to look around where can i go what can i do what shall i do she said yeah somebody tell you hear about jesus who is jesus you hear about jesus you know about jesus it is said that when you get to jesus you could be healed it is said that if you i hear a blind man eye opener i believe she would have had to hear something to move her from her condition to try jesus [Applause] but when she got there she was the only one who would so jesus surrounded it's crowd it's all kind of people and like some of us she said they say you know what it's just too much it's too much more i better come back too much too much people just wait for what i want to know you ever wear mighty savannah a food place right they sell wings and different things yeah yeah you ever see line people willing to wait because they find the wings good without our worry wait wait two hours because they won that thing people want that thing so much they will wait two hours without our some people listen that people leave san fernando to come to porter spain to get that wings and line up for two hours the journey alone is five hours is the whole trip to enjoy this thing for 15 minutes so when this woman came down there and see jesus saw the crowd she tell herself i come too far to just drive back home and the bible said she started to press away and she told herself if i could just touch the hem of his garment now jesus never spoke to her this is what make this testimony so powerful jesus did not speak to her she didn't give her promise if you come and meet me i'll meet you there that was not the promise she told herself if i could just touch him of his government i will be made whole she made a word to herself and she kept the word to herself and she started to press her way she didn't matter who was next to her who was there just quiet who was there for observation who was there taking notes she had a need and her need was greater than what other people around her so she pushed past him how great is your knee this morning how great is your knee this morning hallelujah my so my word shall not return void hallelujah hallelujah how many had a rough week this week there's only one person two people knows listen elena being honest and now and that and that's all right you know job didn't have a hard week job had a hard place at trying where he lost everything and when he lost he think that wasn't he naturally has a loosey thing in the physical he said i get sick i said i get so bloody that's a lose income you lose everything on your wife say why don't just kill his god and die and we get the insurance money but the bible tells us that the sufferings at this present time because people suffering is not people though that's walking and suffering but are these sufferings of this president are not worthy to be compared with the glory that will be revealed so in other words to get the glory you have to go to the suffering so that's why the bible says the issue not only suffering no but counted all joy so the next question is who had joy through their trials this week [Music] i've seen a different configuration of hands well glory listen god loves honest theorem peter was a fisherman and i'm sure he could assume when peter fell any water after he was walking in the water peter say well let me just backstroke back to the boat so i don't look too bad peter say listen i'm drowning you know peter forget about truman forget about all he would have learned as a fisherman because what he had stepped out on was new territory if he was walking on the water and he was honest himself enough to say i need help when jacob was left alone and he was battling with the angel he just said who are you in other words tell me what you're really going through you say well i'm a deceiver mr planter i'm now your name will be changed because you're overcome but it's okay to let god know lord i need help you know this temper thing this temper thing [Applause] this annoying thing every time again i get easily agitated you could imagine if god was easily agitated you just had no patience you know but this gospel and these trials is to get us to get patience you know virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and then god has designed the trials he himself has signed off on the trials for brotherly kindness recognizing what you're the age to test it and to try it and he will have to do it over and over again until you say yes that's it you know behaving itself like a son because power has to come [Music] power has to come and for you to have power you have to have character and the police you're trying is when you feel or you don't feel like doing you still do that's what he sacrificed the praises you know back in the old days his sacrifice was bringing the lamb and and but the sacrifice no is is is when you don't want to do what you still do so you don't feel like worshiping you don't feel your body your hand given your trouble but brother branham said when you lift your hand you defy gravity [Applause] so just the actor lifting your hand is defying the laws of this world you're defying gravity when you lift your hands you identify yourself as a worshiper can the church say amen it's a choice it's a choice to worship it's a choice to praise it's a choice to come into the house of god it's a choice to read a word it's a choice to be on fire it's a choice to forgive it's a choice to love it's a choice to have more patience it's a choice to tarry and wall into the horns at the altar it's a choice to bridle your tongue it's a choice i have the right attitude it's a choice it's a choice it's a choice can the church say amen hallelujah god's word has got to come to pass he promised a pride he said there's going to be a super church there's going to be super race that has got to come to pass every word has got to come to pass hallelujah i will restore say the lord that word has got to come to pass that's your promise has nothing to do with what you lost the question of what you lost the question is when is he going to restore because he promised he's going to restore hallelujah [Music] [Applause] hallelujah my my my mind and by the brand i'm in the message putting on the whole armor of god he says that and he's speaking about about secret agents and warfare and he said each nation will equip its people with the latest equipment the very latest and they study and they do everything they're trying to counteract the other fellow's weapons and to get a little more modern weapon something with a little more punch to it and it's the nation's business if they want to survive they want to equip their soldiers with the best equipment that there is well god you know he's infinite he don't have to think anything better hallelujah he doesn't have to think anything better he got the best to begin with so you can't improve on it nothing to be done about it he gives us the best that's his word his word is the best so god's trying to give you our improvement on it it's the same word it's already the best weapon it's your best offense against sickness it's your offense against everything you're going through your boss get in trouble take the word the word is power you're feeling sick take the word by his stripes i'm healed you say the word come on now [Applause] but the random said god cannot make a decision today and tomorrow come back and make a better decision god doesn't make mistakes he doesn't have accidents here well let me try this this morning let me try to talk about the problem i'm going to try to talk to you about a nicholas let me try and see if this will work this time no he makes a perfect decision every time so if god chose you and put your name down on a lamb's book of life he can make a i will never do it i will never do it right no he already chose you and god cannot change his mind he cannot change his mind about you oh hallelujah and the arrow of god's deliverance has already been shut he can't even pull it back his prophecy over you has already been spoken he can't even take it back hallelujah [Music] so you can rest on whatever god says you can rest on whatever god says concerning your life you can rest on what he says about your health you have to rest on what he says about your spiritual condition that he will not leave you barren it's not his desire to leave you empty you could rest on what he says when he says he gonna give you the holy ghost you could rest on that you have to go beyond your emotions beyond your feelings are beyond your mistakes the devil's job is to keep you in that realm of your mistakes and your sins and your failures and what went wrong and you lose control that's the devil's job but we are here this morning to get reminded that there's a seed in our soul that the devil cannot mess with the devil didn't put it there the devil cannot reach it he cannot get to it but the branham said him to get access to it he have to come under the blood and he cannot come under the blood because if the devil will come under the blood he'll be your brother but the devil is our enemy he cannot come under the blood so he cannot come and touch what's inside your soul he has no access he has no access when the devil tries to reach you he tries to reach you access denial he can reach other people but you you are the blood washed ones there's power in the blood there's a blood bumper around you the devil could try to afflict your body he could try to mess with your spirit but your soul there's a seed in there a germ of predestination [Applause] hallelujah you may be seated and that seed is based on the law of god that seed could only produce after its kind and that seed in that seed has every genetic code from god in that seed is a living fate it's a living virtue it's a living knowledge it's a living temperance it's a living patient it's a living calling in that seed is the mechanics in that seed is the dna of who you are that you didn't know about so god had to send a message to wake up your understanding that this seed is in your soul and god has to wake up your understanding that you are to get that seed in the right atmosphere because you could take a seed you may be seeded and if you put the seed on ice it'll have a different result and if you put it in good ground it's all about the environment so what if branham said if you take a chicken egg and put the egg under a dog didn't he see that because the atmosphere is right the chicken would still hatch because it has to be in the right environment and when you take a seed you can't put the seed in nice beautiful sprinkled sand and printer nice does know you have to put the seed in manure you have to put the seed in the field sometimes you have to put a seed in conditions that that that seem contrary to the beauty that's about to be unveiled so god under the chaos of darkness under the chaos of this world allowed us to grow up in different homes different families different backgrounds that appear to be so messed up that the devil have to wonder could anything good come out to nazareth the devil had to wander could a bride come out of trinidad the devil after one is there somebody's going to overcome because they're looking bleak and looking like the bride is dead it looked like nobody holding the message but the seed is still alive and the devil because he can't see it because he was hidden under the seventh seal he is trying to do mathematics and geometry and algebra to figure out who you are the same way he had to ask jesus if thou be if thou be if thou be if god poured himself into christ and the devil didn't even know who he was what about you as an amateur god what about you as a measure of that stature the devil has no idea who you are you are god's secret weapons his secret agents somebody say man blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah so his word cannot return void but ibrahim said this message would find itself in the hands of the predestinated you didn't find the message the message found you the message interrupted your life the message haunted you the message followed you the message convicted you the message convinced you even when you backslid it troubled you you tried to do different things and somehow you just didn't feel comfortable that's why i say young people all the time listen when you have one foot in church and one foot of the church is the most miserable existence the most frustrated place to be is one foot in church and one foot in the world because you can't go to a party and jump up because there's too much of god in you to be comfortable there so you're jumping on one foot jumping you can't enter in that and when they come to church you can't enter all the way in because one foot they fight and i'm trying to be outside you're upstairs on your foot outside. but something has to take over is about surrender it's about throwing up the white flag and saying lord i surrender that's where the song comes from i surrender all surrender control surrender decision making surrender all of it to what god wants and when you do that it's simple this message is not complicated you know it's a message of surrender it's a message of commitment it's a method of truth and faith and a reality that your behavior has to change [Music] people coming to church and going back and they have more knowledge but their behavior is him more information but the behavior is the same if it disrespectful to your husband i would expect at least every week you're less disrespectful until it's gone but at the same level as you respect for years you were operated at level nine let it hit eight now seven six five four until it some people lose the behaviors immediately like like like soul on the road to damascus god knock him off the horse immediate transformation but there's some people it's a process we would pray everybody's immediate but that's not the case it's a process of character development a process but a random talk about praying and he said as you're about to break through it's when you're getting tired and the mosquitoes come the prophet had to go through that you can't just go check my next one you pray for two hours solid every day really it's a process and you have to carve out more time you have to and this is your work now people are waiting on god to give to give them to give you what he already gave you the word which is all the weapons you need and in the world gives you instructions about having a prayer life in the word have instructions husband love your wives that's a commandment in the word instruction children obey your appearance in the word don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together so you're supposed to be in the house of god in the word present your boys a living sacrifice holy and acceptable that's in the word walk before me be thou perfect let god say that that's in the wood so your promise is there jesus come back and matthew fivefold here be therefore perfect as your father in heaven is perfect that's your word that is your hope that's your expectation that's your reality but if you're not anointing a word to yourself what are you doing you're just making circles you are in your own death walk walking around in circles coming to church walking around in circles but when you see that his word shall not return void that word that is not returning void is not just blessings you know it's also judgments because when god pronounced judgment on sodom and gomorrah he couldn't even take it back judgment had already been spoken so you have to extract lord out because when god speaks he can't unwind his word he already spoke it so judgment is spoken over los angeles judgment is spoken over this island judgment is spoken over this earth fire is coming judgment is coming but a rapture is also coming deliverance is also coming a way of escape has already been spoken and is here and god sent a prophet to make sure that that message of escape gets to us that we could get ready and make preparations the same way noah made preparations the same way all through the ages they made preparation so too we come this morning to make preparations to be positionally placed before the terrible plague strike to be in position before judgment strike we're not here this morning because of fear we are here this morning because of love we are the pride of jesus christ his love his unconditional love for us was so great that he overlooked our failures overlooked our mystics overlooked our faults overlooked our backsliding overlooked the many days you didn't pray overlooked the days he didn't read the bible and he still said i love you and i want to marry you he still say i love you when your thoughts was all messed up his love reach past your thoughts down to the seed in your soul when you felt like giving up his love went past your thinking to your soul to reconnect with the seedy planted deer that is your identification [Music] that's why the prophet can say you are not even the believer but the word in you is the believer it has to become a real to you that the word in you is the believer and the trials will come the testings will come but these are not to weaken you these are to strengthen you so that your roots can be more firmly established in the present truth that through the preaching of the word you could know how to make ready because we are leaving this place and before we leave this place our families will be delivered before we leave this place up our families will be restored before we leave this place you are promised to be healed because foreign healing so divine healing must be here before the rapture comes that's our promise that's our expectation that's what we're looking for for every prayer request to be healed every single hard case every single trouble case every young person who can't find their way god has their name he has an appointment and he will visit him at the appointed time not one will be lost not one will be lost [Applause] you may be seated when moses left egypt pharaoh was so broken by the king of israel by the god of armies that he said don't even just take your family you know take all the animals too take everything moses said not one hope left behind nothing we're not leaving any behind and your family you have to speak the same way not one will be left behind they are going to make the rapture they're going to make it over there your husband is coming your wife is coming your daughter your children they have got to come as for me and my house we will serve the lord the promises unto you and to your children and to them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call it's a reality [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah i'm just encouraging you this morning that this word is real and it cannot fail it's real and it cannot fail you are gonna have the holy ghost you're going to have joy that you can't explain that's your promise he is not just a god of yesterday he's not just a god of tomorrow he's a god of today also the same yesterday today and forever but abram i'm saying it's easy for people to preach about what happened yesterday and it's easy to preach about what's going to happen but you see right now people say when i will get joy no god wants to have joy right now i will have the victory god i want you to have the victory in the future you put out victory right now victory right now you got to believe it you got to believe it that right now no fate is your healing is now your joy is now your victory is now there'll be more to come but right now there's no excuse for you to be sad there's no excuse for you to be depressed there's no excuse for you to be defeated hallelujah he is god and he is able he is able to restore candid say amen oh hallelujah stop running from your purpose stop running from your calling stop running from your predestination hallelujah you could be seen it and run from it that's what jonah did he was called for a purpose and he ran from his purpose but even though he ran his calling didn't change because in running god had to change the whole situation around and positioned the fish that when jonah was on the uh on the ship and he fully fall into the fist that that fish listen the fish taking instructions to take him straight to where he's supposed to be straight where he's supposed to be hallelujah that's what brother branham said if love will get you desperate conditions will so if god has to break your foot to make sure you're coming here you know where you're coming with a broken foot until you come here and then before you leave here you leave the foot [Music] god will do whatever he has to do to get you to hear his word receive his word recognize his word act on his word that's god he's all god by himself church he doesn't want part of you he wants all of you i hope this helped somebody this morning many times we we want to get caught up in so much sick and the simple things we leave god out the picture he doesn't want part of you you know the problem is people put things in in in cabinets or containers so so sunday morning is church as he's scheduled for church and then monday's work and then tuesday is this and and god air coming back in the conversation until the next service compartmentalized thank you brother anthony don't put god in a compartment but abandon preach doors and doors for a reason he said people like to put god in his portugal he said yeah you see right here this is good fellowship here and then you go in the bedroom you go in the living room and god have no invitation to the other parts of your life but when you preach georgia you say make god feel welcome make jesus feel welcome make jesus welcome to go into your kitchen and open all the all the doors all the copper doors in your kitchen somebody preached back to me this morning would jesus be welcome to open every drawer in your kitchen would jesus feel welcome to go through your bedroom and come on now would jesus be welcome to open your desk on your job would jesus feel welcome to log on to your computer would jesus be welcome to go and tell you could you give jesus the password to your phone come on somebody preach back to me he wants all of you would jesus be welcome to to be on every conversation what would you say on the phone if jesus is on the line if every phone call is a conference call which is on the other line what would you say to your brother what would you say to your sister what would you say to your neighbor if jesus is in the conversation on whatsapp when you speak to your family or friends what would you say if jesus is on the line come on now somebody preach back to me make jesus feel welcome in your car when you're driving down the road make him feel welcome to listen to what you listen to come on somebody preach back to me this morning this is the gospel it's not putting on a suit on sunday morning it's him being welcome to go everywhere because the bible said he went everywhere with them confirming the word with signs wonders and miracles [Applause] bro benjamin would jesus be welcome would he be welcome brother jason would he be welcome in your house because here it looks okay but would he be welcome because to make him feel welcome your behavior has to change your language has to change your conduct has to change [Music] can we dig into this a little bit if somebody irrespect come to your house i've seen people whisper in the kitchen and if the person wasn't there there wasn't whispering italian was the two cups because he are you ready reach until you wash the two cups so you feel embarrassed when somebody come like if your balls come in for the house and be like no you know he must excuse the place okay me please say i i wasn't really able to clean for the last nine months just exclusive please jesus is not coming to get no excuse depletion we're talking about a change of behavior excuse the place tonight's heart talking to my wife for the last eight months we we really trying to speak in terms like the way we sir we just talk make jesus welcome because for jesus to be welcomed because jesus is love so love has to be there because that's what attracts him in him his attraction to us is because he so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son it was love was driving his behavior so to make jesus feel welcome there has to be love between husband and wife love between wife and husband love between father and son and anybody in the house is there anybody in the house this morning [Applause] for jesus to feel welcome the love must be reciprocated can i speak on a little bit because god i heard a preacher say god bankrupted heaven if he gives you the word by giving everything he had his only begotten son his love was so great he gave everything all that god was he brought it to christ and he sends christ down as the greatest gift when he search heaven to figure out how to express his love the only way he could do it is his only begotten son his most valuable possession he gave it all [Applause] to redeem man and we in turn want to give him a uh two hours on a sunday is that what love means to you because god is lover he may be seated that's why i don't take issues and brother nicholas help me understand this sometimes he is his simple things gives us the perspective sometimes i think about nicolas also was talking and he was explaining he said people will say why is leave your house to go all the way to granny you say well some time ago you know sorry i delivered him or somebody you know he said i had a girlfriend in tokyo or something and he said he was leaving it was marawi to go up to toko wherever and he was traveling because he loved was great they don't know easy trouble but the love was so great it was men back in the old days before you had what's up on these things you have to know that you plan to visit you have to plan the trip you have to save it you have to leave early in the morning to make it on time what drove that behavior was love if it wasn't really sure he was in love he wasn't doing them is this is this reaching anybody so if you tell me you love god and jesus went deeper he said how could you even love god if i love you person next to you because you god see me and you're telling people you love me but your brother next year you're looking at him shaking hand here called him for the week but i don't know how we barely love me let me dig down in this thing called love because we are one body so when one member the body and pain you ought to feel it and when one member is in joy you ought to feel it too because there's one body it's a body of christ by one spirit you're baptized into that one body so friends this is to encourage you this morning this is not in my notes so somebody pull in and i'm yielding to the poll this morning because this has to become a real test what are you looking for preacher are looking for reality that the behavior when people see you see me they must take note that something is different about us that we have been with jesus because it was understood that when you met jesus your life was not the same you can't tell people you met jesus and you live in the same way you have yet to meet jesus because when you meet him your behavior is supposed to change your love is supposed to change your worship is supposed to change your commitment is supposed to change somebody preached back to me [Applause] [Music] i always find myself with these messages where it's not they shout for joy and they kinda come into your house opening doors opening windows pulling out under the bed you know some people when they clean and they say i have to clean myself because you're afraid to let people help you you don't know what you're going to find but when you're living right you can send me you you can help me have nothing here to hide you're like don't go in that door don't go no that leave that window dude no not that room just clean that's clean you know what just clean the porch i'll handle everything else because you have stuff hiding in here and stuff hiding in here and you know that weighs down your life but about them calling unconfessing the bible say confess your force one to another get it out your system encourage one another proof walk one another it's like you know there's some people here they don't want to go by the doctor could they they want to go away doctor they they freed the injection they but you then living with the pain when help is available and when we come to church we come for the word to begin to operate and uncover things that we may think is okay that we may think i want you to get this now that you think it's okay but it's not that's why brother ovid always say husband love your wives not as your father love your mother but as christ loved the church because we measure things based on our experiences we measure things based on our knowledge we measure things based on our understanding but god has a way and our objective of coming to church is to see his way not my way not the pastor's way his way the way he operates because we want to be like him can the church say amen and no wonder the prophet can say full obedience to the entire word of god is what entitles you to the token because full obedience to the word will bring you into subjection to the word waiting for dynamics to come upon the mechanics but the mechanics part is your part the dynamics part is his part can the church say amen anybody everybody feeling fine this morning could we could we go somewhere that's just it background are you ready are you ready i really hit anything yet to know we're looking for a change of behavior and god will test us and he told us the devil will also test and make you prove every one of these virtues so you have tests coming from every side to prove these virtues are operating in you before you could seal the whole thing so it must be proven before the final ceiling before charity comes a bond of perfection to complete the whole thing and say this is a finished work what can the church say amen and in order for you to even be here this morning you had to be led by the spirit just like simeon was led by the spirit you shall not see death until you see the lord's christ seaman was living comfortable because he knew that he couldn't die until he see the lord's christ blind anna without having eyes to see in the natural was led by the spirit to identify messiah wasn't it that's being led by the spirit but it might have been a message expectation the same reason that you're here tonight and i say today you sick people the same holy ghost that led simeon the same holy ghost that led anna has led you here for you believe that there's a fountain open somewhere for healing it's here god moving amongst his people and his people believing so the holy spirit could only lead you to truth the holy spirit can only leave you to act right you cannot tell me the spirit of your acting bad you misbehaving and saying his spirit so if you are if you have the holy ghost you're looking for the holy ghost there's evidence of that you know your behavior you're supposed to be speak into that you gotta be losing your cool you breaking up your house you're mashing up things that say is his word the holy spirit will not lead you sisters to cut your hair try to butt up makeup trying to look like the world and could imagine if jesus is welcome in your room and you're there trying to pick up and put up something on your face to do what wouldn't you feel embarrassed because i see some people who say they believe when they meet on your own and when they recognize this meow but anthony they don't feel like they're uncomfortable look at him from the corner because they don't want here so if a man would make you feel that way how should god make you feel as you go through every decision of your life your schoolwork your business life your career you can't operate like the world in the corporate world people will just stab me back and do this and do that is that what god teaches well how does work here you know so and you will risk your experience with god because of the way the world operates on your job or in school or whatever just want to break this perception of this compartmentalization of god to your church experience but it's when you're alone and nobody else is around is your true test of who you are when your wife not there are your children that you're nobody else is there who could hold you to a higher expectation then the real you stands up and that's what we are because that is what he tutor that's when the holy spirit tutor wants to see your behavior he really wants to see your behavior when nobody else is around to see how you will conduct yourself and this is what we are fighting for friends the church is a born-again bunch of believers that's in christ by the holy ghost led by the spirit of god this from the mystery children and jubilee they are not of the world they are out of the world they are different from the world i've preached this before it cannot be that you are like the world or you want to be like the world or you want to act like the world the bible said if you love the world and the love of god is not even in you not even in you can the church say amen that's what makes them what they are their life is dead and they're hidden christ dead in christ and hidden sealed by the holy ghost they're away from the things of the world from the messed expectations sons of god are led by the spirit of god not led by some other fanatics or some organization or something other they are led by the spirit of god the holy spirit was given to the church to be the overseer the tutor that was to raise the children of god not our bishops and cardinals and so forth but the holy ghost and brother branham said and this is his expectation hear the word for us i'm expecting the holy ghost not denomination not a bishop not a catholic priest not a baptist preacher or a pentecostal preacher i'm expecting the holy ghost to come and set in order a church that will go to meet him filled with the power and the resurrection of christ i'm expecting that i believe that god promised that that there'd be a church dear without spot or wrinkle on it i'm expecting it because god said it was so and my word shall not return unto me for it can the church say amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i remember preaching a message god has never changed his strategy hallelujah because he's the same yesterday today and forever i am god and i change not so the way he operates he operates the same way every time and the devil still doesn't get it that even though god operates the same way every single time the devil still can't figure out how god operates hallelujah romans 8 30 moreover whom he did predestinate demi also called and whom he called them you also justify and whom he justified them he also glorified because he predestinated you because he foreknew you he could predestinate you because he predestinated you he called you because he called you he justified you and listen these words are all past tenser let me read it again i want you to this is not future tense of presidential no more moreover whom he did predestinate demi also called past tense and whom he called them he also justified past tense and whom he justified them he also glorified past tense so god is not no predestinated no calling no justifying no no he already did it so your destination the glory is guaranteed he is speaking as a finished work what demon what devil what doubt what password mystic can separate you from the love of god oh hallelujah nothing past nothing present nothing hallelujah everybody feeling fine oh hallelujah in a message a guide and i love this quote because god and said god has never changed his strategy never change it and satan has never changed his so this is the part that confuses me by the judge if god hasn't changed your strategy and by the way i said the devil catching a strategy and god always winning and the devil had no room to change because he don't change the strategy either that means god will win everything every single time so this is a rigged game you know we know the result before the game play every day every day we know the outcome in them every single day we know the outcome every single day we know the outcome and what's the confirmation of it i want you to get this for a minute you maybe see that i heard somebody speaking recently about jesus people know jesus as the healer people know jesus as he as as as jesus who was asleep on a boat and that's wonderful but he said he resurrected christ because within judaism and islam and these other groups they recognize jesus as prophet what they have problem with is he resurrected christ now because they have no problem with jesus as prophet but they have a prosperity resurrected christ because the resurrected christ is the one that break the moral of all the other prophets all jew jesus ministry he was calling him god master calling him teacher that's what they how they say address the others rabbi teacher master healer it's not that the jews were not knowledgeable about miracles they knew miracles so jesus doing a miracle wasn't really a big big big thing in context because they knew they had miracles before but is he when jesus died and he put the word before he died he said destroy this temple and three days and raise him back up again them kind of things is what people have problem with dicey thing the devil really had an issue with because when jesus died jesus the bible said i have no sin but in order for him to get the pass the ticket to get to hell because you have to get a ticket to go to helicopters going to hell you have to have sin to go to hell but jesus didn't have any sin so he had to find him and jesus stood there and started collection to get a ticket he took the sin from the past the sin from the present the sin from the future and he said taking all of it and are putting on this sin because i want nobody to question my ticket to get young into hell because what jesus was going for was beyond just redemption he was going for authority and power because the bible said all power in heaven and earth was given unto him but the devil was holding some keys so when jesus reached they couldn't stop him from walking inside because he was sinful but he was the only one who could walk in there and walk back out for the first time someone could walk in and walk back out he walking and manhandling security walking and man-handling bodyguards walk straight past the bodyguards straight to the devil and took the keys turn back around unlock abraham unlock isaiah unlock joel and nope listen i want you to picture it and nobody could move because they never saw this before jesus was doing what had never been done before all the demons in hell want to know who is this who is this who is the king of glory the lord mighty in battle he had come down can the church say man [Applause] maybe she did i had preached about this before god's dominion is heaven he put man to rule the earth man's dominion is the earth that's why you have to pray because god don't operate without prayer god don't move without a request somebody have to cry hannah had to cry the children had to cry somebody on the earth has to do something to activate god to move on the scene it takes a human it takes a man a son in position to activate the glories to activate the power god doesn't just drop down unless somebody makes a request that's why when he called to moses he said i've heard the cries of my people and i've come down because man has dominion somebody preached back to me [Applause] you ever seen a bearing mind that's fallen man man in egypt has fallen man that man in egypt without the holy ghost that's man in egypt living in sin that's man in egypt before the fullness of the atonement and yet still their cries interrupted heaven and caused god to drop down on the earth because somebody had activated his presence or somebody preached back to me [Applause] so in order to fulfill the plan of redemption god had to find a body that's why he had to get jesus he had to put a sperm inside of mary and by the branham said he breaks it all together himself so he could have a body he could use so now this body can activate everything you don't need somebody else who don't understand the plan so jesus cannot say when you see me you see the father we think in the same way we on the same page we know i am here my hour has not yet come because jesus is on a mission to bring deliverance to set the captives free to comfort them that mourn he was the prophet of prophet the teacher of teacher the master of master the king of kings the lord of lords wrapped up in human flesh and he was vulnerable he was tired he was weak he fell asleep and this great god stood in front of lazarus grave and wept and when he shook back his head he activated who was inside of him he said lazarus come forth and brother branham said if he didn't say lazarus every dead every dead person was going to wake up [Applause] everybody with me this morning so what are you afraid of this morning knowing the pork is saying these burgers say death where's this thing grave what victory you talking about because even if i die listen it's just me speedily getting to bite you off in here this this wretched man that i am this flesh man i am here on a mission they had no fear no fear true scripture you know what are you one of the most common things jesus said fear not fear not fear not and then in the new testament later on and say for god hasn't given us the spirit of fear but a spirit of adoption whereby i require our father so what are you afraid of don't be afraid you're gonna make it don't be afraid you're gonna be healed don't be afraid whatever you do shall prosper don't be afraid keep walking on the promise don't be afraid of ten toes not fall on your side or whatever i shall not be moved keep your eyes like flint i'm going to the rapture i'm going to the resurrection i'm going to have a revival my son is coming my daughter is coming my wife is going to be delivered that's our promise hallelujah [Applause] so god always needs somebody if god didn't need anybody he could have operated without humans but he needs somebody so he called paul a pharisee of pharisees a odd man who was not there when jesus was there amen and give this man a mission and when he was called them brothers have an issue with him god does do things why can't i get a nice brother who was there when he was there but he picked paul he picked paul who brothers had issue with him even when paul said preach really by whether brother still had issue with paul because they was thinking back when paul was pushing within them and they remember stephen and when paul was there and paul was imagining kill him and when he said so it might sound bad but but god was showing that when he take a hold of somebody you can't judge that person by a human eyes paul was a star in the right hand of god a messenger at an age and god had paul irenaeus martin columba luther wesley and in our age he sent a prophet 20th century prophet simple man small man no great education but god speaking first to that man and then through the man the son of man feel that he is son of man and every word he is speaking a spoken word the original seed words that cannot fall to the ground words that must come to pass words that somebody will catch words that somebody would hold on to words that would change your life words that would interrupt the plans of the devil words that would pronounce healing can the church say amen oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my my my i'm not gonna be too much longer with you oh hallelujah god gave the promises and he is able to keep his promises and when god give the promise to abraham in the message convince and concern he said he will possess the gates of his enemies and so shanghai believed that you know the saw yosham government and look at the odds against him god only needs one man just let him get one man in his hand the world will think he's crazy but he will drive home the gospel when he's thoroughly convinced that jesus christ remains the same yesterday today and forever are you thoroughly convinced that he's the same yesterday today and forever because if you are thoroughly convinced that he's the same yesterday today and forever it'll make you live a certain way it'll make you act a certain way because you are thoroughly convinced that he is the same yesterday today and forever under anything else he will stand true and go on because he's thoroughly convinced that god is god and if he ever was god he is still god that's where the man i'm speaking if he isn't the god he was he never was god that's right he's the infinite god the all-powerful almighty omnipresent omniscient infinite oh my he's god he's the same god that opened the red sea he's the same god that brought daniel out of the lions then the same god that brought the hebrew children from the fiery furnace he's the same god that raised up jesus christ on easter morning he's the same god that fellow near pentecost he's the same god that raised lazarus out the grave he's the same yesterday today and forever and i'm convinced that this is the holy ghost oh hallelujah [Applause] he's the same yesterday he's the same today he's the same forever he's the same quarter when joshua says stands film and see the salvation of god and say son stand right there he's the same god and made it come to pass he's the same god that was there when you were born in the hospital room or in the house he was there to make sure all delivery was all right he's the same god the first day you went to school he was there to make sure you went to school he was there when you got up this morning and started your car he was dear he is there all the time and he promised to never leave you he promised to never forsake you he promised to be with you peter said on the day of pentecost this is that and if this isn't that i'll keep this till that comes for i believe this is that i'm convinced that it's the gospel and the power and the demonstration of the resurrection of the appearing of the lord jesus in this last day making the church ready to be caught away in the pride see in the message future home of the heavenly bridegroom and healthy bride see his plan of redemption is exactly the same by everything he uses the same method he never changes he said in malachi 3 i am god and i change not the way he does it therefore if he saved the first man he ever saved by the shed blood of an innocent one he'll have to save the next one and everyone he saves will have to be the same way if he healed a man at any time through the journey of life let it be in the days of jesus the apostles the prophets whenever it was when the same conditions is met he's got to do it again that's right he doesn't change man changes time changes age changes dispensation changes but god remains the same he is perfect what a hope that ought to give the sick people if he ever healed a person he has to do it again when the same conditions is met he ever saved the man he's got to do it on the same grounds he did it the first time if he ever fill a man with the holy ghost he's got to do it on the same grounds he did it the first time if he ever raised a man up from the grave he's got to do it the second time and every other time on the same principle he doesn't change oh what a hope that gives me what is it not in some man-made theory something that groups of men have come together but his unchangeable word let every man's word be a lie and mind be true for heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail all scripture is given my inspiration jeffo is good and profitable for doctrine all scripture will be fulfilled every bit of it that's what the prophet said can the church say amen everybody feeling fine just a little more we're done god's strategy is to take empty human vessels and shake the world with them just a little bit and we'll go as the prophet saying like at pentecost what did he do it taken them 10 days to get all emptied up but they was all standing there with their vessels turned up and god took himself and filled them up that's all they shook the world pour themselves into them the same holy spirit that sealed the lutherans that sanctified the methodists that baptized the pentecostals is now setting an order the coming of the lord jesus and the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the world in oneness here we are in the end time coming from the east the west north south what are we doing getting ready for that rapture getting ready holding ourselves steady for a few minutes till every fiber is filled with the holy ghost is that your prayer this morning that every fiber is filled with the holy ghost is that your expectation that every fiber is filled with the holy ghost it's all over you it's all in you it's all around you it's you are so emptied up that he could fill every part of you with his present with his love with his glory that's my expedition that's my prayer that's my desire is it your desire this morning can the church say amen glory hallelujah hallelujah in the midst of the paradox just to bring this home my word shall not return void he said in every age there had been some of it left off so he's saying the reformer didn't have time to take care of it in the days of luther he only preached justification by faith and he was gone they made a church after that come wesley he preached in the vacation there it was and along come the pentecostals but we are promised according to revelation 10 according to malachi 4 and saying luke 22 17 and so forth that there's got to come an ephesians to this there's promising friends there must come in ephesians that these sevenfold mysteries of the word of god must be unfolded and it's in the layout of cnn age that this takes place and i believe that we are here we are here at another ephesians we are here at another dispensation we are here at another time when the closing and the finishing of everything is at hand what's going on the world the political arena wars rumors of wars earthquakes technology all these things economic powers all the beast powers the system are in place and the bride is getting ready not the church now not the church the bride is getting ready because the church has tribulation coming but the bride is desperately getting ready because the world is getting into military preparation economic preparation and only the bride is getting ready to leave here because we are promised that the bride is rapture the rest of the church is remnant tribulation [Music] what group do you belong to this morning are you making preparation because the bible said his wife had meet us already so odie why is making ready you know church mama's going to church but wife getting ready wife is asking what do i need to do to get ready what what i need what else do i need what else do i need to get ready am i ready am i sure i'm ready do i have everything to go all right do i is is everything ready to go is that your attitude do you have leaving on your mind you have a leaving on your mind because we're never leaving on your mind it puts things into perspective without leaving on your mind it puts your job into perspective when you have leaving on your mind it puts your family into perspective we're not leaving on your mind it makes you operate a certain way because you don't know what day the flight will call when the raptor express will so you have to have the ticket in your pocket you can't forget the ticket home because you don't know where they're going to get called you have to have it all the time the token must be displayed you got to have it so that when the call comes you can say i'm ready not after government get to go home and pray we know the parable of the virgins 10 virgins 10 in the message 10 come at the church 10 here in the preaching but 5 wives and five foolish. are they bragging coming back are coming back and while the bridegroom was not there some slumbered some slept and the five wise they made sure that they were ready lambs ready trim none ready ready they're not taking chances they heard too much preaching to take a chance [Music] then the cry went up behold the bridegroom coming going out to meet him the fighters were wise they were ready one time i'm ready they're foolish they know they're supposed to get ready and then they say well here's what we don't have enough light we don't have enough oil we don't know we don't have enough what it takes to make it out to meet the bridegroom can we get some and the why is saying listen if we give you from our oil it will not be enough for you and for us go to them that sell and buy but when it was too late it was too late it was too late friends time to get ready it's time to get ready it's time to get ready are you ready it's time to get ready because his word cannot fail he doesn't change his strategy he will not get you ready you have to get yourself ready his wife has made herself ready the word is there the instructions here the plan for the dress the plan for how to operate how to live how to act his nature is being his action which is all in the world how he's supposed to operate [Music] in the days of esther when esther they were being when they had been chosen and they had been being prepared to go to the king they had all the eunuchs and they preparing them to go and meet the king the eunuchs had no seed the eunuchs were just there to prepare them because they knew what the king's desire was so their message and their ministry was just to get to get the potentials ready for the king to choose and you read it they could have taken whatever adornments they want and esther didn't choose none of the jewelry none of the makeup none of the fancy she said whatever the king will wonder whatever you recommend but i'm not wearing this other stuff and when the king saw her that's what he chose it wasn't coming from the king and you need to wonder already this this car work no you have to be ready when you come to church you're coming to church you'll come ready to worship ready to receive the word ready for the word to have an effect in your life willing your heart open your hearts not close you're not coming with your own bias your own expectation your own way of how it's supposed to be no you come to hear the word and for the world to have an effect on your life so you can be a better christian a better son a better daughter so you can be more prepared every week you are supposed to be more ready so today you're supposed to be more ready than last week and next week more ready than this week but you can't go backwards may you today lock your position and not go backwards this is not the time to backslide not the time to give up because his word cannot return void and his word is hanging over families his word is hanging over churches his mother already said go through the city and put the mark upon those that sigh and cry for the abomination in the city that world has already gone forth and it was that beginning at my sanctuary at the ancient man that word has already gone out and his word cannot return for it but to them not sigh and cry for them not seek his face his word is also true to them he will visit them for them that are looking for the holy ghost he will visit them for them that are hungering and tasting after righteousness he will visit them because for as many as a hunger and testing of the righteousness they shall be filled that word cannot return void it must accomplish the purpose hallelujah hallelujah the musician can get ready i'm almost done hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord adam had lost a book it was a book of authority it was a book of power it was a book of names adam was supposed to open the book and speak from the book and when he called names they ought to be created but adam lost it when he fell and satan tried to grab it but his book was slipped through his hands only certain hands could handle the book only certain eyes could see the book so the book went back into the hands of the original owner and we needed a redeemer to come and be a kinsman redeemer to fully open back access to this book so john had wept when he was caught up in that dimension because there was nobody worthy to loose the seals and to open this book no wonder john shouted when they said behold the land of the tribal judah and the lamb started to come out and all the whole thing unfolded because john knew without redemption there was no possibility for him and all of this that god did that manifest through his prophets was to bring the word for us that we could have comfort in this day that we could make it right but ibrahim said in israel and the church i believe there's a church on his road tonight a power of the living god that men
