Proverbs law and verse 23 reads on these wise keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life and Proverbs 18 21 death and life are in the power of the tongue and there's a lot of it shall eat the food thereof amen ities with a prayer our heavenly father we thank you for your blessings and your grace Upon Our Lives and we thank you for life we thank you for Grace to be still here in the land of the living so means you are not done with us yet Lord you still have some purpose that our lives are true and need to fulfill a lot in your plan in your grand plan and for your kingdom and that's why we come here this morning Lord seeking to do your will to do all that you want us to do so it might be all that you want us to be answer for that pillow that you will help me this morning I'm the most needed person here this morning Lord I pray your holy spirit will help me Lord and just block my mind out and let the mind of Jesus Christ over seven Church ages his Spirit his person his theophany Minister your grace to your people yourself Lord let me you take the words of life and bring them to each one of us as we have need because our needs are so different but Lord you know the needs that being every heart in life and I pray Lord you will Minister Your Grace abundantly unto each one of us today bless the friends and Bishop against the Lord and I pray your holy spirit will be with us and at the end of The Savage we'll have every course and every reason to praise and glorify your holy and much less and blessed name we thank you father in Jesus Christ name amen and God bless you remember so anyway um so this morning I'll turn on the village along because it's quite late already and I pray for me I am tired I am tired so but I'll try to um I'll try to to not act tired so so you don't attire too so brother said you see a church the pastor makes his head this way the old church makes the head this way so so I'm even sorry I said I'm tired but so don't act tired so act the opposite so you know you're sure like he's not the pastor's spirit that controls you but the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so anyway this morning I want to not finish but go on with a thought in the series of um our series on the success of failure and um I know sometimes it might be tough for you to put it all together from where we're coming from but outrun do that for you but even if you take the messages as silos on their own I think you will still find some benefit in them but last Sunday I'm speaking to you about you know the the how the Bible says where um we're faithfully and wonderfully made and trying to show you um I'm not sure you spoke about how the way we are we're like a human computer like the the computer is very very um well known by everybody these days and even your phone in your hand is a is a power Powerhouse of a computer in your hand so and the thing with every computer has like a hard drive which is where you keep all the things and you keep them there like you know memories on the hard drive and when you need them you bring them out you you type in whatever and you bring them out so you program your computer to do those things you the program you see like what program is running your computer and so because we're human beings a human computer too we also have programs that run us and the programs that Runners have been put there by God in the beginning at the original in Eden I mean at the creation of man God programmed us in a way that we will have a phenomenal hugely successful life like Adam did before he fell by sin Eden So Adam was a Powerhouse of a computer and you saw what he did you saw how he lived you saw the impact that he had on this Earth here as a matter of fact this world has different governments they're trying to do an election soon people are voting and you know different governments you can imagine one man who had control over the whole earth over the whole over the whole earth I mean many can even hardly run their homes run their lives let them run their homes but this was the man running the wall so you can imagine the power and the glory that was and um so the same God that made him that that's the same God that made us and the way he created him very same way he created us and so at the original in the beginning Adam was a Powerhouse and God programmed him and that program ran him that program lived out of him and like the Bible says Genesis 2 7 Man became a living Soul Man was programmed and run by the program in his soul and that's what he was able to live by but then you know the story when Adam fell by sin another program came in because the program that God put in there was like disconnected and switched over to another program a negative programming from the Devil his nature his spirit and that's how you have the programming of the two Natures in us and science proves these things science proves this thing science even tells you at any particular point in time your face is right or wrong and it's the HD are programming that has uh the the the that that is stronger in the moment that's what you you you actually carry out and that's what brother that's what the Bible says two dogs in US the white dog black dog the dog that you feed the most is the one that wins amen two Natures in us the nature of Good and Evil two Natures in US God's nature and human nature human nature we just give it like a a good covering it's the devil's nature in every human being and you remember God's nature is part by the spirit of love and the devil's nature is powered by the spirit of fear you remember that all right so so I think we are doing uh pretty good so so last Sunday went further to say that everything that happens in my life and in your life just when we establish how we um let me keep it up on my channel here so um yeah I'm standing so late already so um okay so everything that happens in our lives everything even into the womb proof they can do uh uh um what they call you like um hypnotize you to where you will is is that why he touches them what do I say even therapy even though that's an advanced word I want the one that everybody can understand but is is that's what he's saying hypnotherapy he said hypnotherapy all right so but there's a more common word hypnotism he notices him that they can take you into your mother's womb and you you'll see you talk how you crawl I mean you you are you are like is it is it crawl are you were carved in your mother's womb you see all that they take you right in there because you record it somewhere he's got it somewhere so um um I'm so when we come in the world that recording goes on still and like we said last night that's how God can judge because the books were open what were those books the books were open billions and billions and billions of books are open so you and I are a living human computer recording everything every day I won't get you today but I'll show you why because is that recordings that recording is recorded as the issues in your life and just like ever and they they they they they are they they go in there and most of it programs you the way you live your life that's why many times you were doing things it's not the immediate surroundings that's in controlling what you do no it's not it is not at all this is science these signs [Music] is like your computer only brings out what is programmed on the inside of it nothing else no matter how much you wish it's you must be programmed in the computer you must change the programming to bring out what you want if it's not giving you what you want same way same way our programming on the inside is what comes out that's why it says God your heart because these issues is what controls your life so you might find yourself doing things and Paul said it all wretched man that I am who shall send me from this evil what I would I would not we won't admit it like Paul did but that's the story of Our Lives what we want to do we just don't find the pottery something else is overpowering us a programming on the inside amen so something else has to change that programming on the inside your computer if it has a virus on the inside of it because what the devil put there is the virus that totally changed the programming if your community has a virus no matter how much you wish the virus to go out it will not go out you have got to go in there get an antivirus to to flush out the virus so your computer can start working again properly when you want to bring out your file it brings out it doesn't bring out something else when you want to be something else out but that's what we are that's what the programming the devil put in their sin program doesn't wrongly and we bring out what we don't want to bring out what I would I would not but that thing that I don't want to do Paul said that's what I find myself doing how many times you want to answer very softly you find yourself reaction [Music] and you speak to yourself like how did I do that but the same devil says that don't apologize okay if you apologize do you think you are weak they think they are right and you are wrong it happens I mean can you can can can you relate foreign [Music] I'm just going to take you back to you where we started from because um so lastly we've shown you that most of the things that the memories that are saved in US they're shipped as memories I mean the things that have noticed I see those memories and that's why God's going to be with the judge and I said 10 of those things are saved in our conscious memory which relates to your human mind your brain which is spread by your human spirit 10 of that what you ate yesterday what you had the day before your birthday your schoolmate whatever and things like that and we can call up that memory at will we can call off at will that's conscious memory that's only ten percent that's the like I said that's the tip of the eyes back tip of the eyes back but beneath the iceberg me in the tip you know that's where the most of the iceberg is you know that don't you all right so beneath that tip of the iceberg is the 90 percent of the things that have happened in our lives and that is hidden away in our hearts not an atomical heart but a spiritual heart which is where I received Jesus into my heart it's not your anatomical heart it's your spiritual heart I love you with all my heart it's not your anatomical heart it's your spiritual heart and that's where those memories are kept away from where you can bring them up or or whatever and that memory is totally connected with what the doctors I mean the scientists call your sympathetic nervous system for example when you eat you're not conscious of what's going on elsewhere you know your body is removed even when you sleep your body is walking it's outside of your control that's connected to the person on the inside who is controlling everything on the inside of you so this outside is just a shell just a shell the real person is on the inside talk The Way Way deep on the inside that's who the Bible says God your heart with all diligence for out of it come the issues of Life those issues are these memories none of them have been grounding to you and they control your life country your life why do you think brother Branham would always get on the prayer line and we'll talk with people and said I'm trying to catch their spirit why do you think Jesus Took the man of the well and but the Vietnam told us that he was only trying to catch her spirit because in her spirit is where the record is rebound will say like that woman will never know before and he said I'm trying to catch your spirit he's trying to read her life because that's where it's recorded that's why I recorded and said oh I can see you you just had an operation I see the doctor a short man another because he's recorded spirit is the soul the soul of man that's when you recorded [Music] those are some of the books that's going to be opened you know the record of your life is going to be open amen that's why the Book of Life The Book of Life there's a record of every problem tell us that there's a record of every action that you take on doing the face of the Earth here did you tell us that come on give me a witness prayer said every action you take ever every recorded did he tell us that every single action every single thought every he said every action not every action when you're awake every action right from your mother's womb is recorded there's a record of it and every man is judged out of that record that's the Book of Life but there is another book which is called the book of his life that's the lamps Book of Life the book of the Lamb's life in there and when you receive the Lord Jesus Christ and he baptize your soul with fire he transfers your record from The Book of Life into his book of his own life the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah and when you and that's when you will not come to the judgment but you apart from Death unto life because the Book of Life spreads death but the book of his life spreads eternal life and glory and Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah you may be seated praise the Lord amen and that's why he challenges you like if you if you say you have a gift of you're a dreamer because many of the messages are running around these days to all these you know signs wonders and all them things like that and because they're looking for something else they just run from church to church you're either here or you're there if you're here stay here but if this is not satisfying to you if I was you I would go to where I will find satisfaction but this is the land of the Prophet a prophet has been in the land and he taught us how to live he just had to leave l-i-v-e it turned out to be in the church you can't be in the church today and tomorrow you are back back and forth I know you cannot be [Music] because brother banham taught us how to live this life and this his message is an invitation to leave the life of Jesus Christ it's as simple as that [Music] she has a seven Thunder believing Church and believes that the seven Thunders are the seven voices of the seven Church ages as a manifestation of God God manifesting his Spirit through seven Church ages is not just the Seven Virtues it's the man is the mystery of the Seven Virtues the mystery of Faith how Paul will go all the way back down to Genesis right back into the man of God and bring out all the Mysteries that's the mystery of faith and the Mystery of virtue and all the way down that's what this church believes [Applause] [Applause] and added to that he taught us when you are called out from the world and find yourself a church that's what I'm saying find yourself a Bible believing Church find yourself some church where you trust the pastor the mission that church that they can feed your souls and Lead You Back to Jesus Christ because the angel at the pulpit his job is only to lead to the angel of the Lord that's all his job is out so the man has no business preaching himself preaching his views he has to preach what the angel of the Lord wants because that's the only thing that will lead you back to the angel of the Lord can you say Amen Hallelujah telling you all about my greatness tell you a lot about me and all that who do nothing is this world revealed by the prophet of Malachi 4 that will drive you back to the angel of the Lord hallelujah how we thank God for that great Elijah prophet of Malachi 4. Glory that great Elijah Prophet oh Hallelujah Amen in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be finished Hallelujah the mystery of God who God Is His Pain his nature how he lives how he moves how he behaves himself we learn these things on our Prophet God Elijah Prophet it's no secret will follow him is no secret will follow him Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] amen you maybe see that you maybe see that [Applause] [Music] and that Professor is when you come in the world when you come in the message it's not church church Visions as usual Church to go learn how to you know do whatever dress do your business or whatever church is much more than that there's much more it's not even about how to be of good behavior it's much more than that you come in the church the only reason why you are in this church or any church at all is you come to be trained if you don't understand anything about the message understand that your comfort training and it's not just been trained what is the content of that training what's the purpose of that training when you're going to medical school or law school there's a purpose in that training the purpose is to get to become a doctor the purpose that change you become a lawyer engineer or whatever it is what's the purpose of his training in the house of God what's the purpose of this training in the message of the hour what's the purpose that you might be like Jesus Christ his very own Spirit the Holy Spirit itself vibrating through your mortal body and adopted bread of Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah that's the goal that's the purpose that's what we're headed for don't you ever forget that don't you forget that the seven fondness amen that's what they are and that's what this church stands for [Music] [Applause] me because if you don't understand that you'll come in and you are just doing Church just playing church just trying to be nice trying to be nicer than the other person that's just gonna be nice tell them to see I'm nice those are nature given virtues I showed you that already in every man the word of God is written no God created Man In His Image every man his image what's the image of God love joy peace what's the image of God faith virtue in all the temperance what's the image of God but the devil came and provided that and that's why he said feel your love that we have is a profession oh my God you maybe see that so anyway temperature not just to know how to be nice and be good and all that the people who you just push your niceness forward I'm nice that's not the purpose here our NASA is like filthy reacts feel the reacts we come here to be like Jesus Christ nothing being nice we want to have his Spirit his life amen flesh of his flesh born of his bones that's our purpose that's our goal that's the brightest Earthly goal it comes from the inside of us and we will not stop until we get there and we are gonna get there because the bread is predestinated to get there she will get there whether you and I get there that's our problem not God's because God has a bride predestinated and she is going to get there Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] so I said that's that's so I said that's why I said when you have a dream if I have a dream I say oh you say oh you're interpreting my dream some dreams are very clear just know what God is telling you but when you need to interpret the dream for me you have got to see that dream first why because it's it's written somewhere in my subconscious so that means you you God's got gift in you has got to be able to let you see contact my spirit where they dream is at it's not just find the air no God God has records record of life he has the Bible says the books were open and there's a book on the inside of your recording every action and so if you want to see it you go and read the book and see that oh yeah yeah even Pharaoh's dreams he forgot the dreams and what's his name Joseph um put them with their dad let me see what that Dad is that Mom there okay okay sorry I'm sorry I didn't know that I apologize so pharaoh even forgot his dream and Joseph went and saw the dream where is she from same way like Malachi 4 will contact the spirit and she's like oh I can see you like when you were five years old you are a servant in the Roman Catholic church and you stole something in the church and that's what is affecting you right now where do you see from from the record so to to be a truly dreadly interpret dreams he taught us if you are in some Pentecostal church that's different but if you're in this land of the prophet he said the way you interpret dreams that you go to see the dream again and even elements of the dream that I forget you will see it and you say this day and say that's when I know it's a gift from God that's why I know it's a gift from God can you say Amen oh really God Amen this is the land of Malachi for the prophet of course if you don't believe it I have no problems with you if what you have satisfied you no problem but this is the land of the Prophet so you can't mix this and match you can't mix this with someone else it's not gonna work make up your mind if I'll make up your mind but I'm inviting to come with us come with us we will do you good not God we will do you good for the Lord has spoken good considering this gospel this this Gospel of Malachi first message [Music] amen you may be seated so you have powerful working computer you're powerful you are powerful everything loaded the program is loaded not today but I'll show you how you'll bring out those issues and what they do to your life but we'll we'll maybe study today all of your life is controlled by the issues of your life it's not nobody no nobody is controlling you or nobody is you're my issue it's not true if you say it's true the Bible says not true and I choose to believe the Bible I don't agree with your experience the devil came and told if this is that if didn't argue with her what she should have done would have been to just give him what God Said I cannot get your experience I Saw Mommy water is your experience I cannot argue with it but I don't believe it I don't see it in the Bible even though I really sorry my intervention you were having hallucinations and then you saw something that isn't real but I really saw it I don't doubt you or whatever [Music] I was almost saying something I don't want you know anybody thinking I'm picking on them so I don't uh no no I won't say it no I won't say it I won't say [Music] so anyway we have these issues the memories loaded on the inside of us and some you can pick up because then your brain many of them you can't pick up but when things happen like I said before when you I speak harshly to you and you respond to me immediately then you are responding to what I just told you but science says if I speak Ashley to you or do anything at all to you or anything at all that you see here whatever every word whatever everything whatever if you don't respond within one second it's not that immediate circumstance that that that that that's causing your reaction your reaction is from a deeper place on the internet from the issues of life on the inside of you did you hear that let me let me say let me say it again let me say it again let me say it again you see you really hurt me I said when said last year or even yesterday and because of that I did this no it's not it's not science is if you don't react to the stimulus within one second it's not the immediate environment that is responding for your actions it's not science is that it's something else deeper on the inside of you that's going for your actions because what happens when things happen to you your mind goes searching are getting a bit in some detail later but I just wanted to drop that as I go on go searching for a similar event most especially when you first came across that particular event or a similar event and the way you acted at that time programmed in you already as an issue of your life is what it reacts and you swear forgive the word that it's what I did or somebody that is making you react known it's the issue that's reacting that's why it said don't react choose your response how many years of our children are in this church here choose your response because when you choose your response you are overriding what the issue is trying to tell you that that instinctive thing the issue is trying to do you are deciding in your conscious mind this is how I'm going to handle this not the issue controlling how your life is I say guard your heart from all with all diligence for how to become all the issues of life so last Sunday we brought it down to where in every man's head there is faith and there's doubt everyone said he said one sense in the soul but I told you I read your quotes that actually two but only one as they say so over you at any particular point in time faith and doubt two dogs white dog black dog and the one that has the sex so the upper hand is the one that acts you can't do both at the same time and like I showed you before Love Is On One extreme fear is on the Other Extreme and the one that they cannot coexist together you don't coexist together is one or the other is it 51 over 49 is it 51 percent that will control you for that particular moment that's why people do things wrong a man living in adultery a woman a boy a girl in fornication and all these wrong things every wrong thing that we do as a parent you know as a husband being mean to your wife why didn't do this your husband as a as a son being mean to your your dad mom to your brother on the job your support is on the job I say whatever it is however it is that you whatever it is that you do that's wrong is all controlled by issues that come from our hearts Faith or doubt a man coming in adultery in that moment in time let the man be the worst man on the face of that he knows that I should not be doing this I should not be doing this I'm running ahead of myself but maybe let me let me just say because I mean I may not get to it I should not be doing this I should not be doing this but then you go into what we call in terms of rationalize going to rationalize because everything that we do everything we always do what we believe when that man does that and like the I said this in church years ago when man does that is and he says like he has to talk to his wife and confess his sin and whatever and things like that I mean I use the same example exactly years ago 2015 2016 thereabouts because I've said some of these things even at that time and he has to say like that is future but um I didn't mean to do it I'm sorry I'm sorry I will never happen again but all sounds so good but you know what it's not true like nothing to do it it's not true it's not true because of our programming we always do what we want to do we call our programming we always do what we believe there's no action we take that doesn't have an internal goal none known I wake up in the morning I go to take my bath what's the purpose what's the goals that I'm I I'm I'm aiming at I want to start my day that's the goal I want to come to church on Sunday morning that's what took me out of bed and made me go to the bathroom and change my clothes and head to church there's no action we take doesn't have an internal goal behind it and behind every internal goal there's a belief what you call Faith or belief that drives the internet goes on the inside of you that drives your life so there's nothing you do but what you believe we always live out and act out what we believe nothing in the universe in creation can make us do what we didn't want to do unless we just are possessed of an evil spirit we own it we did it even though we say like Paul oh Richard man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of Jesus boy it took it took our ownership he said what I would I would not that which I don't want to do that's what I do he did it he did it himself and we do it ourselves nobody knows circumstance not that Mom boss nobody we did it that man come in adultery he did not eating I didn't mean to do no he meant to do it because whatever we do at any point in time is fired by a belief on the inside of us I'll I'll break it down for you I'll bring them for that I say I'm getting ahead of myself [Music] it's always felt but I believe on the inside a belief that says this thing is good for me at the moment if I lose my temper because I know even though somebody said that I don't lose your temper but they lose your temper takes the upper hand because I believe it's good for me as a woman it's good for me to let my mind be known let me let my mind be let me say what I feel even though something said no no don't do that because I believe it's good for me for the moment so we always live by what we believe that's why your belief is Major what you believe is Major that's why faith is Major how it was not really scripture maybe every next Sunday by the grace of God he said we live we walk by faith we walk by faith every man walks by faith every man walks by faith you are thinking the faith of the word of God no Every Man Has faith belief the unbeliever goes to work the unbeliever creates things the unbeliever invents things it's fired by a belief on the inside of them we call it Faith they call it belief but it's more than the same thing we live and walk by faith not by sight and that's why because mankind lives by these principles of the Bible That's why God's going to judge them because they can live by those principles and apply to the word of God and the relationship with God With God almighty but sometimes the way we present the gospel it's almost like it's only it's only meant for inside the church you know the gospel the Bible is meant for a man to live on the face of Israel live on faith he walks within the church he walks outside the church he works in the home he works in a Marketplace he walks in the laundry he walks in the he walks everywhere works everywhere when you get that understanding your shoulders will go back you won't feel inferior because you are a Christian you have access to what is greater than Harvard School of Management or business you have access to the mind of almighty God guiding you how to live your life and control your life on the face of Israel here amen amen can you say amen I know you don't believe it but for the two percent my two percent is who I'm talking to amen come on my two percent come on two percent that's who I'm talking to foreign amen Glory Hallelujah amen [Music] so we brought it down to Faith and doubt in every man said every man lives by his belief oh The Atheist goes to work in the morning tell his wife I'll see you at night what's that belief he just believes he'll be back home at night when you go to bed at night every man goes to bed at night usually I'll see you tomorrow morning what is that belief that's how he lives if that man lies against us am I going to wake up he will die before morning let him do that repeatedly every night before you know like that they just seem dead in his bed but you don't even think of it because that belief and faith and Faith Can you say Amen are you experiencing everybody experiences amen [Music] because the same devil talks to you talks to them same devil talk to you if thou be the son of God John the Baptist that says Behold the Lamb of God that takes the distance of the world he came and said and thou he that should come and we'll do it for another we all get attacked by it faith and doubt faith and doubt but when God created marriage there was no doubt in the picture and you know how doubt came in the Garden of Eden at the fall that's why we're getting this child to the age of accountability getting that child to the place and see how God so prepared him but what happened to him what happened to him Glory amen so [Music] human Communists that we are we live from a place of depth on the inside of us from our programming amen and this programming is what I call according to what the Bible says the issues of life in our hearts guard your hearts with all diligence for how to come the issues of life when you have all that anger that hatred that malice and all that stuff no it affects you I know you know that I know you know that you might even be harboring complexes from your father your grandfather your great grandfather it's not genetics there's genetics there how tall you are how short you are whatever but people are overweighted my family were always overweight it could be but it's the issues that's been passed on then and I'll show you that also the issues the influence you leave around and people are so proud of their their Heritage and their upbringing no you should be part of Christ don't be so attached to yeah my family there is no family you come from a great family I must have been the same family as you because I come from one to you boy is that what we should gloat about no no feel good about that and don't care about the family of God [Music] Ahab told Elijah [Music] look at him he's the one that troubled Israel trouble in Israel no rain for three years and six months Elijah said you and your father's house this habit has been passed down you have it your father's house your lineage has it remember the story about the young man who want to get married and I think the girl had some hot temper and brother Branham said no they shouldn't get married until she gets the Holy Ghost so the Holyfield can go and deal with these issues in her heart or shall I might not be a stress because he said is like that the anger thing that she has is coming from her High lineage let me find that quote coming from my lineage how that's not genetics no that's not genetics so God God passed on down to you and you are helpless about it pass on that you Anger from your mother and your grandfather and all that stuff no it's not it's the issues of your life your own life not from your grandfather your grandmother but your lineage passes on down I'll show you how that happens too we should be able to figure that out already amen amen can you say Amen all right [Music] so the programming excuse me can I open my jacket please okay yeah I have some bosses here they always tell me what to do [Music] because they have some boys they don't want to be my boss so so I got a new boss today I can't even say yes sir thank you thank you boss thank you all right all right so [Music] to really and completely fully appreciate how these issues get formed how we have received because the issues are positive and negative just positive negative we need to go back to the beginning which we've done before but just to refresh your mind again and where we receive a love positive issues programming and well received Affair negative issues programming we'll go back to begin in Eden but up front let me tell you that uh in each of the cases in each of the cases words have a lot to do with the programming [Music] thank you honey all right [Music] oh where was I I'll go where I watch watch so so so I want you to be very careful to follow our thinking okay for that thinking because life is very very simple I'm not saying it's easy but it's very simple and I always say we complicate and over complicate the simple because the more complicated it is the more we feel module [Music] he wants to make your pregnancy more complex than it is so you can get more money yeah yeah and that's just who we are we complicate simple things life is very simple your God made it so in very very simple say my yoke is easy I'm born is light easy should be easier than the other the other the other side so words words have a lot to do with it wasn't a lot to do with it now in Genesis 1 22 28 [Music] if I forget to read the quote remind me because you remind me okay I don't want to miss my thoughts so let me just keep it for now [Music] all right um oh yeah in Genesis 1 26 28 I explained you before when goes to engage 26 126 let us make man in our EMH after our likeness and let them have dominion and let them them have dominion over everything on the face of the Earth he went to Dominion in other words that's the image of God the capability of the image of God in every man to live a life in Dominion that's Genesis 1 26. that's the potential in you and I to live a life in Dominion and whatever it is you're doing you don't have a desire to be in Dominion of it you are living beneath your god-given DNA if you are a husband you want to be not dominate your wife being dominant over yourself being Dominion you should be the greatest husband possible if you are what be the greatest wife possible your husband will speak of you like Proverbs 31 if you're a son daughter greatness will be your DNA because that's our DNA greatness Dominion greatness that's our DNA thus is potential we have but potential is nothing potential Talent I'll tell you again is overrated totally absolutely completely overrated so I have potential and you do nothing more because God has predestinated you it doesn't work that way it doesn't work that way because you could easily so easily believe that that amperage needed and then do nothing like someone you know says sometimes like that so like your children are going to be there your children everybody's going to be there and all that and then these children feel like that I'm going to be there anyway no it doesn't work that way no it doesn't work that way God has no grandchildren no it doesn't work that way if you are truly presented God talks at your heart too and today when you hear his voice Harden not your heart as in the provocation because God can get provoked [Music] let's let's go on [Music] so potential we have it you have it I have it potential for greatness I believe as I'm standing I believe that every man every one of you every man on this face of this Earth here is programmed in their being to become phenomenal great I believe that I believe that my whole heart but the problem is smaller than young people some of the older people some boys some girls some men some women think about this greatness here I'll make some money and you don't care about the things of God you can be meet your car in that and be great in that no you can't have faith and death at the same time it's going to be one it's gonna be one because we're talking about the potential God put in man there was no flesh there just put in the soul of man he stopped conscious being in his inner being in his spirit in his being on the inside of him what God knows is going to fire that man out later in life when the flesh comes on God put potential there to be in Domination if you're a business person that should be your goal [Music] if you are a student that should be your goal if you are a worker that should be your goal if you're an employee that should be your goals you dominate in the workplace so that your boss is going to say wow people complain about things let me let me know I'm not gonna do that let me not go into that because I don't want to misunderstand me um very carefully so you don't misunderstand me at all so um all right [Music] then generation 137 so God created mind is the image after it's likeness and then verse 28 God now spoke to the creation that creation was the soul of man the real person that you are that came from God and is going back to God again God now spoke to that soul and watch watch and the words he spoke were directed toward the Dominion towards the potential this is how God is putting the things the programming into the man programming into the man and from that programming he will live out this life of greatness and in this program that you will see that God began to break it down [Music] be fruitful what does fruitful God to do with Dominion listen multiply be fruitful do you go into your day and just feel like that my DNA is to have a fruitful day some wake up in the morning the boss says something hey come on their day is spoiled that day is messed up and you're a child of God you claim the message of the hour or you claim Christian in any ship from a manner and you you you are comfortable not having a fruitful day one day two days three days four days five days you wake up in the morning you spend all your time on Facebook not doing profitable stuff just doing gossip just following this is celebrating one after the other and your time is going every every every hour you spend now is your investment into the future however you spend an investment into the future you're on Facebook you're on Facebook you're spending time on Facebook talking about these ones yeah you spent before you know two three hours is gone thank you God is going to require how you spend your time no he's going to require he's going to require of each one of us because we are commanded to redeem the time time is Lost in Time needs Redemption what are you doing with your time are you focused on having a fruitful day or multiply God spoke to this man be fruitful be a fruit and because you're fruitful you know there's a seat somewhere he didn't provide the seed in God's case here for every provides the seed of God in them for their spiritual Endeavors but he's talking about the total man he didn't provide the seed but you and I know the words the spoken word is the origin and that's the seed that God put in the man be fruitful and the man took the fruit took the words planted in the sin in his heart and from there from fruit to be fruitful to multiply every day are you a multiplier do you go around multiplying joy and peace and goodness Allah is that what you do all foreign or a diminisher true true when you meet people do you multiply what they have you multiply their Joy or you multiply their sorrow what do you do what do you do [Music] you want to make sure that you are never The Source or the cause of me I'm talking to myself also I'm looking at myself when I'm pitching I'm talking to myself okay I want to be safe I don't want a picture of us and be a casual I'm talking to myself um go to bed every night knowing that I have multiplied Joy today for my husband for my wife for my children for my friends even for those who don't like me have I multiplied Joy today have I modified peace today have I multiplied goodness and patience today have I multiplied that today have I replenished it that's how you live in Dominion he broke it down for Adam and thus have that potential to be like God comes out to be like God comes out from what what now what are what what are everything you know you know this human computer that we have here your regular computer you input easily with your keyboard right your keyboard in this case here you even put things in and then you see what you put on the screen right in this case that this human computer that you have here the screen is you and I our Behavior that's what the program sends out but what inputs the words is your fingers the human community that we have what impeached the words what you hear what you see Baba said this the eye is the gateway to the soul what you taste what you feel all of those things when you receive them they come into you and everything gets niched and narrow down into thoughts thoughts images in your heart thoughts [Music] the water God but Mom said on the series explained to you as a thought in other words everyone is not just every word spends to you as a thought the what you read the what you hear the what you taste the words you feel bring to you as a thought and those thoughts go into the sockets of your soul and from there the ones you focus on and think over and over and over and over by meditation become the issues in your heart they become the things they are Rule and control you every thought comes and they go but the ones you focus on the first you take the pornography you will see all the time all the time all the time all the time all the time becomes issues in your heart [Music] angry angry and you spend time talking about it becomes the issue in your heart you have anger issues in your heart from what what anybody you know what what that you read what that you hear what that you smell what's that you feel was that you taste words words words the external steam wash your Champion the ex-nus stimulus that you receive and you receive them they come down into you as thoughts because that's how God programmed it thoughts coming to you and they go into your soul and the more you with the intensity intensity those words become those thoughts become issues in your heart and they're there issues are like genes that's what science is there like they're like genes and that's why they can be passed on they're not genes they're genes but they can be passed on are you following me [Music] you have anger issues it's because you spend the time to think and think convert the anger thoughts into thinking thing and become become each they come congealed as an issue in your heart so when somebody does something that makes you angry no it's not them you have the anger issue on the inside [Music] are you following me lost issues oh I got lost no it doesn't work like that God can come down deliver but how did we get there because my dad and mom they had lost and that's how I have lost no no not that alone you did this too much time on wrong sides Netflix and all those things [Music] grind and grind and grind under the sheet under the cover you're not holding anybody you're hurting yourself becomes an issue the negative issue all sorts of issues positive negative same as what the Bible says let the word of God dwelling you richly in all wisdom that's why Jesus said out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks the abundance that's the issue the issue because your palate your part of feeling the barrel feeling the barrier feeling the body feeling the barrel when it's full that it would IT issues out the issue is out oh brother brother oh brother me so God spoke to Adam be fruitful multiply replenish dominate because that's the goal domination is greatness greatness greatness you know in the Bible Jesus the son of God the angel said it shall be great it shall be great instead of John the Baptist in the same chapter John chapter 1 and chapter 2 said the child shall be great because Genesis 1 26 Dominion greatness and Genesis 1 28 shows you how to actualize that potential and make it Comfort we are a bundle of potential don't you don't you ever let anybody tell you don't have potential don't you ever let anybody tell don't have that to be a Christian to be the greatest there is you have that potential to be the best there is on your job you have that potential that's what the Bible tells me well that's what I experience I don't believe you experience I believe what the Bible says and begin to doubt your own expression if it doesn't line up with the word of God oh Hallelujah Glory amen hallelujah amen all right so watch what what was the purpose of the world what come to you and become thoughts and from the thought you find thinking as a man thoughts in his thoughts in his heart so is he no no as a man thinketh in his head so is he is the thinking that turns the thoughts into issues thinking is something you are over and over and over something that dwelling you richly like in your heart is a burial and you are paying the barrel there if the barrel should be this way it gets full here and you just add the word and the pressure you don't you don't have it yet it's not going to until it gets to feel it can't issue out are you following me until it feels up it cannot issue out that's what Jesus said out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks that means out of the abundance we live when I was a child I speak as a child it's just our activity our action it's going to be full and then it comes out when it falls thinking that's how man is as a man thinking he said so easy you got to spend the time to do the thinking whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are honest what's happening a good report think on these things when you lie down there at night you are not able to sleep don't let your mind just wonder find something profitable to think about okay don't just lie down there and thinking like that I just can't sleep what is that just use the time use the time find something whatsoever things are lovely whatever things are pure worship of a good report think on these things you are filling up your barrels some more freeing up the paraffin of the barrel and in due course of time it will spill over and they said what a phenomenal person what a great human being [Applause] amen oh my words the words why what why what are you are you with me this was that you hear shape the issues of your life [Music] and I shall watch our things you hear you feel your human computer your input words into them by the things you hear the things you will see the things you feel the things you you allow in your life they converted into thoughts in your soul so why what positive issues from God came by words when he turned over to Genesis 3 it came by words had God said words death and life are in the power of the tongue amen so words that you hear what that you feel what that you are influenced by they shape your thoughts and the shape you're thinking and when they become your thinking many of us don't get results we won't spend enough time thinking I'm only for a year but I'll which you know I mean nothing new I'm saying but break down Joshua won to you he said thou shall meditate upon it day and night and then thou shall have good success because Knight fills up your Barrel fills the door fills it up and when it's filled up then you know you'll have it then because the month again is that so easy and you'll have good success in that thing and the same the same thing works for negative also that's right that's right oh so the ones you hear shape your thoughts they shape your thinking and your thinking shapes your belief your faith amen it comes from thoughts to thinking to believe what you what you hear whatever things are are good are righteous good report think on this thing because the shape your belief and your belief Powers how you live your life amen because we walk by faith we walk by our beliefs our beliefs is what powers us amen you won't come to church today if you don't believe there's some good you are going to get coming to church here today even if the good is not complete I did not come to church it's some good some good even if the goodies so that your Dad or Mom will not complain did not come to church eat some good eat some good [Music] so it's words because the words get converted to thoughts and thoughts the ones you focus on repeatedly become your thinking and your thinking shapes your belief your faith and faith is a power it's a Powerhouse because we always do what we believe amen like I said you'll never take an action unless you have an internal goal behind that action I told you already into our goal you get up for me you want to go to the restroom they go they want to go to the restroom you come to church the goal is I want to hear the word of God I want to have Fellowship because the Bible says so internet goal you wake up in the morning when you're not coming in to go to work because I've got to end my pay or my family will would stop internal goal internal internal goal thank you because we always do what we believe you'll never take any action unless there's an internal goal behind that action every action that we take is powered by our ability that's why I believe it's so major that's why the devil gets in there as God said to get her to believe what he wants and that's why faith is so major what you believe it matters that's what controls and make what you live by you think it doesn't matter whether you believe this other no it matters that's what gives you the lifestyle that you have what you believe you always live by what we believe now you say Amen now listening by what we believe [Music] because behind every action is an internal goal and behind every internet goal is a belief amen no matter what our beliefs are we always do what we believe a hundred percent of the time 100 of the time it's not because somebody made you do it no you believed even if you're doing it because it will get him off my back that's your belief that's what you believe you you did it you chose to do it because you had a belief at that point in time that was the best thing for you to do like I said by the man committing adultery he believed is the best information at that point in time he's having thoughts in his mind because many times should I should I know the man feels like that when it gets to when he has crossed the line he gets to where he can't control anymore they believe Russian language is coming together my wife hasn't been nice to me lately lately and then he does the ACT his belief drives everything you do you're swear just think just think about every action you take you take a belief is behind it that's driving it belief is Faith that's why faith is Major is important for you it's my way that you would live and stay in faith [Music] because Faith Powers is your power I tell you your faith is the power the devil knows that the devil knows he can control what you believe he has you he controls your life how you live the lifestyle everything he has you in his pockets I don't know all that stuff in the church I don't know whatever and you are making the guy and the devil is just saying like that random boy right on that he showed them Chicken Boy chicken show them I don't care what they're talking about there and the devil is riding really good because he's affecting your belief all these things there is not true it's false this good thing I don't bite and then it affects you because it gives you a life gives your lifestyle because we if you never had it for me today just hear this Allah we always live by what we believe because the Bible says we walk by faith [Music] and that's every man we walk by faith [Music] and that's what God in in training Adam was trained to walk by faith and train Adam in that Age of Innocence the world she was speaking to him was the faith words of Hope what's of Life words of encouragement words of living in a wall Beyond limits lots of possibilities and not impossibilities what what of greatness what of Glory Words of Power that's what God was put in Adam and this was became issues in Adam's house is thinking the issues of his life because as a man thinking he said so is he that's another word for saying the issues in your hand are your thinking and your thinking gives you your attitude and your attitude that's your character your behavior but the devil is trying to get God's trying to get to that thinking portion where your belief is anchored my ankle holds within the Veil that's what the devil is I mean God is eminent to get you to believe that's what the gospel is all about to get you to believe what you believe that's what life is all about what you mean that's what the the the social scene is all about you are just there just just bugger and Joshua all the buga and all that stuff you are doing that but the devil devoting the show what he wants is he wants to infect and affect your belief your way to having listen listen listen you are doing burger and in your soul is been entered some belief had God said God hasn't said and like what happened to Eve you start having doubt issues without issues doubt issues and then your faith is no more solid your face is diluted with some doubt [Music] and I'm done to everybody I'm talking to everybody because the attention to that person I'm talking to you I'm addressing your issues not that person's issues because your issues you curse them yourself not that person [Music] I'm talking to you and I'm talking to myself too can you say Amen can you say amen I can't hear you amen Glory let's try to close out here amen oh my to give Adam each issues of greatness in his soul God found no better way than words Faith cometh by hearing listen he didn't say faith coming behind the word of God so Faith coming by hearing comma hearing the word of God did you hear that no let me question you again Faith cometh by hearing stop it there whatever Faith whatever you hear gives you faith I don't believe this girlfriend if that is what you hear all the time before you know it like that you have that's become your belief I don't believe this God thing that's right if you fall like they like what all these new last chapter in the world just fill people like that we're not there's no man can we are humankind they're gender neutral and all that when you hear that openly enough threat comes by that your faith stops your belief your belief comes by that and that's why you become you believe what they're trying to do give another 10 15 years even though if not shoulder than that so all our children will just believe like that a man is a woman a woman is a man you are whatever you feel you are because the and those things don't need any resistance they say repeatedly repeatedly faith comes by hearing and that's what you hear that's what you read about that's what you see everywhere and all that so get your don't don't do no more like you let your children just watch any of those movies listen listen you got to filter those things some more we would and Nollywood all they are polluted don't tell me cartoons just open cartoons and they are saying they are saying like like um some man that the man that man to man and woman to woman they are Paul you are seeing that they are polluting your children they are controlling their belief [Applause] is mind control the Mind Control Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] Glory as for me and my house we will serve the Lord can I hear you shout it out Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah amen watch watching for my pictures before my movies in form of like things you feel and other words to infringe you and put issues in your heart and your soul issues amen and those issues become who you are as a man thinking he said so is he as a man has issues that's so easy amen you may be seated I'll try and find somebody who went on here oh brother so like I was saying the man in adults he said I didn't mean to do it didn't want me to do it I'm asking you I'm asking a question he didn't mean to do it is that true is that correct no he could never have done it he did not believe if they put a gun to your head so I did it because they were going to kill me no no you did it because you fell if I do it then they will not kill me no you are jumping a small thing there you did it if if not for the gun they put in my head I will never come in adultery I'll never steal no you did it because you took a decision that the best thing for me to do at this point in time is to [Music] do this adultery or whatever it is you're in control the gun is not in control you get away if they shoot me and kill me so be it but you don't say because of the gun is why I did it no it's not because of the gun you can see I did it because I was afraid of the gun but I did it I'm going to go they're gone you chose to do it he's the one that upset me and that's why I did that no it's not true no it's not it's not it's my wives my husband it is not true look how would God you and I we say we are going to control the Earth and then God puts the control of our everyday actions in the hands of some other person it doesn't even make sense don't even add up you are an absolute control absolute control of yourself Absolute Total Control amen [Music] I'm not talking to believers I'm not talking to believers all right all right so Genesis 1 26 28 is the love of God poured into man in the form of his seven spirits that's got DNA in man the potential and the words the the spirit to make the potential come alive so Adam can live a life of greatness a life of dominion a life of fruitful multiplier replenish subdue Dominion the what the spirit to fire the potential and make Adam's potential come to life so love is a belief system the belief system Amen in other words love is a way of life oh that's my way of life no it's because you have a belief that's empowering that way of life [Music] or in our home we have prayer every morning you have a belief that no face like that pray every morning is good for us you never do anything against it that's why I just said love thy neighbor as thyself you don't have to be better to love yourself no the man who commits suicide he feels is the best thing for him at that moment that's why he kills himself of course it's wrong but that's why he does it so we'll be able to own our lives and take responsibility for everything [Music] because you know when the devil came in Eden you remember pain is bad pleasure is good that's what it is pleasure adultery pleasure fornication pleasure still what doesn't belong to you take it pleasure is good you have to rationalize why is good at that point in time and while the pain or discipline to not do it is bad my wife has just been not been nice to me at all so I gotta do this it's not my fault it's her or whatever whoever whatever whatever put whatever there or you shout on your children when you don't need to when you don't need to because you think at that point in time it serves your purpose what it is just pain is bad pleasure just the pain of uh uh feedback or criticism Growing Pains you can't be you rather ease of full of instant gratification let me just release this pressure now and speak back and shout and let it off and your pain pleasure programming that's like little babies living like an animal s have no soul to process these things the man coming to Android when at every point when we do anything wrong we are living like animals the man who is living adultery is living like an animal you've seen let me not go there [Music] oh okay so love is a belief system in other words love is a way of life how we see that by the spirit spoken words of love in Genesis 1 28. and so also is fear a belief system fear dominates everything dominates everything and this phase tied directly into our pin pleasure programming that pain is bad and pleasure is good and that's why women means we always gravitate towards pleasure and get away from pain like I told you over and over in the course of this series here God that's what happened in Eden the pain of discipline to wait until God will give them the promised son was too much for Eve and she went to the pleasure of sensual living adultery with the servant [Music] pleasure to good even when pain is bad to run towards pleasure because the Bible says she saw that the tree was good for food want to be desired to make one wise and was pleasurable gravity towards pleasure and run away from pain and with that his speed of fear came in when they did it they found like that all is good all the all the Glitters Is Not Gold it's Fool's Gold many times hallelujah oh glory to God Amen and so the fear that came in then because they said Adam Adam where are thou Adam Adam where are thou I heard that voice walking in the garden [Music] and I hid myself because I was afraid fear came in there just like love is a belief system fear is also a belief system and it's tied directly into your pain pleasure programming like you're saying Eve run away from Pain grab it towards pleasure and that makes you excellent focused and Jesus said you'll fail when men's Hearts fell in for looking after the things happening in the external the world around them the real person lives from within because that's where the person is at it comes from inside out and that's one thing many people many of you haven't got yet but I will break it down it takes us two three four years we'll break it down are you in a horse go anywhere no way only the horse is going to Rapture that's all so [Music] fear came another fall and that's how every man was programmed to live but the devil is not the author of creation so we live and run away from Pain and gravity towards pleasure and just the way he had Eve there he was certain was going to have all of us there from the day we are born well he has kept in God and took that fear and turning on his head because it was God's spirit in man that was perverted anyway so God took it back and turn it into is on purpose the fear of God turn the offense to the fear of God and that fear of God still made use of took what the devil had from his hand and measures of it to God's glory because it's what God owns it and the devil only provided it and God took that fear and let that child understand life that pain is bad and pleasure is good when that child touches a hot plate he feels pain if that child don't feel that way that child will charge your hot plate and it will burn and just have bronze all throughout his body but because pain is bad it runs away from that and not lends by experience that you will never touch a hot plane anymore because it's not good for you are you following me that child goes to the edge of his staircase and falls over the pain is bad pleasure is good God use it in the early years but when we get to that age of accountability when we're adults that ought to change [Music] and we don't live no more by pain is bad pleasure is good but many when you do sin after the age of accountability is because you are living by that belief system that's fired by fear fight by the flesh fired by the external the external is the Flesh and all around it at the age of accountability we're supposed to change that and become adults who live not by pain is bad pleasure is good but they live by what is right or wrong and I'll show you because God taught that baby Adam or the child Adam in the age of that Age of Innocence of every tree you can eat of the church you don't eat it what's right what's wrong go talk the child so that when it gets accountability knows what's right and wrong and doesn't live no more by pain is bad pleasure is good but many people don't leave those training wheels it's like riding a tricycle to know how to balance yourself going through life and then when you become 10 11 15 20 years old you are still riding a tricycle that's what many of us do with our lives [Music] what we do is is our pain that we react to our pain and our pleasure what you said really hurt me what you said really make me feel bad look at what they did and look at what they did look at that and that's just what you did that's what you do that's what you live by and that controls everything that you do and that grinds issues in your heart just if you just have issues all over all over issues I wonder they even have space for anything possible anymore issues negative issues have taken so much mind share in their souls they don't have space for anything possible anymore [Music] be tired by this angry about this feel bad about this feel about it but the issues issues issues oh my [Music] God Sophia came another fall but God turns they feel on his head a mixtures of that belief system that pain is bad pleasure is good in the first years of Our Lives during those years of Innocence but then when we come to the age of accountability we we ought to switch to live by love what is right by love joy peace goodness gentleness long suffering [Music] so love and Pain I'm In Love and fear I believe systems the stories of the issues of our lives and God in Eden poured the love of God there given Adam issues of greatness so only she has that how to be great that's why that's wasn't him but at the fall the devil came in there and put issues of fear and negativity and doubt there and that's how we have the white dog and the black dog on the inside of us and when we get saved it doesn't does it does it the black dog is a snake in the soul it doesn't wipe out because we get saved even the bathroom of the Holy Spirit doesn't totally annihilate it his adoption that will annihilate it but because I'll show you from there next time God bless you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] all right did you get did you get the message today that you are you are totally you are in more control than you think you are because the devil disempowers You by making you feel you don't have the control and when we come Christians like is God that's in control of our lives and all that so then don't get saved sit there and say God's in control of Our Lives he talks at your heart and you go to the altar he talks very hard that thing you're doing is wrong and you need to repent Angel is not going to come repent for you I'll be blessed I'm president I'll be there no that's a very short sign you are not going to be there amen because he said if we live on the inside in the spirit let us also walk on the outside in the spirit it's always from the inside well it's on the inside oh brother [Music] the quote okay it's a little lengthy but listen here for instance I believe that every born-again member of the body of Christ the Paradox in themselves I believe each one of the of you methodists and Presbyterian they never had experience the purpose of the Holy Ghost was in some formal church that did not believe in the general New Birth and has not received the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a perfect example of a paradox because something happened to you that changed your whole being and anyone could look at that and know that a paradox is a miracle unless that happens you cannot be a Christian there must be a paradox for you to become a Christian because no one can change a spirit in a man and give him new breath outside of God God Alone is the only one that can do it and it's a miracle how that God can take a man's thinking and his ways and his life and everything and changing from what it was to what it can be what he can make it for instance a few days ago I was caught on a scene a little something on that was a fine young man fine very fine boy he was going with a little girl like some of them here and everywhere else very fine little girl out of a fine family and this but all of a sudden come with some kind of an idea and he just walked away it is something wrong to the little girl I'm much and much has promised her to do a certain thing and then didn't do it and instead of coming to the game and apologizing like a gentleman should do he just it just wasn't in him to do it watch this prophet and the father and mother called me to the scene and said we will desire to know what is wrong with our boy he said misbehaving big time maybe brought up in church and instead of misbehaving the big time what's wrong with that boy this will make me make excuses what's wrong with that boy whatever what's wrong with that boy nobody's going to kill anybody but you're going to know what you're dealing with I skipped that in Eden you know that the devil convinced Eve to get these issues in to get many of these negative issues in you what was it like it convinced Eve there was a problem where there really was no problem and it it brought into a issue of adultery because One Believes wrong beliefs not just unbelief unbelief is in the word of God an unbeliever man doesn't care about the word of God on wrong beliefs and wrong beliefs wrong beliefs opens up the gateway to the devil as much as unbelief does because they're all shapes of the same not unbelief in the word of God the mother mother came to me and said we would like to know desire to know what's wrong with that boy now it's not easy to do sometime but you must be truthful and honest before the boy was a Christian as far as far as a Believer he had repented and had been baptized and now he's positioned among the Believers but he had not received the person of the Holy Spirit no matter how much he thought he had and that's where we're leading to but even the baptism of the Holy Ghost like I said doesn't Wipe Out the snake but he gives you some power over and above it so you can imagine without the baptism you're just struggling you're thinking you have and having it is you thinking you have and having it is two different things you might be able to try to say you have and you might be able to show some evidence of some emotion but unless your life is vindicating what you are profession you have you still haven't got it no matter how many emotions how much you jump how much you run sensation speaking in tongues or shouting or whatever you might laid upon which is all right I believe in all that true but unless your life copes with your testimony then you haven't got it because the Fruit of the Spirit fruitful fruitful fruits of the spirit vindicate what you are just like the fruit of any three Tales what it is Jesus said by the fruit you shall know them now these young fellows parents his mother is German no reflection on the German but there's a strain in that family straining that family string and the strain is in the home and the children live with that and children live learn what they live unless Trend comes to them as an issue of life and those children just go they just can't have a normal relationship with anybody they just must the matter aggregation is the major side where you get a strained relationship possibly you and your father's house Elijah said to wake up foreign no reflection on the Germans but there's a string in that family and that is they'll just sit and you can talk to them and you'll just tear you right in the face you don't care what you're talking about the girl's sister the mother of this boy her sister the mother of this boy her sister that's the boy's auntie I have calmed down the street many morning and this young lady be setting out in the yard and I'd say good morning how you doing she just chill and look at me and I'd stop and say sure I find money she would just stand by look what at you an intelligent woman and I say come up to see us sometime you see she just turn and look that distance look it's a spirit in the family is an issue in the family it's an issue of life in the family either they believe it makes them feel Swank or feel tush or feel Superior or feel like the guys in the insane or feel like we don't go around with all these church people or whatever we are the whatever they feel just tell you are you like that the boy in church saved same thing so his conversion did not take it out no that's what I'm trying to show you because we get lazy because just like God is going to do for us no you have work to do we are laborers together with God no matter how much you are predestinated you got work to do work to do so you just stand and look well her brothers are that way father and mother is that way because that's the atmosphere and that atmosphere was poured into her according to her because she sees it the child sit in the home it becomes thoughts in their hearts becomes their thinking how they live and then becomes another it fills up IT issues out issues out that's why you see some things running families this is not genetic I mean a lot of is genetic but even without the genes you can I'll show you how even things that are not genes can become a genetic thing from you science not me science I'll show you that also not today [Music] now the father of the boy so on his on his mother's side her brothers his mother's brothers are that way the father and mother is that way also he's one parents that way and the anti of course that way now the father of the ball is strictly a nourished Man Moody Moody Moody and high temperate High strong highly strong when highly strong when Swami isolation he can cut right away very prickly they get angry at everything just just very prickly even tension just attention tension like high tension just just High attention just everything just get angry just attention that's how we are many of us you know the real life you know that's how you are all of us all of us this is not for the other things for you for you you examine yourself now the fellow boys should be an Irishman Moody High tempered High strong that's his whole family like that so are you telling me all the family have these jeans no it's just the atmosphere they live in Adam lived an atmosphere of positivity be bold be strong you can do it amen but we get this train leaving an atmosphere of like gossip and who it doesn't like them who doesn't like them and and you think they are going to grow up to fulfill the potential of greatest of course not [Music] we get them live in an atmosphere of like just negative negativity High Strong high tempered that's his whole family like that except one out of the family that's converted that's converted and that understands these things here and knowing like that I am not going to live my life just reacting through life I'm going to live my life responding to life I'll respond to life I'll take charge I own I own my life I take charge I took charge the father mother both are Christians filled with the Holy Ghost and they have brought this young man up in the way of the Lord and now the young man is about 17 or 18 years old something along their very fine kid very fine kid and it's been a real model boy at home nice kid and he's got a brother that's just vice versa both the girls the mother's family lives close to a fine Church but do you think they'd ever come over there no they won't go to church there and they know it's right but it's just not in them to ask forgiveness or ask pardoning they just won't do it it's just not in them now the genes in the mother father or mother of this boy no matter how much they are converted Still Remains the flesh that has been interbred out to this boy therefore the boy has got a complex in him just like from his mother's family and they are not forgiven they will not apologize and there's that and and that's where that boy stands now accept to the father no matter how much you raise him up now look at you out of your family all of them drunkards and fighting and shooting and cutting and so forth now look at our family to the mother there are a bunch of people just said they won't speak very independent the independent thing very independent man on my own I like that too but everything has its limits very independent and so forth a reverent to religion but I said it's not you you are the only one of all your sisters and brothers and you are sweet kind of forgiven what does that and you are true part of the family tree yet you have received the Holy Ghost that's the thing that made you tender and sweet it's not your people anymore it's your Christ that lives in you that's why you are different but what I'm telling you actually like not because you're a Christian automatically goes no that's the worst way I'm building up to that's what I'm building up to even with the person of the Holy Ghost you are just getting started so that's why you need the Holy Ghost that's why there's seven breath pains to shake you out of your filled flesh shake you out of these issues of life and Shake you back into the image of Jesus Christ amen doesn't the middle Santander it's not your people anymore it's your Christ that lives in you I said to the boy look at your family practice all of them are drunks and so forth and how moody and high temper and high Strong high strong but you are not you are kind forgiven what is it the Holy Spirit you are no more what you want what you are is Christ and you are said now that's the thing that's going to happen to your son on the father reads up and said my son went to the altar he was baptized correct in the name of Jesus Christ and what about in the pool said I know my son has come to Christ see parents yeah that may be all right all the outward emotions you might be identified as believer of the Believers but until he's reaching and written born again I advise that that young man to never marry a woman or he'll make hell on Earth for her unto that gentle sweet forgiving Spirit of Christ comes in then that will be a paradox in itself to take the very nature of a brother that's between father and mother and yet in his intellectuals he's trying his best to overcome it he can do it by intellectuals he'll never overcome it Christ has to come in him and overcome it when he lets Christ in then he's already overcome then it will be a perfect product when a man is born on the spirit of God a paradox [Music] 630801 God bless you [Music] mother Paul you know God bless you [Music] foreign God richly bless you that's all I want is just

less but certainly don't let anything keep you back from coming also make sure you organize your transportation it is Carnival Monday as you know and although there are plans and things in place for activities you are certainly welcome to work with different things for activities games bicycles and those things for particularly for the younger one but I just want to encourage the church most importantly is to be in the presence of one another and to have a time to fellowship and have a time to connect knowing that one day when this time experience is all over we'll be on the other side fellowshipping about the trials and fellowshipping about how we made it over and we are looking forward to spend more time with each other it's also biblical as the day approaches that we spend more time together encouraging one another fighting through these trials that we all have to face that God and His Divine wisdom has sent our way and certainly last but not least among the great expectation as I'm sure you are as well for our convention this July 14 15 and 16 and I believe in my heart that it will be the greatest convention that we have ever had do you believe that that one of these days of Minnesota wouldn't be able to minister that the Holy Ghost will pour out in such a way that'll shake the word it'll shake this island it'll shake the nation and I believe God has called us for such a time as this so we want to encourage you to be in prayer and also uh in preparation for this as we are looking for God to do something as you know for the last few years we would have had ritual conventions because of the pandemic but we are really happy to be able to get back to physical physical conventions this year and we're looking for God's work for us and to also be able to host our local Believers as well as Believers from around the world just before I came up to the pulpit I got a message you know from Ivory Coast with number of believers who are trying to make it and we're beginning to get to the applications and the requests coming in for all of the Visas and all of these things so we could begin to process so our Believers coming back once more to this beautiful small island of Trinidad to have a wonderful time in fellowship with the Lord so beyond the expectation we need all the help and the support and but over also asks that we mentioned that we are looking to get some commitment from the Believers as the Lord put on your heart in terms of pledges and commitments for the convention we would like to be able to start to work on this from next Sunday Lord willing and but over there that and we'll put some support there with kind of coordinate that effort but we are soliciting your support uh whatever law puts on your heart but what is important is that we have a commitment so we can be in a position to be a blessing to others you believe that this morning so may the Lord wish you bless you have a wonderful time in the Lord today is the Lord's day so it's it's a day we dedicated the Lord so all those service is officially over I want to encourage you to keep practicing the presence of the Lord he loves the fellowship with you you know he loves when you call upon his name he whenever you talk about him he draws in there because he loves to be the center of your joy the scent of your life the scent of your home you know my brother all who said so much about the way we live every day and the choices we make every day he says it's out it's it's the issue of your heart so my prayers Lord I want the and I want that virus out of my heart take the virus out of my heart today I want to be reprogrammed to the original programming that Adam had before he fell because that program that script when it was running had a certain kind of behavior that came from in time when the devil came in that virus brought a different kind of behavior but Lord take us back to it was Back to Eden oh fellowship and God back to holiness the way it wasn't a day of Pentecost where the Holy Ghost says just as real as when it poured out Peter didn't even know he could have been reprogrammed but when Peter was reprogrammed he said this is that that the prophet Joel spoke about Oh my he wasn't afraid of debt he was not afraid of persecution why he was reprogrammed back to the original back to the original programming brother I'm excited because that original programming cannot die that the results were coming is eternal oh when they tried to take that original programming and put that programming on the cross that programming had it built in he said destroyed his Temple and then treaties are raised back up again there's something written in the programming oh that you cannot die and even if you fall down you're gonna see you in a resurrection because that's all part of the broken oh I want that programming and it comes by the Holy Ghost itself living out Living Faith all the way to a living charity a new creature a new creation and this being when it is completed is the being go to the Rapture oh I'm looking for the Rapture are you are you looking forward to leaving this world behind leaving the sin behind leaving the Mind battles and the back pains and the struggles behind people feeling free to go out the house the crime or the situation but before we leave it'll be such a power in your life that when the devil sees you he has to cross the street because he knows just like when Jesus went there those demons that were in Legion said have you come to tormentors before our time they recognize him before he said a word and the devil will recognize those who have been placed into the body of Christ with the fire of God burning in their souls so be excited stay on the firing line and don't let the devil lie to you you are born for this you are built for this you are designed for this you are going to overcome lift your head up Square your shoulders back and say Mama I'm Coming Home that eagle to Eagle call that mother Eagle was trooping over and when that little Eagle saw that mother Eagle he said something in my soul responded Mama I'm here I'm here and I'm gonna make it
