Lord and will be in your presence you put it deep in libram heart the seeker city who's making builder is going Lord he put a toast in our souls to be like you father Enoch had a testimony before he left and we also will have to have a testimony God come this morning take me out of the way and come into your word and speak to us we need to hear from you it is coming beyond a seminar it is coming to a genuine life a word life spirit life Holy Ghost life make us true channels Lord that you could speak to your people lived area because through China's law that the spirit can flow freely and you can be magnified and glorify allah mention me founded lord jesus in my ask Amen god bless you welcome it's good to be here let's go into the word Amen we have three portion of scripture this morning one from first John chapter five you wanna read from verse water eat we also know they got first John chapter two fifteen to seventeen and also Hebrews eleven was five and six readin first John chapter 5 was four for whosoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is a victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God this is he that came by water and blood even Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the Spirit is truth for their tree that bear record in heaven the father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one and they are treated bear witness in earth the spirit the water and these three agree in one one about first John chapter 2 1 I read from verse 15 it reads love not the world neither teens that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he's a do it the will of God our last scriptures of Hebrews 11 and this one verse 5 and it reads by feet Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God our doubt feet is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him let's pray one more time father we thank you for your word Lord you know that chopped up to a word some things here and you just you could put it together father take me out of the way and me a spirit flow upon your woman and quickly to your people in Jesus and I ask it email him and you may be seated praise God tons for coming this morning you wouldn't want to come to church and preach the empty benches so you make the effort to come and I pray that God richly reward you and bless you for coming out this morning I want to read first John 2:15 to 17 and the amplified before he continued it says here do not love or cherish the world or the teens that are in the world if anyone loves the world love for the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh craving for sensual gratification the lust of the eyes greedy longings of the mind and the pride of life assurance in one owns resources or in the stability of Dibley teens these do not come from the father but above the world itself and the world passes away and disappears and with it the forbidden Cravens the passionate desires the lust of it and he who does the will of God and carries out his purpose and life abides and remains forever isn't that something Savva title this morning faith is the victory that overcomes the world as a title this morning faith is the victory that overcomes the world I have a subject of being born again by the incorruptible seed of the word of God another team it's the truth because God said so once God said it it's the truth and this scripture this are being born again of the incorruptible seed of the will of God that came from first Peter chapter 1 was trying to say it's eating you're purified your souls in obeying the truth see truth is no gesture here but truth has to be obeyed or bathe obeying the truth through the spirit under unfaith love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever and then Peter give this reference for all flesh is as grass and all the glory of man as the flower of the grass what happens after a while the grass withereth the flower fallen away but the word of the Lord endures forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you so just as grass just a fade away and the flower fall off so the glory of man and all the luster of will not feel you're gonna fall off one day isn't that right all right my my my ready for the word this morning get a wonderful provision and on Friday which entire church was there and there's telling the believers that your prayer even stands beyond death if somebody dies doesn't stop their prayer that's a powerful tortimer hallelujah just think about it now so I was saying you don't know some grandmother might have prayed for you and nothing grandmother or grandfather might even be wrong right now but their prayer was held before God the diam going on but that pristine before God written for you to vote for answer that pray on your meal before you can't stop ring for your children your family your loved one you can't stop that because your prayers in living before God your prayer is the important a fire rocket see a prayer he could hear your prayer your prayer going to be answer don't stop brilliant because you feel this and you're not seeing it no you keep on any home where as try whether it's crotchy where a I don't feel like Kevin no keep on playin go read a board our share a norm that when Isaac put the blessing upon Jacob and Jacob taught was Esau and the blessing went upon a Jake Jacob and when Esau came he said I only saw father said but I put he blessing on that other son already watch this he couldn't take it back he couldn't cancel it he couldn't undo it Oh hallelujah he had to take what remain because it already banged his mouth oh boy that's how powerful it is hallelujah and one more one more when Abraham told Abimelech that Sarah was his sister which was a lie oh it was trying to cheat in a way but but it wasn't the truth Godfrey's every woman that house we man come to Abram and simply go to me that or come and warn a man in a dream don't touch demo interfere my servant wife the man said in Munson Ellie sister he said I come to talk to you about and your Bible said that Abraham prayed for God to Brit that thing off of that house and good answer it by one so I want to show you something here Abram was not responsible for freezing the rooms in the house but he was responsible to pray to take this atmosphere I want to show important you are if ever I'm didn't where God couldn't do nothing for them I wanna see understand even I'm not to pay for that to be lifted over Abimelech in these homes and the Bible said they were all healed because you are that's important repairs but you let a picture that's so important it is my hallelujah so let's get on into the word this morning question answers question you said a person could live so close to God that he could not sin while he on it then explain first John 1 8 to 10 so but I'm gonna read first John 1 into 10 and the Bible says if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves on the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say we have not sinned we make him a liar under will done enough well nor with my wit my dear brother just turn right over to the to chapter the 9 verse you write on the same page in mind I but it was to begin with and then we're I'm gonna read he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sin from the beginning for the purpose the Son of God was made manifest that he might destroy the works of the devil just what I've been talking about God predestination knowing you we shall ever adizero scripture whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he's been born of God that's just that's just what the way it says now if you watch here if we say we have not sinned we make him a liar and the word is not enough now some people say well now here is just a good attagirl or good little boy they never said to begin with you are belong in sin you are certain iniquity you come to the race speaking lands so when you are born in this world you are a liar you are a teeth you know everything there is just all this sin not a teeth but you have a story you are not a liar because you are not a leader that the Spirit is in you when you are born because you are in the world and that's the reason you can't have Reformation you have got to die and be born you cannot have birth without reflection on the line that you cannot have without conviction you can't have a resurrection you must be crucified to the things of the world in order to be resurrected in price so if you are going to depend upon your intellect or conception you will never be born of the Spirit of God you got to forget my pole did all you have a node I know nothing except Christ Jesus and be born anew see it's a bait that makes you a new creation the very greek word here itself it means creation you are a new creation there's a worthier creature is the word creation you are new creation not of the world but in Christ Jesus us in the world you know fancy things fine clothes put it wrong eyes to a girl wavy here for the boy you know and something another to attract attention or lustful or drinking the Bible said if you love the world and until the world the love of God's not even you so in order to get that out of you you have to die you have to be crucified buried and resurrected a new creation in Christ Jesus now this is the truth because God said so this is the word say Amen somebody hallelujah so therefore you will receive the Holy Ghost before you receive the Holy Ghost you are believing unto eternal life but you do not have eternal life until you receive the Holy Ghost course it is eternal eyes the Holy Ghost is God it is God's life in you then you've got eternal eyes do you understand it now you are believing onto it it's a good thing you were men excusing for this if it sounds too flat but still a baby isn't born if you cheat that baby right and follow the rules of nature that baby will be born normal but if you don't apply everything to the rules of nature I'm going to hide bruised or hit it's going to ruin you it's killed Italy before it's born but that's the matter the bruises come from Satan and Satan takes the poison that's of hill and try to bruise the church that's in travail with a baby before it's ever born they kill it but if you just take the Bible and meet it give the baby food the mother taking vitamins and this is the best vitamins I know of it builds you up though the church ought to be taking spiritual vitamins and the vitamins is right here a whole book full of them praise God and that little fellow he's got life and the little cells are moving and kicking after about three months and four he is kicking and moving but he is in pornea that means the babies in the womb but the baby hasn't been born as yet it had life at kicking but it's not born yet let's continue but as soon as he's brought into the world the doctor holds him up give him a spankin and Wow there he goes he starts breathing and just as soon as he breathes the breath of life then he becomes a living soul and that's the thing sometimes you receive you are ready to receive the Holy Ghost you ain't reveal you are wanting to be delivered how many here in that right now wanting the baptism of the Holy Ghost really want to know what it is and you want to get into it who wants the bathroom only goes raising hands he said you are in travail you are wanting to be delivered could you imagine wanting to be delivered because you are pregnant with child you are pregnant with God hallelujah burrito God Amen and what you need is a little gospel spank sometime on your skin for dory I know you think I'm crazy but we have the minor cracks which is craziness to the world Alleluia let's continue but a Branham if possible for person to be lost and end up in hell if he rejects the light of the word even though he has a genuine experience of justification and salvation yes sir that's exactly right when you use the expression that if we do not believe the word we will be eternally separated from Christ do you mean the fullest version will live eternally but they will be separated it from New Jerusalem the Christ will dwell with the bride here those who do not have the Holy Spirit born again as the Scripture speaks of be born again if the natural built requires water blood and spirit does not the spiritual but requires all three stages of Greece before a person is truly born again absolutely doesn't do any message about any profit of only rapture they not what being taught him he said absolutely the three stages are required no be get into something just bear with me and I explained this morning on the same thing you've got to have all stitches you are begotten of the spirit just like a baby is begotten in the womb of a mother but not born until they receive the Holy Ghost that's right you are born then you are not converted you are in the process of being converted until that time and then he went on some deep stuff that's the reason all these great mysteries could not be given colita could not be given to wesley could not be given to the heir just pass us by the pedicles r8y it wasn't time they will be glutton Oh hallelujah praise God so that man the pen Acosta was telling the womb so God didn't bring mysteries to them because it was still inside the womb but brother Branham came to introduce the person of Jesus Christ which is the fullness of the world and you will be born by that word the incorruptible world God take his word and pack it up and wrap it up as a seed to be preached and that's what being preached to you and then the secret comes about the wood is in the black hallelujah Oh God mystery wrapped up in a seed and he slipped a seed inside of you and they'd ever try to do anything about it or glory the public or the secret is out your room is already closed you can't get pregnant for somebody else or Korena clogged a woman's sealed up let the Word of God Oh hallelujah diddly that where is the name of the Lord he said it couldn't come before now hallelujah praise God so this person of the Holy Ghost is what Balram came to introduce us to hallelujah the person of God which is the word of God isn't that right Lester beat him of the Lord let's continue now watch it will come to a head in the last days that it would be this the seed of God and the mark of the beast to spiritual powers working together and anyone knows that the seal of God is the blood right the baptism of the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4 titty see see is not just stating a statement honor it have a scripture to back up what you're saying so it knows a scriptural voice that is speaking to you Ephesians 4 today grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed till the day of your redemption when they were born again they were filled with the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit is the new but we know that you are big Clutton of the Spirit I'll admit that but until you are born dancer baby is the gotten in the mother's womb that's got a kind of a life it's a life little cells in the body twisting and kicking and jumping but when it is born it has a squeal and they become a living soul so he's saying the room lies and the outside life is two different life so that's why you said a new hot tub will give you a new spirit I will give you Alan leave it then I put my spirit in your spirit or glory to God you believe that he said the baby can go to churches they believe in church I go I'll do this I'm good I want to do right I want to do right but what Annie's a gospel spunk to wake it up the screen is eternal life and the Holy Smoke screams in it like it never screamed before and then become a new creature so you in your flesh you come to church a mother premier someone kill some and some husband wife whatever that you like normal man but until fire from inside of that use this normal man when the Bible is right the word is right I love the church I love this singing I love the testimonies are like a special there's just normal man you had to be born again by the word in the spirit hallelujah hallelujah they still know my mind will still go and costs and steal and lion do everything else because you were born in sin that's why the gospel came to say you must be born again oh boy we know God hallelujah and a man that is born of God overcomes the world and this is the vichy overcomes the world even our faith and that's why the bottom of the pyramid his head look at the little shake you have to start somewhere Oh glory no came

ugly act in the church and course in trouble you will never be able to have a revival as long as that kind of a pleasure is all wrong so the troublemakers either get out of trouble or they get out

in Jesus Christ you said my arm is still crippled but fit is a victory I still feel sick but it is a victory it overcomes the world and when you can train in to God by prayer until you see the Saint conquer under you there is nothing that can hurt you then you have overcome you are 50 miles of elbow room or that one when you cut : in prayer and conquer in the spirit realm or nothing that stopped it then you are 50 miles an hour room Loreena God hallelujah all those boxes and boxes they just just jump in the room and I reckon this fight notice prepare yourself mentally that's something called weigh-in rather wait to see the weight before they were nearing and they weigh me mentally Wayne opposition here while it we in one talking I'm not content forum hurry to the wrong now what did you in there is mine they're trying to bring fear nineteen Timmy the other person but if that man intimately I don't want to beat you up like fire looks like B's if you don't have a rebuttal if you cast him that not all this little guy you don't defeated in the minority this man wrecking no recognized already he don't have feet over you because your mind week so Jesus and the gardener Gethsemane when

any spirit he was gonna bawl my God why over second me but he already conquered in spirit his flesh had to go to die but he conquered in spirit you gotta come to grow your conquer before you're going to conquer let them feel like a conqueror you know you're a conqueror here is the victory that cannot conquer this world or give the Lord a show you need revolution more than you think you need to ask for for revelation because revelation is fate or glory the corners continue when you climb into garden by prayer until you see the thing conquered under you this nothing can hurt you then you overcome you got fifty miles of every room you're stealing freedom you who have been a drunkard and sleeve to whiskey you will be a master over handling that's what we talking about it's the truth because God said so this is God speaking here go say you could be a master over what has been accomplished you can't get by you a master it everything that conquered you you wanna conquer it God set so that you chew chew chew toy shoot Lord let's continue that old ever of alcohol that make you drink he's your master now but then when you get fit I don't make the leafy green fate he's yourself antenna Oh hallelujah what is fate fate is sometimes revealed to you that is not yet what you believe it will be it is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of God Oh hallelujah so it's not ready it's not right view and experience but in the spirit you are a revelation so Abram didn't experience Isaac here a revelation of Isaac as I didn't come yet it took 25 years to see the fruit of that fate it took 25 years for Isaac to materialize but he had a fate he had a revelation yeah he has something in his soul he has the experience of Isaac yet but inside his spirit is finished because God says oh and that's the truth and if God said it is the truth God is can't lie it's got to come to pass Oh glory no God I've got a continuum right then we don't pull him out this sticky to Tico funny run away I can't stop no hallelujah hard I get to the speed and pull back this stick I want to share testimony with you a little woman para bellum you can't lead um tobacco you woman mmm when they come to a place where you can get to that spot the way you have to overcome at my feet your master there a woman that said in present no she had been to this she has been at this altar time after time after time a good woman she started smoking a long time ago she just couldn't overcome it she had come up and I would pray with her seemed like she just couldn't overcome it the first thing you know I told her here I said there'll be danger down the road she said but Abraham I've cried beg you see I just emotional he said just fight in the air that won't do any good so I get down pray with her lay hands on her she'll go back a few days I'll meet her again just knock you down with cigarette smoke I'm still wrong one night she went to the doctor beginning to get sick and withered away spine lifting doctor look into her and said cancer smoking cigarettes jesse was lee india today then she got up the business you see a drunken man who a rich first row as long as you want order to church tonight no you can go to join a Methodists or Baptists as long as you can sit in here and say I'm a good person there's nothing wrong with me

where she was at when I got there she had a dream when the Holy Spirit came into the room she got down to real business she never smoked a cigarette from then on she had gained many pounds of weight and they can't find a trace of cancer what is it listen what is it it's faith that overcomes now when they get something out to you this is the Prophet that preferred woman not once over and over this

around but when the doctor says you got chance are you gonna die she got the business that's the way it has to get when you get the business why wait that long why not get down to business now put your faith in God what if the woman had had a faith in me this is big he said it would feel because I'm a man but when she changed her faith not in Branham tabernacle or in William Branham or in anybody else but place of faith in Jesus Christ then she got faith so I kept conscience to this church I kept Rogers as a man after pointing to Jesus Christ because that is the faith not going to give it the victory to overcome the world come together law son praises since the old force it is pointed in some autism group or some manners on ministry we saw force that is this is Bible teaching this is the Word of God how let's continue what if the woman had had a faith in me it will feel what I'm a man when he change of fate not in Brahminical Owen but William Branham or anybody else but place of faith and Jesus Christ then she got feet she raised up above all the fears and doubts and God healed her she overcome faith is the victory that overcomes real faith knows no defeat here a bomb it cannot be defeated even death itself can't defeated listen trials nor defeat but fate knows no defeat it cannot be defeated it's the only way you can please God for without faith is impossible to please him Oh hallelujah so when mater say even know Lord as they even know hallelujah aníbal Lazarus come forth defeat in Jesus she said he that believeth on me though he were dead yet shall he live

Sigler has no end no there's a real true spirit of love there's a real true spirit of loyalty there's a retu spirit of honesty and I know but that is God the very fountain he said let us close our eyes to our imaginations for a few moments and go back before there was anything the great function of all eternity was that spirit of love joy spirit of honesty speed of trueness in this perfection then out of the existence of the Father when the logos which was the son which was a tyranny which was the body of the great Jehovah God when fought in a celestial body that's the logos the word spoke out of them great fountains of life and they're the theophany which was God made into wood then that theophany was made flesh in the person of Christ Jesus then all the fullness of the Trinity dwelt in him father son Holy Spirit all that and that's the very way we go plumb back to the original beginning of God dear we are born again not a flesh born again not of blood but born again by the spirit and in that eternal spirit of love and honesty comes down to make its place in us then when we die from this life we go into the body which is the rhetoric we resolve we have a teen often II into one a celestial body then I the comment of the Lord Jesus this body is picked up from the eat again and made into a glorified state the live in his presence forever then all perfusion all the things that was in profusion pulls out of existence flesh goes into punishment he'll open up a moat and swallows it all the evil and pollution and God and his beloved church his bride takes the stand for the
