name we ask it amen god bless you and welcome thanks for coming out tonight and if you have your bibles i'd like you to turn to sin mark chapter 11. we want to read from verse 11 to 26 o praise the lord and jesus entered into jerusalem and into the temple and when he had looked around about upon all things and how the even tag was come he went out onto bethany with the twelve and the tomorrow when they were come from bethany he was hungry the scene of victory of fire all having leaves he came if happily he might find anything thereon but when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of the figs was not yet and jesus answered and said until no man eat food from the hereafter forever and the disciples heard it and they come to jerusalem and jesus went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money changers and the seats of them that soul does and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel to the temple amen and he taught saying unto them is it not written my house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer but you have made it a den of thieves and the scribe when the chief priest heard it and sought how they might destroy him for they feared him because all the people was astonished at his doctrine and when even was come he went out of the city and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and peter called in to remember and say it unto him master behold the fig tree which thou kissed this is withered away and jesus answer it say it unto them have faith in god for verily i said to you that whosoever shall see unto this mountain be done removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said and therefore i say unto you what things so ever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is heaven forgive your trespasses let's pray father we thank you lord and i pray you would breathe uh your spirit breath life upon your word and and touch us with life tonight and light tonight in jesus name we ask a team and you may be seated go praise the lord have a title tonight when you stand praying forgive me o pray is the name of the lord there's a great need for forgiveness in this hour people don't even know how uh holding grudges and authors oughts affect the person who is holding the oats and grudges more than the person that you're holding out and grudges against sometimes people don't even know you're holding the ought against them they don't even know what they did but you hot something against somebody else and you're holding it and not affecting all your other blessings because faith is based on forgiveness i want you to understand that faith is not just by hearing the word of god faith itself is based on forgiveness hallelujah that's what the word declares when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any oh praise god you love him tonight hallelujah and jesus live in that world that that no one knowed about he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith in a perfect god because jesus was unhindered in that he had that sick sense connected to him because he was the word made flesh hallelujah so he wasn't just tied up in five senses he was connected to the sixth sense which was a perfect fate so he lived in another world another dimension and you are going to live in another world another dimension god gonna bring you out of your five senses and bring you into a sense of a living fate oh glory to god hallelujah praise god he said have faith in god hallelujah so when people get excited about look defeat the victory is clear he said have faith in god oh glory to god said he said no if we live in a perfect faith of a christian to what we are we'll be a mystic to the world the people won't understand you you would walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what it forbid you will not do because you're walking in the spirit oh god one the spirit said do you want to do it because you're living for the will of god you're not living to compete with your neighbor you're not believing to compete with your brother you're living for the will of god that's all you want is god's will and what you will enjoy god's will oh glory to god that's right if he said i'd rather be a doormat in the house of god than to be a king in the tents of the wicked oh glory to god you want to be an effective doormat let everybody wipe the shoes on you oh glory to god hallelujah oh yes i want to be in god's will i'm happy in god's will there is no jealousy in the will of god oh he has no envy in the will of god oh guess god's will revealed to you oh glory to god hallelujah god's will for you to praise him tonight god's will for you to shout tonight god's will for you to in everything give him thanks in the good time he praises his name and the bad time you do the same oh glory and trouble come on every hand you do the same oh glory to god i have a bondage upon you tonight if the power is a come among the people it will not even be the prayer of the people but it will be the grace of almighty god i have a bomb to jump on you tonight when the headstone come it will come with shout-outs not be long in the message i'm not even shouting not be day long time that's not what they're shouting and be shouting grace grace grace oh glory to god it will be the grace of god to you [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah so they should give you a consolation tonight that don't try to figure out nothing with your head the same god that brought out rehab oh glory to god the same god that brought out noah anybody batman the same god that bothered all these people he gonna bring you out and bring out your family too it's not by night it's not my power but it's by my spirit say the lord all glory to god and on the message of grace the prophet said the church got to be rebuilt a lot of preachers will talk about that oh yes we build the church with the word all these years but he said the church will be rebuilt that means god will raise up abort a bunch of rebuilders not by might and power but by the spirit of god and no man can do nothing by the spirit the spirit itself has to do it he said not by might not my power but by my spirit not my intellectual might not my knowledge power not my press and play but by thy spirit say of the lord oh give the lord a shout in the house oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah god are using the machine god are using nothing mechanical god using men oh glory to god put fire in men and the last of the pillar of fire could be failing the sons of god no devil had gone stop it no fallen angel go stop it god kicked lucifer out and he fell on the earth and sees what's in the earth the seas of the sons of god and we are coming back he gonna bring back them sons oh glory to god you're not ordinary folks you are supernatural oh glory i'm not saying it again you're not ordinary folks you are supernatural glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god [Applause] [Music] so you figure you you feel your christian soul for none for naught because you're walking and walking by sight you're walking by eyes you're seeing flesh and blood but the bible said we're rational against flesh and blood but against principles and powers but yet he doesn't think that all the time but the reality is we are not fighting flesh and blood we fight in all kind of evil spirits every living day oh glory to god hallelujah every living day you can't see them but they're still there you can't feel them but they're still there influencing and pushing and manipulating and whatnot [Applause] [Music] maybe she said you hear what lucifer said jesus all these kingdoms are mine the gift of whosoever i want just worship hallelujah satan say at last i catch him now oh my one man man love this poetic dubai you know oh yes let's get my reporting let's give my thing you like that you know hallelujah man won power in his fallen nature listen listen to be over another man man in his fallen condition lusting for power over other men and jesus who was away made flesh before his ministry take off god lead him to deal with the devil to see how he could handle himself before he could handle others and other things he makes sure the spirit itself that about this bunch of ministers who say they adopted already they messed up big time they may mix they may meet lucy yet they may meet lucifer yet because jesus was led by dynamics into the wilderness to overcome lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life in a private test no believers propping you up you know nobody waving you on come on you could do it amen hallelujah shall turn around and shake your hand to your brother encourage one another it wasn't that general it was he taking a stand for the righteousness it was he saying it's also written oh glory to god this wasn't a secret deed jesse as is you i says you okay i'm hungry i've got ten little bread no he didn't do that he washed the stone he knew his power he knew his authority he could have done it but he didn't do it he wanted to prove that man truly shall not live by bread alone but by every word i proceeded the mouth of god because the bread hallelujah is limited to the senses but the word is eternal all glory to god you're heading for eternity don't be giving away some praises hallelujah so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith i mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ they know you were getting into bright material you were getting into rapture and condition that means that each one of us not just the pastor the deacons the trustees no for each one of us not just the pastor declan trustee that means a lady every individual walks in a world with god alone you are baptized into this kingdom and there is nobody in deal but you and god how come you don't hear that much there is nobody in there but you and god not you god and the pastor not you god and this elder not you god and the church nothing like that you and god baptized into this kingdom [Applause] give me them kingdom people oh glory feel inspired tonight jesus came to preach the kingdom of god this is what the fathers had this is what jesus preached to peter now the kingdom of god let's backtrack a little bit here these men fishermen cuss birds smoking drinking lying do another one this man with a long beard come and say peter come someone come i start to preach to them and teach them stuff that describing pharisees wasn't teaching amen and then he cast out a devil an unclean spirit and that is what started a weakened people when that devil get booted out they say what never see that before we are customary pharisees with the long gong tall hats and beautiful robes doing all kind of stuff and hailing in marketplaces and praying marketplaces but not demonic coming out satan undercover because satan had to get uncovered you know oh yes as long as he behind the scenes doing all the mischief he undercover that's what barum says you know you see when the devil gets exposed all the people face has changed on the platform he said the devil don't like to be exposed people say don't tell i say don't tell don't tell it's devil hiding behind there you know what kind of confusion and backhand is satan behind that you know don't say who tell you you can't say it because the devil man in your tongue truth is truth oh give the lord a shout lie is light and he's the father allies but he gonna be exposed oh glory to god hallelujah because of pride he wanted to elevate himself to the throne of god he get boots hallelujah he went and tell that to the rangers a tale he lied to them all glory to god to set up another kingdom and god kicking down on the earth and the battle of angels became the battle of men and that battle raging ever since oh and you are caught in between that battle and causing a prophet to enter into the supernatural realm already stretched out word to reveal that you already called anointed justified oh glory lord god as if it never did it that is beyond your senses you maybe she said so what brother brahm came to bring wasn't for the flesh wasn't for your five senses what brother brahm came to bring was for the fate that's supposed to be in you activated in you because all these precious promises have to jam into your faith he wasn't watching peter then fleshing him he was dropping upon them every promise he could give them the same works i do shall you do also and then peter was going to deny christ oh glory if you believe on me as the scripture had said out of his belly shall rivers of living water you keep chopping promises upon them if you shall say to this mountain be move and don't don't in your heart you can have what they don't know a clue what he's talking about he said have faith in god but he knew they had the potential he knew they had the gene he had the dna they had the german them to become that do you get that understand this he is not trying to come down to them you know he's trying to bring them up to him he said at that day you shall know i am in the father you and me and i am you he is prophesying over them he breathed upon them receiving the holy ghost let me have a clue we talking about he said i haven't i will not give you comfortless i'm going to come to you they never had that experience before they never had that fire breaking up on their show before he said but i'm gonna come to you a little while the world's here at me no more but you're going to see me how is it that the world is not going to see you and you're going to see me oh is it he said i am the father oh glory to god he that will be my word and my father be going to love him are we going to manifest ourselves to him or give the lord a shout in the house oh god want to confirm his word to you god want to confirm the faith have faith in god [Applause] and what jesus christ that victory for to show them it could be done by the word and if they could curse a victory it means you could bless a victory too you notice what was he selling whatever you binding it is bong in heaven whatever you loose on it it's loose in heaven that means somebody crippled up you could lose them on earth and they're equally loose in heaven whatever you're binding a bong in heaven if it says satan i bind you in the name of jesus christ heaven there is heaven can undo that [Applause] as you operate heaven confirming the operation do you get that whatever you're bound on earth is born in heaven it is recognized by heaven you become a heaven representative you become a kingdom representative you represent not a church or a group or a pastor or some tabernacle you're not representing that you represent the kingdom of the most high god [Music] [Applause] glory [Applause] so they must have a way for god to bring the kingdoms into enter into visibility in other words the clash of the kingdoms [Music] oh this bible is created a woman's daughter was sick man come and say jesus my he told me he i couldn't believe i hear any tips privately he going on youtube and listening privately jesus the daughter is sick next man come and say don't even bother with me she dead now and jesus said i go weaker because he's in different world all together all the people are wrong is five senses people but he in a realm of perfect fate oh hallelujah wake her so every time he's walking towards her all them demons just moving to the left moving to the right because they seen a living representation of michael power and force that defeated them listen he conquered hell he conquered the grave he conquered sickness he conquered debt itself die by the debt could be reasonable because debt itself has been conquered you know i'm not hearing you i'm not hearing you i'm not hearing you i'm not hearing you that itself has been conquered you know [Applause] it is easy for the dead to be raised no because that itself has been conquered he conquered every sickness every disease all manner of diseases you know what this is devils and if the devils have been conquered between sickness conquered crippled conquered blindness conquered female condition conquered depression that conquered two frustration conquered uncleanness conquered adultery conquered fornication conquered unclean living conquered [Applause] every demon that banging you damn cocado [Music] every devil in your home right now is already conquered the demon upon your wife the demon upon your husband the demons on your children all glory to god they already conquered or have faith in god tonight [Applause] oh glory to god who gonna tame them devils but there came a voice one time oh glory who's going to tame them devils oh hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah glory glory glory glory hallelujah when jesus ministry begins when jesus ministry began to come forward you see you know what they said they bring all men of sickness brother george what kind of crippling thing look at look at them brethren who had a nice brother who was in a wheel in a pallet and his friends brought him yeah and there was a press around jesus in the house and there was no way through the front door back door side oh and them guys walked with him for such a long distance had no maxi or taxi in those days and only donkey's in them was fully loaded so wherever they're coming from they walk with a friend they walk with their partner they didn't bring it to hear what teaching and doctrine jesus i don't know all they know the power is moving again just like their pentecost fire moving again speaking in tongues living again oh holy ghost fire holy ghost discernment you believe they're coming back deserve mental spirit word of knowledge oh glory to god the knowledge of god dropping down to give you what you have need of and speaking right into your life thus here the lord oh glory to god the word of knowledge the word of healing the gift of healing the gift of faith the gift of wisdom the gift of miracles every gift could be back in the church i have to preach this i have to declare this these are my promises oh glory to god hallelujah i do have to feel it i declare it i confess it i anointed i claim it i am walking in it mark 16 in action these signs shall follow them that believe oh i know no signs now and again i am talking about the lord himself went everywhere with them god made start here tonight oh glory to god hallelujah [Applause] [Applause] [Music] so some point in time you have to stop your complaining because complaining has weakened your faith you have to begin to live by faith live by it that means your life has to do with your thoughts and your words see what isaac preached on sunday going to be transformed by renew of your mind if your mind will change you're not changing your mind have to change first and when your mind change your words just change because you have to talk in line with your faith oh glory did you get that because he's the high priest of your confession he can't intercede until you confess what you've already done he said by his stripes you were healed you have to confess it's already done because it's faith and finished work it was already done have faith in god it's finished already when jesus died at calvary and the devil don't want you to see calvary when jesus died at calvary he paid the price for your redemption by his blood you are bloodborne you are blood washed or you are justified by his blood and when the prophet revealed justification he revealed as if you never did it in the first place your human finite mind can't grasp that it takes a divine revelation for you to understand that you are justified when you look back at your sin and your failures and your where you come from and what you do [Music] how that carnal mind could hold justification it has to be a revelation of god dropping on your soul in your spirit and when you understand that you are justified how could you condemn somebody else when you didn't work to get this justification oh glory to god that's why when you stand praying [Music] oh god don't get me started tonight hallelujah when you are justified it's not god justify not clean man you know it's after you justify you get sanctified god taking you up as you are just as you are god take you wretched nasty miserable oh god he take you up just as you are and he come and sprinkle the blood hey seven times sprinkle it upon you oh the blood of sanctification to make a way for the spirit of god he'd justify yours if you never did it it is god that justify it who is he that condemn it if god before us who can be against us that's why i don't listen to them people in the message talk all the negative nonsense take care they don't have a heaven they don't have a hell give god some praises tonight you are going to be delivered you are going to be sealed [Music] thank god we have no headquarters thank god i'd rather call our bishop and get permission to preach water preached tonight thank god this anointing coming from vertical not horizontal oh glory to god hallelujah thank god we have an ability to access oh glory to god a direct channel coming down vertical oh glory to god we do have to listen to some man here listen to some man here whatever god said we're going to speak have faith in god oh somebody going for it tonight somebody dropping the oh what's the night somebody going and forgive tonight you have to speak it you know i forgive this one i forgive that one i forget you gotta say it you know don't forgive them in your mind you know you have to speak about your mouth you gotta come on your mouth you know oh yes hallelujah i don't care if they get abused they get raped you get this i don't care what you went through what hell you went through that they gonna stop what god put inside of you i don't care everyone's a prostitute you have to forgive yourself too are you kidding me the drunkard you're piping coke you're scraping dope you're smoking drinking it doesn't matter he justified the ungodly well nobody gonna hang me for that one you wanna kill me for that boy oh god now we're getting wood [Applause] glory glory hallelujah [Music] hallelujah my my mind glory to god hallelujah hallelujah are you reading nowhere who were tied justified who wear long dressy tractors who never pressed they hear you justify that message thing they feel everywhere with long justice bright is that right everybody looking like christian is bright that that period looks like christianity sorry you could make a a rainbow colored dress there's nothing outside you know that rainbow to come inside you know and the only effort that will come inside whenever you come inside the devil have to see it [Music] you can't bluff it the devil understand bluffs when he get kicked out he know what butch is you know he gets he got boots already you know so he understand and recognize when your boots on he know he get that already you know so he could get it again when he recognized you know how that boost is a different thing altogether so down by that demon say paul i know pizza i know it wasn't a man saying that you know it was the spirit seeing in there no god no you were ceased anyway the bible said you shall know as you are known [Applause] let me say it again the bible says you shall know as you are known god know you a certain way you know and the way god knows you you don't know yourself yet but he said at that day you shall oh give the lord a shout you shall know [Music] so there's something you don't know yet but you have a promise that you're going to know it at that day oh glory to god so peter was speaking by the revelation of his fate when he said silver and gold have i none such as i have i give it was a revelation of the faith that was resident in him [Applause] and that is the faith that god sent a prophetess in our hearts back to not this church joining message thing not that that's why there's going to be a unity of debate not the message defeat not groups desert [Music] and faith is based on forgiveness and forgiveness is the blood of the age [Applause] you have to have that blood here we go displayed [Music] [Applause] not a secret go tell them take alarm kill the lamb and take the blood if you have all the blood in the bucket day that's not the only instruction god given it wasn't take the blood have a bucket of blood you have to put the blood a certain place you have to apply it not talk about it not fellowship about it not discuss it not send emails about it and what's up force about it he said apply it that means this gospel that we got have things to apply to your heart to your life to your spirit o hallelujah the spirit of forgiveness the wife do this your marriage broken this situation your son your daughter whatever god always allows stuff and the test is not them and when you see you're blaming them you have to get more mature than that is this that is why and and that is why and that is why i'm explaining all what is why because you don't want to deal with you you don't want to face up to the mirror of your behavior of your attitude of your arrogance of your pride because you see forgiveness that humble you especially when you are right and they are wrong and you have to forgive them and you know they're wrong and you are right but you still have to forgive them amen no i know they say amen i don't know how deep that a man going back kangaroo but that's a powerful one [Applause] when you know that they're wrong and you have to take wrong and you have to forgive them and drop basically forgive them not talk forgive i mean drop it i mean anything to the spirit of forgiveness then make it hook them up and love them up and take them and eat dinner with them and bread with them right now you don't want to shake their hand you didn't want to talk to them you can't stand them if they walk in so you turn your head so because of something upset in your spirit we talk about when you drop it when you get free from that nothing affecting your spirit you're free when i say you're free you're free you're free to hug them they go feel a hole you know because they know that their things dear but you overcome that and you have to give your testimony i love you brother appreciate your brother god bless your brother oh glory to god i thank god if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us but if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us of all unrighteousness oh glory to god if we say we walk into the light and we hate our brother we lie and do not the truth oh glory to god hallelujah oh glory to god praise god praise god yes yes yes yes yes oh give the lord some praises tonight this on first john 1 that which we have seen and heard declare be unto you that ye or samantha fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father with his son then this is the message which we have heard of him and declaring to you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all so god not any darkness thing god is light in him no darkness at all okay if we see we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do another truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light [Music] then we have no fellowship with one another that's not description so evidence of your walking in the light you have to have fellowship [Music] one with another celebration will pull away their self from the faith they don't want the fellowship the induction because if you're walking in the light let me read it again let me back up a little bit this is good god is light in him no darkness if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie then he come down if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus cleanses us from all sin because the fellowship identified that the blood for you is the blood for me if i know one blood for you and no blood for me the same blood that forgive you forgive me too and if god put the blood on me i could put the blood on you too with the blood of jesus cleanse us [Applause] oh the cleansing stream i see i see i plunge i know it cleanses me hallelujah oh glory to god do you see it tonight the blood for you is the same blood for your brother so don't condemn your brother don't neg your brother your charity believe it all things hope in all things you don't hope you better fall you don't hope he fails you hope we make it your hope he comes true you believe in all things for him you're hoping all things for him oh glory to god you're expecting the best for him because that's your brother anyhow oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah one of the big testimonies considering william branham's life was that you couldn't tell his enemies from his friends think about isaac was preaching and he's talking about when jesus told judas whatever that would just do quickly these are the disciples thought he was going to buy something for jesus or something he won an errand they had no clue that he going to get his his 30 pieces of silver they didn't don't he don't negotiate already and looking to go and collect because his mind was made up to betray christ but christ didn't expose him there was one among you are you watching them soon affects i call him one earlier no christ called judas too he was elected to be among them he was anointed only thing judas didn't make it was your purulena but he was partaking of the ministry and said his ministry was not inferior to the rest [Music] i want to say that again jewish ministry was not yay give him some praises people glory hallelujah just give him some worship praise the lord wow [Applause] i share this scripture with my wife scriptures i blew my mind from deuteronomy chapter 16 it says this here if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee a sign or a wonder and the sign or the wonder come to pass whereof he speak unto thee saying so so if you give a sign i wonder and it come to pass then afterwards saying let us go after other gods which thou has not known and let us save

let him serve oh glory to god as i wash what your feet so you must wash one another's feet what he's showing the right behavior the humility and that's why he said the first sign of the holy ghost is humility because the curse since up there in heaven was pride oh give the lord a shout that is what enter lucifer had pride when you don't want to humble yourself glory to god why you think god drive them through the wilderness to humble them and to prove them in the wilderness no shortcuts hallelujah he didn't want him to go back to egypt so he sent them along the long way to see what's in their heart oh glory to god and god sent this message for 50 years to see what the people have often noticed and backsided up to now they're walking on the message oh they know they say they can't believe this and they can't believe that hypocrites and liars in the message for years hiding on the deal but god gave them time to expose them all kind of people long in a message walking all the message they can't believe this and they can't believe this i love this contradiction and that they have no contradiction god send behold i send you elijah the prophet no we look god no rapture coming with all them demons sitting inside of there god had to flush them out oh glory to god hallelujah praise god we gonna have a revival i could feel it brother george i could sense it hallelujah the holy

wonder jesus us upon this rock i'll build my church kids of healthcare prevail against them [Applause] gloria glory hallelujah glory glory to god [Applause] [Music] [Applause] before the holy ghost fell that was to get somebody to replace judas because it had to be 12. they had to get my tires but before the holy ghost fell that they got a man to praise judas they get my tires have no book of my tires go to his pole but i had to set things up in a certain way for dynamics to fall the church has to be set in order church can continue all this nonsense and all this hate and all these things are people messing with hate wisdom a demon of hate standing behind ministers and they swings hate in the people they're showing hate in the to the church by bad talking other churches and other ministers sealing them down with hate they don't understand that go backfire on them because with that anointing in them they can't have the faith to prolong love they don't understand that they think having a church on their side here their soul and that one soul and that one so that's this information but they don't know what they're messing with the people's faith and you see why that's why i didn't go that route [Applause] i want your heart to be pure because i want faith active that's why we didn't go to the root of legalism because legalism can't put long love yes [Applause] oh glory to god beating people up can't prolong love it has to be a faith that wicked by love of faith with the love of god or wrong into faith that based upon forgiveness a free fate god whether god bless you or not you still love him if you send her to hell you still love him oh god whenever you restore your husband or not you still love him whether this walker don't know that you still love him some to the monk some to the water some through the flood some to great child but all through the blood [Music] [Applause] and if you go through suffering so what i reckon that the present suffering of the is not present it's not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall reveal 70 years that three is content that's so short [Music] i get baptized you're 17. and right now i see something from a normal normal number you think i was looking for that people living here for a long long while on the front of the van hold on that's all no longer living always said me oh what why are you you know long in here hallelujah god get three score and turn left by adventure what extend your years you bless god but is that short time you know oh my god my mother was so peaceful i was so happy for his one feeling so happy for oh my lord oh my god you know where's the crossover and leave back the old trouble in this world oh my god you know what i'll leave back a raspberry perfection a bride to come to perfection with a judge not just come to church when you come to perfection we have to get that in our thinking you know you have to come to perfection and there's only one way to perfection is by his perfection not the message perfection his perfection and that perfection only come by spirit before the word there was spirit all glory the god elohim was spirit seven perfect spirit and that spirit condensed into logos word and logos words spoke let there be let there be like to be let there be lucifer let there be angels let there be them wasn't before you know they may know that because was created he was created so perfect a musician he knows music he wasn't really quiet you know he was in charge of running things in heaven he gets so powerful and caught up in his anointing and all his feathers and his wings and swept back wings and all them kind of things and he anointed upon him he's had a whisper and started a whisper kind of on the hand kind of thing to see if he could get him in your other side with him hallelujah i will be like the most high how i say to himself i will do this he was the i man the original iman original ayah man he convinced two of the angels which is still they were heavily angels you know when they get kicked out they become demons they become fallen they fall into darkness because he was like an angel of light so he fall under darkness and he drop on the earth now oh glory to god and the brotherhood said the battle revenge will become the battle of men so these supernatural spirits drop down on the earth and battling the elect of god since that time so god had to hit the mystery of the restoration by putting a man with abraham who stood with faith for 25 years and challenge the devil's kingdom without the devil even knowing it because he was standing with faith as a rock abraham faith isaac love jacob grace during perfection god was doing a work right under the nose of the devil because you're reflecting on what we've done in you [Applause] do you get that back for us to go back to eden we have to go back into the image and likeness of god because when god finished the earth he said let us make man he has seen nobody like him and that monkey that beard had wailed at that session of everything else but nothing like him and how he operates business upon two nothing like him close but not like him then god will let us make man in our image in our likeness and let that man have dominion and god put a spirit man there but he needed a dust man to deal with the earth because he put man to rule the earth so he put man in five senses with sixth sense five six cents every evening adam using six cents to talk with god adam didn't even know he was naked every evening adam could commune with his father sixth sense a higher phone line a wireless connection a earthly man having an access line to a heavenly realm of the spirit and what do you think about that right now just think flesh man just like you and i having direct access to a heavenly place and a spirit being roaming the earth with other angels for names lucifer looking at an opportunity how to get in he can't mess with adam he's had a fool with eve eve is by product so he talked with eve and he fell adam fell and i saw satan gain access to rain on the earth that's all sit and get access to become the prince of the power of the ear so he rule in the atmosphere oh glory to god that's how that's how them angels know how to battle demon powers to bring messages so when daniel was praying gabriel had to fight your set of demons from the day daniel started to pray he had been fighting fighting and brahms if he stopped praying he just stopped coming so your prayer operating angels we're going to wrap up and have every time i pray i'll do this exhortation tonight daniel prayer was pulling the angel hallelujah and the angels say when you're going back here the fight do you know he fights him to come and fight him to go back are they there angel fighting you tell me you don't want to fight you want a priest today i see somebody holding me to be crossed on the head after they jump up yesterday they're proud to have the big cross in the head i wonder if i started to give out crosses if people would put it on me but judge said but you're a priest catholic church have a big boom this this ash wednesday here ashes does it seem like the hindu have any dirt it's spiritual the same similar you know they have a dot one reason about dot one of a mark one have a color and all kind the spirit we don't need ashes we have the blood this blood that's continually cleanses as they continually confess as you continually repent the blood is there to deal with your issues continually that you could have a continual confidence oh glory to god and have true fellowship with the father you're i want to get you a little thing here he said now watch watch when a man lives by faith he was talking about me going all day and walked by faith i mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and become a new creature in christ dear you are now getting into bright material you're getting into a rapturing condition now that means for each one of us you are baptized into this kingdom and there is nobody in there but you and god he give the orders and you pack them out oh praise the name of the lord i'm going to wrap up with this i know i said this before it takes three elements justification sanification through the blood and babylon he goes this last great step must come into perfection that the holy spirit has to live in that church so perfectly it will make the head on body unite you know this he's not talking about messages preached he's talking about the holy spirit living in the church okay all right wow all right let's get something here he's talking about uh version six and they cry with a low voicing how long oh lord holy and true does thou judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white rooms were given unto every one of them it was said unto them that they should rest for a little season until their fellow servants also are of the brethren that they shall be killed as they will shall be fulfilled note particularly that none of these under the altar were killed for the testimony to jesus they were not like antipas who was slain for holding first his name these are not born again one with eternal life as their possession they come up in the resurrection and receive life because they stand on the word everybody i want to get you notice how these are crying out for vengeance they cannot be bride material the bride turns the cheek and cries further forgive them they know not what they do these are jews they have to be because they are in the fifth seal and this is the fourth seal of the gentile bride is going to rapture so these jews and of his spirit so brother over you mean when somebody is born of the spirit they can say father amen forgive them you mean is somebody not born of the spirit they can't say that that's right no they can't say that you mean somebody calling for vengeance that's not bright material you mean there is something called bright material and bright material when bright material stand praying by material will forget [Music] oh glory to god hallelujah praise the name of the lord hallelujah so when the spirit falls there will become a move among the people them denominations will swing together just as sitting as i'm standing in the pulpit and the church of god will be ousted and they will make a racket until they confederate put a boycott on anybody that don't belong to them but by that time the pride will be under the anointing of the restoration of the spirit of god upon the church the bride will be a super race a super church let's all stand and just praise them a little bit heavenly father we thank you tonight for your presence and this last notation tonight lord jesus lord may the people leave here with a desire in their heart to forgive drop every oath lord jesus no order against anyone just a freedom from their souls lord looking for their own personal deliverance and breakthrough and all the

unclean and filthy and ungodly and unrighteous spirits lord and lord get them to understand by revelation that they're not rattling against flesh and blood but again principalities and powers and
