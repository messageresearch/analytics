the most important day of the week there's no better way to start the week then come into the house of God to let God know whose side you're on and to let the devil know whose side you're on can the church say men though all hell is against you those sicknesses against you that doesn't matter because you know whose side you're on and the church say man oh it feels good it feels like we in revival I'm not just saying but you got to get into that you gotta say it before it happens you got to speak it before you see it you gotta walk in it in your heart before you walk in it spiritually oh

good to be back in the house of the Lord from where - nicholas god bless you better Nicholas welcome back welcome back waring amen and you know he said the operation is a success there's a bit of a rebound on the system he said the operation was a success because I believe they had to remove too I believe and I said you know but the Branum said missing limbs will be restored but the problem is there really aren't any volunteers nobody wants to volunteer but there's a promise that missing limbs will be restored so god have to have somebody as a testimony that when the power of this church rises there come a time we don't even have to lay hands on the sick but we speak and create the power that comes from God flows into the house of God and brother oh I'm looking for that deep I'm

brother Jabari Sammy well for pain fever and the cold and also for brother Marlon Alexander who was down with the flu and if there's any other requests you want to show a raise of hands this morning as we approach the throne of God amen can we pray Heavenly Father Lord we have stood behind the secret desk so many times and seen requests become notes of phrases we have seen so many times the elders lay hands on the sick and we have seen them recovered this is no surprise to us Lord it is what we have grown to accept it is it is our normal that you are a healer it is our reality that you are a present help in time of trouble it is our reality that you are a comforter you are our reward you our shield your buckler and Lord we go to different experiences Lord that push us to call upon you in a new and real way father and law we have these requests that have come Lord it's a burden under the Stevens heart for a student no doubt in pain and suffering but Lord me his feet and our feet

everyone you know their needs you know the situation's you know the conditions you know the desires you know the pains the problems our struggles our heartaches Lord may you minister to the heirs of salvation and lord as we approach your word may you bless the reading of the word and open our understanding to the scriptures may you take me out of the way and speak to us in a real way like you before we commit the service into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen you may be seated for a few minutes amen welcome to the house of the Lord this morning it's certainly great to be in the house of the Lord how many appreciate a message last week from our pastor what a masterpiece what an anointing our burden is busy appreciate your pastor a many many many many men four Watchmen in the tower a man with a burden to see lives change transform to see God do something real in your soul and for a burden for the upcoming convention we under great expectation for God to do something tremendous and I've been going through my own experience as it were in the word where and some time ago I said I want you to speak on on a topic on the way brother Branham lived because I found that message believers take what they want from the message and the Missis the way that brother Branham lived because it's the life behind the name that makes the demons tremble you could read you could talk you could know doctrine you could exegete the scriptures you could cut the Bible you could be able to put quotes together in such a sequence that it will take your head to another dimension but if there's no life behind that you're wasting time and but the branham's message was love it was it was loved I've reached out to the sinner it was love that went out to the loss it was love that would minister to the young people there was a burden to see lives change and transform them beloved send me some quotes this morning and I believe it probably came her brother kindly at first but I just want to touch in it and then say a few things to key in before I get to the message this morning from the message to you and welcome Christ but the Branham was seeing now some time ago I tell you what you know what my theology is and where Branham says his theology is redeeming love that's his theology and that's my theology this morning redeeming love he said when you got love one for another see no matter what these other things are how many gifts we got how much this we got or how much that if we haven't got love one for another we are lost now that's an absolute statement there's no room for interpretation there's no room for you to get your own perspective on what that statement means doesn't matter who you are the Prophet said if we haven't got love one for another we are lost that's all and as if the sentence before ended with we are lost he confirmed the gravity of the statement by saying that's all in other words end all the other arguments if you don't have love you're missing the whole picture now where the random goes on to make clear what he's referring to he says I went to a fellow now brethren I'm using Church names here this morning I don't mean harm by it but I went to a fella that belong to the Assemblies of God he didn't know me it's been years ago I walked up to him and I said howdy-do sir he said howdy-do I said I understand you're a preacher he said I am and just before the a great man in the Assemblies of God he wanted me to join the Assemblies of God he said come join because we had a biggest Pentecostal organization in the world I said that may be so my brother but I like to stand between all of you and say we are brothers see I said I may be way off the road on some of mine you may be true but let's be brothers anyhow see let's be brothers and he said oh he said all right we got the church so I just happened to investigate I went up to a fellow I just taken the negative side on both sides to test out so brother Branham is testing I went up to her brother this brother I said hey I'm here you belong to the Assemblies of God a minister he said I am he said what are you I said I'm a Baptist and he said well have you received the Holy Ghost I said yes I said I received the Holy Ghost he said you speak in tongues I said yeah yeah he spoke in tongues he said brother you have caught it hallelujah praise the Lord that's it and I said well yeah I said I received the Holy Ghost and spoke in tongues and for the evidence a bit and I said he said or you'll come out of that old stiff formal Baptist Church then hallelujah and he spoke in tongues a few times I said yeah I received the Holy Ghost was baptized in Jesus Christ's name he said you what I said I received the Holy Ghost and I was baptized Jesus Christ name he said you don't get the Holy Ghost like that I said you told me a little too late' I've done done it he said I just just done done that he said oh you can't get that like jacked he said you believe that kind of heresy see I said I wouldn't call it heresy I said it teaches it in the Bible he said get out of my house I don't want nothing to do with you I said okay the Lord be with you brother and walked out when I ran and went on he said not long ago an old Baptist preacher out there that was my first trip to Phoenix Curtis I went to see this old boy walked into him and I said how do you do sir he said how do you do he said I heard you're a Baptist preacher way back over there at the time when that little old boy back there in that place was healed without long troubled black where that cubicle of places back there forgot a name of the place and so I just said I hear you're Baptist picture he said yeah I said have you received the Holy Ghost he said well what are you Pentecost I said yeah I'm Pentecost I was a Baptist to the other one but I was a Pentecostal this one I said yeah I said I'm Pentecost I said you got the Holy Ghost every time speaking in tongues he said uh-huh he said well he said I tell you brother he said that's all right he said but you know I never did just somehow I just never could see it just like that he said and I said oh you haven't got nothing then that's all there is to it you ain't got a thing less you do that's all he walked over to me took a whole of my hand looked me right in the eye and put his arm around me said but we are brothers aren't we we are going to heaven aren't we brother and I said yes and brother happened to be I'm on your side now I said that man proved listen listen to the Prophet that man proved by that that he did have the Holy Ghost and the other proved he didn't have the Holy Ghost that's right see exactly that man had theology but as soon as I told him something to cross up his theology then he flew to pieces because he didn't have nothing else but theology I crossed this other man's theology and he said cries and he had Christ to hold him there oh my cam the church say Amen so this Court fits him perfectly because I was sharing with brother Ovid you know if if you get an invitation onto something and what I love about the Prophet but a man went everywhere because he believed in Brotherhood he believed in fellowship he believed in communion it's impossible if my brother Gideon and I don't see eye to eye so we should stop being brothers that cannot be right because we don't see this court the same way does it mean he's not my brother all of a sudden I can visit him he can visit me does is just is that Christianity is that what this message came for that because the scripture came and he looked at it one way and I was like no I didn't mean that maybe call didn't show me yet maybe God didn't show him yet but we are still brothers so I'm under great expectation because but the Branham said one day the rain will fall and the water level will rise and the ducks that have been kept apart will begin to swim together and I believe that something is about to happen now brother Branham preached many things he said but there's some real sees with a bride now remember the Branham cut down to dealing with the Branham tabernacle and bringing the message he preached a powerful message called the token and in that message he preached at the evening time message the whole message to be wrapped up into one message the evening time message is to apply the token so I'm calling for Trinidad this morning let everybody know that there is one theme of this message and there's one inspiration for our upcoming convention it has nothing to do with how you process your scripture or your quote God's prophet to which we identified stood and declare the evening time message is to apply the token he sent up tie it on your house apply it in your life you may be seated but the random said he said and he called out to the Branham tabernacle he said all your believing is in vain if you don't have the token all your common is in vain if you don't have to token this token is the most important thing to get make sure on your resume that your years of service is trumped by the token how many books you read has to be trumped by the token because God isn't interested in the books you read he's interested in when I see the Blood I will pass over you can the church cement hallelujah so I'm seeing all of that to say that this upcoming convention all are welcome all are welcome doesn't matter your doctrine your belief if you believe that we are going to the rapture you are welcome if you believe that Jesus died to save and redeem and restore and restore Church then you are welcome if you believe God sent a prophet to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers you are welcome if you believe it's going to be a revival then you are welcome if you believe that young people are going to be delivered then you are welcome if you believe that God promised that the sick will be healed then you are welcome if you believe in the old-fashioned sim killing I blew Holocaust survivor then you are welcome if you believe it lift in your hands if you believe in keeping your hands swinging you are also welcome but whatever you do do something and apply the token apply it in your house apply it over your family because when I see the blood I'll pass over you hallelujah hallelujah let's say be the name of Lord feels good in here this morning oh it's your fashion gospel if it was good for Paul and Silas then he was good enough for me if it was good for brother branham it's good enough for me if it was good for Luther it's good enough for me if it was good for Wesley it's good enough for me everyone's good for brother Coleman it's good enough for me I don't care who it is if it's good for them it's good for me because it's the same car it's the same power it is good for the pastor it's good for me oh god help me oh he could still take the prostitute and give her the Holy Ghost he can still take the drunkard oh come on now come on now oh I see the chains breakin it's the same blood I'm not better than nobody you may be seated in fact I want to apply to be the worst I don't want any better than nobody I want to be last place because in your last place it means the grease I want us to reach down there because His grace is not too short so if I can make it then anybody can make it oh come on somebody help somebody help me this mornin what sin you talking about he is telling the same cleansing business they're still blood blood for your home blood for your family blood for your situation Oh somebody say Amen so catch a burden friends it really starts with a burden and before you could put on the oxygen mask they see on somebody else in an airplane if you've ever been on a plane or seen the demonstration of the safety rules they show you the exits they show you how to put on your seatbelt they show you how to pack your bags because nobody expects a problem and sometimes many people sit down and maybe they overlook the warnings they overlook the training but invariably there are times when stuff happens that you did not expect and that's where the training comes in but you always tell you if the gas masks fall make sure and put it on yourself first before you put it on anybody else it's alright to try to help people and many times our efforts to help people is covering up a deeper problem that we actually have because many of us we don't want to confront our own issues I just we don't want to confront our own promise and it's easy to say well brother you need to fix that tie because that's not how we wear it up in here and it's easy to spend time because the more energy you spend focus on other people it takes away your focus on yourself but after the display of the criticism and the observation and and the casual conversation about the issues when you go back home and look in the mirror you still have to confront the reality of who you are and if you look in the mirror and you don't see Jesus looking back at you then you need to go deeper on the inside because our Commission is when we look at in a mirror Jesus should be looking back at us because we ought to be a reflection of his majesty a reflection of his glory a reflection of His Holiness a reflection of his decency a reflection of his life friends I am under expectation because I was human beloved I was speaking to someone and his feeling about the spiritual realm and and we preach it but he said it in such a powerful way he said when man was given Dominion this was the jurisdiction of man and because it's man's jurisdiction whatever happens here is actually authorized by man so Jesus says I stand at the door and knock If any man open then I'll come in now if you don't open he can't move if you can't oh if you don't open he cannot act I want you to get this he is limited by your access so the brothers said to me said prayer is unlocking the access to God to be able to operate and I loved it you say when you begin to pray and if we get to talk to God he's had to open the windows and open the doors and you give God permission to come into your situation Oh somebody help me this morning no wonder Jesus had to pray because as a man on this earth he had to give the access forgot to operate in this realm because this belongs to us he has no hands but your hands he has the eyes with your eyes and the same way that in the spiritual realm prayer unlocks the ability of God operate is the same way the opposite of that any activity or action that is contrary to opening for God is witchcraft and you allow darkness into your life Jack this into your house I was speaking to my wife this morning and I said you know it's real but the Branham for witches 99% of the message they want to hear about this but we can't have to fight witches because there's spiritual warfare people want to think it's business as usual but as we near the headstone and the anointing rises it'll bring all kinds of spirits not only that when the power comes it'll open and uncover everything that's happening in here so be careful in this season because the season is changing because this this is the blood season is a token season and you better be in the act of safety and the AK is not Church the act is Jesus Christ [Applause] and the church seamen are you ready for the word this morning you love the Lord this morning are you on the expectation but what go to loo now next Sunday is our last Sunday before the convention we will just have one service next one the Lord willing so we encourage you make every effort to come out as is the last Sunday service there will be no midweek services next week it'll just be the convention remember friends it's seven services and seven is God's number for completion seven services that's how he has lead it on the heart of the pastor and I believe it's critical for you to make them all make every effort for God to really do something in your life you know I was hearing a number of testimonies over the last few days and many times I realized that it's easy for us to be ungrateful because many times we don't see because we don't see the spirit realm we don't understand what's happening how many times you could have gotten in an accident and an angel was there protecting you but because you didn't see it you thinking it's your own driving ability and you just happen to and you have no idea sometimes you you you you leave earlier you leave later and you don't know God did detained you because something was happening that he didn't want you involved with and behind around daniel is praying and write down his bring the angel of fighting he doesn't know what's going on in the spirit realm but he is just praying and you have no idea right now the activity that's around this tabernacle of angels that I'm fighting because there's a prize in your heart there's a seed in your soul that there angels are seen to protect you because I've seen us got to come to pass that scene as a destination for the Holy Ghost young brother young sister and every obstacle every activity every action that is fighting your destiny is demonic you have to name it as it is whether it's friends whether its family whether it's work commitments whatever it is if it is not bringing you closer to the kingdom of God it's taking you from the kingdom we need to name it can the church say man everybody feeling fine how many only expectations for God to deliver their families how many on expectation to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost on fire [Applause] [Music] now friends I want to challenge you this morning you know there's a statement you could bring the horse to the water but you cannot make the horse drink I don't believe in forcing anybody they have places that for that but God is love it has to be in your heart that you want to change it cannot be because of your parents it cannot even me because of the past it has to be because of your relationship with God that you want to be a real Christian and a better Christian because if you are not becoming a better Christian than you are backsliding there's only two movements this backslide or moving forward because standing stationary is not an option that doesn't exist every service you come to you either moving follow you moving backward so I pray this morning we can move forward where we have never gone before because that's where we need to go can I say ma'am so shall we stand as we approach the scripture there just sing one song before we read the scripture Jehovah Jireh my provider [Music] without any one is safe yes whoa [Music] oh my I our strides I am set free Jehovah [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank yous issues shall we turn to Joelle chapter two cinmarc eat and Romans chapter one Joelle to st. mark eat and Romans chapter one Joelle - and verse 23 be glad then he Turan of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he have given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the for marine and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer were my great army which I sent among you and he shall eat and plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that had dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and he shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the hand maids and those days will I pour out my spirit and readin st. mark 8 and verse 34 cinmarc 8 and verse 34 and when he called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me deny himself take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the Gospels the same shall save it for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the Holy Angels and our last scripture one verse reading Romans 1 and verse 16 for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek middle Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated so for a title this morning I want to take it from that scripture I be read in Joel and whenever the Bible repeats a statement its emphasis so we see in Joel 2 verse 26 and he shall eat and plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that he'll dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and then it goes on and he shall know that I'm in the midst of Israel and I'm the Lord your God and an else and my people shall never be ashamed so for a title this morning my people shall never be ashamed and as a subject the unfolding of the bride and an inspiration the mystery of who you can the church say Amen and this inspiration of my people shall never be ashamed started for me when I was look the message to token and I was realizing that the token has to be applied before it could be displayed because whether Branham said the token must be on display so it cannot be hidden something it must be a public something and then I was looking nana say I was looking at the young people and the situations and the problem and a challenge and it really bothers me it really troubles me when I see young people come to church and similarly all the ones and you see a certain pattern of behavior and for all intents and purposes they all look as Christians act as Christians and I mean we do have the Prophet telling us there are three kinds of believers so there's a certain perspective there but then there's something that happens in the daily lives that creates somewhat of a disconnect between the behavior on a Sunday and the behavior on a Tuesday morning or Wednesday evening or Friday morning we have young people who dress as Christians on a Sunday but in the middle of the week they don't look like they're Christians we have husbands that speak to their wives a certain way in a Sunday but in the middle of their week they don't sound like Christians we have wives who honor their husbands in a Sunday but in the middle of the week they don't act like they should and I'm wondering what causes this why this behavior I'm wondering what insanity will get ahold of someone's mind that the God are provided for you to eat you are ashamed to bless the food in your workplace I'm wondering why our young sisters are ashamed to wear their dresses long and they allow words like peer pressure the foolishness of this world to deter them from having a testimony and I'm and I'm thinking back to my own childhood and I share this in the youth meeting in Ghana not growing up there was no television in the house and I remember going to school I believe was like form one form to I actually felt bad that I didn't have a TV and because my mind works a certain way and I learn a certain way and I could remember things that way I I don't even think I told my dad this so it's a confession this morning in school the young people would come and they would talk about the short night before but I had no idea what they were talking about so in my own simple way for the first few days I listened and listened until I learned all the characters I knew who Bobby was who Jenny was what tom was so by the 7 8 D I'm in the conversation as if I had seen it and I'm be able to put together and what you heard what Johnny said Johnny is a mean character he had to be in it I don't know what Johnny said and then somebody would see what and tell you Johnny something else and you would never think that I didn't see the show because I was ashamed that I didn't have a TV because growing up in the message until you get a revelation and an experience it's just rules and knowledge and words and talk because it hasn't registered it hasn't dropped from an intellectual consciousness to the heart experience that compels you to act and behave a certain way somebody preached back to me but there's still something holding you there's still something pulling you but is what psychologists call a cognitive dissonance the gap between your reality and what is really true so shame is a real thing it's a real thing but then the Bible speaks and absolute tells we spoke of what the Prophet said before there's no love you don't have nothing that's all it's an absolute statement but then the Bible tells me this morning that my people shall never be ashamed that's an absolute term so there will come a point in your Christian walk where there's no shame with how you dress there's no shame with how you worship there's no shame with how you praise us no shame when you have to say I believe the Prophet I believe this message I don't have to be ashamed to say it you can make me feel funny because something has happened on the inside and now my people shall never be ashamed as a young lady I can let my hair grow out you may be seated under here dresser tells you that you need to cut the ends way to grow out you don't need to be ashamed to say listen I don't want it because I'm not ashamed of this gospel I'm not ashamed that this son of man or his words he may be seated we have young people struggling with an identity crisis and identity crisis it has you up trying on makeup even if you don't make it out of the house with it you still try it on to see how you would look it troubles me you know Facebook Instagram these things have all these it's it's it's too much but demons all these filters young people no whatsoever all our nose then you're in trouble but these filters that make you look like you have on makeup I said why would a Christian by a bubble even message believing Christian use a filter that makes you look like you have makeup makes you look like you cut your hair because whatever you feel into becomes your life and your actions don't only affect you it affects anybody else who's watching bigger but the grand said there's somebody watching you but going forward it has to be I am not ashamed of the son of man nor of his words of every word it becomes your words because when his words become your words and you are fully identified just as when you were identified with the lamb that the sacrifice it was it was you should have been dead but the lamb took your place do you have to identify with the sacrifice it should have been you there the slimiest identify with this word and deny yourself deny your family didn't and your family should be easy because in an yourself is the hardest let me say that again denying your friend should be easy because in an yourself is the hardest thing to deny your perception of things how how things are posed to be that's for you I'm going to break that deny yourself not for me not for the pasta not for the message was for Christ that's the Bible can we have change this morning my people shall never be ashamed and the message of she me I want to touch I want to take my time a little bit today there is a Lord's D behold a cool lazy Lord's Day get comfortable and why I I posted on Facebook this morning friends when the Prophet said watch Russia he wasn't talking about he woke up people have such temporary attention spans in church but every game they can tell every minute the hour but I see it telling minute the hour when you will receive the Holy Ghost people are the middle of the hour of every score every move because that's how the world has been created as a whole so it's spirits behind it you know so I remember drove it in the officer said listen it's not the people it's the people are never the problem it's a spirits because when you open your door to the spirits in until that's where this passed out and the Prophet with love would look beyond the man look being under woman and see the spirit upon them and have compassion for them that's why the word goes forth to bring liberty in your soul that a spirit that are operating could be exposed because we wanted everliving expose he can't operate anymore so the word comes from the sacred desk to expose every unclean spirit every unclean thoughts every unclean desire and that's why when the word goes forth and power fire come behind it then if you will go free it may not be obviously visible but demons in this program have to let you go because the word is powerful Jesus use just the word and he beat the devil it is written it is written it is also written and this morning but the words of the Prophet it is written it is written it is also written you shall be delivered you shall these hill you shall be set free [Applause] [Music] you may be seated and the Prophet tied my people shall never be ashamed to restoration so the story goes pouring out heat add it all in at one powerful scripture of ivory sauce here the Lord and my people shall never be ashamed oh you'll not be ashamed of what you lost but among us doesn't have to feel ashamed because those limbs that talk got to come back and my people shall never be ashamed oh come on somebody please back to me not ashamed of your poor head because you're gonna get young again my people shall never be ashamed oh come on somebody please black

Savannah I'll sing about His goodness I wanna walk down magic street and testify but he's a semi yesterday he's a shame today he sustained forever I will never be ashamed Oh somebody please back to me I can never repay him for what he did for me how could I be ashamed I could never repay him by his love and mercy how could I be a shame oh come on come on oh my you may be seated when you were in sin he wasn't even ashamed of you he still claim you as his all and he left eternity he left glory he was not ashamed of you oh come on house of God come on sons of God come on daughters of God oh my my oh my you may be seated hallelujah my people shall never be ashamed Samson is feeling bad he lost he anointed he lost his strength he is feeling ashamed but in glory in glory God has ever seen God went past his shame and reach down to Samson it was that Samson become heir apparent tortoise that you are not even a believer but the word is the believer you didn't even put the word there he placed it there before you even have thought before you even a joke that see how can God be ashamed of his own seed it's impossible you belong to God don't let any devil demon spirit tell you otherwise that see this glad to comfort [Applause] the devil's got it twisted this morning you may be seated and the more dirty trolls on you the more filthy trolls on you he doesn't understand the certain fundamental principles that the devil has missed the more manual he throws at us is the greater the environment for the CETA come to life all your pass your mistakes your failures your struggles all when the devil brings up your past try a trade that's me alright because I'm God's book here's nothing against you and God allows all of it to be the manure superior environment to that see to come to life and my people [Applause] cha-cha-cha-cha never be ashamed never be ashamed never be ashamed every trial you went through God sent it to you [Music] how can I be ashamed of the journey he took me through how could I be ashamed of the journey he walked you through it was his Divine Plan he said the steps of the righteous are ordered by God I have no choice it was his I and my people shall never be ashamed Oh hallelujah you may be seated for a minute II right on your total might be in trouble but mama my people will never be ashamed you need to be ashamed of them don't be ashamed of them their name is written there's blood for them don't be ashamed when you messed up he was machined of you don't be ashamed of them don't let nobody make you feel ashamed apply the blood plead the blood and forget about it it's gonna happen they are gonna be real ever when I see the blood I'll pass over you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] maybe see them [Music] [Applause] [Music] listen go except for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are my waves of yours for the heavens are higher than the earth so are my thoughts above your thoughts you the fundamental difference between the ways of man and the ways of God is this man judges you by your resume and your resume is only a declaration of your past your resume speaks of your past achievements your past accomplishments what exams you wrote what you did before but how in the world could somebody be able to understand your future from your past in God's economy your past is irrelevant that's how we could use Paul [Applause] Paul's resume would not have made the discipleship list Rahab the prostitute her as you may god had to turn it over for him to use her Oh God David the adulterer gotta turn it over you don't hear me you don't hear me this morning you don't hear me this morning but when you read the book of Hebrews like meet Noah like I shop God resumes God's document is written by fate [Applause] [Music] you may be seated [Music] [Music] the devil is limited in the ingredients that he could use because he only has access to your past [Applause] I'll say it again the devil is limited by the ingredients he has to work with when he gets up in the morning to try to figure you out he could only rely on your past he has no idea about your future and that's why he could never win because he holds your future or you know hear me this morning that's why your daughter has got to come your son has got to come because the devil could only talk about their past but God he sneaks up destiny he speaks of pre-tests and my people shall never be ashamed this is the gospel friends the gospel is the good news the good news set you free from your past and to walk in the trust of uncertainty because if God tells you every step will be then there's no need to trust him so there's a trust of uncertainty because the boat will get shaky but it's for a purpose I heard a preacher speaking about many time you made me see that I'm taking my time take off speaking about Jesus is walking underwater and many time we talk about Peter come out to walk in the water but I never saw it quite that way about stepping out the boat we talk about Peter walking on the water and he stumbles and he's a man of feet but stepping all the boards are the easy thing in him no no but I'm thinking if I was there and I was a Peter Peter Peter Peter get Peter : : : stepping out the boat it's not an easy thing but the brand I preached a message called the oddball because that was Peters example of being an oddball nobody else left on the board except Peter and and all of this just pushing me because I have a burden especially for the young people because I have a higher expectation of the Caleb's please don't disappoint me but my heart bleeds for the young people not just for their going through but I look at my own life experience and what I went through and I said to my dad and i'ma go so many things we here are easier said than done brig free step out clean myth walk on land walk in the land wherever you put your foot is yours and it sounds wonderful and it feels exciting it sounds good and then when Tuesday comes and you see the solanum on I am very comfortable with this piece right here this piece called the comfort zone I'm very comfortable but to step out the boot or to take more land to witness somebody to take more land to reach out to somebody to take more land to call somebody and say you're gonna make it to take more land to enter into someone's suffering to take more land and try to understand the troubles that lead to songs like nobody knows the troubles I see so to enter into the suffering that someone may be going through that is different from yours no wonder the Bible says confess your faults one to another because it levels this playing field of the struggle and the pain and what we're going through because it brings this unity of we are in this thing together to make it my mind is blown I was sharing a few days ago with some friends at how Jesus was so much and I could use this term carefully one of the boys that it took Judas to identify him he walked no different on the disciples he was regular but yet received some people said they look so so holy immune the Brees broilers there and this is it's it's encouraging to see people who are solid but Jesus wept at the grave of Lazarus because as a brother or as a sister we will all have our up-and-down moment and it's okay to tell Jesus it's okay to tell somebody it's okay to say I need prayer my people shall never be ashamed so there should be no shame in saying pray for me there are people when we call an altar quality regime to come because they don't want anybody to know that they really need prayer I'll tell you I need prayer my people shall never be ashamed I pray this will help somebody today and number the bottom goes on and this young people I really want you to be careful with this now but the banner said whosoever is ashamed of me and my word I'll be ashamed of him so in the midst of your sin and your feeling is when you don't know he could be he could have no shame about you because you belong to him he died for you but now you committed his glorious gospel and you want to be ashamed to have a testimony a shame to sing imagine that people do want to sing in church well give me expurgated say outside i remember and i could relate to my one i'm just gonna give my testimony because many of you are better than me but I was young I remember as young and parents have this way they tell their kids do something you know and they have all confidence in memorize young way that was like speak Spanish or a single song and and yep I mean you're small young man you like what so we had a family gathering with the obits Saturday family many many years ago maybe seven eight years old and I think my dad was doing a little gathering and he's like let's sing this song and I'm there looking at my other little cousins and nobody else singing at my dad's like sing with me because he's like the only one sitting and I'm like there quietly and I think back to what happens in your job and the workplace in your family because friends what's happening in here is not the test this is not the test the test is when you are alone when there's no D Colonel Eleanor parson or sister and pasta what is your testimony when nobody else is watching you that's when you ought to be testifying through your life of His goodness somebody say Amen so let me skip a few things I want to strike a point here glory in a message of shame but their banner said Jesus said now if you are looking for my watch I gave my watch everybody jesus said now if you're ashamed of me then I'll be ashamed of you why would he be ashamed of you because you are claiming to be his when you won't follow him and that's the way that's so-called Christianity today if you name it a name of a denomination alright they accept the Fatherhood of a denomination but when it comes to accepting the Fatherhood of the Word of God Christ no they're embarrassed they don't want to say yes I've spoken tongues yes I've seen visions yes I believe in divine healing yes I praise the Lord yes I'm free from all organization I'm not going to any of that I'm a servant of Christ oh my that just tear them to pieces but it's a reality to a man or woman boy or girl who really is a genuine Christian when God made the promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you receive it there's something that settles within you that there is nothing takes its place when a man ever meets God not in some emotional work up some enthusiasm or some religious doctrine some catechism or creed or dogma that he is accepted for a comfort for himself that's a prophet but when he really comes to the place like Moses did on the backside of the desert woke up face to face with Almighty God and you see the voice speaking to you exactly with the word and the promise of the hour there's something it does to you see you're not ashamed of it it does something to you can the church say man and by the madam give some examples that there was a man a very scientific age by the name of Noah he was mishima of course would gordon met him and he talked to him he knowed it was God he said it is gonna rain it never had rain but he believed there was going to rain and the fee that he had he wasn't ashamed to exercise it it took him a 120 years to build an ark when the world was against him he wasn't ashamed of God's would in his day God saved him and his household four-hit how foolish it might have seemed to other people but to him he meant God no matter how scientific the other was that was contrary it couldn't happen it couldn't happen he had met God and that's what it is when you know you're talking to him you were thinking was a foolish thing when somebody and by the Balan goes on he said well Nora wasn't ashamed it seemed foolish to the rest of the world but not to him Moses when he was before hero he was ashamed to tell Pharaoh that these certain things would happen because he had met God and by the Branham cause sure a number of examples of Elijah how he was not ashamed he talks about Daniel how Daniel was a prayer a prayer warrior and they put a law that that you shouldn't bring I wanted to put a law too dear that you shouldn't bring I'll leave that for a month but Danny wasn't having it and Daniel could have gone in secret and hid but Daniel opened the window and prayed as normal because he was not ashamed and because he was gonna shame they put him in the lion's den and still he wasn't ashamed man and when the lion saw him because he wasn't ashamed of God where was I - I'm up in that lion had to understand who he was in the room with come the church Sam and the three boys they were not a sheep when everybody else was bowing down did he clear it we are not going to bow and in start to speak our God is able to deliver us and that's why gonna speaking brother young sister you're not going to bow down and your God is able to deliver and they went on they were so convinced they were so convincing even if he doesn't deliver that shows they have no agenda it's wanting to say I will ready I'll go a fiery furnace because gold will in the world and fellas when they're not quite sure if they're gonna help anybody catch that it's one thing if you're know for sure for sure that you're gonna get a help any fire but every guys walked it wasn't sure it they say oh I got it they will deliver but even if you don't he'll ever we still go in him and as if fire it's not hot enough to burn you the King say put it seven times later and as they're walking the Bible says the men that were with them them fellows get burned the robes and were tying their hands that was keeping them from being able to worship those robes got booked 50 feet of me fiery furnace nobody was there forty feet nobody was there thirty feet nobody was there ten feet nobody was there Easter we spoke about it because but the Branham said when that declaration was mean and we are not going to bow down now we are not ashamed and we gonna have a test of money but the Branham said Gabriel around to the true room and said you see what's going on can I go down and take care of this situation and court said no I'll take care of it myself but the Branham said Michael ran to the throne room and said can I go and court said no don't worry about it but the parent said wormwood Rhianna that was the angel who sent the water for the flood and when the Branham said God told woman you were faithful with how you handle the flood but this situation is not one for an angel this is a situation for a man and with the Branham said he's summon the east wind he's summon the north wind he's summoned the south wind oh and he choked on a thunderbolt and when those boys stepped in there was a fourth man in the fire and my people shall you may be seated God was so pleased at their testimony he didn't even send an angel he came himself because if you stand for him he'll stand for you young brother young sister there's no reason to compromise your testimony for anybody I don't care where's your job your boss your family your principles stand for God he'll stand for you I said to them in a retreat in Ghana I don't care if it's a hundred or as you means lineup if you stand for him the employer doesn't even know what's directed him you don't know why he pulled his file you don't know why he opened this file you don't know why this person he just connected with the person you may be seated in the world they do all kinds of stuff to get promoted we know the Bible's a promotion to come from the East promotion will come from me it comes from the we have a Bible believing Church so what are you worried about David went through the same thing you know many are they increase the trouble me many I didn't rise up against me that was the despondent posture did something clicked but Thou O Lord [Applause] and it's okay to go through these mountains and valleys because with a random tortoise you could never appreciate the mountain until you tasted the valley many a day arrives of against me many I didn't see of my soul there is no help for him in God but but now O Lord are a shield for me to glory to lift up that's David going through down the valley but when you hit the valley is only one place to go in it have them all valuating any valley goofiness body right now this is the lowest you don't know law you know look up look up [Applause] [Applause] to be careful that's an illiteracy but I was like I still dumb my mum but I Barry said that the struggles and the testings and the pressures of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is gonna be revealed in us see I realized the problem many of us really haven't really trusted God I got a testimony a couple days ago he was actually yesterday over brother he was speaking he said somebody told him when you pray and pray specifically so he said he needed a car exam you need to be more specific he said take pride only make the model number the color paint you kind of seat he said be specific because God is a specific God anybody say you wrote down he need me remodel the kind of color he features everything he says six months yet it because it that's what I want give us another plans that talks I have with me what's up P squad but the bansemer to me the happiest people Lord I want a blessing what what what kind of lesson be specific the Prophet stood in front of Hattie write and say because he say the right thing what do you want I want a blessing no no no she said a 1d salvation of my two boys you cannot see a son she gonna say boy he I want of my two boys specific Laura wanna touch no we going deeper what can I touch I want to touch him a backpack and this is pizza that is why we make Peter unique enough when Jesus was bringing Communion to them and Peter was like Lord how could you do this you say well if I don't do this wash your feet you have no part with me you know Peter say what Isaac Hayes beard man they say watch everything many of us we happy to get a little blessing I want all I want every blessing my family I want my business my life my health I wonder Holy Ghost I want dynamic I want speed virtue knowledge temperance patience call it specific [Music] specific a revival in this church specific these young people specific but a Stefan specific I don't want to plans by accident I want you plan specifically come on now [Applause] Oh blessed be the name of the Lord everybody feelin fine you ain't tryin to win but the random goes I said Sampson wasn't ashamed so that was all in the general no let's just go to the specific a little bit the first time the word shame is found anybody knows in the book of Genesis chapter 2 in fact it's the last verse in Genesis 2 speaks of the man or woman was there and they were naked and not to shame that's whole chapter 2 ends for the whole of chapter 1 and chapter 2 there's no reference of discipline disciplined enters the drama at the beginning of chapter 3 so throughout Genesis 1 it's the unfolding of creation and as a punctuation to every day God says it was good it was so good that God felt pleased he didn't feel any shame because he was happy with what was unfolding and when Genesis 1 is complete in left man as a spirit man but by Genesis 2 this spirit man is now given a body of flesh dust man as it were and then surgery takes place and God pulls a rib out and out of this man comes a woman and the Bible said they were naked and they were not ashamed now this nakedness is not just physical this nakedness is meaning there's nothing hidden so it's not just physical there is there's nothing to hide it in other words Adam and Eve had no secrets there was no barrier between them and God he had access to see through their mind their heart their desires they were naked and they were not ashamed there was nothing to him a perfect when the Bible makes a point about something it is to draw reference to something specific so I wonder why would chapter 2 end they were naked and they were not ashamed God was pleased to say there was nothing for them to be ashamed about but when sin came sin brought sickness sin brought pain sin brought sadness and sin also brought Shem bear with me not me too much longer when sin came it brought a barrier and that barrier of Shem left her hiding shame led to guilt Jim led to denial shame it was shame that led to covering up it was shame that led to I can't tell anybody it was shame and led to let me just keep on acting as if everything is all right it was shame that letter I hope he doesn't call me shame that led to I hope she doesn't see me shame and let I hope he doesn't maybe check my fond shame and there are so many reasons that but the Branham said the word ashame could be translated as embarrassed you faced with something that you embarrassed about and there different kinds of shame the shame of sin the shame of failure the shame of your past the shame of being barren the shame of being in church and maybe not having a real testimony to the shame of not feeling successful and maybe you feel pressured because other people are and you think you're not and you feel ashamed shion of your financial situation shame of and there's so many reasons that because none of this existed before sinking there was no constructing Adams situation about poverty in wealth and health and sickness these things not exist these are all the byproducts of man's fall from his position in God Webster dictionary defines the term shame as a feeling of disgrace or guilt a feeling of inferiority or unworthiness shame is that negative feeling or emotion we kept me inside of ourselves when we know we're not acting the way we're supposed to act when we know we have done something we had no business doing so we spent half of the service dealing with one aspect of the shame to give you the faith to press forward but now on an individual level we want to expose and pull the shame out of the equation that somebody could be delivered to be because that shame and guilt is hindering your blessing but the Branham said unconfessed sin hinders the blessings of God on your life and they're people who the reason it's unconfessed is because of shame is described as that awareness in the innermost part of our being and lets us know that we have transgressed against God's law or we have violated one of God's commands shame is that guilty feeling we get on the inside when we know we have offended the very presence of God in our hearts God doesn't want us walking around as Christians feeling ashamed because the word is my people shall never be ashamed [Music] so there's blood for whatever situation that has caused that shame but if they are shame there it has to be dealt with to remove the shame to remove the guilt to apply the blood over the situation so that you could be free to worship and not sit condemned wondering if your sacrifice would be accepted by God because there was something bothering you in your soul can we go a little deeper shame was one of the reasons the woman at the well went when nobody else was there she didn't want to hear the comments of how many men she had been with she had become tired of the whispers so she went when nobody else was there and it was in the middle of a shame that Jesus met her Cerreta Clark a deal with her when nobody else was around it was shame and let david to become a murderer he had abused his power to sleep with another man's wife and to cover it up because of shame he sent a man to his bed the woman really is your blood her situation man she could not go to the temple she could not cook she could not touch my husband she could not touch her children it was shame and let her quietly she couldn't even touch Jesus because when a woman is bleeding under Julia claw she should not touch him should not cook so she told herself if I could just touch her shame push her to decide if I could just like the woman at the well King David and the woman with the issue of blood I was shamed many times can lead us to higher in the wrong places shame leads us to be isolated because we don't know what we could tell anybody we don't want nobody to know we don't want we hide in our homes or away from our homes we hide in our bedrooms we hide in our offices we hire in office work house work yard work we hide behind computers and phones and newspapers and magazines behind behind headphones Netflix TV sports world cup we hide behind fashion education careers Facebook and we hide in church we hide in prisoners and procrastination we hide allies and diversionary conversation we hide behind laughter and humor and jokes and solidness we hide behind bravado and being a man and being macho and timidity and shyness we hide in extraversion and introversion today we want to remove that shame because when Jesus came he came to take away the shame of sin the shame of failure shame of mistakes the shame of this struggle in your marriage in your life in your whatever it is I remember schoolteacher years ago he said that's big shame and they're small Jim I've sat in classroom with students who were ashamed to say I didn't understand that and the teacher said that small Jim small shame is in class because you don't want teacher ask anyway understand and if we say yes and you know you will get it but because of shame you know was a circle he repeated one more time and because you're ashamed there's big shame coming you going the exam people come and other people who really understand drinking people hang up you there and the favored example is this know how much more time you have if you don't know the answer the answer is not coming I still work and stop lying and not still working even that is shame P artists to say I don't know I've done I have no more answers with I think my dad to me one time i schooled principal or somebody a reverend came to the school you say lord bring back to their memory everything they studied and those who haven't studied lord help them shame it's better to say I need help I'm in trouble I don't know it's okay because if I don't know admitting you don't know is the first step for you reaching out to get to help everybody busy anybody have stuff to do doctors listen to carefully doctors don't walk around the street how you feeling how you feeling how you feeling how you feeling but it's when you're in pain you find yourself by the doctor it is extremely difficult for the pastor to call everybody how are you doing you pray you read Bible you're on fire you living right how's it testimony house you live in great you're on fire and how many people to testify to this week it's extremely difficult but if you are struggling don't let him hold you back from seeing beloved this is what is going on can you talk to me or send somebody to talk to me and God has blessed us but if you feel you don't want to call him you call me if you know commit you corporatist even because we work together for the benefits of the scenes so you can get the help you need because we have to make it together there is no joy in making it if I'm there at the finish line and I look back and there's nobody with me the race is not for the Swift but we have to endure until the end could you to join me for one minute I want to demonstrate something but now you see when you fighting a battle like this with your hands locked brother Jorge join me please whether Alexis lock your hands I lock it tight now if he stands alone I could push him over but because his hand is locked it becomes very difficult because pushing him look what happens on the other side I start to pull those are nice if I come and push with a George on this side it affects him too as a body of Christ our unity is our strength and the devil's job is to try to break this but the banner what connects us is love and if the planner is love and we create no room for the devil then the devil has no room now listen we sing the song Satan will be bound a thousand years he'll be bound by circumstance circumstance means there's no room for him to operate because if the devil can find no space in him no space in heaven no space in him no space in him no space the devil has nobody to use and as a church divided we fall but united no devil could break down the barrier break down the wall so I'm calling for the church and I'm speaking in his local church foster unite in prayer unite and fit unite with one another and my people shall never meet a Lord bless you Thank You brothers no room for the devil no room for jealousy no room for envy no room for animosity your pain is my pain your victory is my victory oh come on now he cares for us He loves us and we have to love one another give the Lord a hand oh praise [Music] [Applause] I pray somebody got help this morning so shame leads us to hide the issue is not so much to hiding it's where me I don't hide in solitude don't hide in pain bring it under the blood the blood will hang it better than anything else Christian and when it comes under the blood it's permanently hidden because the only record that matters is his record oh come on now the only record he's the only one I want to please once he approves I'm fine you know it would have Stefan look at me upset all service and I try to adjust what I'm seeing I'm not picking on her Stefan jess is an example he's not looking at me upset I can't use him as my validation my job this morning my assignment this morning is to please him and for people who are hiding in problem in pain in doubt and feel whatever it is for the shame of hiding to be moved that you could go free that the upcoming convention you can come with such a joy because you could say take the whole world to give me Jesus forget anything enough pasta I leave it behind I press towards the mark for the price this is powerful the woman and the well she couldn't go where others were going but look at what happens when Jesus starts you do they say how many go call your husband something she was supposed to be ashamed about she said well I have none I just say well that's true okay I've had what four or five and I wonder what I said when she was delivered she ran I tell everybody come see a man who told me all about my problems see him Gordon no more scheming no more embarrassment enough nobody could bring up a pass anymore because she is not free of it she know about testimony I used to have Eichmann put up free all of a sudden what was negative becomes a positive because it's a line of bloodline that separates a class so anything over that line don't ask me about it it's underneath the blood oh come on somebody preached back to me that's why the Bible says who the son of man set free I'm almost finished do over the issue of blood Yeshua Jesus has this issue with you hiding stuff now God knows everything so when this woman touched him he could have discerned hila she went away in hiding because she came in secret he could have allowed her to go back in secret you know how nice his story would have been she touched him slip back out was healed and we would never know about it but as if she doesn't make out he said who Dutchman come way way higher in you Cassius when I went to our first issue in Sonora and we are know who touched me even Peter and even make or gorilla whatever Jesus everybody here he said what this is different this woman came in higher than she came in shame she came in secret and she make our withdrawal and extraordinary withdraw because I felt she left me this is a real blessing she actually make a withdrawal the account Cielo hit he liked impact because her need was so great she activated principles and laws chemistry and biology and because she will heal so it mean the hospital in heaven went into action angels was it was a new womb a new condition things happen things went missing all these shells to fix the problem the catch is to it like that who touched me oh don't you love Jesus now it's blood that unites us so it makes it really hard when you have people who in the mess want to judge people because we have seemed to have forgotten that it is his grace to you and to me so if I know it's grace that reach me I am sorry Jason with whatever quote delivered you from I don't even need to know if you deliver you just like you delivered me I am so happy that you are my brother you're my sister because we share the same testimony he deliver you he deliver me he delivered David he delivered Solomon he didn't ever brother branham he delivered Moses he delivered Noah he delivered Paul and that keeps us excited because we rejoice Dualla heaven rejoice when one so received I'm here on earth what he did I don't know if I will pasta not sure I don't know a best blood for that if hero believe it like us I don't know where's that only would where's that any scripture that's why the Prophet said people came on the street when he was preaching on heal and people there sitting on for years and moving because people just have feet that this world could come alive this work could have a reality and that's why he was an I'm tired of Church of the formality of chile's of people is coming because it's supposed to be but I'm looking for people who willing to step on the boat but a brother is careless some people were to cause something to happen become any right to cause something to happen Danny lose radical things like to slide on the ground right it won't already is your blood and do stuff that nobody's willing to do because you really want to help because you know he is a helper you know he's a healer and you're looking for it for you so there's no shame lord I need I need help if I'm the only one in here screaming I'm screaming if I'm thirsty altar after every lead you're gonna have to lift me up and carry me out because I'm looking for help and I'm saying Lord I'm not gonna let you go until you bless me I'll tell my change comes Oh hallelujah oh my my my my my glory everybody feelin fine whoo well George I look in the ATM but the balance and let us not be ashamed when we when we stand before people we're here in different people religious whatever it is as Paul told Timothy this is the prophets wood let's be instant in season out of season reprove and rebuke and with all long-suffering and doctrine for the time will come when they learn and your sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall he put themselves together teachers having itching ears and will be tilling from the truth of fables God we're living in that day you've left me living long enough to see that happen as that that leaves right here in the corner sort of this Tabernacle today god bless each one in here if there be one in here Lord that's not ready to meet you that they just cannot agree with your word and they haven't met you face to face musicians become I know that you're not just by an act of some of exception like you would a Creed or somebody has met the Living God if they haven't did this Lord made it do it right now you are real near this hour I don't know who they are I don't know I don't even if there's any here but I just feel led to pray to you none of the people hear me for that would be a hypocrite right god forbid I don't want to be a hypocrite but I pray it with a sincerity in my heart and this is have a few scriptures Psalms 25 - oh my god I trust in thee let me not be ashamed let not mine enemies triumph over me samms 25 3a let not let none that wait and me be ashamed let them be a shame which transgress with our cause samms 25 2000 keep my soul and deliver me let me not be ashamed before I put my trust in thee samms 31 1 in viola do I put my trust let me never be ashamed deliver me in thy righteousness he is here this morning musicians frenzy the hour is late and we speak about it about the door is about to close and I heard a gentleman general and Experion that he had and maybe you've had to take a plane at some point and with a plane there's a time to check in and there's a time to board and typically when boarding is about a wrapped-up if there anyone who has been checked in who he's on the plane it's not to make a call so calling anthony o'brien to flight 201 to wherever and the gentleman said that he was somehow caught up somewhere in the airport and he really miscalculated how far he was from the gate and he heard the name he heard his name called and he started to move as quickly as you could to the gate he said but when he got to the gate they told him he asked where's flight 201 they're like that's a plane right there yeah well I'm on a plane he said but we just closed the door he said but the plane is right there he said that's that's that that's nothing to do with it we already called the last call and the door is shut and here he is standing watching the plane it hasn't even left yet it's still there but the door is shut and he cannot go on [Music] and he is a preacher and he was saying he stood there and it hit him the reality of this store being shot because he said people would be witnesses of this door being shorter but the Branham said they're commenting when there'll be young people at the altar and they'll be praying for salvation praying for deliverance but never really crossed the line you know what it is to be at the altar praying and there's no hope you had the altar looking for help but there's no God available to help you the Bible said I'd like to seek it alone while he may be found this conditional calling upon him while he is near and I asked myself the question are you ready do you really want to be a Christian are you really ready to give up the cares of this life give up your ambitions give up your desires give up what your plans are because his plans are different from your plans his hopes are different from your hopes his expectations are different from your expectations young woman you don't need make-up if the people in the world need it that's them you are too beautiful to need make-up you don't need to be like them you need to walk like them you're manually to act like the men of this world you are sons and daughters of the Living God and don't let nobody tell you otherwise he said my people will never be ashamed never never never be ashamed to say I believe this gospel I believe in holiness Hollywood has made fornication acceptable homosexuality acceptable it's a worldwide agenda in some parts of the world you can't even see these things anymore because the word tells us that Satan is the god of this evil age so he is running things in the government in the media running things on social media running things to distract you and to make you insensitive insensitive till it becomes normal till you accept it can you say hey this is this is normal but God cannot change sin is still sin heaven is still heaven heaven still L right is still right wrong is still wrong the government cannot legislate righteousness no movement I'm not ashamed in the dark ages you had a choice do you believe in Jesus and you had a choice you could have been Ashima see no I don't and they would leave here alone but if you stood and say yes I believe you know it was lying you knew it was crucifixion you knew it was some type of persecution and they died a glorious death because they were not ashamed but we live in a different day it's not physical that it's spiritual death and people are dead dying or badly wounded in the message because they have compromised and what God taught us through the scriptures and through the Prophet what I'm calling for us to return to the old landmark to return to what our forefathers built to return to the alpha church that was established on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit moved through the camp may God remove the shame here we go remove the pinion in the church we go remove the sadness McGaw remove all of your thoughts of your past and and may you walk from this day on like you've never walked before knowing that God is going to give you to a Holy Ghost forget that worldly boyfriend forget that worldly girlfriend you know what brother Branham said under no circumstances should I believe I marry an unbeliever no circumstances god help us as you go through the word and you see where the standard is and where we have drifted may God bring us back to real sincerity but Aaron said Gordon 1
