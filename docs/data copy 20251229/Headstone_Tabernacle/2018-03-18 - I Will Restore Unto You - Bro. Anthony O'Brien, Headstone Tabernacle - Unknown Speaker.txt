Oh hallelujah hallelujah Oh glory be to God oh you can praise Him you could praise Him this morning there is hope for you there's hope for you yet [Applause] yes yes there's hope in that situation it's a promise of restoration o mine [Applause] prophet Sarah I rushed home I got my dictionary and so forth and he said on some Scripture notes and and I began to copy some things down prophet said and then I got a Webster's dictionary to find out the right definition for restore he said to restore means to return to the former owner or to bring back to the former estate of condition so we be talking about total restoration now we're talking about total Redemption I'm not talking about restoration praise God from 1999 or no I'm not talking about specific year I'm talking about where was you before the foundation of the world we're talking about restoration we're talking about bringing back Eden we're talking about pushing the big reset button that's waiting at the end of eternity to reset everything back your gray hairs rolling back you turning 19 again or 18 or whatever oh that's what I'm talking about restoration I'm talking about who you was in car before I was up trouble before I was a mind battle before I was a trial before I was a headache before I was back pain you are running you are jumping you are shouting for joy oh you deserve this this is where you belong in heavenly places in Christ Jesus enjoying the blessings of a magic card and what Satan destroyed in the early after the early church came in we're gonna get it right back luta fought to bring back a portion Wesley fought to bring back a portion Malachi fought for the entire message what are we gonna do this morning it's time to rise up oh I feel this morning there's a rising up there's an army rising up to break every chain break every chain break every chain there is power in the name of Jesus to break every chain to break every Satur to let you go free [Applause] hallelujah are you ready this morning there is talk to a former owner this land belongs to you you are the farm owners of this this is design inheritance every every tree every river every lake you see that's your inheritance praise God hallelujah God promised to restore bring everything back to we're supposed to appear before Adam before a man before the fall and everything else hallelujah please call is now Oh [Music] [Applause] he said now the would restore means to bring back to the former owner he said now if a claim is made on something to make that restoration you can enforce it here's a new word now so if a claim is made on that item that item that is to be restored whatever it is he said now you can enforce it he said you can make it come back to its right place that's what enforces hallelujah is to carry out the law is to carry out the verdict is to carry out the decision to enforce the claim that is being made hallelujah hallelujah all is not so it's good to claim that this is minor that is my love is mine and Joy's my peace is mine it's good to have a blueprint it's good to have a plan it's good to have a map hallelujah hallelujah but that's not all of it hollow-core po Joshua every place of sole of your foot shall tread upon have I given unto you Oh hallelujah so you ain't really yours until you enforce it until you claim it literally take it back from the enemy take back your joy your peace your land overflowing with milk and honey saturated with all of the fruits of the land that is what belongs to you every promise in the book is yours Healing is yours deliverance is yours breakthrough is yours freedom is yours freedom to shout freedom to worship freedom to lift your hands don't let the devil take your toy in this morning you lift your hands up I don't care what mistakes you made I don't care what condition your family is in your loved ones you could praise God this morning because the declaration has already gone out declare your victory this morning shout and give God praise don't be afraid of the devil he's nobody to be afraid of praise God this land is ours it's ours for the taking Oh somebody shot right at me this morning MA so we're gonna enforce it and to enforce it when we enforce it it comes back to its rightful place it comes back to where it's supposed to be hallelujah is not reset isn't that right and may God bless the feeble words now Roberto Pam says he said the restor means to bring back a claim to be enforced he said ah now to bring anything back to its rightful owner where it belongs therefore some way it went away from its rightful owner and can run no one around anywhere but to restore is to bring back to who really owns it or bring it back to its natural state where it was at the first time bring it back to its natural condition and in order to do this we have a right to enforce and he said that they are law if there's a law then to enforce this rightful condition of restoration to restore he said like if someone stole property and they are holding the property captive then you take the law you take the officers you take the army you take whoever it is holiday if they hide in a property property you take down the law to this person and the law enforces and forces this person to restore this property back to its natural owner oh that's what we're doing this morning Oh we are going down to the enemy we taking a fight to the enemy give us back our joy give us back on land we're gonna knock on your front door we're gonna open your window if we have to bust in with Boston but we serve an eviction notices this devil cat out get out you hit lights get out you tripping sights get out I'm all right get out hit lights oh I'll just land belongs to us and to our children and our children it's time to strengthen the feeble knees if you understand what belongs to you then you have difference then you walk difference then you talk difference because you have a understanding that Court is your God and whatever he spoke for you whatever he promised for you that belongs to you then you have a right to be healed you have a right to be delivered you have a right to be strong in the Lord and then the power this might you have every right to put on the whole armor of God you have every right to pray with confidence Oh hallelujah pray with poulos before God's truth he said ask and you shall receive seek and you shall find knock and the door shall be opened [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah enforcement he said oh what a text how I'd like to have that for two days just enforcement hallelujah is that enforced there we are have the privilege enforce upon Satan in order its forces hand off of your children the forces hand off of what belongs to you you try to your life we China choke cares of life trying to wrap his way around you but you got all right this morning to take the sword of the word chopped into ribbons sever praise God separate hallelujah every binding Spirit

said but you know the Prophet said there was a seal in there ready for life and God knows it was there he's now right said now the predestinated ones the first to be quickened by the holy spirit for the holy spirit comes to claim its own and now this is deep now he said to be sure to catch this good he said now as the Sun went across the earth not to bring rocks which was did it also to life it was it was not to bring all the dirt to life but was to bring part of the dirt which was enclosed around a life he said a not all man will receive Christ or no but those which God for ordained life is housed around some the dirt of the earth that's the one he come to quicken they're the ones and that know that dude would lay there in the Sun and I would say oh this old Sun is so hot but it's just carrier see that rock see that old Sun is so hot but that little seed says that is just what I'm looking for oh that's you and me this morning we got little seed this is exactly what we are looking for this morning hallelujah this is what we need and it begin to spring for life a quick and not part of the dirt because the Sun was sent not too quick on a rock not too quick in the dirt but the quicken the life that is in the sea and now the Holy Spirit comes now oh of course it wasn't sent why it won't be it won't be all of the people receive it it wasn't sent to them said a guy told me he said I don't believe I don't care what you see if you raise it there or anything and heal the sick and prove it anyway he said I still don't believe it I said certainly certainly not he said you're an unbeliever I don't mean I think I don't mean a thing to you it wasn't even sent to you it was sent to those who will believe the Prophet said a message is to her believer to them that perish it's foolishness but to them that are in Christ and part of that seed then it's life to you and the same Jesus the blind the eyes of some open the eyes of others the same Jesus the blind of the eyes of the Pharisees I said your father's well I said our fathers ate manna in the wilderness and he told him your everyone 10006 in the grass hypocrites but a little old woman who came with a little water pot Oh she's insane but that same Jesus the pharisees couldn't understand him but he opened her understanding to let her know who he was to them she was black but up in heaven she was white her name was Richard in a lamb's book of life and I don't care how you look this morning I don't care how you feel this morning I don't care what the devil told you Paul's got an appointment to meet with you you

to what it was before the beginning Oh [Applause] hallelujah amen Oh mine oh alright II meant it's life alright in my preschool spoken with the original seed and that last quotation we had was that God made every seed after its kind that's his you are his this morning every seed after its own kind hallelujah hallelujah bring after their own kind Wesley ends after their own kind but you see the perfection gonna bring after after its own kind you're gonna bring forth feet you're gonna bring for knowledge bring for temperance bring forth patience bring forth godliness bring for brotherly kindness every seed after its own kind what Malachi 4:2 resaw we are gonna be a living manifestation of what he spoke by prophecy that would be here it is anytime we are gonna point back to this and say this is that we are it here it is here's what Jesus died for here's what the Prophet fought to bring back a perfect man standing on earth many Mathew believe it Laurie oh my that's his see me man I won't be any much longer with you please God even don't get all shaken up you man then when he said he made man in His image when I was a seed of his word and when Jesus was made flesh he was the flesh of the Word of God and when we see the Word of God then we become God's Word in all flesh a man the church should be in that condition oh dear loving this morning hallelujah hallelujah happy this morning hallelujah hallelujah do you see God's promises this morning do you know you were restore unto you he's gonna restore you back to what you once was hallelujah holiday praise God hallelujah don't let the trials shake you don't let the testing shake you hallelujah all about wants your roots to go deeper God wants your roots to go down into the love of God have a strong foundation and even though the winds blow contrary even though the storm blow contrary them roots keep going t paw shake a little loose sometimes what them roots I'm cutting the love of God anchored in the Word of God brother we're so anchor this morning the devil can't move us the devil cannot shake us o Allah we've been around we know that there's nothing else out there we know that the world has nothing to offer all of the styles all of the movies they have nothing to give us nothing like this nothing like peace nothing like joy everlasting y'all holler joy prophecy said they will be satisfied and they will praise the name of their God Oh Holland we'll never be ashamed by people shall never be ashamed oh my he was a flash Lord of God we receive okay he said that when he made man in His image he was a seed of his word and when Jesus was made flesh he was the flesh of the Word of God he said but when we receive the Word of God then we become God's Word in all flesh see the crack that the church should be in that condition What did he say the secret is that the world is in the bride and he received that word willingly openly with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the law and as we behold him we become what we behold and we are changed into that same image from glory to glory to glory from fate of hates growing from hallelujah from perche to virtue a man oh my I will respond to you say the Lord said now if you plant the seed then you go out every morning and dig it up and say it to see if it's growing he said it'll never grow committed to God and leave it there amen know that it's so and then when corn first come up the farmer looks at that stalk of corn and he says oh it's not wonderful I've got the first two little shots shot shoots on it it's marvelous he said that's when the Lutheran Church the Lutheran Church stayed there right out of there come the Methodist Church and then the next two shoots of corn come up the Lutheran begin to wither the Methodists was a day alter the message is coming up any cost or profit explain the process you know he says the name leaves begin to drop down but there's still part of the corn it still takes all of it to make the stalk isn't all right he said we're going on and no Pentecost is becoming form and different and drying up the shoot is still going right on up just the same see all the leaves coming down like that but she's going right up on into the seed crop that's her sitting has anything he said but in the resurrection the elect of every one of them will be resurrected that plant that grain of corn off of it and it'll produce another stalk just exactly like I'm come up in the beginning amen he said so don't worry a poor grandmother died 40 years ago if she walked in a light she had it she'd be in the resurrection a man he said that's right I will restore saith the Lord truly a many man hallelujah a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the Dark Ages the world was almost entirely lost to the people but God sent Luther with the word and the Lutheran spoke for God at that time but any organized and again the pure wood was lost for organization tends to what dog man Creed's and so on are not simple word and they could no longer speak for God then God sent Wesley and he was the voice with the word in his days now and the people who took his revelation from God became the living epistles read unknown of all man for their generation is not so for every word I was preached there was a group that raised up and they became living epistles read of all men for that day Luther haughty had written epistles Wesley's he had written epistles is not right for their generation and when the Methodists fail God raised up others and so it has going on throughout through the years until in his last day there is again another people in the land under their messenger shall we say Malachi for there will be the final voice to the final age the final Junction of time Oh hallelujah when the devil thinks he's got everything on lockdown here comes a bride a rebel group who will break out of traditions of man and preach the riches of Jesus Christ heal the sick raise the dead cast out Devils Oh the devil won't be able to contain us he won't be able to hold us not the power that's coming into the church now oh the devil's gonna meet this bride he hasn't met you yet oh but he's gonna meet you he's gonna say Paul I know Pete I know and this bride she is undefeated she is a champion with Jesus Christ at the center of it praise claw connecting the party boom come to poon boom come to poon Oh hallelujah praise honey six an apple some nice it's gonna take place he got a his he'll exceed from all walks of

there's another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age the prophets at the church is no longer a mouthpiece of God he said in his own mouthpiece so God is turning on her he's turning on the bride for this last day he said yes Oh hallelujah hallelujah he said he will confound her through the Prophet and a bride for the voice of God will be in her yes it is but it says in the last chapter of Revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come and once more once more this world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost once more you're gonna hear from God once more oh I like Samson cried out Oh devil had no right to pull out his eyes the devil had no rights to take what was rightfully his isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah

chain Kiefer he said so revival in our day how can we have it when the regular revival giver is bound by the world God won't come in where the world is you could just depend on that you associate with the world then it's all of it but when you let the world creep in you go to acting like the world he said and then you're finished but when you cut loose from every Satur of the world and come to God God will use you until you go to flits and again a prophet said here is the only hope and I have this morning the wind of my message is this that while Samson was bound a new shock of hair grew out God send us another church just before the end time the power the Holy Ghost could come into her in the demonstration of the Spirit st. mark sixteen will follow and we follow right along with the church Oh although you can stand this morning I'm finish Oh hallelujah oh I believe right now a new shocker here is going out I don't care how long you've been in prison a new Shaka is growing out oh
