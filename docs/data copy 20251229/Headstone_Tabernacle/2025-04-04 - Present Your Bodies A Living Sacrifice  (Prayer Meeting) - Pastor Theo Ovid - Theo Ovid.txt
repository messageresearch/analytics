Amen and amen. God bless you and welcome tonight to this time of prayer after this day of prayer and fasting. And I have a title that I like to share with you a few words. Present your bodies a living sacrifice. And I want to uh start with Exodus chapter 19. We want to read from verse 3-6. Exodus chapter 19 verse 3-6. You know, the Old Testament gives you a clearer picture of God in terms of how he thinks, how he see, what he sees, how he operates. And you could reflect it back in the New Testament. But let us see what is said here in Exodus chapter 19. And Moses went up unto God, and said, The Lord, and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain, saying, "Thus shall thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel, Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians." So, this is God telling Moses what to tell the people. You have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bear you on eagle's wings, and brought you unto myself. Watch those words. Brought you unto myself. Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people, for all the earth is mine, and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. Now I know brother Isaac have been some time in past spoke about the kingdom of priests and the kingdom of kings but I want to look at that preite tonight in a bit. God has many wonderful blessings and privilege and inheritance for us but his primary purpose is to bring us to himself. In other words, the outer court, the inner court, then the most holy place. So God wants us to journey to get to that place. God is interested in a personal connection with his people. Some stop short at religion, confined to a belief, and they're satisfied with that, what they believe. Some stop short at what they do. But God wants an inner veil relationship with you and I. And this relationship in a veil relationship this most holy priest relationship this will fulfill the second fold of the three-fold mystery of God that is to have the preeminence which is abiding in the vine that you can be fruit bearing. But Anthony wonderfully expressed that on Wednesday night about abiding, about fruit bearing and God interested in us bringing forth fruit. Not just a tree, not just to say that we exist, but we are our purpose is to bring forth that fruit and that our fruit remains. Where did Aaron's rod blossom b and brought forth fruit? It was in the presence of the shikana glory. So verse 5 again now therefore if he shall obey my voice indeed. So there is something about recognizing God's voice and dropping into obedience to that voice. There's two things you have here. You will obey my voice and keep my covenant. Then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people. for all the earth is mine. Now, excuse me. It's in John 10:26:27, Jesus speaks, but he believe not because you are not of my sheep. As I said unto you, my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me. Let's go through that slowly. My sheep. Who is the my sheep? They are those who hear his voice and follow him. Not I'm in the message. Not I believe I believe the message. Not that my sheep want hear his voice and follow him. Follow Jesus for all the earth is mine. It shall be to me a you shall be a kingdom of priests, a holy nation. So God of all of this this vision that God seen for the for the nation as the kingdom of priests was in the Old Testament. It was the vision of God for his people to become a kingdom of priests. We'll see where we're going tonight. Now 1 Peter 2 9-11 Peter speaks but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation. So Peter is going from Exodus drawing from what was in the Old Testament and bringing us bringing it into the New Testament for us. Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, that he should show forth the praises of him who had called you out of darkness into his marvelous light, which in time past were not a people that are now the people of God which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lust which war against the soul. So Peter is quoting from Exodus 19. He's applying it to the New Testament believers and you are chosen generation, royal priesthood, holy nation where Moses said a kingdom of priests. Peter said a royal priesthood and royal is kingly. So we talk about royal king kingship. Revelation 5 and6. Revelation 5 and 6. And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth, unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and has made us kings and priests unto God and his father. To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. So here it is. What was spoken by Moses, reaffirmed by Peter, confirmed by John in the book of Revelation that we are to be kings and priests. Romans 5:17. For if by one's man offense debt reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ. This verse in the amplified says, "For if because of one's man trans trespass, lapse, offense, debt reign through that one, much more surely will those who receive God's overflowing grace, unmmerited favor, and the free gift of righteousness, putting them into right standing with themselves, reign as kings in life through the one man, Jesus Christ, the Messiah, the anointed So we see here that Jesus came to bring abundance of grace, overflowing of grace, unmmerited favor that we could get the free gift of righteousness. Not all righteousness is a gift of righteousness putting us into right standing with God. 2 Corinthians 5:21. For he had made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. So God's purpose is to place upon us by his grace, by gift, by unmmerited favor, his own righteousness that would make us righteous. is not our own righteousness but the righteousness of God which is by faith. Jesus was made sin with our sinfulness and in return we might be made righteous with his righteousness and it's a gift when we receive this overflowing grace and gift of righteousness. We are ready to be reign as kings in this time. Not only are we to be kings, we are to be a kingdom of priests. And the thing that identifies with this priestly ministry, what is it? It is sacrifice. The only people entitled in the Bible to offer sacrifice to God are priests. This is what this ministry, this priesthood ministry is about. We have to learn to offer sacrifice. We have to have this sacrificial ministry. 1 Peter 2:5, "Ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ." Peter clearly identified as spiritual sacrifices. Why? Because in the Old Testament they offer physical sacrifices of goats and bulocks and different kinds of things like that. Physical sacrifices. So Peter was specifying that this priesthood is different. This priesthood is to offer up spiritual sacrifices that is acceptable to God. Hebrews 5:1 says, "For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sin." So this is the objective offering gifts and sacrificing for sin. Now when they apply they said Jesus Hebrews 5 6 and 7 says he said another place thou art a priest forever after the order of MelzDC who speaking about Christ in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers here we go and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him of death. Let's go back again hear what this priest after the order of MelchzDC here what Jesus offered up who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplication with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared though he be a You had learn who learn you learn your obedience by the things that he suffered. So this is incredible. He Jesus offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears. So Jesus sacrificial ministry while on earth was to offer the sacrifices of prayer. Then came the time when he offered himself. So first he offered prayer, intercession with strong crying and tears and then he offered up himself. We're almost done. And this is where we get to Hebrews 7 verse 26 and 27. says this, "For such a high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens." Here we go. Who needeth not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins, then for the people, for this he did once when he offered up himself. So in terms of the priesthood, he didn't only offer prayers. He didn't only offered up uh intercession, but Jesus offered up himself. Hebrews 9 13 and 14. For if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of Hepher sprinkling the unclean sanctifying the to the purifying of the flesh, how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God. And Hebrews 13 almost finished 15-16. For by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, not partially, not when you're feeling good, not when you get a raise of pay or you get a new car, new house or whatever. Let us offer the sacrifice of praise of God continually. That is the fruit of our lips giving praise, giving thanks to his name. But to do good and to communicate, forget not, for with such sacrifices, God is well pleased. So we see what pleases God. God is pleased with the sacrifices of praise continually. God is pleased with the sacrifice that we make. When we make the correct sacrifices that is right in his sight, for such sacrifices, God is well pleased. So our sacrificial offerings made with praise and thanksgiving. But there's also a sacrifice that Jesus made. And this is where I want to bring bring it to a close. And that sacrifice is with our own body. Again, the ministry of the priesthood. We like to talk about the king part. We shall reign on the earth and rule and reign and conquer and walk on the enemy and whatn not every place you put your conquer and so on. But there's also the priest part. And the priest part have to do with sacrifice. Are you willing to make a sacrifice? Are you willing to sacrifice? What are you prepared to sacrifice? And this is where you come to Romans 12 1 and two. I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. and be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. So what is the sacrifice that God requires? Just what he wanted of Jesus, he wants of us that represents our bodies. Our bodies become holy when it is laid on the altar of God's service. This body is more than what meets the arm. You know that woman right now talking about my body, my choice and whatn not said of foolishness. But this body is the temple of the Holy Ghost. This is the house that God want to dwell in the spirit. Just as the evil spirit have to get bodies to do mischief, the holy spirit have to get bodies that he could work through to bring on righteousness and so on. He have chosen you. You didn't choose him. He chose you. He chose you just as you are. He chose you in the condition you're in. He chose you knowing all about you, your past and your present. And he chose you knowing that your future is already finished in God. It's a finished work. We just have to go through the process. But Anthony struck it. Those that bring forth fruit, no fruit cut off. Those who bring forth fruit, he purged to bring forth more fruit. And then here is my father glorified and they bring forth much fruit. This gospel is perfect. This word is perfect. This announcement of the kingdom of kings and priests. It is perfect. We have to grow in the ministry. Grow into the kingly ministry. Grow into the priest ministry. Jesus went past prayers and intercession until he could present himself. Here we are exhorted to present ourselves, our bodies, the whole man, body, spirit and soul as a living sacrifice which the Bible identifies as our reasonable service. Let us bow our heads. Heavenly Father, I was thrilled to bring this and share it with your people tonight to present their bodies a living sacrifice to go through the Old Testament, the New Testament that we are supposed to be a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, a people called separated unto you, a people that you would find favor with you. A people that will be a treasure unto you. Oh God, your prophet you told in through by and through the bride will be fulfilled. All Jesus, may something supernatural take place tonight in the hearts of your children upon the lives of your people that they could see such a high calling that we are called unto not just to be in church, not just to be believers, but to believe the word that declares that we are to be kings and priests. May they as they go down in prayer tonight accept the reality that Jesus after the order of Melchzdc at his priesthood. He offer up much prayers with tears with oh God groanings and and so on crying unto God. The father of God if he went through all of that. What about us tonight? Give us the burden of the word. Give us the burden of praying. giving them the burden of of of crying on unto you for breakthroughs, for deliverance. And may they see it, may they feel it, may they experience it right in their homes, in their lives. May they not accept that how they are, but may they see what they are to be. But the devil is not challenged by what we are now. What he's challenged by is the possibility of what we can become. And Lord, you put prayer as an avenue to access heaven. You put prayer as an avenue to inspire faith. Anoint the feet of the people tonight as they get on in prayer. In Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. So God bless you and I trusting that these words would encourage you tonight to recognize that this calling is a high calling that God has given us. A high calling to surrender and yield ourselves to God. So as you get on in prayer, think on these things. God bless you. Praise the Lord. Amen. So we get in prayer. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat.

Bless the Calebs in our midst, those that long in the vineyard struggling with gray hair and struggling with aches and pains. But may you minister and meet their very need. Give them the comfort, Lord. The comfort, the comfort of God. How you brought Israel out of Egypt. The destination wasn't just a journey. The destination was the promised land. But that in itself wasn't a destination. That destination was to gather a people unto you. You wanted the people for yourself. Not for some man, not for some church, not for some system, but to bring them to yourself. Oh God, receive us tonight and may we have a closer communion, a closer fellowship, a closer relationship with you, Father, tonight. Bless your sons and daughters.
