you this morning Oh [Music] oh my old glory to God ah [Music] I know about you this morning but I fee to worship my filter honor him and prison this morning if every Bible is turned to the scripture this morning wanna go to Malachi chapter 4 familiar scripture 5 and 6 mark 16 verse 15 to 20 sin John 14:1 verse verse 12 first scripture reading this morning god bless you and welcome we are grateful to be in his presence this morning I appreciate a special this morning or bless you amen reading from Malachi for you who like this is God speaking be well I will send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the father's to the children and heart of the churn to their fathers recycle and smite a third with a crease mark 16 verse 15 and he said unto them go into all the world and preach a gospel to every creature he that believeth was baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord has spoken on Adam you receive up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them confirmed the word which signs following soon John 14:1 verse was 12 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father let's play one more time father we thank you for your scriptures and Lord you know why that we come right back to the scriptures this morning and we pray that you become and interpreted your word Torah hearts in Jesus and we ask it email and God bless you you must be seated this morning of a title the feet of the fathers part 2 and it so happened that we preached on this at January 19th that was like part 1 but it is part 2 and the subject was the fee that was once delivered to the Saints and the his mission was just going to be a unity of the feet we had contact scripture from Ephesians 4 Jude 1 on religion 10 okay so you ready for the word this morning all right know when you come to church you not coming to find out how good you are or great you are how powerful you are ho mighty you are come the church to find out your faults your weakness it comes to to find out about you what you don't know about you that the word can discern you and reveal you expose you help you strengthen you pull you out so you come not to look at other people you come to get to hear from God yes because when you get empowered then you could help others he's none right all right so let's continue this is Barbara if you notice in Revelation 13 when the United States come up is the only beast in the Bible that come up and did not come out of the waters the Bible says come up out of the earth where there are no people's that was this new kingdom and it looked like a lamb and after a while it spoke like a dragon that is this country it's got to happen there's an echo here it's got to happen someday they will make a mistake and elect the wrong guy they will raise up a Joseph of a pharaoh that doesn't know Joseph they tried it before and they will do it again if they feel this time which the time he was in it will finally come the Bible said so and I am NOT a politician both sides and I'm a crooked I'm casting my vote on Jesus Christ he's the one I'm interested in but I tell you you better wipe your glasses off no if you expect any freedom for your children I don't know how close it is so this is the direct prophecy that some day America would elect the wrong guy a fear that no no Joseph any time Joseph as freedom of religion because America was founded on that but that is going to change he is praying Grint law that something will be set tonight or done that will cause the we were to turn to Christ for we believe and feel pressed in the spirit that greed judgments are upon these lands in the last days plagues disease germs already bred up to be scattered throughout the nations no doctor nor even how to take a whole of it Oh God will have to believe in divine healing then when nations are breeding germs together the bosom and bombs and millions dying hours over it but we are thankful that when the destroying angels went for you said touch none of these that had the seal of the Father upon their forehead for their mine and we are so glad tonight to be under the blood safely protected as Israel in the days of old put in the blood and the lintel of the door upon the doorpost sign of the Cross when the danger was sweeping the land that dark wings bow down but when you see the blood is rose again I'll pass over you on just one more thing he said what is cancer is a disease we debated for a few extra minutes what is cancer what caused that thing let's take cancer or anything you wish to take tubercle or pneumonia or whatever you wish any disease diseases are germs let me pass something and quickly as our time is going to listen did you know the Bible predicts that in the last days that there'll be germ warfare that diseases will break out upon the people and will fall on everyone with all the baptism of the Holy Spirit but with the angel or who are charged over these plagues was given orders to touch not one upon wound amok ones why how much kind of teachers have we got to be bredrin to get the church in order in that condition to be immune my arms are saw no where the doctors have punched needles in to try to inoculate me from yellow fever I told him I didn't need it but they wouldn't listen to me but I tell you what's going to do God's got a serum it's called the Holy Ghost and when that serum goes in it will inoculate plea all glory to God hallelujah so this morning I come for inoculation against all the diseases and pestilence and please not going to come upon the earth because mango Quan could wouldn't be able to stop it all praise be to Jesus he said our bodies need food and drink each day to survive a physical body if we don't eat take food each day and drink our body weakness and there is something in us that we must have food on one day food will not last for the next day you've got to have food each day to strengthen your mortal being you can live over but you get weaker on the second day you're weaker and the today your Chipman this week well well well that's what many times that we do in the spiritual realm you see each day we have got to commune with Christ we have got to talk to him each day we have got to settle it with him each day Paul said I die daily each day I die yes I live not me but Christ lives in me so if your physical body needs food each day and drink each day to survive your spiritual body needs spiritual food and communion with the Lord each dish to survive hallelujah yes Jesus said man shall live i bread alone but by every word I push you down to the Mount of God so each day we've got to study the Bible some people study it because up every two three times a year but a real believer that is really spiritual built up he reads his Bible every day and talks to the Lord that's right he has to I think I want to read that part again a real believer that is really spiritually built up he reads his Bible every day and talks to the Lord that's right he has to just as you look at what's up every day just look at your phone every day look up text every day look at the messages every day you have to read a Bible every day Oh glory that God has a spiritually built up amen and we have enough power all of this coming Saturday Oprah 506 right here that crowd unto the Lord not another thing that we take food for is to build up our body to resist diseases if you don't take food and let your body get weak then it is subject to diseases diseases will break into your bloodstream and you're gone if your blood is enriched and pure then disease will go right into your bloodstream so you got to eat nourishing food to keep her bloodstream right if you don't you allergic to diseases that's what the matter what other Christians did not eat in the food the nourish and food to keep them diseases out of your system of backsliding and coldness and formality and deafness that's what reading the word and praying every day does it keep the diseases of love sin and unbelief out of the system isn't that something oh praise God so don't you come near anyone that has the whiner no I don't touch those what the seal of God in the forehead and I read back in atomic bombs Arlene in the hangars hydrogen bombs sickness and diseases germ warfare Oh God and everything the wait is knowing that the Bible said that man would actually lock in their flesh and don't even die he said cancer is too thick to what's coming man will rot in their flesh all glory to God but the angel was given a commission don't you touch any of those don't come near those with us the wine and oil don't touch those that has the seed of God in their forehead and will realize that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the seal of God not teachings not books not tapes not press and play the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the seal of God not join in church but the baptism of God had to put his seal upon you or not man your mama's can't give it up your father can't give you that your uncle can t auntie no family could give you that so you can't look to this one you can look a husband for this you can't look forget wife God give you this is court to give you this you have to want this or glory the goddess will answer all the problem in your system this will answer the situation around you this is the answer today whatever you can't control or glory to God hallelujah praise God you believe that for this written Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption Lord seal this church tonight those who are wanting the seat of the Holy Spirit Yamini I don't want it if we don't preach it they wouldn't want it you have to want it you have to want to see that the Holy Spirit you have to want to be sealed lord I want to be sealed I want to be mocked this is not a game this is serious all glory to God he says seal doors all glory to God praise God he said okay those who are worn in the seat of the Holy Spirit kissa we'd every fear Lord and seal them with I see of the Spirit in their hearts that they will comfort as newborn babes crying Abba Father I commit them today in the name of Jesus Christ thy son so this message this endtime message was to bring us at a baptism of the Holy Ghost period outside denomination outside of Pentecostals all set up Baptists and Methodists this method was to bring the people into the Baptist module Eagles where you are baptized not educated into the Holy Ghost but baptized with the Holy Ghost or God as a dip in water to get water baptism God dip in the spirit God strong in the spirit what sinking in the spirit when you're leaving you're drunk praise God you don't know what to do praise God hallelujah walking like a junkman that's right Peter said these people and that drunk as you suppose or glow either called him a drunk in the spirit or glory to God not chocolate worries and problems drunk in the spirit they didn't know where the next meal was coming from but they know what who was within them or glory to God had a power they had they had dr. Jesus in them that's my chicken is silver and gold have I none Peter said but such as I have I'd give it unto you rise up and walk in the name of Jesus you mean that coming back it has to come back because we are going back to the faith of the father's Oh glory to God hallelujah hear what I said we are going to write back that'll save the father's church going back to the faith in the father [Applause] all glory to God being given back the message church we came back to the faith of the fathers or glory there Claud what college special what well it's a higher order because corsa behold I will send you Elijah the Prophet we have one thing to do you're gonna turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers or glory and fatherless children 3 and the father's to the children you will be seated it's two things Elijah's spirit was gonna do the latest breathing John the Baptist was turning the fathers describing the Pharisees because Jesus was a church one of the children of that day so they had to turn up to this young man this Messiah I'm going to than Commission yet I tell them Pharisees is not your message now Oh hallelujah you you're inside you see your time is up there is the Messiah will made flesh Oh glory of God and they were supposed to look to this young man this Messiah called Jesus because he went into the temple he took the book he found the place where it was written the Spirit is upon me he was identified the faith [Applause] jesus was the faith manifested Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah I done lost it I've had it and I'm gonna command the trees and command them mountains the Lions Adam had a dog was a son under Dominion not something contained him he was conquered it that is how God want you to be not your situation terrorizing you not then demon and your house terrorizing you you supposed to be terrorizing them when they see you they're supposed to be taken off that is what stinkin on the matter maybe seasonal so let's get this straight god of a certain thoughts when God made man he said I want man in my image and my likeness and I want that man to have dominion over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth God one of them money to be proud of he could boast about because this is my son I am pleased with him don't mess with him don't interfere with him that's not my anointed do my process no have that's the kind of people that God wanted he gonna have that true today he would have that a little all the slack assistance outta here probably pick yoga sadness I look at what what after we gonna break you he's gonna bring it down to zero he's gonna Humble you he's gonna slam you here and Sam you dear but you're gonna get out you're gonna come out or give the Lord a show doesn't matter what's in your Torino it's some to the waters it's some to the flood it's some to great trials but oh I'll country the blood God doesn't care what he said your true inner oh but you're going through or glory you're going through Oh Cory the God that is some way to set you at all I'll learn to trust in Jesus and learn to trust in God let me make you do something unsure we talked about for your child's right now say thank you look for the trials just just give the devil a headache my tongue can board right now right now right now right now open your mouth and thank God for what you're going through right now whether you can pay your rent where they can pay your bills we're in trouble there you're backslidden when you know whatever condition you in bank him right now for whatever you're going through [Music] [Applause] may be seated you know I just did a your Mester Devils might not you met he's messed up right now the devil is messed up Lucifer is messed up because of what they just did there you decide him thank God for your present situation I wanna show what a pretty angels watching them on this angels looking in on this this is unusual you are thanking God that is fit that is safe that is operating fate or glory to God hallelujah maybe season [Applause] so I want to put Jesus in the middle right here the father's here and we hear it's all about him because the Pharisees and Sadducees have to turn to him and then after he came Jude said to Lisa contend for the faith that was once delivered because they start a new jet no it's a triple from the hand it's a delusion then a church back slated for seven years go sending plagues can't go on caterpillar Lucas my army which I sent among you don't be a boxer I go to send and with them you see if you don't do our send this I will send data we'll send the other and he sent it but he also said I will restore so when the Catholic Church grayned the Christian strong into the ground to the dark ages over 68 million Christians was killed under room under potpourri under papal decree they was thinking the doing goddesses and Jesus prophesied that time will come they will kill you think in the - in God a service called zealots and them spirits and I them demons that kill sixty-eight million Christians after the priests people died and em demons then we must hang up in the air waited to jump on on you bunch then demon German Hitler and Stalin and Mussolini to kill the Jews and slaughter six million Jews and in so slaughtering and going after the Jews he dragged them to the hormone God used them guys to run them Jews back into the home and to give the Gentiles a sign or glory to God Israel in the homeland God I bought a wrap up things with the Gentiles and before God go back to Israel you have to seal a bright and alert call the elect to seal the elected lady that's why the Bible says come a rejoice let us rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife that's another woman he ain't no one a Baptist years Anabaptist wife yellow Methodists I'm his wife Madame baptists after that mr. Baptist Madame Pentecostal again mr. Pentecostal but Madame Jesus Christ will get Jesus Christ so he says price or glory that God has made herself ready so you are here to be made ready it wasn't born ready your honey had to be made ready so you come here for a word from the Lord it's not what you know you know it's what you don't know hallelujah come on please answer me it's not much you know you can know everything it's what you don't know after you know everything or glory the court though I have knowledge do I know all mysteries if I don't know that I know that I know that I know when that which is perfect is come if I don't know charity I know nothing or give the Lord a shout glory to God you have a come to our when knowledge runs out a where the spirit begins to take over where it's not your intellect is that your friends and family is what the Lord have for you is what the Lord wants done or give the Lord a shout in the house may be seated miserable either quickly this part this part here God wanted to place his church Sunday daughters wanting to please his church you can't just do something he had to place you put you in a position hallelujah God God put the moon and stars in place enough if it's the Sun can filter drift some way I figure to be the Sun in this position I want a new position it will burn up the moon can say oh god I fed up standing this moon half moon little own big moon I go on my own yet no the moon needs to be there beside me to be there this task need to be clear everything have a place just man older person may taken prisoner is man ultra order you know God business to bring man back into order but the order have the company inside because I can't legislate this order that's why we can't beat the people in legalism into righteousness it has to be internal [Music] so Jesus went so far and tell them the kingdom is within you but outside of you in you have to come in you oh my hallelujah but ugly something struck me people talking about when the press come now which is Dylan and Byron said I feel the tipple moving within me I feel the prefect but for everybody Oh the minute it will have to be in you oh oh that's a big one that's a big one mean the tip will have to be in you or glory to God hallelujah praise God press coming you know oh yes it'll be a squeeze it'll be a tightening tightening you know slowly but the grip is tightening its tightening until you're almost pressed out Oh glory to God then what happened to Daniel in Alliance then when the chat antenna rely on he said the hidden power that was in Daniel came from inside Oh [Music] if the ideas did not deserve in power he make a good lion million on the lion was on the easy minnow but because he had hidden power and it came out when he needed it the power he had on the inside Kamath on the outside and the lion could raw but it could meet him they could walk along and break a touch him and that's what I'm talking about you will have protection inside and I wrong because he angels a lot and camp around those glory of God a believer you may be seated so you think can say something the Bible said the Bible said there's coming a time when men will rot right in their flesh and the buzzards will eat of carcasses before they even die cancer is a to take to what's coming but remember that horrible thing was forbidden in that day to touch those who had the seal of God and that is what we are striving for - to get in watch one - to get in and be positionally placed before the kingdom of God into the kingdom of God before these over strike so it come in but they're gonna strike but before I strike he said we are striving to enter enter the kingdom of God let me put this onto you let every trial and every test push you into the kingdom let every situation push you use it as wing to your wings let the tires make your flight let the testing raise you higher not push your dog because the Eagle have the ability to use the wind to soar higher so when the storms come in the eaters happy because the even though these strong will take them higher or buried or caught them little birds and then sparrows have to go under but either spy higher so you could saw where the Eagles go come on now you are not chickens you are Eagles user trials as wing as wind to the wings that God has given you or praise God amen you may be seated so we find out the original Church the true church is Max and Max sixteen an action it's the scripture that we read coming to life coming into action and he said Jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature then he meant to go into all the world and demonstrate the power of God to every creature so all these mysteries and histories and revelations and testimonies for the past 50 years have to be converted into the power of God that is demonstrable to the entire world let me say today we turn God for the time of the revelation of these things being did known we turn God for all the mechanics and revelations and teachings and doctrines and all these things but there comes an hour when the gospel must be preached and God have an interpretation of the gospel being preached that is not my interpretation that is Klotz interpretation the gospel being preached is not given or Trax is that given all teams it's not telling people what's in a prophet that not the gospel being preached because were being preached that does the playing tape playing hey mister cover being preached that is playin tape we are not here to play tapes we are here to preach the gospel that's a commission from Jesus Christ not from some man in Jacksonville or New York or America or Europe or anywhere else this is from Jesse's will this is from the Bible Jesus Christ go into all over land do what preach the gospel to every creature don't any bull at all don't any bees at all every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth reach the never how could you preach to the bully every creature how could you when you've got what mystery you're gonna preach to the world you may be seated let's go back that over again the Prophet was passenger feel the pray for somebody that is sick he forgotten that feeling uh killable killable the ball hard reputation and tag and everything else on him that's what he is he forget that he had a gun he forgot the gun and walked into the field here come to kill a bug he thought he was gonna have this just stand up there and something came over him he said well I'm a servant of God and I've a bull coming the bull coming he's getting up you got enough he said going like back down because you know and the bush creatures breaks to the wrong light on and he passed normal normal listen to what he said listen what he said you think if he had a gun he was gonna shoot the bull and pay for the bull but God allowed it you see what brothers are loud sometimes goddess protect you from you God wanted to manifest something higher more than a letter or glory we will do the same thing suitable and differ table you may be seated but something came over him he said was the love of God but I say I say is what Adam had in the Garden of Eden the feet that Adam had was manifested when courts they have power over creature over the animal over every creeping thing and he casts a bull go and lie down I'm a servant of God passion to hear to prefer some sick person and the bull went and laid on because if there was the master speaking it was the master preaching it was the same voice that Adam had back there it was the fate it was evidence it was restored so what we presented a event coming it has been here it is here it has been restored Malachi's our center restore the faith it has been restored or glory their core knowledge will be restored to you or give the Lord a shout but that's it is on the earth right now it had to be here if the devil is an irritant what is on the earth if hell is an ear they'll have nothing and if the devil easily let the sons of God on the earth also Loreena God God is always one step ahead of your problems of your situation of your condition you got to want the mind of God for your situation but he's always one step ahead do you believe that so so when he so wait so when he said going early will and preach the gospel yes we could preach nice long messages and nice mystery messages and well well fit together messages but the real things that he meant is the demonstrate the power of God to every creature now in order to preach the gospel before you can make it a gospel preached you have got to have the power and the demonstration of the Holy Spirit to prove the gospel now some people asked what abandoned by man will receive the bathroom Holy Ghost shall we ask God for gifts he said I'm become a stuff he said don't ask what for no gifts you know was he trying to tell him you have to grow in God now is there usually signs and wonders demonstrate you an adult in Christ so now was he put the power to a level of maturity that God's a proof of by character not by age by by so hear me off time say quarters are adopting the sermon he's a defender man he's interested in a man more than the sermon because the man makes the sermon the Sermon flows through the man man is who called C's not the Sigma not the message sweating some people like the past I know we we're ready 'cimmanon lee soo-man elisa.landi nobody could preach like him and whatever it is there's only - level and that's why Paul said this way I came to you not with enticing words of man's wisdom I come to you with the power and the demonstration of the spirit that your faith with rest not in me with my intellect and my knowledge and my information and revelations but might that your fate my rest and the power of God because you know man can't do that when you begin to see the power of God you know is the power of God man can't do that it's the power of God are you with me so watch in order to preach you can make it a gospel preach then you have got to have the power and the demonstration of the Holy Spirit to prove the gospel they let the kill it but the Spirit make it the life so it's not a ritualistic affair it's absolutely a real living reality of the resurrection of Jesus Christ living among men and that's the faith that I am trying my best constant for today that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today forever and this power is unlimited so top unlimited or glory that was shot again unlimited that means that power could do anything it could bring missing limbs back and restore it it could dissolve the cancer it can dissolve your tumor it could heal your eye it can heal your air he can heal your tongue it can heal your spirit it could heal your body it could heal your soul because his power is unlimited [Applause] so cor trying to power the church into unlimited power I think about animated poor think about five loaves and two fishes and Jesus could take that and said just bless let me bless it just take that he said what you have five thousand people to feed the five loaves and two fishes with unlimited power he taketh he blessed him power he said share it all he had looked the same as multiplying it multiply yet it multiplied yet multiply yet it wasn't like that you know he brick had blessed vision shared under brick and shale and brick and share and break I'll share the didn't realize was a miracle there was just breaking and sharing Britain and sharing Rick and Sharon they didn't recognize the past ten people yet and there was still Britain assured when they passed 200 people they were still breaking and sharing they still go realized if it was breaking and sharing as your break it you can charity break it they could share it unlimited power could break and share break and share not breath and keep break and share could imagine they say pass the bread alone and you break internal server and break it out of break at hand break and as it gets into brick as you hand it as it get such a break it you pass it on and everybody one by one they get baskets of remnants afterwards this is a miracle it's a miracle or Chloe the can explain that I don't know what you're going through today I don't know what situation you're in but court could give you a miracle Oh glory to God we believe that hallelujah hallelujah glory know the gospel the gospel commonly believed is the word of God and that is true

teach them the Bible that isn't the gospel it is certainly scripture the gospel came not to you in word only but to the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit so watch that now a seal in here a

professor that will repeat because that was dear bye buddy father's hand now what that was show him God is in heaven thanks for his tune was he stepped into Jesus Christ his second drone it still churn was when he stopped and a man in Peters hat God was always coming down like that so what that shows is that a cuspid man like Peter a fisherman when God firebomb his heart so is dynamic and blow up all them demons and sneak out of Peter and clear that gangway inside that seat and this Saddam insider there the scene is a mount word man you see in the same eyes and the same nose and whatever is

be seated praise God all glory to God in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the wood was gone so watch the teeth a word is the expression of thought because a word is a total Express right it has to be a thought before it could be a word so Gordon it beginning give the thought of what would be spoken by a wood to make it what is for and we see we see we see the word and it produces what God thought was the word is the gospel in C form don't ever forget that see it after me the word is the gospel in seed form ok amen Oh glory to God then he said no other power could work in that bride say a cow poop you can't get a motorbike battery to stop this engine that God put inside that right you have to get the right hand a battery to tumble at engine that engine nut will just start until you get the right kind of power has retained the dynamics of the Holy Ghost could we give the Lord a shout not some man coming from somewhere to pitch a certain message that is that the power we're looking for oh don't call me that don't worry look at the Lord I so don't go there over there don't go there Oh give the Lord a shout now if we take the power of the Holy Ghost to connect with what's inside of you then you become a pulse or coactivator by God and the devil can't do nothing about it he's already said Paul I know that's what the father's had miss I know he's gonna know you all get the Lord a show [Applause] one thing I guarantee you citizen and stupid and Satan have discernment because over these Christians have a light so if you figure your peanuts a shy question I wanna buddies cement you're hidin so when she turns you're like look look look wait look look what you're doing and he's pushing the backside right or because you want to out your light oak tap your own self hinder your own blessing mess your own story up you don't have to do that take a gun crack I can shoot it in your foot pow pow I know trial that you take a gun and shoot yourself in the foot don't do that don't do that shoot yourself in the foot is one thing very devil shoot you know when you should yourself with a bling Paul I know pizza I know MD months you know and present telecast more Paul I know Peter I know because them guys walking with power your name on eBook you really believe this thing while you're using the name of Jesus portraiture you do not fit in what is gospel is oh my mmm let's continue is that yattaman these days he cuttin the backdrop of what I wanna preach let's continue God it's powerless religion I kind of mentioned as well this was kid intellectual pictures a second ative god he's powerless religion it's got to have power in it it's got to have listeners with sincerity ELISA this big one sincerity brings power [Applause] you see you see if I so season you against other churches or ministers and to show me a positive to you and everybody that's negative I am NOT sincere and your feet will be up of witted feet your feet will be resting on me instead of the word and you'll be deceived see if I try to set you up against this one on that one you will have the wrong pictures and in your spirit will be conquer them and when you meet people other churches your spirit wouldn't be right you will smile and skin your teeth but won't be sincere because you will see them as off or shocked or this or that and see them cuckoo but you love your choices to do that because if you receive Christ the word you give everybody to grow and mature and change in their own scenario because this is not the only church and inside this place you have three kind of people treat kind I believe it true believers make believers unbelievers rightness are displeased I know that because the Prophet said that every Guardian have that they not just make a point I'm making a point no you have to believe as a true believer you want to have the right spirit the right attitude the right motive the right objective so you have to get a source of strength by how you operate and that source of strength will be motivation must be love you'll love to come to church you love the Brethren you love the world you'll love the cause you'll love to Silve the scenes you're in love with God whether you give you I don't give you you still tank and many all they're not effects with them you're not angry with them you with silver Murray catalyst that becomes a motivating force you willing to depress you willing to go the extra mile then or go not just for your family but for anybody or glory to God hallelujah you're willing to push you're willing to be strong you will attend courage one another oh boy look at the description a charity charity suffereth long and is kind is not puffed up it's not easily performed believe in all things rejoice and up in iniquity but rejoices in the truth somebody falling back side over he fall I like it happy because you stand in what kind of it is done like terrible you can't live like that say see the things we say and do have us reaction in or quality of if you have questions or wouldn't have fit I suppose that I don't know why you see in that boy he sell for me like somebody said oh my god fight like I say most of them I destroy some people you know me I will talk to you by yourself you know i eyeball two eyeballs were talking to i'd like the true things and hoping the person who supposedly get Ajani when i talk to you direct and really getting it because i tell you so either usually put with the traverse or nobody I use the pulpit to preach the wind not from fusion you recognize the no confusion i back an island I want on Saturday I have none doing that you know I have to do with the vision of the word I know this is first this is primary I want to keep the main thing the main thing that's what we're here for to keep the main thing the main thing Oakland and the main thing is your message or glory there but I do or you run like that money run and say what a message you don't forget me message again boy remember it has some story long time a family story yes I have to see something's very cave to open a man who are unforgettable see you can run it with all the messaging when you run the other polar this is the King's message get out of my way or I'll have the King's message get out huh man win open every devil help at the Kings message get outta my way then you becomes the King message when the devil see you you get out of the way or give the Lord a shout and you and a message as one you and the message the same you become the King's message or glory they're gone sincerity brings power so remember what the Prophet was told you have been given power to bind a member not will be given you are being given power the binder Mamba the Mamba wasn't affecting him the mama was affected bredrin going after brethren testing them to kill them and yet he says be more sincere now it means that God saw something in the Prophet that man couldn't see and he himself didn't know so gorko tell him be more sincere so he went and fast for three days and people mocked him so why did well for he said because God say be more sensitive so he said you have to clean it out he said he believed in purgatory you're fast at all your Priya told you get it home he said your purchase soul here you can expect somebody to put your soul yes I could give you a new dress a new shooter whatever it is but but your soul only God could push that and you have to be able to lay before God and say God take it out your husband can see it your wife cast here yeah cheering casting it the neighbor can see it your boss casting it but God sees a new sneer and you have to ask for take it out rinse it out push it out get it out [Applause] and when you begin to do that then your worship becomes sincere your prayer becomes sincere then power becomes real over you and around you some believe people believe every dream they have is some God every Jimmy have is not some good something because they eat some corn and some things with egg is some dream some boiled corn or who is going to eat was a corn its soup Toledo some things are limited some kind of dream some dream or for the soup your sweater God had gotten ISM the goal is really nothing just this just fell asleep in no man's land just file it on a site so yeah because they cut the Bible gasps scripted fields go talking to them they plain Baptists are yeah Baptists duelist I wasn't about to so I don't know I get back I just got fiber right you wanna reform up a pyramid over that's what I saw did no longer Baptist cotton bye everyone getting scripted content by the cuckoo when you cut them and put it on your hand rest and read and interpret curriculum material that interpreter would have mean they were a feat that means one joining some sister Patricia another Bible and just about idols are coming to me we haven't judges I know them message we play Marcus either we should stop it say we either say we come from she no longer yeah she gone oh my so good so sincerity brings power sincerity brings real worship okay not forms but genuine power ship to know you have passed from death unto life cord wants the perform his word by his power and the final part a cup of this little part we have you know listeners that noted elected God is calling to the elected didn't know it Paulin the virtuous bride the word the lasted Church the elected leader of Allah Jesus Christ Jesus a word how many believe that all right then the bride there we go is always part of the bridegroom so the brain will not be a denomination it will have to be the would manifested to be the Bride of Christ he promised it oh come again come again the bride have to be what the will manifested not talk to fasted manifested this would have to manifest itself in you he said this way by and true the bride will be fulfill all that was promised Oh glory to God by and true the bride will be fulfill all and Jesus said in st. John 14:12 what the Jesus said the same works that I do shall he do also that is the faith of the father's not the same talk I talk but the same works that I do shall you do also because I go to my father Oh hallelujah praise be to Jesus alone allelujah seven seal he said you notice for the endtime message Amory noticed now for the end of time message this seal or the seventh seal is for the end

fathers and this faith is based on forgiveness Oh glory to God so called loose hell the devil loose hell in this message with all kind of attitudes and doctrines and teaching the revelation to try to destroy the faith but what's our inspiration there is going to be a unity of the faith nothing will stop it because of faith SF will be restored and with that restored faith in this group and that

seven thunders of Revelation ten dukhia separated the revelation the mysteries all tied together this seven sealed book is revealed at the time of the revelation of the seventh death of the time of a seven Thunder version 10 if your mockery down let's turn to revelation 10 and he said no he said I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven / with a cloud a rainbow he on his hannel a book open here it was closed stare and sealed no it is open it's been open and since the time of the ceilin we are getting to that book tonight no the book is open Oh glory to God John was commissioned to write and when the seven thunders the voices I was about to write I heard a voice remember sinner to me seal up those things which is seven thunders uttered and write them not oh that's what we don't know that's yet to be revealed or glory to God and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and swear time shall be no more isn't that right in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be finished as he hath declared to the cylinder prophet now see the mystery of this seven sealed book will be revealed at the xiangyan of the seven churches message then the seven is a big in the song and there's the messages wrote out here we cut it and tape and book form so when you are listening to the tape and reading the book you are getting a message that the angel reveal is not like know at the beginning of the song of the message the mission of God should be finished at that time now we notice the book of the mystery of God is not revealed until the seven angels messages sounded now these points are important in the seals cause it must tie together now this book is a mysterious book is a book of redemption and now we know this book of redemption will not be thoroughly understood it's been probed at 468 ages but ID when the symbolism to get the song he winds up all the loose ends these fellas probe that and the mysteries come down from God as as the Word of God and reveals the entire revelation of God so that tap with mystery mystery mystery like is so mysterious the machines come down as the word so the word is preached to you and you get the word inside of you so if you have the word and you you have mysteries inside of you then you have seven mysteries Oh glory to God hallelujah the word and you become

his foot upon the lamb upon the sea with a rainbow of his head no remember this seven angel is only earth at the time of this comment so John Saudi ends up with a more closed no man is worthy lamb step forward Jesus died to get the book because the book had your name in it and for you to comfort only matter be loosed let me change this a little bit your name had to be spoken you couldn't comfort until your name is spoken so God put your name as a mystery in the book and seal it in the words of the book and seal the book so when the book is unsealed your name is unsealed your name is released by the word [Applause] it doesn't leave here a normal level its resource the mystery of the book and you catch your name and when you catch your name the devlins finish in your life because you caught your sonship you caught your gotcha you caught your inheritance so you are no longer a cinnamon an unworthy man no you are chosen you are elected you are for known who is fond you recall we

the Holy Ghost what could I say in 15 minutes that could convict 3000 people is not what the man said is what the Holy Ghost did [Applause] fifteen minutes you talk about a short quick message not gonna shake the whole nation but listen in this part he said god this prophet prophesied God will do in one year what all the religions feel to do in 2,000 years he see you give me a church full of the Holy Ghost God will do in one year we have that here comment that's here where to believe that years gonna come what if that here is this year what if data is this time what is that there is no

father's this is what you call - to go back to the faith of the father's Oh My glory to God you may be seated let's continue and we realize that's in the script over Malachi this would be one like John and Elijah to whom the water Lord can come to and he has to reveal by the Holy Spirit all the missions of God and restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the Pacific father's restore back all these mysteries that Ben Pope that Trudy still Amish aliens I know that's the word I'm justice from before it's written oh my and say then when we come on to the end the last message is supposed to straighten all add up all the issues to bring these things to one fate one Lord one baptism the last message not the cost confusion the last message is restricted up to bring it to this one Lord one faith one baptism what's that another Ephesians let's continue and the days of the song and of the seminal message the mission of God should be finished the hidden mystery a version ten one two seven the last message to the last to teach the hidden mystery of reference ten one two seven is the last message that the last stage fulfills exactly and this age looks something to tea in the son of man reveal notice he about the seven see use of the last message you notice that the seven scenes which all the mission of the seven th ages was sealed in the seven seals the Reformers didn't have time to do it in a day they didn't live long enough but this blessed revelation of the seven seas it open up to us in the last things do you believe we live in the last days when the son of man was to be manifested and then he explained what that is that would be all the word that's God up cholita Wesley Baptist all of that Pentecostal all got up to Revelation or what's been as a history watch the seven angels to open six seal mystery is all to be gone up in the Solomon because Jesus is the seventh seal so William Branham that prophet Elijah could only open six years because Christ is number seven so he open six seals and when you hear the invitation come to the unveiling the mighty God the mighty God was no Valen that prophet he said come to the unveiling of the mighty God and under that message is when he said I talk about hidden mysteries and in the seals he say all their messengers was hid in the seals they were mysteries it had whitewashed red horse but a developer who see the mystery that was behind all that that they were hidden in the seals and you were hidden in the Seas also so you are mystery to the devil and I know you will come out on top on top of whatever you are you will be on top of it [Applause] I know we're act in it right now but you're gonna come out on top because you are mystery Oh glory to God hallelujah glory glory you riding with me this morning Jesus was Christ um the mystery of God and the devil didn't know he was so when he approaches it on Satan approaching he said don't be the son of God if don't be don't just never say I am the son of God doing Who I am get on my wish Satan I am Jesus no no I stopped watching thanks cowboy thing Jesus wasn't in that star boy he sort of thing he said it is written so actually he leave the devil clueless no I know that man different but I don't know who he is Oh glory even me DICE's finish there were still you understand that language just talking about he he was saying the devil you are finished and the sons of God is about to come for because I'm dying I'm paying the price I'm gonna get a book and lose them names and laughs it will come some fearless sons some sons don't care what the bishop and Pope and message Pope and message people and church people on church force what they say second Timothy heady highminded lovers of pleasures and all Adam character see I'm not gonna let them say where they are but you your call to something higher or glory that was finish or complete take some more hallelujah my god so you said never before since the church age did they see these things we have seen today and this was only made possible when God sends 70 seals and give us a sign by it and since seven angels on from heaven and come back and bring back that scattered within them denominations and tied back into the word again to bring down his holy spirit so the purpose of all this scattered wood on all this messages and all this mystery and all this revelation the purpose of God together is to bring down the whole ego is not a big sum or message men and some message spoke and whose manatee hour is not that you realize a repeating that AB is never personal it deserved leaks hallelujah that's why I beat it because it falls it wrong because they take the spirit of the people and put it on a man and that's what we end up with the Pope and Nicollet and spirit man spirit combined equipment and conquer the laity and cuz I hate that I hate that I hate spirit a man dominating over the people he wants his Holy Spirit working among the people working behind the pulpit you have to see his Holy Spirit so I will never hold this back from you because this is the truth and you shall know the truth and the truth will set you free forget the Lord our

am putting a limit on my life and I will never allow a man to put limits on me Oh glory to Corey man alright okay so watch so then do so all this word tied together right the object of bringing a way to get up is to pulled on the Holy Ghost so any world goes to come down to say WOW Oh Oh hallelujah let's continue a little bit praise God hallelujah I say this there's a elected Church somewhere in the world that is pulling on set aside from those things and the manifestation of God has attracted its attention we in the last days the shock has given forth it strengthened to the seed it went on oh it was a good shock but it's service train it's the word bride of the word groom Oh hallelujah so the shock was the only color in the seed and the mess in Italy aside lots of shocks but no they dry up and they go on and you are still here so I have to believe you are the seed that court was prophesied about you wants people coming in message with 70s did not hear no more they back sitting somewhere they out there in the 80's 90's and people left but you still here your struggle you're hanging in there but you're still here but you're here under a promise whole glory that got a promise of the Holy Spirit dynamics to your mechanics or glory of God you yourself becoming God's mechanics you yourself becoming the word mechanic a way think about that part now you yourself become in the very world itself o clock then the spirit get attracted to you whenever you go the spirit goes when the Bible said the Lord and suffered everywhere with them they were the word living so the spirit have to follow the world although he from the book of redemption you gotta fill up this spirit follows the blood so then the blood was upon those he cycles they had the blood on the chest oh god help me Jesus you may be seated praise God that token is the word itself on display the Paul Cain let that angel class called myself at last the token is the blood and oldest on display and the Old Testament meant Moses they take the lamb killed the blood and put them in a doorpost then it was the blood right no it's the spirit right then the spirit talking life has to be on display on your own side that means you have to become the word manifested don't lure that don't make an excuse for that you have to become that [Applause] listen luta fort wesley fort the pentecostal fought but name is coming one says the bible that in the days of the song name the one is run up in Jesus name the Trinity went up and fast on Holy Ghost and so forth but they fought he said no watch then then then is this the time for them seven forces of variation tend to be reveal when the book is finished there's only wanting less and that's seven mysterious voices of thunder that was root and a back side of the book John was forbidden to write I've skipped a little bit and at the time of the seven angels song in all the missions are written a book is completed I mean meters in the book that was broken unwritten within his clothes the mission cord is finished and this is the mission of God to wane over the church and all these things the mission is over when the seven angels songs out every mystery is over let him be who they will God would can feel so what a William Branham brought every mystery every mystery was revealed no man in opacity will have another mission to bring [Music] it'd have no Malakai for junior it have no Malachi forty-second it have no one man in lights a ministry that following elijah elijah will take the bride it have no minor prophet coming after the prophet to reveal more mysteries every mystery has been revealed and the mystery come down as the world and input lists and books and tapes the minister was supposed to preach the word to you and the word is the come inside of you because the secret is the word is in the brag watch that the word is in the bride that's the secret but the secret has to be unveiled therefore the word and the bride has to become word manifested before the world to be manifested the word had to be in you so God put the word in you and in the season time he liked the match because eyes gasolina inside of there and when the devil don't know it when the devil unexpecting it he special much enjoyed and salerio and that has explode inside of you and you become a living powerhouse [Applause] that is why Jesus said the strongest body of cheaters I will raise up myself because jesus knew a word inside of him a resurrection world and I have a time on it within three days like already set so put him down in the grave bury me say I'm dead and God but you will see that you are wrong go ahead Oh hallelujah praise God bury me but very soon you shall see I will rise again I will come again or chlorine Acosta that word he put inside of you is nothing vain [Applause] Laurie that word he put in Sally is not in vain you're gonna come forth Oh hallelujah you can't keep a good man down hallelujah can't keep a good word um all

fought before dude you say you remember the message okay he say might be closer than you think it's got me scared I have learned enough time shall be no more he knows that that time is over what happens could I be so no brethren seriously think then the preeminence kept by the seven thunders let me see it again I think I said it before in 1918 the Spanish plague kill about between 50 million people and 100 million people in 20 weeks or something so they said I was more people died and AIDS and HIV and what let me last 25 years it was a plague sent by God but I banned talk about the

judgment America born in blindness and the democracy has been dismantled in order that that be system come into effect afterwards people gonna wonder is that America I thought that was America I thought it was the land of the brave and free all of a sudden overnight people see things change so quickly you want to know how it is possible it is unraveling before their very eyes all the prophets around in very very eyes once was a lamb speak like a dragon and then the laws and system begin to come down bit by bit piece by piece you got to squeeze it not just one lockdown you know squeeze just gradually just taken another Oh glory to God by that time the third pole supposed to be in the brain not you're looking for to put in order to be in you tell people is Christ in you D fate or glory

greatest world the greater was imparted eternal life by spoken word or glory we will imagine that in path of eternal life by the spoken word the greater was the will I do how you do also and greater

to see that this is your promise Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God in the beginning the promise was Messiah everybody looking for Messiah the prophecy was Messiah John continues the Messiah isn't

understand this promise is we're gonna take your odious stuff if Peter denied the holy ghost Elias didn't fall and be the golden prison Peter remained prisoner but that I have old man prisoner no but because the power board fell then believers know to pray and when they pray the prison gates open up and Peter just wore holder prison guard at the Concord and grab and put them to sleep but keep it a coming out do you understand what I'm saying if Paul didn't have the Holy Ghost when a snake bitten me Diana ten nine eight seven six five thirty one it grew man buried the common poor shake off his stick then looking down the die you know when he when he still standing they say he he's a god they said am I not right here we never know a man got better with that snake and any annulus but the Bible said is I suppose I'll buy them shall not harm them there's the word when the serpent tried to inject a kind of poison sidewall system or we are the antidote [Applause] the Holy Ghost is a antidote to snakebites [Music] like not talking that's real enough if they drink any deadly thing it shall not harm them he drinks on my accident one two three four five still alive because you have

listen SEL you remember the pure message it's the capstone what did it do listen thought we describe it it is the capstone what did it do the Holy Spirit cut of the individual and sealed it when we
