amen amen God bless you if you have your Bibles ID like you to turn to Luke chap 21 want to read from verse 5 to 28 and as some spake of the temple how it was adorned with goodly stones and Gifts he said for these as for these things which you behold the days will come in which there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and they asked him saying Master but when shall these things be and what sign will there be when these things come to pass and he said take heed that you be not deceived for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and the time draweth near go ye not therefore after them but when you hear hear of wars and rumors and commotions be not terrified but these things must come to pass must first come to pass but the end is not by and by then said he unto them Nations shall rise against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom and great earthquake shall be in diver places and famines and pestilences and fearful sights and Great Signs shall there be from heaven and before all these they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you delivering you up to the synagogues into prisons being brought before Kings and rulers for my name's sake and it shall turn to you for Testimony settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate before what he shall answer for I will give you a mou and wisdom which all your adversar shall not be able to gain say nor resist and he shall be betrayed both by parents and Brethren and kins folks and Friends some of that you shall the C be put to death ye shall be hated of all men for my name seek but there shall not a hear of your head perish in your patience possess he your souls but when you shall hear praise God praise God hallelujah praise P to Jesus but when you shall hear Praise just one second in patience possess your soul and when you shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies then know that the Desolation thereof is nigh then let them which are in Judea flee to the mountains let them which are in the midst of it depart out and let not them that are in the countries enter there into for these be the days of vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilled but wo unto them that are with child is them that give suck in those days for there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people and they shall fall by the Ed of the sword and shall be led away captive unto all nations and Jerusalem shall be drunen down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon in the Stars upon the Earth distress of nation with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring men Hearts feeling them for fear for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draw it now let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we have read your word your word is ET your word is true and it is prophetic unto this hour that we are living in Father step by step word by word scripture by scripture line by line as what is to unfold in this end time father speak to us as your people and prepare us for your soon coming granted God in Jesus name I ask and bless your word tonight in Jesus name I pray amen you may be seated praise be to Jesus thank you Lord Jesus and the scripture want to highlight for these be the days of Vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilled and have a title Mercy before the days of Vengeance that's a title Mercy before the days of Vengeance well the election is over and uh Donald Trump is now the 47 president of America we see that play out but what is striking to me is the time that God given us as among some ministers I telling them you know what is the sign for the bride on the inside we seen things unfolding the outside but what about our people and the message come to prepare people and if we are not ready my God God have to extend some time with some mercy to give us the grace to be made ready because understand once that that car without the steering wheel that is to come about next two or three years is now highlight what they're going to do but the thing about it the prophecies is going to come to pass every one of them will be fulfilled is how prepared we are so tonight Mercy before the days of Vengeance that how God describ it you know it come in the days of Vengeance now Daniel 2:21 says and he changeth the times and the seasons he removeth Kings and set it up Kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that know understanding so God know why at this point in time he brought back that man God knows what that is about because he does that he removed Kings and set it up Kings he does that because he is in the Affairs of men now there must be an inside sign for this bride Hallelujah and I'm going to show you that tonight oh praise be to Jesus see the angel of the Lord is on earth now see he's moving around fixing everything for the coming of the Lord now when you come to church you have to come out of your bubble you have to come out your backround your little small little world in your house and your home you have to come out of that to try to catch what God is saying here because remember there's not a book of behavior and be nice and be a Christian there's a book of Prophecy so you have to understand your day and its prophecy concerning what God say and God TS and that you will understand how you are to behave your life in your in your life the angel of the Lord is on earth now now he's moving around fixing everything for the coming of the Lord Revelation 71-5 said and after these things I saw four Angels standing the four corner of the Earth holding the Four Winds of the earth and the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree I saw another Angel ascending from the East having the seed of the Living God he carried a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the Sea so these angels had a commission to hurt the Earth hurt the sea hurt and a angel from the East said hold it hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the Servants of God in their foreheads that's the slot of Mercy when the angels of Destruction have been commission that is the grace that's is the opportunity that God give us that we could praise come into line with that isn't that something praise God and I heard the number of them that were sealed and they were seal 144,000 of the tribe of children of Israel we know that the Jews but before they are sealed there's a bride to be sealed Before Destruction there's a bride to be seal do you believe that oh praise God and we know what happened in 1970 on November 1917 November the 11th at 11:00 in the morning 11th Hour 11 minutes the war just stopped suddenly nobody know how they wall stop it just sto because God stopped it to hold back destruction to call out a gentile bride some of us was even born yet but God had to call out you a gentile bride not for Destruction but for election and the Rapture oh give the Lord some Praises isn't that something so God stopped the and release a prophet with a message to go get that bride so you have been found by God tonight I don't care what you feel what you think you have been found by God God send this message to find you maybe you're not feeling well tonight you're not feeling on top the mountain tonight but this message was sent to find you because God sent Malachi 4 to take out a people for his name's sake oh give the Lord some Praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah glory to God we won't be long with you but we are something Upon Our Hearts tonight praise God Ezekiel chapter 9 familiar scripture he cried also in my ear with the Lord voice saying cause them to have charge over the city to draw near every man with a destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came to the way of the higher gate which L towards the North and every man a Slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was throw with linen with a righteous incor by his side and they went in and Stood Beside the Brazen altar now this is after God was showing them successive Abominations of Israel look look in this room you see what they're doing look in this room you see what they're doing look in this room and God had enough of that and that's what I'm saying don't misinterpret God's mercy don't misinterpret God longsuffering because you in your foolishness and God told it for so long he told it forever don't think that sometime he comes to end of stuff and say I had enough the iniquity is full the cup is full I have to react now I have to act upon that the day of vengeance is at hand oh praise God and this man watch and the glory of God was going up from the CH where upon he was to the treas of the floor and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the righteous incor by their side and the Lord said unto him go to the midst of the city to the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of men that sigh and cry so the bride have to come into that position you have to come in that position this can't just be a scripture you have to be burdened enough just like Daniel when he saw there was two more years left he got a burden to fast and pray he got a burden to press on like never before and I am seeing what open here is a window to press on to the bride Revival a window to press on to receive the Holy Ghost a window to press on that your life can be cleaned up and you can be a people prepared and ready for his coming oh give the Lord Praise In The House glory to God he said go to the midst of the city to the midst of Jerusalem go in the message and put a mark upon them who sign not them who sitting those who sign not them who sleeping those who sign not who tired and wey those who crying and sing somebody have to get a burden you got be sitting in your filthy flesh and expect God to seal you it doesn't work that way oh give the Lord a shout you got to do something more than you have done before you got to press more than you have done before we are the end time oh glory to God hallelujah we will see the Democracy of America just crumble before us because the Bible talk about that lamb speaking like a dragon you see Crush before that and it can only get worse and worse because the object of the devil is to go hunt that Pride he want to persecute that Pride he want to stop that Pride he want to kill that Pride but he can't do it praise God there is going to be a Rapture oh give the Lord a shout we not he killing time wasting time I believe this message with all my heart God sent a true Prophet Oh Glory and we will fulfill the prophet's prophecy Oh Glory to God there'll be one more ride Hallelujah there'll be a worldwide shaken hallelujah praise God I believe that I believe that we are leaving here quietly oh give the Lord a shout we leaving here quietly Oh Glory to God the bride will go up with a shout because the shout of the king will be in the camp Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen watch go to the midst of the city to the midst of Jerusalem set a mark upon the foreheads of them that sigh and cry in other words no judgment until you put that Mark Hallelujah the slaughter Angels got come until you put that Mark oh to God put that Mark first hold back to Wars hold back to judgment hold back that seventh Vision until a bride be seal I want you to be convinced there's going to be a real sealing a sealing of the Bride of Jesus Christ you got to be convinced of that I'm not talking about sitting down here in messages I'm talking about a real sealing of the Holy Ghost you will be sealed with the book just as the book was sealed with Seven Seals you will be sealed with Seven Seals okay the Lord some Praises glory to God seven spirits huj put the mark not upon the Slackers not upon the loose lips not upon the gossipers not upon the people have no life not not not interested in changing there are too many people M talking about that to tell them religious Spirits 30 years and no change 30 years in the same behavior religious Spirit andto the others he said my hearing go ye after him after who after the incon writer and smite let not your eyes spear neither have ye pity so these angels not coming with compassion and come oh God are feeling sorry here who to Smite slay utterly old and young maze little children and woman did you hear that this is not chocolate by they're not a chocolate God this is the truth kill them Smite them who in the message young and old in the message means little children and woman but come not near any man in whom is the mark and where to start begin at My Sanctuary because judgment begins in the house of God before judgment hit this one and that one and that one out there and all them Nation judgment had to start where in the house of God that's why they have to have a sign in the house of God as what God going to do outside we not looking outside for the signs we have to look for the sign inside oh give the Lord a shout before anything is done outside the proclamation the the anointing the the the the the the the fire have to come from inside before Jesus Took up his ministry what he did after he overcome the devil he took up the book in the temple and said what the spirit is upon me for he had anointed me Jesus had to take the book book going and find the scripture read the scripture proclaim the mission Proclaim what the anointed is there for he said to declare the acceptable year of the Lord and he left out the rest the rest was to declare the day of Vengeance of our God and I am telling you that God is extending Mercy before the day of Vengeance because there be a bride and H going to declare their Vengeance no man can declare Vengeance vengeance is mine say the Lord I will repay no man could declare Vengeance it will take God to declare Vengeance okay the Lord I sh that's why Peter asked and ask Z why have you lied to the Holy Ghost oh give the Lord some Praises why you let the devil come into your heart the light of the Holy Ghost Vengeance was an effect judgment was an effect Authority was an effect deity was an effect oh give the Lord some praises the Throne of God wasn't just in heaven it was in Peter's heart oh give the Lord some Praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah utterly young and old and little children and women and not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary and then they begin at the ancient men which but before hallu the house he said unto them defile the house fill the courts with the slain go forth and they went and slew in the city and it came to pass while they were slaying them I was left and I fell upon my face I cried and said ah Lord God will thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy Fury upon Jerusalem then said he unto me the iniquity of the House of Israel and Judah is exceeding great and the land is full of blood and the City full of perverseness for they say the Lord had forsaken the earth and the Lord seeth not what they say in message the Lord delay is coming and then what the Bible says they begin to Smite one another because like the Lord delay is coming we have a a setback we have a space I want to get something and behold watch this and and as for me also my ey shall not spear God saying this as for me my ey shall not Speare neither will I have pity but I will recompense their way upon their head and behold the man CLW with linen which had the income by side reported the saying I have done as thou has commanded me so this sealing angel or this incor writer that incor writer went forth first to express God's mercy before judgment Hallelujah the Judgment was commissioned but the incor writer was sent to interrupt that to give that space isn't that something then oh praise the name of the mercies of God to seal those names to seal the 11th Hour Gentile bride hallelujah hallelujah oh give the Lord some Praises thank you Jesus hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus glory to God glory to God glory to God hallelujah give him some praises [Applause] [Music] let me go to our next scripture here [Applause] [Applause] h [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] M [Applause] Hallelujah listen to this Luke 21:20 and when ye shall see Jerusalem compass with armies then know the Desolation thereof is n then let them which are in Judea flee to the mountains let them which are in the midst of it depart out let them not that are in the countries enter there into for these be the days of Vengeance that all things must be written and be fulfilled Saints regen Believers it cannot be business as usual please Jesus said wasn't days a Noah so shall it be you know what Jesus described they eat they drank they build they got married but the day Noah entered into the AR the flood came and destroyed them all he was describing normal living nothing out of the ordinary you know you go to work you go in your grocery you put gas in your car you drive here you go on Fellowship you read a book you play with WhatsApp you do a little YouTube or or Tik Tok or whatever it is you you watch this and you L normal living but you could do that and you're not in the spirit of God you could do that in the flesh natural missing what you're supposed to be seeing what is happening so the Jews the Christians that believe Jesus words when they saw Jerusalem surrounded by armies and that was led by Titus surround Jerusalem it was a powerful Siege there was in famine it was real pressure but the Christians believe what Jesus said when you see Jerusalem surround with armies flee to the mountains how you fleeing when the Army Sur but you're watching you're watching what the word say yes you're watching what happened outside but guess what happened the Army pulled back the Army pulled back because Titus his father was the Vespasian was called back and when he pulled back the true believers they bust it and run out Hallelujah they took it as the sign of God's mercy because judgment was coming not because Titus disappear tit coming back oh give the Lord a shout Give the Lord a shout in the house hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God praise God Amen brother stepen I some brothers say if that woman get through there this might be the last election in America could you imagine sigh of relief is like a space of Grace to get yourself in order because what coming out will be worse it coming you know just delayed but it coming we don't know how but it will come isn't that right so Titus was called back and when Titus praise God was pulled back praise God the true Christians they got out amen so I was doing some research in it Titus briefly withdrew from The Siege of Jerusalem historical account suggest that Titus with Jo created an opportunity for the people in the city to flee if they recognize the moment praise God so this was connected to Jesus prophecy where he urges followers to flee when they saw the signs of impendent disaster oh praise the name of the Lord praise praise God so the early Christians and Jews who recognize the signs Jesus had prophesied seized the moment to leave the city I hope you could seize the moment to leave churchianity and leave the fleshly world and leave Hollywood and the movies and leave all everything else to get it together because the time is short oh blessed be the name of the Lord things will happen suddenly you know not long and drawn out you know overnight you know things will begin to happen you know so I telling the brothers I I no California bringing so much income and money and I guess all the tech CH down there when Los Angeles sink that could be a real a huge thing for America worse than 911 because California going under ground and the bride will still be here oh praise the name of the Lord Bible call it the beginning of Sorrows oh praise God hallelujah so glory to God so those who stayed because Rome eventually breached Jerusalem defenses destroy the temple and the the massard enslaving the surviving inhabitants and those who escaped was those who was connected to the prophecy of Jesus okay let's continue here now but brandham somebody talk about his dream I thought i' bring it back he said Mr brandham I realized I got to stand before God he said I don't know whether I was asleep or what happened my dream I'm going to say I was dream asleep and dream I taught my son in the market and then he says and he said a voice shook the little Earth and the Earth shook from under my feet and said after it quit shaking I Heard a Voice and brother brandom it was your voice and said I know there was something said it said I'll ride this Trail once more and I started looking up the rock like this and look on past the clouds and way up there on a rock from the East to the West it pointed to shape like a pyramid it run back to the East and there you were standing there on a horse like I've never seen anything in my life Great White Horse white man hanging down and the were dressed like an Indian chief with all the things the Indian use said he had breastplate and bangles on the arms all know like that you had your hand up like that that horse standing in a like a military horse with a PR like that walking and me standing still you pull out the rains went riding out towards the west and I looked down there and there was a whole lot of scientists and the next morning I preach on scientists you know being of the devil and scientists were pouring things in tubes and mixing it and said you stop the hole raise up your hands and scream I'll ride this Trail once more and said the whole earth Shook and them people shook looked at one another like that and look up to you so this was the dream where B talking about I ride this Trail once more now on the fourth seal when he was praying he said this Lord how thankful we are I'm so glad Lord so happy for you and your people you purchased our Salvation on Calvary we gladly accept it Lord now try us Lord by your spirit and if there be any evil Among Us Lord any unbelief of the word any person here father that would not punctuate every promise of God with an amen May the Holy Spirit come down now the white horse rider while his Spirit the spirit of Christ in the face of the Antichrist call his own and call them out so he came around identifying the holy spirit is the white horse rider so what he said I will write this Trail once more it wasn't brother brandham it was the Holy Spirit speaking I will write this Trail once more that's why we keep saying there'll be one more ride so when we say one more ride we mean a riding of the power and the person of the holy spirit of God the Dynamics to the mechanics it is guaranteed it is promised it can't fail God can't lie oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah Hallelujah from myo not he said my only building they always at hand when you're going to see something happen don't you see nothing saying this and who saying that what you're going to see something happen when something is going to take place and all this background here has only been a foundation for a short quick message that will shake the whole nation the message itself going to shake the whole nation that has to be a message of mechanics and Dynamics because we have books and tapes all these years and they Shake nothing so when you talk about the message going to shake the whole nation it has to be more than books and tapes the hour is coming when this world I want you to say Amen to these things when this world will shake under the impact of the Church of the Living God that is moving forward in great power oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah so in other words the prophecy hanging over us is that there's going to come a power that going to be powering the Church of the Living God hallelujah glory to God so listen did destroying angel in Revelation 7 had to wait until the Jews are sealed the Angels had to wait destruction have to wait until the sealing Angel make his appearance even the the the Press coming down have to wait Give the Lord a Shou in the house closing us down have to wait they can't close us down we not ready but the CL that don't even make any sense the Bible said his wife had made us already they cannot close us down until we are ready we have to be ready for they to close the church down they will close it down we know that oh give the Lord some Praises stop the wars stop the destruction stop this and stop that amen [Music] hallelujah Russia have nuclear weapon you know Russia have Satan one and Satan you know one and Satan one or Satan 2 could blow up Ukraine and and pulverize UK to dust you know so what is holding back Russia's hand Hallelujah you think rush you think Ukraine could defeat Russia that's impossible they not gol and David this is different powers contesting these territorial demons principalities and upper spirits the spirits and demons are upon Hitler he doesn't he wasn't seeing Germany alone you know he was Conquering the world all these guys when they get the anointed when hit them so George they riding to conquer the world you know all of them his kingdoms his powers it's demon activity behind every one of them whether the Democrat or Republican behind that is the Lucifer in charge yes and what Lucy want Lucifer want is a Superman a man that he could step into I could read something here will shock you I mean something that we know you know the image unto the Beast that is in churches because they modeling after denomination and that Spirit come into groups and churches they have an image like unto the Beast the Beast is a system that binds the people and don't free them unto God that's the B system the B system buying people to their Pastor buying people to their group buying people to the doctrine bind people to believe and Jesus told woman of the Well Woman the hour come and now is when the true worshippers will worship the father in spirit and in truth brother M said she had a defiled body but she had a pure heart and the Pharisees had pure bodies but a defiled heart take that give the Lord some Praises explain away that hallah Hallelujah fight up with that oh give the Lord a shout is really what what a Gideon preach the matters of the heart oh give the Lord some Praises not matters of the head matters of the heart oh God as a man thinking in his heart so is he God want to know what is sticking in your heart do you have a heart for Him are you going to be like David a man after my own heart you want the will of God for your life you don't want your stinking flesh powered by yourself and your lip and your mouth and your taste and your you don't want that you want to surrender all of that and say God let your will be done in my life oh give the Lord a shout in the house you have to lock God NE no neck for no blessing Hallelujah you're believing for all things glory to God so the councel tightening B say will be a tightening that wait hold your tightening there come that VRI to lock you up they can't do nothing out weight could you imagine that we have the Assurance out a weight but Bram there's a vast difference between a Christian and a holy ghost fil Christian that's the problem the message everybody say they believe they believe what devil believe and he trembling people believe in normal normal and devil trembling when he believe there's a vast difference between a Christian and a holy ghost filled Christian he said we are going to get this from the scripture and place it exactly in the scripture the first place is a Christian profess to be a Christian but if this Christian has not yet been filled with the Holy Ghost he's only in the process of being a Christian he is professed to believe it he's working to it but God has not yet given him his the spirit of the Holy Ghost he has not yet reached that goal with God that God recognized because when God made a covenant with Abraham he called Abraham which is the type of calling the believer today he called Abraham and Abraham moved out of his country went into a Strange Land to dwell among a strange people and that was a type of when God calls a man to stop his meanness repent of his sins he turns them from the crowd he was in to live in a new crowd among a new type of people and then after God found Abraham to be faithful to the promise that God gave him that he would have a child and to this child all the Earth would be blessed then God confirmed his feet by giving him a sign and that sign was circumcision and circumcision is a type of the Holy Spirit isn't that right praise the name of the Lord so but BR say what is the SE however the mark that was put on their head was not tattooed what was it the baptism of the holy spirit that was the mark that was going to be for the last dayj so the mark for the last day is not the books and vials and plagues and Wes how much how much you know the Mark is still this the baptism of the Holy Spirit regards of what Mysteries them fell preach it the word without sensation and all what they say the Mark is still the baptism of the Holy Spirit Oh Glory to God what is the mark that is going to be for the last day question the answer the Bible said the Seal of God was the baptism of the Holy Ghost for the people in the last day no man could give you that seal God give you that seal God promis you the Holy Ghost God promised you to Ace don't let no man take that away from you and talk that out to you you should be hungering and thirsting after righteousness just to be hungering is to be blessed he said blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness what going to happen to them they shall be filled oh give the Lord a shout your hungering and thirsting is a blessing a blessing to be thirsting for God a blessing to be hungering for God oh give the Lord some a shout in the house Hallelujah the Bible said the seed of God was the baptism of Holy Ghost and for the people in the last days Ephesians 4:30 said grief not the Holy Spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption the Bible speaks about amen what is a seal a seal cannot be put on anything until it's complete then he Dro this bomb but punch the Lutheran wasn't sealed the day of dispensation of Grace wasn't completed the preach justification Methodist wasn't sealed but the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the the completion of the works of God hallelujah so the baptism of of of the Holy Ghost produced the rest press to enter into the rest oh give the Lord some Praises however the mark okay I repeat there I don't know how I have that twice now notice this Holy Ghost is a sign I mean the Holy Ghost is a seal it's a sign that God given to his chosen children to reject it is to be cut off from the people to receive it is to be finished with the world here we go finished with the world and all the things of the world and to be a product that God has put a seal of approval on used to work at the railroad out there and we used to go down and load a car my brother duck standing there and when a car is been loaded they go to the car the inspector and if he find anything loose they would fall and break and would destroy he will not seal that car watch anything you find anything loose until that car is completely packed and so packed down and so in order that the shaking of the ride won't bother the product on the inside what is he saying when you get all them things packed into you because we have a shaking right to go through Oh Glory to God and if if it get too shook up and it not packed right you might get shake out with it but when it's packed inside of you you can handle the shaken because everything that can be shaken will be shaken oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God hallelujah every house nice you know every house pretty and nice you know and they paint it outside and have gallery and have porch and everything else you know but he storm may come yet oh give the Lord a shout the test come yet and we he painting Christmas time Hallelujah changing lenium changing window changing curtain but the stor may come yet they change the roof they pain the roof but the stor may come yet is if your house could withstand the storm because the storm is coming Oh Glory to God Wars rumors of wars the storm is coming Hallelujah we are approaching the days of Vengeance not day the days of Vengeance hallelujah praise God you believe that what's the matter we don't get sealed so much we are too loose about things time to tighten up amen deal with the Small Things the small things lead to Big thingsall we don't get seen so much we are too loose about things when the inspector goes through to inspect your life to see if you're not just loose about things and here he details some things here loose about your prayer life everything is consistent but not your prayer life loose about your prayer life loose about your temper so you fly loose and you know little loose about the tongue to talk about others super gossiper lady who brother Bram come out you touch me tonight he said he blast everything could blast he said you don't know that lady she's the biggest gossiper in the church

Hallelujah people want money to buy new car new car loan where they have installments for to pay for five six years they want a car they they want a red car blue car pink they want this they want that they want they want what want but this year they should want my nson preaches the only thing you need from now to the Rapture this Holy Ghost Peter couldn't go on without his and he preached with Jesus Peter couldn't go without his know and he denied Christ but when he got the Holy Ghost he was crucified upside down they couldn't live without it they couldn't go without it Oh Glory to God oh my my my are you ready tonight Hallelujah listen to this I preach this so much times talk about this so much time and this end up so swe see we know this this Tabernacle we will say where she comes to church this Tabernacle is not a holy ghost Tabernacle there is no such a thing individuals that come into this church is Holy Ghost Tabernacle what is he talking about somebody had a vision of a br box and BR talk some a big bucket of water and pour it and it leak right out and then he had a good big bucket of honey and when he pour it it held it would looked like it wasn't going to stick but the honey held so he was given a dream and something like that he said now there's no such thing individuals that come into this church is the Holy Ghost Tabernacles the they are Tabernacles that contain the Holy Ghost but not the church in the body or group therefore it runs out here this part but this man who was pouring the water the messenger to the church pouring the message into the church but what was the water doing it was boiling out the trash that was was in it look how much years back I've been reading this thing and I never see it the way I see it tonight the message is supposed to boil the trash that when the trash comes out something else could be oh give the Lord some praises the message is not to attract trash and bring trash the true message is to boil out the trash not throw it out you know boil it out it must have some fire to to boil it to boil there must have some fire it has to be more than just talk talk explaining explanation it has to be something more than that a boiling water a hot water a cleansing water a cleansing stream Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah what was the water doing boiling all the trash that was in it that is what the Holy Spirit does it boils it up Hallelujah so I have here I wrote this here so the message was sent to get the trash out of the church not to bring the trash into the church but the honey represented brotherly love which is this age which you could have in a group because you can't forgive yourself and you in a mountain with some old bag or something so you have love kindness to yourself and you do your hands so and say God bless you my brother and if faith is based upon forgiveness you shaken your hands and say go Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory I a need nobody else you you're on your own you going nowh with that foolishness so there's a group that you have interaction with that people could wrong you and you could wrong and whatnot and you could come and say forgive me I was really wrong I see things wrong and go clear my mind and whatnot and I can forgive you oh praise God we almost there Hallelujah you enjoying the word tonight nothing new you know is what you already know you know nothing new I want to bring something here to you I have it here lamp's wick oil extra vessel Matthew 25 Kingdom liken un to 10 virgins took their lambs five were wise five were not so wise Bible call them foolish but classic not so wise foolish they that were foolish took Lambs but took no oil with them the wise took oil in their vessel with their lambs while the BR T the all slumbered and slept at Midnight Cry made behold the BR come at so these people didn't expect the Lord delays coming didn't expect the time element to wait they didn't expect all this time so they're ready now no extra I think he coming tomorrow so you're pushing you're pumping and then time while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept Midnight Cry made behold ground come and go and meet him all those virgins arose so this message wake up everybody foolish yes and wise give us of your oil the foolish said unto the wise those virgins Rose trim their lamps th where the wick come in and when K we off the lamp and thing and you had to cut the wick because get Su when you cut it clean out the glass and whatnot light shining good so when behold the ra come you had to cut your Wick put your oil have your fire going good because you the sea the wise answer saying not so give us brotherly kindness Hallelujah Glory wrong timing you're out of timing wrong season to even talk that talk but I knew you long time this oil is to take me out you got to go and buy you had to go and pay the price all the time you're watching movies all the time you're fooling around all the time you're making no sacrifice no effort to show to God you was playing games for years you're reaping what you're sewing somebody say a p your own can roll your own boat go to them that sell and buy for yourselves don't lean on me don't beg me don't ask me you had an opportunity to discipline yourself because the would come to do to discipline and humble yourself that you could set yourself in order to be ready for what God have for you and you could wait for what God have for you look look look Abraham Abraham and lot he he wasn't supposed to bring out lot but lot come he bring his family with him and the to come out and what it caused problems and what did God tell Abraham God a say nothing to abrah God wasn't even telling Abraham nothing until he watched Abraham decision and action Abraham made a choice to call his cousin and say listen not so let's straighten this out we are Brethren you are blessed I am blessed we are all blessed make your move you move East West North you choose why he could have say you choose we would say Wonder this PC is you watching good land and whatnot Abraham he knew who he was he wasn't defined by others he wasn't allowing others to Define who he was he knew he was a Son of God he knew the calling of God was upon his life he know the devil can't take what God put upon him you know the devil can't curse what God have blessed he know he was blessed because God told him so Hallelujah he knew that let look with his eyes and look and look and look and he pitches it towards Sodom without even having no thinking how it will destroy his family L was a selfish man he was just thinking about his own interests not even thinking of what the family could handle but he choose that way at the ending how much people he lost because he made a decision he had something in his heart he had an anchor he had a strong tower but not his family he could have made a different decision but he chose that let's continue while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterwards came the other virgins Lord open to us he said I know you not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour when the son of man come but five of them all virgins five wise with oil he said now you can have the father without having the son you can't have the father without having the son you can't have the Holy Ghost without having father and Holy Ghost but you can be justified without being Sanctified you can be Sanctified without having the Holy Ghost and be clean live a Pure Life and so like that here the part I want to get to there is a wise virgin who had all in their lamps Rapture in faith that's a bum that's a bum the Holy Ghost is rting Faith so if we don't have the Holy Ghost what we going with to leave here we need what rapturing faith there is a wise virgins those who had all in their Lambs Rapture in fate give me all in my lamp keep burning Rapture in FA believe in all signs and wonders prophecies everything else these five cutout of the remnant was taken away and the rest of them are still virgins will not be lost but will go through the tribulation period so all in your lamp is Rapture in fate Hallelujah almost done Isaiah 61 it reads the spirit of God is upon me that what Jesus read Because see the Lord had anointed me to preach good tidings into the meek and this is where it brings Clarity that the fivefold ministry will be the ministry of Jesus Christ I've been saying this for years people challenge it people disagree with it I have nothing to do with that I don't care if every minister in the world disagree with that but I am contending that the this fful ministry will be the ministry of Jesus Christ in the form of Pastor Prophet evangelist and so on like that and I'll show you why spirit of God is upon me because he anointed me to preach good TI to the meek he assem me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the accept of the Lord that's where Jesus stopped and said this day the scripture fulfilled but the other parts reads and the day of Vengeance of our God and then he said this in identify Masterpiece of God he's cutting you down now he's cutting you down to the word only cutting all the Creeds and dogmas and everything away from you trying to get back to the bride first the son another Masterpiece part of the word Jesus couldn't take the place you remember when he read the day in the book he read just part of the prophecy he left the rest of it for the last days we are supposed to take that part which man could declare Vengeance no man so it will be Christ veiling a bride declaring the day of Vengeance of our god do you see it Jesus couldn't take that place you remember when he read that day in the book he read just started the prophecy and left the rest of it for the last days musician pleas so you see he has cut and he wants to cut the church out just like he did the Sun out and this is where you get the free thinkers now the prophet always talk about the cloth that a woman puts into cut a dress it's the same clot but there a pattern that is placed on the clot and is cut out now the freethinkers want to do their own thing act their own way and whatnot and like free thinking but they're still part of that clot you have to be willing to be cut or I'll use another word honed or shaped this is what bride material is like the rest of the church members they come to church and they go back home but bride material could handle the cutting the Shaving because you have to cut in order to be fit and he said that is end time evangelism shaping Stones not Gathering Stones together and just pour water on the stones but cutting the stones that the stone could be fitted into God's program when you know you are fitted in God's program how the Raptor leaving your back you a calling leave anybody there you you are part of the whole body so watch he has cut he wants to cut the church out just like he did the son out like he did the bride and the groom to be his bride you must be part of him not part of a Creed not part of a church not part of denomination but part of him he out of any other kind of form won't work you got to be hewed from the word so a pastor could heue out a church chch based upon his image and likeness and his vision he's not talking about that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's always do it here don't by we that talk is good the word says so but we we no no you want to be cut by the word so that eliminates oh she do do that and she does do that so you want to do it too because that person is so much in the church no you're not following them you following what does the word say so when you see it like that you are being cut by the word and this is where I'm going to close all right brother BR he's praying father God from the little children I got two girls two boys in this room today Lord youngsters Lord send the power upon them look at this prayer other men and women are here with youngsters send the power just now mothers are sitting here and fathers maybe they were dying today they would have to cross to Jordan alone but oh God when they come down to that nearing that Shore when the breath is about to leave the lightning Flash the wrath of Jehovah upon a sinful body that's been born in sin how the breakers will Dash the lightning Roar and the great Breakers and dangerous shows oh God may they anchor just now in Jesus when that time comes knowing there's an anchor that holds that will

the impact of it Lord if you can only find a people who are willing to wait upon the Lord and then he begin to sing later wait upon the Lord then he said may we consecrate our frail boats this morning this little Tabernacle of shameful flesh that we think so much of to work so many days to keep it comfortable place we live in fine homes nice cars oh God and when we get our eyes on that and off the Ransom God let us lay aside these free little things to know that we leave them here on Earth let us seek the Heavenly Treasures the Holy Spirit the true witness of God success never Bears witness of
