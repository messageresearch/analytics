Jes you may be seated praise God I want to appreciate brother Bernard for giving me this opportunity to share the word with you tonight and also Sunday morning but before I read the scriptures I want to read a prophecy that came at the beginning in the in the beginning of the message of Grace uh somebody spoke in tongues and there was an interpretation and and that was uh soam was speaking and he was saying that something changed that morning he had one message and like the Lord he changed it and as he speaks was before I think before he prayed this prophecy came and it says again I've spoken to you this morning by my spirit again calling to your remembrance that I will talk to you this morning by the voice of my Prophet I have given him a message this morning that might seem even strange to him yet it has been ordained of me that your understanding might be made fruitful that you might look upon my work of righteousness that I am working in my church this day that your heart might be lifted up that your understanding might be made fruitful that you might be receptive to these things that I'm going to speak to you this morning that you might become encourage in the way that I desire you to walk in that you might lift up your voices and praises and thanksgiv to me in the close of this service and know that I have been here that my spirit is in the midst of you even now look unto me the true and living God because I am standing in the midst this morning I am rejoicing with you in my spirit and I would lift you this morning by my strong right hand in the place where you can represent and walk beside me in Heavenly places because my desire this morning is unto you that your hearts might be lifted up that you might Rejoice with me in spirit listen to this part and gain this Mighty knowledge and this spiritual wisdom and the understanding that you are going to need need when the time comes and the persecution that is going to come just before I Rapture my bride you will not endure my wrath my children but no you will not endure my wrath my children but persecution will come upon you and beset you on many sides you will be tried and you would lift up your hands and raise your voices on my behalf and testify when the going gets hard I will come down and witness through you I will ward off of you the evil devices of the wicked one because I have spoken to you from my spirit and if you would listen to my voice that I am bringing to you this morning you will have no cause to regret God sayth my spirit oh praise the Lord oh praise the Lord so two things I want to highlight you have often heard the prophet speak about a persecution come into the church and we see it here in Prophecy and this this what was spoken wasn't spoken for that time it was spoken for our time so I wanted to get it clear tonight we are not going to sit in church and just walk into the Rapture no no no no no it's not happening that way a persecution is going to come pressure is going to come and that pressure will separate the men from the boys and the wom from the girls in other words don't press is coming to test and to see what's in us so I want to encourage you tonight this message is not a game it's not a play thing it's real God had spoken by this Mighty Malachi for Prophet that word shall not return void oh praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah so let's stand tonight as you want to turn to Genesis chapter one we were to verse 26 and 27 Romans chapter 8 we want to read 20 to 31 and Ephesians chapter 1 we will read 3 to 5 and 9 to1 reading from Romans chapter 8 verse 26 and 27 oh no we read Genesis chapter one rather and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fall of the air over the cattle over all the Earth over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image and the image of God created him male and female created them Romans 8:28 and we know that all all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are be called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called them he also Justified and be justified then he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us Ephesians 1 from verse 3 to 5 and then we go down to 9 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings and Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love more having made having predestinated us unto the unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his [Music] will verse n having made known unto us the Myster of his will according to the his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ with both which are in heaven and which are in Earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who work at all things after the counsel of his own will let us pray one father God we have read your word I am very needy tonight I'm depending upon you [Music] father that you would release the unction to speak and may your spirit Quicken the word to your people in Jesus name I ask amen and amen you may be seated oh praise the lord well I have a title predestinated to be formed to the word imagees predestinated to be formed to the word image have context scripture from Romans 8:15 and it says we have not received the spirit of bondage to fear but we have received the spirit of adoption where we cry AB father mean that we have a connection with God and a revelation that he is our father the spirit bear witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then you are ears if children then you have an inheritance and if we suffer with him we may be glorified together and then Paul dropped this bum for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us for the creation is waiting on the manifestation of the sons of God oh glory to God in the Amplified that verse 18 says I consider that the sufferings of this present time I'm not worthy to be compared with the glory that's about to reveal to us and in us and conf on us Oh Glory to God we have a great time coming powerful time coming but tonight I want you to know that you are predestinated to be formed to the word image all this message of Seven Seals of seven tund had an objective with God is that right so he said that he is predetermined that you have to be conformed because who he form you he called who he called he justified and who he justified he has already glorified and he has he has predestinated you to this word image what what is this word image and that is what we want to talk tonight what is this word image and if God help us on Sunday we can go into how we are formed but this is what you are predestinated to God didn't set you up to be a nice church member set you up he had a purpose in his mind he predestinated to adoption his longing God to see his sons come to maturity that's CA burden remember there was nothing like him is had animals dinosaurs all kind of creatures but there was nothing like him then God said let us make man in our image and in our likeness so in the beginning God's image came on the earth and Adam was a reflection of the image of God in flesh but man fell and God purpose he will bring man right back to that image of God all the Mysteries all the Revelation is to bring us right back because we are going back to Eden we are not Americans we are not haian our home is not this world we going back somewhere we came from somewhere and we going back to somewhere but we came from God going back to God we don't belong in heaven we belong on the earth so when the lamb took the book John said we shall rain on the earth to rain it's to rule it's to dominate it's to conquer it's to overcome that's our calling to r on the earth as Sons and Daughters of God oh it's a high calling it's a glorious calling you'll be struggling now but one day your struggle will be over because God had purpose that you are going to make it don't try to figure it out who called you who started to work in you who brought you out you didn't start it you didn't call yourself and the god that began good work is able to complete it tell that devil tonight God is still working on me let that devil know tonight God is still working on me oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to godam he said God can write one time there was writing on the wall God wrote with his fingers he said God can speak God can read or let say in the beginning the Bible said the Earth was without form and void no form no shape just a mix up thing darkness and then God spoke God said said let there be light hallelujah hallelujah so when God see things that are not shaped or formed because God is into shaping things forming things not letting things just scatter he's a god of order he's a god of discipline he set the moon one place he set the sun one place he's a god of order hallelujah hallelujah he's a god of form there was no form something had to change that the only could change that has to be the word so he spoke a word and things begin to shape and the evening and the morning was the first day and God said let there be this let there be that he is coming onto something so listen what the prophet said therefore he created by his word he sent his word so all the seeds that he placed upon the Earth he formed those seeds by his own word for there was nothing else to make the seed out of he placed them and they were beneath the water the first man was in the image of God which is Spirit God is a spirit isn't that right the first man was a spirit man and he was in the image and likeness of God then he put this man in flesh and man fell isn't that right then God came down listen he come in the image of man to redeem Fallen man did you get that in the beginning let there be a man in our image Spirit man put this man in flesh that man fell now Spirit God put on flesh to redeem that man to bring back that man Spirit put on flesh in the person of Jesus Christ to come and redeem that man and in this last day God go have them Sons and Daughters veiled with God to go after your Fallen brother to go after Fallen sister it will be God in you redeeming calling pulling drawing that's his purpose isn't that right now let's go he commanded each one of those seeds what it would be and they they would transform themselves into the plant of which any kind of whatever the kind of the word spoke it should be in other words he said every seed bring forth after his kind and that was a word isn't that right because the cre creator has sent for his word listen to this the word seed was there before the real seed was ever formed the wood is a seed right so when God said let there be light that was a seed and then there was light oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so when the word go to you a word seed it's the word seen first before it com to the reality Oh Glory to God do you get it now let me say it again and the Word was before the real seed was ever formed in other words let there be a mango tree let there be a mango seed that's a word people could laugh at it people could mock that's a prophecy mango seed is coming it could take 10 years 100 years and all of a sudden seed is there the real seed so I'm talking about you now there's a prophecy over your life they may laugh at it but that's a word but one day you be a real the Lord one day Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God okay okay watch the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from a seed to plant I love how God operates remember the first major parable Jesus gave the first Parable disciples ask him Lord what what is the meaning of this if you don't get this one you can't understand the rest the word is a SE a saw went for to S some fell on the way side some fell on rocks some fell grw up in with torns and some fell in good ground nothing is wrong with the seed each one of those hearts weide Rocky thorny and good represent heart nothing wrong with the seed the seed is perfect the seed is God but once that seed get into good grow a process start to take place and people don't like process but God is a god of process Jesus could have come down like a big man but God said all a seed a virgin shall conceive Lord prais the Lord Jesus could have come long on the earth as a big man God said a shall conceive now Adam didn't go through that process Adam was spoken with image Adam he called Adam the seed of the word but Jesus he was the Flesh of the word he was the word itself Adam had the potential but Jesus was the reality of God he expressed God in totality oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah so when God put a seed he said the seed has the potential of what he said it would be let's bring it to you tonight the seed that has been going into you the seed that is in you has the potential to produce what the seed said going to produce the Lord you are not weak your seed is strong oh give the Lord a you are not the believer you are not the believer the prophet said the word in you is a Believer Oh Glory to God there is something inside of you the devil can't take out the devil didn't put it in and the devil can't take it put it inside who you who you me call God called you the devil's a liar tonight you have been called by God and you will be conformed to the image of Jesus Christ J oh give the Lord some prais Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah you put a corn seed on this desk you put a mango seed on this desk and you watch it it may look rough it look old but that seed have potential you don't even know how much mangoes in that se because you have to bury it it has to go into the ground and go through processes and then begin to bear and flow and bring for fruit and more fruit and every SE from that mang tree if it fall it could produce more fruit what does God want from us what does God want from us he want fruit come on preach back to me he wants fruit from us and he will have fruit because he said my word or my seed shall not return glory to God my word myed shall return for God didn't waste his time on you the Lord shout in the house God is not wasting his time on you he put something in you before the foundation of the world there is a gen in you there is a g in you of your glory to God whether you feel it whe you feel it or you don't feel it that doesn't change it oh I'm going to get a Revival here I'm going to have my own Revival inside Oh Glory to God God you have something inside of you oh Glory Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah I told her in a church the devil problem with you is not what you was or what you are now because you know your behavior the devil don't know your past what the devil is afraid of is your future what the devil is afraid of what you are to become he know what your was he know what you're struggling right now what he doesn't know is the transforming power in the seed Oh Glory to God the devil that seed have power to be transformed Oh Glory to God Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah is okay to shout if we can't shout here where would we shout this is the time to let of De press this is time to praise your God because he is good or give the Lord a shout he want to Rejoice with you he want to shout with you hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory to God glory to God fire fire in the building build glory to God hallelujah all right okay brother anything that stays in his channel in the line of the word it will bring forth exactly so in other words the mango tree or the mango seed feel led to become a bread fruit or or become Taman tree or become orange tree mang I'm tired of I don't want to be no mang anymore that can't work every seed after its kind every seed after its kind so if God want sons of God in the last days what seed what he plant if God want a reproduction of the original grain what seed would he plant what Original Seed and the spoken word is the Original Seed spoken word the word out of the mouth of God and the mouth of God are His prophets so prophetic utterance Spirit spoken words or Spirit given words Jesus said it this way my words they are spirit and they are life so my word is also spirit so you can receive spirit in word form in seed form so that's why the angel of God the spirit of God that told the prophet pick up a pen and write he said the secret is this the word is in the bride that's the secret that's the secret the word is in the bride this bride is pregnant with God in the form of the word but one day he will throw his Spirit upon that word that's in you and it will be transformed oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the kingdom of God that is within you the prophet said it's the word turned into spirit and power and that's the kingdom in you hallelujah hallelujah that's why he said Jesus said when they said come here go over there go by this church here he said don't with them the kingom is you he said father they have received your word Oh Glory to God who is he talking about people that cursing smoking dring who you talking about Peter James all them guys there wasn't church folks no there wasn't scribes they were rugged fishermen Jesus did not call the church folks you know Andries pH Philip come prostitute you come to this one come and the bright come I will change you I will transform I will do a work for you believe that tonight the one who call you he's going to transform you you will not always be how you are one of these days maybe today maybe tonight how do you not know that tonight is not your night suppose tonight is your night for transformation your mind changed your heart changed your walk Chang Oh Glory to God something on the inside oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah sometime you don't even know how dead so many churches are out there you can't say hallelujah hallelujah say hallelujah people turn back hallelujah hallelujah so long time they praise God and these people claim to see the name in the book which book a copy book exercise book not the Lamb's Book when John show his name John say what even the CRS the had CRS and they had a chair and when L took the book I no I come to worship I come to praise God I blessing and hon and hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so friends you have to know what you're going on to in John one 11 the Bible said he came onto his own his own receive him not here we go but as many as receive him who is him the word as many as received him the word to them he give power watch it to become so this isn't like instant coffee and instant food this is power to become so in other words faith is a revelation but virtue virtue is power virtue is what came out of Jesus so virtue is power that come upon your Revelation to give you power to add the rest of the light Give the Lord a sh that's not a natural thing that's not a natural thing taking a ladder to go here as many as receive him to them he get power power have to come upon you I am prophesying tonight will come upon you because you are predestinated to be form that image what image f virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness kindness charity that image would be ins once more the world direct from God once more people will see Jesus in bright form Give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah Glory hallelujah hallelujah as many as receive him to them give it power to become the sons of God who he speaking about which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of God so he's not talking about your first birth he's talking about the New Birth a born again experience there something superal happen to you to God you can't explain it that's from Grace that's from the message of Grace what happened when the head come when that come it sh of Grace Grace the prophet said if the power is to come among the people it will not be their prayer it will not be their prayer it will be the grace of God Rejoice tonight the grace of God is coming to you oh glory to Hallelujah not by might not by power but by my spirit say the Lord God will speak God has spoken God is speaking Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah what does the transformation how do we get it what does the what does the transformation he's asking the question and he's giving the answer God does it by the spirit of his word I love that so the word of spirit said letter kills but the spirit give it life or you mean it could have word no Spirit exactly that is letter just as the voice what mean is live voices could you imagine a voice without a life a voice without spirit it's just words it's like a lecture so we need live voices life behind the voice so in every age when the devil came in with God raised a spirit Power the ox the eagle lion the man he rais a power against the demon power that power was spirit Power in every age had God's spirit in his people through his people overcoming the devil so when he sent the Prophet The Prophet gathered all the spirit that was in Seven Ages he put it all together because He restored the Holy Ghost itself back in the church released to us the Holy Ghost in word form Glory hallu he couldn't release the spirit as spirit because that was going to make us P church because to handle the spirit you need character Lord I pra are we getting some tonight are we getting somewhere tonight when the Holy Ghost fell upon the Pentecost they speak in tongues cast out Devils heal the sick roll on the floor shout a little bit and then this one go with this one husband and this one go with this one wife because there was no word there there was no life there but the word had the life and the word to a prophet and the PC reject the prophet and then go open opportunity that you and I could get it if the Pentecostal had received the prophet rure going already but they couldn't receive it because he said they were the shock and the shock is the green thing around the seed hallelujah hallelujah around the seed you see when you have the corn is Young it has some green around it because it is Young and you have to protect the seed from the hot July Sun so after a while as the seed get mature pull back church people pull back people who think was with you don't get upset back Rejoice that your seed is getting mature the mature seed want some room oh give the Lord some prais you are God's seed and once you begin to mature the shock becomes dry but the seed becomes golden brown ready to go where I'm golden brown I'm golden brown you make a special sing a song but that golden brown is God getting you ready to die except a corner weat falling into the ground God don't want your POS on top the platform I'm a lovely seed long I take the pH Pastor look at look look at my seed you to bury it now cuz if you die you would bring forth fruit you would bring forth life you have been called out to become a token for your family to become a token for your love you have been called out God didn't call them he called you to stand for them because of you they com in if this don't make you sh if you in a boat and you drunk and you and you fall off the boat and you drunk you can't save nobody on the contrary you might have drunk somebody fighting for your life so you can't be in a drunk trying to save somebody no you have to come out of that you have to be in a safe position you have to be in a power position they say come my brother come without money without price come the spirit and price say come whosoever will I don't care what they have on their face I don't care what clothes they're wearing I don't care what they're drinking and what they're smoking the spirit and the bride have a voice come come come the Lord God call you ahead of them oh give the Lord some Praises that's why God put you here you have a testimony the spirit Oh Glory to God the spirit is here but the spirit is also coming because the spirit is the Dynamics that is promised to start this adoption season Oh Glory to God we can't do it in ourselves Oh Glory to God let me let me just go back quickly in the scriptures Jesus called the disciples give them seeds he know they're not ready yet to handle he told them the works that I do you will do also could you imagine how this talking men who are not converted men who are not changed he giv them promises the same works I do shall you do also as my father sent me so send you why because they are sons and Sons could handle the seeds even if you're ready yet you have to hear it you have to believe it you have to act on it because you a son he's not treating you as a outcast he's treating you as a son and Jesus died two guys walking Jesus come among them he could come Among Us and see a word and he walking with them said what going on what was happening say well oh God Jesus was with us he died they fall years with no Revelation Jesus told them going to die you know what Jesus do he pepper them he rebuke them fo slow Christ was to suffer these things but he gather them together not a public Ministry not on some Mountain Fe when he rose from the dead it was a private Ministry to the elect oh give the Lord a shout the public Ministry for Peter and all of them that was coming but Jesus lock them in open up the word open up the understanding so they they got Clarity they got Clarity of the purp and the vision of God for their lives they had no mistakes they had no wondering they have no question how how how you know that because the Bible say they returned to Jerusalem with great joy and Christ was going Hallelujah GL hallelujah hallelujah because Jesus said Jesus said if I don't go the comforter will not come oh glory to God so Jesus will tell them you have a comforter with you I am with you I am the word I am a comforter but I'm not talking about me I'm talking about another comforter and that another comforter is the spirit Oh Glory to God so he prophesied he said behold I send the promise of my father upon you and he blow receive the holy Oh Glory to God hallelujah and all me in the upper room Apostle Prophet teacher Church janitor everybody was there and to wait because Dynamics was coming Oh Glory to God and I know many men in the message has claim a lot of things and it's only because their mouth saying so no Vindication no manifestation no evidence but the m going making all kind of claims they will be found to be Liars when God come down God begin to do the work there be no doubt he will let it be known among men it will speak for itself oh give the Lord some Praises when God begin to work with you it will speak for itself oh my hallelujah hallelujah so he transformed the seed yeah what he said he plants his seed and throw his Spirit on it and it brings forth the product so what you expect God to do plant a seed and we just have books and tapes and we like seed collectors not working when the disciples understanding open and the word open they decide to go in the upper room and they created an atmosphere and the prophet says the Praises and worship is water to the seed so if you want the rain if you want the water you because nobody knows the trouble see you troubles like if you car whole hold troubles in your I remember a story somebody said one time somebody was in like heaven and they had the cross the back and they come inside said Lord this cross so heavy and the Lord say okay put on that cross and look and pick anyone you want they look and they look and they look and they pick up this one and he put it on and Jesus said but that's he want you come with the smallest one in other words the cross he thought was so heavy was the smallest one every one of us have a cross to beer every one of us have something to carry Jesus said come unto me all and I will give you rest for my yoke is easy and my burden is light he did not say no yoke he did not say no burden he said the burden the devil will put on you my burden is lighter than what the devil put on you and my yoke is better devil put on you oh give the Lord some Praises Glory somebody had to pack that burden GL to God hallelujah brother I'm Pentecostal but not denomination I am Pentecostal by experience you cannot organize Pentecost because it is an experience if you don't believe all the word of God you haven't received the Holy Ghost because when you hear the truth and the Holy Spirit don't lead you to it then there's another spirit in dear keeping you away from it so the spirit you got in the Holy Spirit then he said this then he said this when Jesus was made flesh he was the Flesh of the word of God are you ready but when we receive the word of God then we become God's word in our flesh the church should be in that condition where you know that you receive the word then that's God in your flesh Oh Glory to God don't miss this now after God made his man in his own image that was a perfect man but he fell by the byproduct which is the bride which is Eve he said death come by cross breeding death can't come by God's word the watch it life comes by the word Jesus said my words are life and the spirit Pickens the word and makes it life now what he say here and who who do you say this is and the word anointed makes the Messiah and he said be one as I and my father are one how will that be how would that be the word in us would be the the anointed word that's the oness of God so he's talking about the word coming into you and then God anointed that word in you even Jesus had to say the spirit is upon me he was the word itself but the spirit had to come upon him after you overcome the devil lust of the eyes lust of the Flesh and the pride of life came into the temple Spirit upon him he's now the Messiah the anointed word so right now you are the word but you are to become what the devil is troubling by what the devil is looking at who is this I don't believe she I don't believe him he was a smoker she was an adulterer a drinker who who are these people but that's what God does and confuse the devil so the devil not looking at you because you are something else oh glory to God jacobob jacobob God was looking at something beond Jacob he was a trickster but he was going to be changed he was going to be transformed even his name was transformed so when they say Jacob you did this hey talking to Israel my name was changed don't talk about this jacob thing when I was Jacob but now but now I'm changed I'm no longer Jacob oh give the Lord some Praises I'm a different man glory to God transform change so the word in us would be the anointed word that is the Oneness of God the Oneness of God is the word anointed in you so listen to this so regardless of what you believe you cannot transition from the seed in the soul to the resurrection for body change no there's something in between there we find by Revelation brought by this enti message God put a seed in your soul when you was in smoking when he was drinking when he was in Baptist or Methodist was there so when the message come over you something in you respond to it you can't even explain how it happened but it happened because God put something inside of you isn't that right but listen to this God has to bring that seed in your soul into the process in which it is transformed by those virtues hallelujah hallelujah then the virtues resent in your body you're not going to the Rapture the Rapture is in you the Rapture is not outside in the Rapture is inside out what you on the inside change what's on the outside Oh Glory to God the fire the power that you have on the inside will change your body on the outside Glory power on the inside and power come around the in the old days we used to have um I don't know if you know about it making bigs and I had they had a kind of big got fire on top and fire below and they bake in between they B cooking inside what going to happen power the inside on the outside and your body in between this world wouldn't be able to hold you oh glory to God hallelujah huj Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah so Peter identified in second peter4 all these virtues here and when those are added the son is adopted and adopted in spirit All That Remains is the Redemption of the body but the son will be adopted that son is back in the image and likeness of God Son in ministry that's where the come in you can't press play for this one no a fful ministry will be here I wouldn't have time to read it to bring all those virtues into the church the man can talk that the man have to have that to release that and it will be done there will be a genuine F Min with the ministry of Jesus Christ all right let's go wow the first man he made the first man in His image are you ready and we are returning back to that image to our first created image if there one thing I want you to get tonight is that we are going back to the first created image glory to God to God has said let us make man image going back to that and no devil will stop that because God said that image is to have dominion Glory so if the image is restored Dominion will be evident all the Devils that was conquering you you would conquer them you would step on the nck you would overcome you would possess the case of the enemy because you have returned back to your first image he call it the first created image God hallelujah let's go when God created me William Bram I was before the foundation of the world he made my being my spirit I wasn't conscious of it he said I don't believe you're getting it so when he was preaching this he knew them at that time wasn't getting it are you getting it getting it tonight no wait he said wait a minute Jesus told his disciples that he knew them before the foundation of the world and Paul said here he chose us what you didn't choose him he chose you he chose us in him before the world began are you ready Church there was some part of me and the rest of you here that's in Christ Jesus before the world ever began in other words before God say Let There Be You Will part back there you can't remember it that doesn't change it now remember in the beginning was the word that is the beginning we talking about before the beginning because Lucifer he came part of in the beginning note he wasn't before the beginning so he don't know about before the beginning he could never be you he could never come back for that first created image because when God created Lucifer created Lucifer in the beginning the Angels worship Him Mak him God that's how become God of worship I going devil part are you ready here this big one to my analysis I think that the people today that are possessed with this Spirit or the spirit is part of these Angelic [Music] beings spirits which wor rotated rotated off of God that never fell in the beginning he saying the spirit that you are he believes is part of the Angelic being that rotated off of God that never fell and resisted the devil's life and if we resist it up there we resist it down oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallu oh glory to God I feel like saying the devil had no power over the blood wash ones no power no power over the blush on try to wrap up here really and truly have 10 pages just five all right okay two3 of the earth is in sin and two3 of the Angel was kicked out listen carefully those demon spirits come into people and habitate their body and give them a nature Jesus cast out seven of them out of Mary Magdalene magd Pride [Music] unclean okay them was spirits that was made up back there so when God begin to make man he created those supernatural being those Spirits when he put man in the dust of the Earth the image of the man from the Earth is the image of an animal and when say we got a hand like a monkey and we have a foot like a beard let's switch it now these evil spirits that inhabit people's bodies and give them a nature let's switch it now what do you think the holy ghost coming into you inhabiting your body what will be your nature Oh Glory to God do you see how your nature will be actually changed do you understand when Jacob wrestled all night and he changed he walking with a limp but no fear he had peace because he met God and God confirm his word to him do you understand that trickster that deceiver called Jacob when he is finished God give him the name Israel and that's how we have the country of Israel today because a man wrestled with God and said I will not let you go until you change me he was predestinated to be changed you tonight you are predestinated to be changed I don't care what trouble in your mind I how heavy you are the children give in trouble your husband give in trouble your wife give in trouble it doesn't matter who give in trouble you will be changed that's your destiny Oh Glory to God Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus was the Perfect Image he was the god man God and morphe had changed from Supernatural to vision and then the vision was projected into an image this perfect M Masterpiece let's go quickly now he could not do it in Moses he could not do it in Isaiah he could not do it in the prophets because they there was just a portion of him the prophets were a portion but in this perfect Masterpiece was the fullness of the god body he could not project only Moses he could project his entire being into this person and taste death for the human race he was the Perfection of perfection he was our kinsman redeemer our lawgiver our prophet he come from eternity and become man The Perfect Image and God through the Patriarchs had a platform and he was laying a foundation he began to build his word Abraham Fai ISAC love Jacob Grace Perfection he start to build the body work Prophet after Prophet after Prophet Prophet after prophet and then Jesus John the Baptist was the neck part and Jesus kepa the Old Testament as the head and Jesus become the Cornerstone of the New Testament building a body building a church he's getting back that image the image never left God it is still in his mind got to have it the devil throw down that image in the Garden of Eden in the Garden of Eden Satan came and pushed down that image and God waited for Satan to have his Eden and in satanen going and bring back up oh glory to God that is what you are predestinated Oh Glory to God going to close my God my Lord this body is subject to the spirit okay let me back a
