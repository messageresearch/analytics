in and welcome if everybody's like it turn to Exodus chapter 12 and revelations up to 2250 reading this morning Exodus chapter 12 honoree from this one to 13 and the Lord speak under Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this man shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you speaki unto the congregation of Israel seen in the tenth day of the month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers lamb for his house verse five your lamb shall be without blemish a meal of the first year you shall take it out of the Sheep or from the goats let's go to verse 7 and he shall take the blood and strike it and the on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the houses where and they shall eat it they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire unleavened bread with bitter herbs they shall eat it eat not a bit wrong or sudden at with water but Roose would fire his head with his legs with a pertinence thereof and he shall let nothing of it remain until the morning that was a minute of it until the morning he shall burn with fire and thou shalt eat it which alone is good it your shoes on your feet your staff in your hand which are easier than his it is the Lord's Passover of our pass through the land of Egypt this night and which smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and beast against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord the blood shall be to you for token upon the houses where you are when I see the Blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt let's go to the book of Revelation reading from for his twenty-two a Russian chapter 22 millions of his 10 and he said unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he doesn't just let him be unjust till he were just filthy let him be filthy still he that is righteous let him be righteous still he that is holy let him be holy still and behold I come quickly my reward is with me to give every man according to his work shall be I'm Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed the day that do his commandments that they may have right to Tree of Life and may enter into the gates into the city for without are dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters and whosoever love it and make it a lie I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and the offspring of David the bright and Morning Star and the spirit and the bride say come let him that heareth say come let another tears come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto Him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life out of the holy city and from the things that are written in this book he that which testified these things here surely I come quickly amen even so come Lord Jesus may God bless us well let's pray one more time father we thank you for the scriptures that have been read I repair coming interpreters to our hearts and Lord move upon the hearts and lives of the people that there will be change all together after the service granted Lord in Jesus name we ask it amen you may be seated praise God it's always good to be in the house of the Lord it's always good to be where you could come to hear from God and if you change your mindset instead of coming to church you come in to hear from God you would listen and you receive direct from God so this morning our title I will execute judgment I am the Lord took that from the scripture I will execute judgment I am the Lord subject the token has to be displayed inspiration no free pass no shortcuts God's requirement must be met I wanna read it again no free pass no shortcuts god requirement must be met the even time message is to apply the token so we want to go straight in the world are you ready just to come here to receive fun to hear and to be edified and to be strengthened them to be built up a man we not come here to entertain you you come here because we believe that we have something to say to you from the Lord I just backtrack a little bit from last week you come like Adam like me what about him speaking you become from attribute to flesh to be tempted but when this life is finished here if our earthly temple nappedam naka be resolved we have one already waited now we don't have no permanent thing on this life here we only have a time slot but as the 70 80 90 100 that's all we have to leave here this flesh have to give up one day he told the man in the beginning the start at the dust thou shalt return because he came from thus the first man was not dust man the first man was the spirit man that was the first created image the first image was in dust man Gordon make dust man and put spirit man in dust man but the first created image was spirit man so you are not just flash flash you have to bow in a flash you were spirit Unversed and you have to come back to that recorded empower you in your spirit in your heart that you wouldn't walk after the flesh but you would walk after the spirit because the flesh had a law and the spirit have a law and if the yields of the law of the flesh you will do the things of the flesh but if the yields of the law of the Spirit people do the team of the Spirit you come here to get empowered in your spirit or glory no God you're in comments on knowing the flesh land you're commenting on the spirit man because you're more than meet the eye you're more than flesh and blood there is something beyond your flesh there is something inside your soul that's what the word come to address go glory to God Amen hallelujah hallelujah so we have never listened we have never become the word we just become freshmen not the word because we come from taught the flesh so you walk in the orginal ordinary because I'm talk to the flesh who could reveal that was in a prophet to reveal that we did for granted but that's a revelation that he was any accurate mind of God you can be loss of here trying praise God you come from God they went back to God don't let the devil tie you up he was not there before the beginning he is not property attributes that wasn't God's mind he was created in the beginning with the rest of the Angels when God created angels but you you may be seated but you see in order to stand temptation you have to bypass the theophany you have to come down here in the flesh to be tempted by sin so if you didn't bypass the theophany then you couldn't be helped you couldn't be written that ye listen whatsoever but God to the fall make you skip the word party but because you had a thought Pat a words that thought expressed that means the thought has to come to expression lawyer speak yet to think it so what was thinking about you and we put the thought in flesh and your wasn't any lawyers and dancer with and Pappy was in fact it was invisible but that stopped the thought inside of you when pain comes on the door Peter come on G come sure you are Paul come on now change the man named that's not be talking about you one of you you are who God say you are my God my God listen what a man say you are the physical manifestation of the attribute that you are in God in order to stand temptation you have to bypass your tyranny or your word body or your expression you have to come down in flesh to be tempted by sin and if you stand order the father will come so it went on to say further we strike it last week that here is where your form in the word image and we said you have formed by what to go through that's what shapes you like we like to say this is a building here it was built but before it was a building it was conch it was cement it was gravel it was bricks might have to be formed into a building I might not have galvanized walled material that's not a building nice material but the material has to be built and that's the building well faith virtue all is material all these things in the book is material that's why what else ever faithful ministry to put together the material because you have to be perfected say thank you knowledge temperance patient talking as DC after coming to you actually have to live in you [Applause] if Jesus could live it you can live it because he was the first one first fruit of the Resurrection first one manifested son of God [Music] he's died listen listen to bring other sons yeah die you don't say Jesus save me save me save me and I'm saved that is fine save in your heart right but we're not talking much save in your heart we don't want the display of the token what you have on the inside have to come out on the outside you have to be displayed because you say when I see the blood you can have the alarm the alarm inside the blood inside the lamb if I keep the London of the blood because I have a whole lamb me alone only blood inside of it you want to see blood inside lamb he said kill the lamb get the right kind of a lamb hallelujah first fruit is you are you with me then take that blood and put it on the doorpost on top because I come in judgment I am the Lord this Moses speaking this is some pastors weekend this is God Himself come them to tell them this one have decreed no man could cancel it no man could stop it no man can block it I am coming to execute judgment or shame and somebody and when I see the blood document at all when I see the blood when I see the blood don't tell me what churches or - when I see the blood don't tell all your passes I see the blood [Applause] well a box hidden I don't want to hear that I'm gonna see the blood-drinking Bartos I do wanna hear that the blood the blood whatever happened last night last year I don't care when I see the blood quadric why breath Oh blow it up coordinate you want a shortcut to heaven

the virtue you're still growing the knowledge your servant and getting closer patience godliness brotherly kindness and your break into the spirit you guys closer than that after that I am my father and one ain't gettin closer no more you one with the father now when you see me you see the father because the father is not a joke no is that the ambient virtue power such a leak out from your being

the will son no means just like that you understand the Bible how powerful is and maintenance and inspiration is when Jacob went and dress up because his mother give instructions hold the turkey saw to get the boot right mother knew he's a special child the mother was in on it and he mother said listen to water with a felony now felon alright hero is Britt right put right but--right think about this make a song about it talk about it read it but a paper on their pillow just visualize it like yours brother hallelujah praise God and she was even encouraged isn't that right and after Jacob say Oh God if Isaac Maxine we feeling strange put O'Connell here he's killing me man he's over the hairy man all kind of take the disguise watch this watch this he was enabled by his mother for the right thing their mothers and parents who any of the chair for the wrong thing but that is the naman for the right thing right thing is the birthright and after Isaac put all the blessing down and he saw

here I'll check the visa I'll check it already belong here oh my hallelujah praise God remember remember remember but around get this story about the wedding and in those days the wedding the person will have the marriage and so on be provide the garment so that might not have gone is the affiant of people's got a final piece of garment everybody had to look the same and they get the garment at the door that means of an invitation you present a petition you get the garment you have no invitation you have no comment to get and this man was found inside without the garment and when the king came as a friend he's in normal oh hi hey oh it's just like that how you looking so different who you look is who early oh you oh you're not looking like all the rest of brethren I thought this one faith one Lord one baptism one fire one bush I thought I thought was what I thought was one you supposed to be looking one you see when that's the one garnet you don't know Richard a loophole you don't who have you don't know who have and that's what the Holy Ghost make us humble it make us one I don't care if you have one dress and somebody up and dresses you are still one in Christ isn't that right what did the man say cast him out hand and foot they shall be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth because of what Bertram says he didn't come to the door not me you slipped to the window it was open and you take a chance and take a shortcut what he should have done was kept me the garment and then jumped in a window the only problem is the gamut is on the front door so he couldn't get the gummy could snatch one so you understand boy we can open boy nobody there not eaten no police go my god I'm gonna move it move it no don't my second idea to Ethan agree with the earth glasses sharing you drink like nobody else nobody about a man that you know because he can be a souvent he can be anybody didn't who yes it's many guests they have there is a man come on knowing all my guests supposed to have red orange yellow green and ego violent all my guests supposed to have seven colors all my guests I'm looking for those seven colors how come that that man don't have those colors out he goes no shortcuts not either start he that finishes many start the race but there is one finish in it there have been many churches start many girls are people better be one group finish that's the overcomers and then he went on to define the overcomers not a group who say but individuals it's not the dam that overcometh or a church body is he that overcometh so that group will be made up of individuals who are overcomers do you see yourself as all over come up you have to begin to see yourself as over come on you're still gonna take charge of your life or glory to God and don't be a driftwood and let the stream of life just drift you along Oh hallelujah praise God isn't that right thank you Lord Jesus okay here we go so Israel was to gather together to apply the token because it was exodus time you heard what I say it was leavin time and before you leave it has blood to apply because God good an execute judgment hallelujah against the will and the wolf system against Egypt so God couldn't judge his people along with the Egyptians he had to make a provision for them and we have escaped and he bring that provision to the lamb which had the blood so he give instructions a family a house a lamb for house if you're hopeful too small join with somebody else but make sure everybody on the inside and the outside must be blood and I would recognize that blood as a token that I can touch once that but is there is blood because when I see the blood I'm gonna pass over you if I don't see the blood I'm going to pass through I will execute judgment I am the Lord will give the law some praises hallelujah so they came out get together to apply the token and they had to have faith in that token that under the blood sacrifice that there will be under exodus out of Egypt that was a second Exodus and we are promised a t-rex or us the first Exodus was a natural and into a natural and second a second a third Exodus was a natural and into a spiritual baptism in the upper room but this Exodus is from a spiritual baptism it's a laminar millennium we are live in here it's a rapture train to get he never rapped Express to pick up wit Oh glory that Gordon and hallelujah so the token was their sign of what God was gonna do for them he was taking them up out of Egypt oh praise God so the token what's a token I took is a sign that the price has been paid so when you go to get the bus ticket you know Honda driving by the money you pay for the ticket and the driver takes the ticket the ticket is the token and at some Xena Mia Cara go and take that ticket and ride on a taxi and say listen taxi look look the ticket taxi was a wrong listen wrong please we don't take those tickets you have to go to the bus isn't that right so that talk morning walking sitting please so when God said that token he means that you have to get token and when you get that talking to Joe Vicario that's all right the board when the drivers see that cuz I'm not taking you this is my right this is paid for you have to take me on board I see miss it already okay my candle or some princess people that give you the right hallelujah you cannot be denied because you are paid a price it must be the blood so God made a token give it to Israel no other token will work it can be recognized and you cannot have the token until the fair speed then you are possessor of the token which gives you the privilege of a free pass what give it a free pass up the token so when you're passing just sure you're talking the pastor let your parts not talking you have to stop go and pay the price doesn't that sound familiar wise virgins foolish virgins hallelujah the first device the fullest version had oil you know but they all ran out the wise Bridget an extra oil there wasn't taking

tonight of the children of Israel decision of the country and the king of Jericho sent on the rehab saying bring forth the men that I come to D which I entered into thine house for they become to switch out all our country and a woman told took the two men and hid them and said to us they came in unto me but I wished not Wednesday world and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate when it was dark the men went out with a commandment I what not but sure I said him quickly for he shall overtake them and she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hid them the stalk of flicked cracks which he had his lead upon order upon the roof and the men pursued after them we have Jordan into the Fords and as soon as they were pursued after them they were gone off and he shut the gate and before they were laid down she came up unto them upon the roof she said unto the men I know that the Lord had given you the land and your terror is falling upon us all inhabitants of the land of faint because of you for we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt and what you did into the to kill the ammonites that were on the other side of Jordan sea horn and oak whom you ought to destroy as soon as we had heard these things our harded not neither did they remain any more courage in any man because of you for the Lord your God

time may you bless the services coming Thursday may you bless your people at me you grandchild mercy stop your people and as we leave this place but not real presence may you be with us in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says and the truth says Amen you may be seated for few announcements we have quite a few announcements so I want you to pay close attention service continues this coming Thursday at 7:30 p.m. do make every effort to be here maintenance group to please meet with brother Joelle streaker after the service there will be a choir practice after the service members are asked to meet about 15 minutes after service is dismissed and we also have a reminder about our church praise and worship service and banquet on December the 9th the poster is on the notice board downstairs please see sister Abbey and sister Ruth downstairs after the service if you have not yet registered for that opportunity to come into the house of God and worship and have fellowship and have something to eat and as whether Steven would say it's quite a delicious menu so we encourage everyone to make it out it is being managed a certain way so if you are part of the cooking support then that part is arranged and if you're not one of the cooks or arranging part of the food and is a contribution required the person of $75 and we encourage you to make that payment as soon as possible and ideally by next Sunday so that everything can be put in place for December the 9th and it's it's very important that we make that deadline for that in addition this coming Saturday just ahead we have a youth-oriented service and we call it youth oriented because it's not just for the young people it is for the entire church and for the last few services we have had we have been speaking about life and godliness how Peter speak of God gives us all things pertaining to life and godliness and speaking about that balance that Christian balance of managing within the context of the spirit as well as a natural a school work family church being a Christian your daily walk and for this coming Saturday I believe it's imperative that if everyone can make it out it will be worth the time and the effort because we want to speak about good success in the book of Joshua cartel's just short to meditate on the word dia night and you will have good success how do we define that good success both in the spiritual and in the natural because God wants us to be successful but a random speaks about success he speaks about God wants you to be smiling you wants you to be happy when you look at the biblical principles laid out in Scripture and the way by the brown and presented it he speaks of successful marriage success in your financial life success in your spiritual life so we want to go through the scripture and spend some time as we sit down in the trenches particularly with the young people but what will be shared we know many of the older ones would not have here before and certainly if you have read it before it'll be worth the revision because but the Branham said we ought to be God's advertisement board so if it is that someone sees us walk in the street we should have good success because if you apply the principles as Joshua was instructed meditate on the word day and night and you will have good success then you ought to be successful in your marriage you ought to be successful in your financial planning you ought to be successful in your prayer life you ought to be successful in every area of your life so for those who are not here please let them know that this coming Saturday at 5 p.m. downstairs we will have a special youth oriented service speaking about good success there's no reason as a Christian you ought to be failing exams in school that's unacceptable because whatever you put your effort into you will get two results for whatever you put your effort into if you put more effort into the things of God you'll get more results in the things of God if you put more effort whatsapp and Facebook you will get the results that come with that which really is no result other than wasting time so we want to be able to find that balance with young people and we encourage you with that as well and very importantly as well we are officially making the announcement for our annual convention our annual July convention which will be held July 6th 7th and 8th of 2018 so the announcement officially went up on social media and we will be updating it on our website as well so keep those deets in mind the countdown has begun and we're getting ready for have a grand time in the Lord knowing that one of these days it'll be the last convention one of these days will be the last service but a random said one of these days will be the last song one of these days we'll read the Bible for the last time because it'll be homecoming time but before we leave this place we want to do all that we can do for the kingdom of God and for his people and in closing I do want to encourage you I was reading this morning where the Prophet was speaking and he was speaking about children right in his church and he was saying and we have a responsibility and he was speaking to the mothers and he said don't you know that you are preachers you said we speak about a woman preaching but I'm talking about the woman you are preachers in your houses and you supposed to preach to your children and he was making a point of we have a responsibility to share this gospel we have a responsibility to live a life and but the Branham a believer about two weeks ago we spoke about it but the Branham said he felt so bad that he did not do enough so I want to encourage you this coming week be an influence on somebody's life there are only two influences where the random speaks about influence from above and influence from below but the reality is we are also an influence the people around us and we have a responsibility to be a positive influence to somebody's lives because the enemy is using people to influence one another and we have a responsibility to tell somebody about Jesus tell somebody about the Prophet tell somebody about this message tell somebody that there's hope beyond just the bills and living the life but there's a land beyond the river and even though we are trapped in time we are really creatures of eternity and that we are born for a purpose so have a wonderful blessed week and give the devil trouble I love her but Ruben said he said he has gasoline because when he is driving he wants to leave smoke in the devil's face and you need to have enough gas to leave smoke in the devil's face so this week I challenge you to leave smoke in the devil's face I challenge you to lift your head high and lift your hands in worship no matter what trial comes your way no matter what situation comes your way you are born to overcome you are born to make it you are born to be victorious the trials are just to push you into your position the test is just to push you into position every obstacle you face is to push you into your position and with the random tortas perfect fit is based on your position so when you get into your position now you have the authority to speak to the devil and see Satan get out the way because I'm on my way to Kenan slam and it's gonna be well so may the Lord richly bless you with Anthony breeze go any man says yes just come and dismiss you out a man god bless you I sing that song as we leave I want to be ready I want to be ready I want to be ready to walk in Jerusalem just
