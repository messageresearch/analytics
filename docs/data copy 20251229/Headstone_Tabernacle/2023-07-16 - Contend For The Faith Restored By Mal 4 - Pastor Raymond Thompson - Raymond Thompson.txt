by God's grace amen now uh tonight I want to salute but reman Thompson I know he his wife has gone on to be with the Lord it has been more than a year that I know he started back preaching and sit me appreciate his stand for the word and he stands tonight as a Time tested Memorial I see him as an elder in the message he has been many many years as a soldier of the Cross preaching his glorious

God bless you tonight amen certainly appreciate our precious brother Theo having me to bring greetings to this convention and I believe all of us would like to salute but to and his team for having us here the government of the church the L and all the ministers that have us here it has been a rich blessing it's for the first time being here I recognize that they pull aside all the generals of the convention apart so I suppose the reason for it is to salute them for a job well done amen amen they have been a wonderful repres presentation of what God's Prophet called God's dress we amen and God's dress we will say what the prophet has already said so we really appreciate them we thank God for the blessings of the meeting I have been privileged by God's grace to be here physically for two of the services I followed the other two other three virtually the question is to ask what else can I add but I recall being a school child and we were taught repetition is the mother of learning so nothing is wrong in repeating ourselves amen there's no harm in being repetitive remember Noah's message was it's going to be it's going to rain children is going to rain they have to hear it until they receive it are to hear it until the work for them and we as a matter of fact the very message we believe in amen the very message we contend for tells us say what I say so being repetive is not wrong amen praise God Amen so the team of the meeting contend for the faith amen and Jude in his letter here addressing Christians addressing Believers addressing the Sanctified addressing those preserved addressing those called amen and just 23 years after the first church was set up he invit them that you should earnestly earnestly contend for the faith amen nowhere else in the sacred writing are we invited to contend but as brother Del shared for us last night amen hallelujah we as much as we are not to have contentions we are asked Amen to contend for defeat amen so contention is all right it's good to contend that's right if it is for the right thing Hallelujah it is good to contend we are not to contend get in the world of sin get in the world of argument get in the world of Doctrine and head knowledge and content for a kind of contention that get us angry and get all kind of spirit but we are invited to contend for the faith contend for the writing and not just content but to earnestly contend earnestly earnestly contend what it is to contend it mean to debate it mean to hold fast hold fast to your conviction earnestly content earnestly content mean that what we hold on to is between life and death Hallelujah earnestly content honestly argue honestly fight earnestly for the Fate so we are invited not to let the faith drop Hallelujah don't let the faith drop what are we to contend for this evening is it a historical God no is it a historical Affair is it a faith it is not a Fai it is the faith so we are inviting to contend Hallelujah for the faith contend for one faith and earnestly contend for that Faith what kind of Faith the very faith faith the Saints had amen and when you find that Faith contend Fai Hallelujah when you find that Faith content for it not only to argue but to hold fast yes to upheld to stay put to believe it to contend for it now if we ask ourselves all of us will say this evening that we are the people who are the ones who are earnestly contending all of us will say our church is contended we we are contending but question is are we contending for the whole thing the thing we need to remind ourselves amen you know God's Prophet tells us don't seed on anything that's right are we spending our time contending for our interpretation are we spending time for contented for what we see but our invitation is to examine our faith by the faith that was delivered to the Saint not our ideas not our thinking but the examine our faith Hallelujah remember 33 years after there was a falling away amen 33 years that group got tangled up in a short time what about 57 years what about this group 57 years after the passing of the Prophet what about us we need to examine ourselves by the grace of the Lord so they were asked to contem after a short time they got off the track they got off the beaten path what about you and I tonight amen this message that the Lord has blessed our hearts with God's prit in the message God's chosen place of worship tells us how fitting and matching this is to Luke 17:30 when the son of man Eagle will be revealed in himself I want you to look at this to bring to North all other places of worship is see what we have to content for is see what we have to contend for this message has brought to not all other places of worship yes to bring to not other places of worship that's what the last day Eagle is to do to show the whole rest of it is foolishness denomination is folly to point them again with the same sign that at the end that he's the same yesterday today and forever so we already know the rest is rubbish we already know there's nothing to the rest there's nothing to the rest so all that we have as a matter of fact the only sacred thing we have is this message there's nothing in this world that is lasting there's nothing that is holding up nothing nothing Family Life politics whatsoever you call it but the only sacred thing we remain with is with the word of God Amen so God's Prophet put together Jude 1 and three and he tells us Jude 1 and3 is written to all the churches all Church but is specifically for this age come on church we are the people amen it's specifically for this age it's written for all you know this is the people who are called to content remember the Apostle Paul amen he witness a situation and he said amen in Acts 20 he said Grievious w wolves will enter you have to watch for the Grievous wolves Grievous wolves will enter in not sparing the flock Hallelujah come on we have to contend amen God's Prophet described them Wolves of sheep stealing dogs they are going to come along amen Paul's testimony is that once I am gone they will try to come and claim a equal Revelation so you see where the contention going to come from Pentecost will give you no trouble have I said enough the denominational world will give us no trouble as a matter of fact they out is not you know what North is North is North you could multiply North how much you want it's still lot but they're going to be Grievous wolves once I have gone there are some foress coming that why God's Prophet tells people like us God have a hard time after he bless us to keep us humble not only us all of you we want to be bigger than God okay Hallelujah so God's Prophet tie those scriptures together amen so just to close off now I just want to share a quotation to you that I believe is very significant in our Battle of contending I rest my keys Christ is the mystery of God revealed Wesley was a man of God but what followed him Fallen Angels what was the Angels the first created beings of God that fell for Lucifer's wisdom fell for Lucifer and you see what they become fallen angels and he has show us a pattern that fall Angels follow Luther Fallen Angels follow Wesley Fallen Angels follow Pentecost you think is only ask yourself where our where this Fallen AG is going to come from is going to come from among me and you you see what a contending we have to do you see how we have to guard the door you see have to guard the entrance the last one and he shows us that in a man who can turn on the light and in turning on the light paragraph 250 there's a man who can turn on the light now you know you ain't going to take a Pentecostal and deceive him with a Methodist Doctrine or a Baptist Doctrine you ain't going to tell him that he knows better you you ain't going to deceive some Baptist with a Lutheran Doctrine either and neither are you going to receive the message or see the message now in this word by some Pentecostal Doctrine he's showing us a pattern deception where deception going to come from our deception ain't coming from the Catholic our deception not coming from the Pentecostal oh our deception is coming from the fool God bless you God bless our meeting God bless our firing Soldier appreciate being here and let us content between life and death amen do you appreciate Reverend Albert green

you that was so beautiful and everyone else that greeted before the ministers may God richly bless you and uh may his Blessing rest upon your lives can we stand as we read the word of almighty God Matthew 7:10 Mark 16:20 Ephesians 41-6 amen Matthew 17:10 and I'd like you to listen to the scriptures and the quotes that will be read there's a special reason I'm reading tonight and uh as brother rblo said uh brother Peter came from a different angle he came from a different angle so tonight I'm coming also from a different angle but we all contending for the same Faith amen so it says here uh 17:10 and the disciples asked him saying uh why then say the scribes that Elias must first come and Jesus answered and said said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things so there's something striking there they ask him about Elias but he's speaking of another Elias that must first come and restore all things okay so he says here uh then he turns around but I say unto you that Elias is is come already and they knew right and they knew him not but they have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise so shall it also be when the son of man suffer for them then listen the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist wow so then we go to Mark 16:20 a very familiar scripture if you have it and they went forth and preached everywhere watch the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following them amen and then uh Ephesians Ephesians 4 and we read from verse 1 to 6 therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that he walk worthy of the vocation where with ye are called with all loneliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love end end endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace there's one body one Spirit it says here even as ye are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all whom is above all and through all and in you all may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated God bless you uh forgive me for rolling up my sleeves and taking off my jacket but uh I kind of feel more free when I do this uh I he brother all laughing you can see me doing it [Laughter] today yes sir so uh I got a title to tonight One Faith one Lord one baptism now there's not many faiths there's only one Faith as much as it is declare I don't know how many thousands of denominations is out there he said but there's one Lord One Faith one Lord one baptism my subject now I was just going to say two things but I thought hey people will wonder what's two things so I'm putting here Malachi 4 is to do two things amen so that's message talk right inspiration and brother Theo this is Ty still into your inspiration let's contend for the faith restored by Malachi 4 and you're going to find out as we go along please stay with me it's not something different but but Malachi 4 had something extra that the early church had that's right that's right so if we're going to go back just to the early church we're going to find out we come short somewhere because Malachi 4 restored more then what Jude was speaking about and brother Delhi I don't know you were a student I checked uh ad33 when he wrote it and then I CH I checked when did John write The Book of Revelation and they said at he died at ad 98 so maybe when he wrote Revelation I don't know if Jude was born or even wrad but it's not the contentious issue right contending but not contentious thank you sir so let's look at this a bit he says you earnestly cont for the faith the faith that was once delivered to the Saints then the first one to introduce the faith for the Christian church was none other than Jesus himself now this is beautiful because he says contend for the faith once delivered to the Saints but the one that introduced the faith was actually Jesus Christ and you're going to see why because it starts with him and it ends with him oh Hallelujah he was the introduction of the faith that was to be handed to the Christian church do you believe that now we'll have to see what he was we'll have to see what kind of a church he organized and see what kind of a Doctrine he preached and what kind of The Works he did and what he left for the people to do and then see if the disciples watch now so he done it first so that's right and then he had to watch now what the disciples is going to follow and how they going to do and he says here and then see if the disciples if they done the same thing he did and the way he did then we'll know by the Bible what the faith is that was once delivered to the Saints so our first example is Jesus Christ then if the disciples come back and do what he did then we know okay that's a faith that was once delivered to the Saints h Hallelujah okay I want you also to I don't know if I must even read this but just to let us get into it Malachi 4 behold I sent you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and then Brahman says and is the conjunction and the hearts of the children to the fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse so there has two portions two things happening here and I was surprised brother Theo every time I check I checked uh Jude he connected it with Malachi 4: 5 and 6 so brother there's a connection there's something happening and I know you're going to shout because you know this that we have is greater than what Jude was speaking about it's greater than what Paul had Paul had signs he had wonders he had Miracles and we all want that but you know there's more than that Hey Brother the last restoration is greater than the first Hallelujah so put on your shouting shoes man don't worry who's next to you the only way you're going to get the presence of God you better aim in that word say that for me say that what I believe you sit there you're going to stay dead but if you start acting brother you become alive you show the devil on whose side I am he didn't let the devil win why do you think you're here brother you fought through battles you fought through everything but here you are the devil didn't win oh Hallelujah I Feel the Fire of God then we must watch that's the faith that was delivered he says yeah now remember this is just 33 years brother green after the inauguration of the church Pentecost 33 years later there there has been such a falling away until Jew says yeah under the inspiration brother Theo of the holy spirit is sending the letter to the churches to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints now if we can only find out what kind of a faith the the the first Saints had then we can find out what kind of a faith we can find out what kind of a faith we must contain for brother Del yes if we don't know what the faith was what are we contending for but the faith is oh my God help me so content for is that right but we must remember what kind of faith faith it was now listen here he says the disciples thought repentance and you might say but brother Amon this is all Beginnings we all know it you start I said but listen here something hidden here right this the deciples taught repentance water baptism Divine Healing resurrection of the Dead manifestation of the power of the Holy Ghost signs wonders spoke with tongues interpreted tongues cast out Devils heal the sick open the blinded eyes saw Visions you mean that's the first church then what does the Omega Church do if that was the alpha Church what about the Omega Church brother the Omega Church needs to have this in it [Applause] and I'm going to say something the Omega Church does have [Applause] it so the Omega Church has got to have what the alpha church has so it's got to be the same and once we find out what they had then we preach repentance we preach baptism in the name of Jesus we preach lay on of hands we play healing brother Deli said last night he has signs he saw tumors G brother I saw the dead been raised I saw a woman in our church she had a a cancerous tumor brother and they didn't give her much time to live she came for prayer and she went back when she went back tumor is gone no more cancer brother why the alpha church has got the same thing brother signs wonders Miracles brother Theo you have it in your church brother green it's in your church wherever you go you can speak signs wonders Miracles but we need [Applause] more oh Hallelujah we need more brother and there is more you're going to find out this message brother it's not just another message it's not just something that came by the way it's not something just that came and and to give you no you're going to find out brother it gives you something more than healing more than oh god oh so he says here now I have to skip and I put the the ones in Red so that I don't have to read the whole quote there's only one Faith One Faith one Lord one baptism and that's the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ is the only Faith now he says here uh now he's addressing this telling them that those that are Sanctified he says yeah it's not a faith that was delivered it says it was the faith that was delivered do you notice there it says the faith was once delivered to the Saints not just a faith some people say well that's against my faith and you might be tonight say man this gu with a message I I'm not with him it's against my faith brother sister you're going to find out there's only one Faith one baptism one Lord not three Gods it's one God and if you baptize in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost it's a false baptism you need to be baptized in the name of the one God the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah not just the faith Hallelujah listen to this my I like this one are you ready brother he says earnestly content for the faith he says the faith that was once delivered to the Saints what was it my he's asking a question himself the faith that was once delivered to the Saints what was it you know what's his next words the spirit of Christ in the apostles that's the faith that was delivered to the Saints so we're not preaching a God that's far off we preaching a God that's here that's in the people that's in these ministers that's in the people tonight that's the faith that's the faith brother so where you walk the Holy Spirit walk where you go Angels go why the holy spirit is the faith that was once deliver to the Saints he didn't let the devil win he thought he had you but now the the Holy Ghost got you woo Hallelujah the Holy Ghost is in you my [Applause] Hallelujah it says the spirit of Christ in the apostles that's the faith and he says the Lord went with them watch how beautiful the scripture to do what to confirm the word so it's not not our word it's not it's not mine it's not mine hallelujah it's not for me to bring this word to pass sorry man it's not my it's not for me to bring this to pass this is already Vindicated this is Vindicated By An Angel by a Prophet by the pill of fire so it's not on me it's up to God God send the message God send the prophet God send the Holy Ghost you must believe it yes Lord yes Lord it's for [Applause] me my everyone want to protect the message it's not your duty the holy spirit is here oh that Mighty angel with a swear back Wings he's yet to uphold this message it's not going to fall to the ground it's not going to be grandle brother I don't care if the whole world walks away I don't care every church member don't believe there's going to be a bride that believe this word that will stand and uphold it why there's an angel the holy spirit is that angel [Applause] Hallelujah so if the Lord went with the Omega bride that means the Lord goes I mean went with the alpha bride that means the Lord goes with a Omega bride so no matter what they say you know Hallelujah I like to say this don't become a product don't become a product of some man's opinion or some woman's opinion and say are you not nothing headstone is nothing this church is nothing brother there's their opinion but when I read this message it tells me I'm a Son of God it tells me I'm going to be adopted it tells me I'm going to receive the Holy Ghost it tells me I'm going to fill with the power of God so brother who do I listen to not to the world not to the church not to any man not to any group I listen to God God in the prophet said I'm a Son of God he said I'll be adopted he said I'll be perfected Woo is there a shouting [Applause] [Music] house so we got to be so careful what we say about one another because the Lord goes with the people the Lord goes to confirm the word hallelujah so don't say no there's nothing happening be careful wow I I wrote you Simon the Sorcerer in in Acts uh 8:9 he saw the power of God and brother Isaac he was deceiving them with line wonders and attracting the people here come Phillip on with the true baptism of the holy spirit filled with God and he come and he did signs and wonders but yes Simon the Sorcerer sees that he deceived the people but when he saw that power hey he wanted to buy it brother Cosmos he wanted to buy it you can't buy the Holy Ghost you can't buy the message of the hour you can't put a price on the Holy Ghost you can't brother the Holy Ghost is a gift to you God promise you the Holy Ghost you shall receive the Holy Ghost it's yours by promise no amount of money woo Hallelujah my god brother he the lion of thank you man and and and and Philip told him die with all what you try man he he almost cursed him and he said please please don't say anymore you see that you can't buy this power and people want this anointing you can't buy this anointing it comes by divine inspiration it comes by the preaching of the word the Holy Spirit follows the word the spoken word brother stephanus the Holy Spirit follows that to bring it to pass Hallelujah so tonight you mustn't worry who's next to you you must get loose if you're worried who's next to you and who's going to brother you'll never receive the Holy Spirit but if you break loose tonight and say it's my brother watch the Holy Ghost come to you and meet with you and you'll be full sealed [Applause] baptized so he says addressing it you may be seated to the to the Sanctified ones now the Acts of the Apostles are showing what the acts the Holy Spirit did by the Apostles so we have an idea what must happen the Lord working with them so he says wasn't so from the beginning it wasn't so from the beginning the way they got the holy ghost at the beginning it's got to be the same today now now I'm very worried of our churches in the group I mean our churches in the message our groups because they getting away how did they receive the Holy Spirit man they were drunk under the power of the Holy Spirit brother BM says you Catholics mother Mary was staggering under the holy spirit before she could go to heaven so if they got the holy ghost acting like drunk people how are we going to have the Holy Ghost when we sit all dead and still we got to say God it's me God F me you got to stagger under the anointing of the Holy Spirit woo Hallelujah I feel fire on that man and this comes fresh brother B says you know the Antichrist Spirit Works within the framework of the church Amen brother Greek he didn't say outside the Catholics don't hurt us he say within the framework of the church that's where the Antichrist Spirit work to do what to make the church cold formal look warm he says but what must we do do we sit back he says resist that spirit resist the spirit resist the spirit we fighting we contending we contending for that Faith you got to Worship You Got To Worship You Got To Worship young people you got to worship amen Worship You Got To Worship come on come on we got to worship Mama come on we got to worship you might not do it in your church show God

show God on whose side you are tell the devil you're a liar you didn't win man God gave me Victory and I'm here tonight for victory Woo is there a shout in the houseall [Applause] H Hall that's beautiful now please when I when I come down I want to see you standing right so I'm going to say be seated but when there's something anointed stand up and tell the devil that's for me Satan tell God Lord that's for me and what the blessing come to you my woo Hallelujah brother Peter feels good here man you men Anointed The poof man yeah so if God ever has a church it's got to be the same kind of church like the alpha church so you can't say I I'm contending for the faith but I'm sitting you know I love the Lord and I'm in the message and I do no the alpha Church acted like drunk people until they found out they went to Peter they say what what man of people is this the the shabin are closed the bottle saes are not open and they're acting like drunk people you know what Peter said they are not drunk like you suppose but this is that this is that spoken by the prophet in the last days I'll pour out my spirit on All Flesh All Flesh All Flesh young old less man he pour out upon you glory be to God I don't know if I'm going to finish tonight brother but even if I don't finish he will finish he knows how to take care he knows how to touch he knows who's hungry he knows who's pulling on

demons knows that life where is that life today where is that life today it's failed in you the Holy Ghost is failing you bringing you to the image of Christ that's why demons are scared of you you

the pill of fire veiled in you why you're a son and a daughter of God I want to come back and then here come Legion and bow no one could tame the man he broke chains now you see why we get people to

tonight I'm cutting You Free by the word of a mighty God the spoken word is the Original Seed and they said give us permission to go into the swine and he gave them because it wasn't time for to men yet and he says go in 2,000 not even the demons wanted to live with the I mean not even the pigs wanted to live with the demons and yet people are prepared to live with them amen they smoke this Oka pipe they smoke this drugs you must see back in South Africa what the it's like what has gone wrong with the world that's why I'm so glad tonight I'm in Trinidad and I'm preaching the way I'm preaching because I'm here even if it's one Soul one one young person one mother one father that's supposed to go free I'm I'm here to let you go free tonight the Holy Spirit can set you free not even me the Holy Spirit can do that and you know what they changed Jesus away from from gadara you know what brother Ben says it was a the same tribe of GAD that was prepared to live with the Enemy he says was in gadara that's why they chased them away look how that thing come back on your Generations your decision you make tonight is so important because it's going to come back on your wife on your children on your children's children on your grandchildren on your great grandchildren why because the decision you made don't speak against this people rather say Lord make me a part of it tonight I want the Holy Ghost I want to be saved I want to get you something so you may be seated so in the message circles we all know Malachi 4 and it speaks of two Messengers first one was John he'll come and turn the hearts of the fathers to the children who was the fathers Jesus and the disciples they were the fathers so that was John's job but he said Malachi 4:6 says he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers wow so it's not confusing because John had to turn their hearts back to Jesus that's why I introduce him but when Malachi 4 comes after 2,000 years he takes the hearts of the children and what does he do he turn it back to what the Pentecostal fathers oh I feel a shout coming on me brother so you mean Malachi 4 was sent for a purpose to bring back and restore now there something beautiful brother Peter in in in in in uh Jude the faith once the delivered but yeah in Malachi 4 BR ISAC it's not delivered it's restored so one is delivered one is restored oh I hope you I hope you see that brother so it was delivered to them it was ordained for them but then the Palmer wom eat it and the caterpillar and all they eat that what they eat it to a stump but what did he say I will restore woo I will restore brother Delhi I'll bring that church back I delivered it they ate it they killed it but now I'm raising up Luther I'm raising up Wesley I'm raising up Pentecost and here come Malachi 4 He restored the Church one was delivered the second one is restored once it's restored you can't kill it again Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you see they could kill it brother green but not this last three cuz there's no other ages this is the finality that's why it's so important to recognize the message of the hour if you're not in the message you better run from your church get in the message you're going to find out only this message thanes you nothing else nothing else I don't care where you run to I don't care how much money you have this message takes you in the Rapture this message is going to change your body this message is going to transform you this message has got wapt you in faith so every time you go to Jude brother B refers you back to Malachi so somehow he connected that two together so you can't separate it it's there I can read all the quotes here but it's going to save time he says but it does not say that the hearts of the children will turn to the fathers that he says watch is yet to take place the hearts of the last day children will be turned back to Pentecostal fathers John got the fathers ready for Jesus to welcome the the children uh into the the fold now this Prophet upon whom the spirit of Elijah Falls will prepare the children to welcome what Jesus back now in this brother there's something happening John here welcome the fathers right at the first coming of Christ but this message comes here right at the end what does he do he welcomes the children back to meet who oh come on man you mean so I have to believe this yes you have to believe this in order to be to introduced to him John said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the son of the world only John knew him why he saw the dove coming down who was this prophet he was baptized in the 17th person here come the same light came down a voice spoke and said as John the Baptist forun my first coming your message will forun my second coming this message for runs is coming so you can't be in a denomination you can't be in the church you got to be in the message you got to believe what the prophet said you got to believe this message otherwise no rapture no Rapture you want to go in the Rapture believe this message come on come on young people come on mother father let's give God a shout man let's give God a praise come on young girl let's give God a praise thank you young girl God bless you God bless you Hallelujah come on come on come on Hallelujah my it feels good here man I feel the anointing I Feel the Fire of God this message will take you in the Rapture this message will give you Rapture in faith this message will turn your hearts woo hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh forgive me man sorry I'm like this man hallelujah oh and I love it hallah because it sets people free I seen people at the back amen that wasn't God bless you for doing that not because I ask you respecting Christ and God will reward you for that he'll give you the Holy Ghost for that because he's showing you [Applause] loving so he says there's a compound meaning showing Elijah and Elias to come so it says when he comes he will turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers so it's be back to the original message now you see why you can't go in the Rapture you want what Paul want I also want that I want to shake off that serpent in the fire you know you know what I'm saying I would like be like Peter like to walk on the water my wasn't that great but you're going to find out we got something greater it's going to change his bodies Y come on oh Hallelujah there's something great brother it's going to change our bodies he says we hardly have faith for the Ric let alone Rapture in faith so what step forward something step forward more than what Paul [Applause] had oh [Applause] my okay I'm going quick here brother Theo then he says here also you will be God's mouthpiece and as he declares as it is declared in Malachi 4:6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers now I hope you see that some so John the Baptist time is pass that was children to the fathers now we in Malachi 4 now we back to what the the children to the fathers you mean brother ammen something changes in this dispensation and that's why we needed a prophet no one knew that that's right and your heart can only be turned by this you're going to find out so he says yeah he will bring back watch turn back to the fathers he will bring back the elect you mean this message calls the elect hallah you not here by accident God knew you'll be sitting here and this message is to call back the elect your name is on the book be the for the foundation of the world your name was written in the

supposed to come to restore what to restore back again the faith of the fathers once again the revelation of God in Christ now may they see the revelation of God in the human beings we can all admit

I'll have this before yes overnight it can happen you can wake up tomorrow and wow the skies are full of the genuine Holy Ghost full in you the apostolic faith the Bible teaching everything will be in you woo if you're not serving the lord you're going to go to your mom and dad says mom I want to be baptized I'm sick and tired of the world I want Jesus woo we not leaving a hoof behind not one child not one backel and child we taking them with us hear that Satan we taking them with [Applause] us here's another one but he says behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day shall destroy the world he'll restore the hearts of the children back to the original Faith so this message is promised to do it it's not going to be maybe or halfway it's going to be a full [Applause] restoration restore the hearts of the children back to the original Faith back to the gospel back to the power of God back to the real Holy Spirit back to Christ again before the great day woo Hallelujah now I I'm rejoicing over that because I can't bring it to pass but he said before the coming of the Lord you will have all this in you he promised you'll have the Holy Ghost he promis you'll have Apostolic Faith he promis you'll have power [Applause] hallu wow he says you can kill the messenger but you can't kill the message so they killed him but he said in the days of the voice he's not here but his voice is here so they kill him but you can't kill the message H I have to bring this in two things it's very important and I think brother the will connect beautiful and it's not a Doctrine please it's brother brandham this is a quote from the prophet so when I read he don't say ah there we go be very careful he says in the Lan Church age now this message mess of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things so in other words the whole message is wrapped up in two things brother Deli two things so the whole message brother Isaac is wrapped up in two things because this messenger is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he's going to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers you want to hear number two number two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that will literally turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers so are we preaching restoration well then Malachi is for he's going to do two things one according to the message he's going to re the mysteries in Revelations do those Mysteries contained in re is going to literally Hallelujah and tonight you in the turn he's busy turning you I feel you turning and he says that's going to literally turn Hallelujah brother Isaac there's going to be such a power of Dynamics when the Holy Spirit Falls and he pours out that Spirit from beneath the seven seal they won't be able to stop stop it brother get in the turn tonight don't say I heard that before don't be foolish that's the prophet so we can't do away with that as much as we have good servants this is a reality man this quote is a reality we have to preach it I could have come here with a nice sermon but the Holy Spirit say preach the two things you don't hear them preaching anymore nice sermons flowery sermons but nothing how to become a statue of a perfect man nothing of that nice sermons of butterflies and everything but brother that's why I say this je didn't speak about now don't say brother Raymond is taking out Jude please I'm not I'm adding this to Jude brother L you said don't remove the landmarks but you can add to the landmarks right so we're not adding or taking away we're just reminding the people listen this promise takes you in the Rapture I don't care how you know the message how you School yourself how you can create quot it from A to Z if you don't have these seven Thunders and the Seven Thunders gives you Rapture in faith now we're not speaking of a normal Faith he says because what we have can't even heal a headache we need something to step forward to give us what Rapture in faith and this message will give us Rapture in faith brother I challenge anyone here tonight we need Rapture in faith come on mother we have headaches you have toothaches but you need Faith to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye you need rapturing faith we need that faith we need to get in the turn we need to believe the message we need to believe that brother because there's a Rapture don't you want to go in the Rapture you want to go in the Rapture sis you want to go in the Rapture well those seven Thunders will take you in the Rapture woo Hallelujah those seven Thunders will take us hallelujah whether we like it or not those seven Thunders is going to take us brother green God bless you amen amen we got to preach it man we got to preach it no matter who it offends no matter who it hey Lord help me and don't say it's a Doctrine man it's not a Doctrine this is the prophet's [Applause] [Music] words brother Isaac I had a battle must I do it Hallelujah but two things you know the whole message can be W up up in two things Hallelujah so if you don't preach this I can I can preach the own messages from two things am the whole message is wrapped up did you know brother Brandon was sent he re he revealed all the six seals the Loose Ends if you go to Matthew 24 Jesus even kept quiet when he came to the seven se he revealed all the six seals but he left the seven seal but he sent this man the the lamb came to this man the son of man stepped forward into a son of man and he tore open that seventh seal brother and under that seven seal was your name your name is under the seven seal not the six seal the seven seal brother is there a shout in the house where is your name seven seal brother so we have to preach that [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah and then I'm going to close but I'll skip he says this message will introduce Christ to the world did John introduce Christ well this message will introduce Christ that's why we preach Christ we preach love we preach forgiveness we need the image of God in us so if you sit there tonight and criticize it's not the spirit of Christ say Lord take that from me tonight says this message will introduce Christ the seals is Christ the token is Christ the Holy Ghost is Christ love of God is Christ the seven virt is Christ the restored faith is Christ Christ in you the hope of Glory Hallelujah I like this one Luke quoted it now if we want to think for a few minutes that the seven Church age mess was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers now watch every time it's restore not delivered that's powerful man because it was delivered brother uh over but in this day now we come back 2,000 years it can't be delivered again must be restored so there's a process of restoring and he came back but he finally came to the top oh now the fruits are on the tree Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness the Holy Spirit and Charities hanging over you ready to seal you with the baptism of the Holy Spirit may it be you my brother tonight may it be you my sister tonight that gets filled with the holy [Applause] spirit thank you Jesus okay just to emphasize and to show you brother brma had a preview of The Bride right and he saw the first Bride come walking beautiful hward chran soldiers marching to war beautiful long hair cloaks on but he says they went past him that was the Omega bride I mean sorry the alpha bride here come the filthy bunch and brother B says I almost died to think as a minister all these years is this what we produced he says I couldn't even look at them when they
