on low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts in the midst of the eldest of the lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seventh spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him and sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts Four and Twenty Elders fell down before the lamb have you every one of them Hops and golden vials full of orders which are the prayers of saints to take the book and to open the seals thereof for that was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy

the throne and the beasts and the elders a number of them was Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand and thousands of thousands saying with the Lord voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power

son his feet the Spillers of fire he had in his hand a little book open he said his right foot upon the sea his left foot upon the Earth cried a loud voice as well and Roar it and when he cried seven Thunders under their voices when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write I Heard a Voice from Heaven said unto me seal up those things which the seventh and assaulted and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that lived forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that they're in now and the Sea and the things of Daring are they're in that there shall be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he shall

for the angel that will set his foot on the land and on the sea and raise up his hand and swear by him that lives forever and ever that time shall be no more he said at that time the mystery of God should be finished we understand no father that God's threefold mystery has been known to us and we understand that we are looking now for those mysterious Thunders that came out from heaven in the Book of Revelation that was seen in the back of the book revealed to us O Lord the things we need of for the battle ahead of us you hear that prayer revealed to us Lord the things we have needed for the battle ahead of us forgive our sins our many neglectful things our iniquity we pray God this afternoon that he will do the exceedingly abundant above all that we could do or ask or think oh blessed be the name of the Lord you believe that this morning praise God our title seven steps to bring down the Capstone praise God as my title this morning seven steps to bring on the Capstone I

because the cap seals the whole thing oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah glory to God and then so let's go for the brand I'm from go with Jesus I've always thought the church wasn't a haphazard Jesus never came to Earth and a half hours at we he never died in a haphazard way he come for a purpose and that purpose was to fulfill the Commandment of God that he might purchase to himself a church without spotter wrinkle that church is a predestinated church [Music] every name that was ever put on that book Jesus came to redeem [Applause] and when the last name is redeemed the book is closed not last name saved not last name get a spoken with book when the last name is redeemed the book is closed and redeem is to bring us back to where we were before the Lord I shout in the house do you understand this is a little more than 100 book and a tape this is you in the church you hear long enough to get baptized with virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience and godliness and probably kindness hallelujah praise God all the virtues Oh Glory to God hallelujah redeemed in your soul redeemed in your spirit and then the Final Redemption Redemption toward the Redemption of your body oh glory god the Holy Ghost come to capture your soul oh hallelujah praise God and fill you with fire oh Hallelujah and then your spirit redeemed with a living faith I live in virtue living knowledge all glory to God may be seated there's no man put these Seven Virtues in that pyramid is a mighty like a prophet but he lies went into second Peter 1 4 7 and he fitted in the pyramid and he identified the first Bible the Zodiac the second Bible the pyramid and the third Bible is what we have here and this pyramid going to be in you oh glory Lord this Bible gonna be in you the Bible and the pyramid is the same thing a pyramid go be inside of you and the city be going through it's built like a pyramid okay the Lord I shout the lamb Gonna Be The Light or give the Lord a shout glory to God amen amen a pyramid bride going to a pyramid City I saw the Hallelujah [Applause] listen watch therefore let's do it again every name that was ever put on that book Jesus come to redeem so when that last that's why he couldn't miss you that's why he had to find you the message from you you couldn't miss it when a Hindu Muslim Baptist whether you're catholic whatever Pentecostal whether you're a witness whether backslidden I don't care where you was gonna Define you because every name that is on that book Glory listen to this which book the book we read about in version 5. hallelujah what version 5 says praise God praise God hallelujah praise God thank you Lord I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside C with Seven Seals the book was written within but the backside Hannah writing on it it was a sealed with Seven Seals but your name was in the book so because your name is in the book the book have to come down to call you Revelation 10. I saw a mighty Angel oh Gloria God come down from heaven let the book open [Applause] this is not your mother Church okay the Lord I shout glory to God the mighty Angel has descended and the mighty Angel is here oh give the Lord a shout the angel is on the Earth right now [Applause] fixing things are wrong for his coming [Applause] [Music] every name the devil were put in that book Jesus come to redeem not save this message is not about salvation this message is about Redemption not salvation you can go to some Pentecost church and say you're saved they can go to some messages and say yourself but this is not what we talking about we're talking about the wonderful glorious baptism of the Holy Ghost break every spiritual knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and the Holy Spirit the faith we had seven things Oh Glory to God Amen [Applause] therefore therefore watch back up again we still can't go to this quote here every name that was put on that book Jesus came to redeem and when the last name is redeemed the book is closed now he didn't intend that no one would be lost but it's for knowledge and let him know who would be lost therefore he could predestinate and then their names were put on the book and when that book of redemption is closed and sealed with Seven Seals while the work by the mysterious powers of God and someday when the book of redemption is finished the lamb takes it and when the lamb name is when the last name is Call of the Lambs come forward to call for what he has redeemed and that's the coming of the Lord you come to get what he has redeemed you have already purchased like you go to courts and you buy some furniture and you have the receipt but here Collective furniture yet you have the purchase and power you have the evidence of purchase and you go back someday to collect it you back up your truck and you say put what I paid for on that truck because of his minds and when God back up is struck and tell the devil all what I purchased put it on that truck you have to give up you have to let go sickness have to give up cancer have to give up disease have to give up the girl have to give up okay the Lord I shout in the house Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God let's go no one can be redeemed unless they were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world who are they I don't know if the prophet don't know which mango no one tell you a shock and you can't make it they don't have a heaven they don't have a hell tell them shut up no man can keep you out the kingdom and no man can put you into the kingdom the kingdom of God is preached and every man every man one more time every man pass away until get the Lots on Praises oh God no Pastor to put your kingdom no Bishop no Deacon no Elder no church could put you in this kingdom is by one Spirit God has taken and deeply and baptized you into this Holy Ghost there is going to be a holy ghost Revival in Trinidad okay the Lord some Praises I can't talk about nowhere else but there is going to be a genuine genuine genuine original Holy Ghost Revival I see all things are possible okay the Lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah to get some Doom Devils on the Run Hallelujah [Applause] what who are they I don't know nobody else knows surpasses a liar who tell you you're not in a bride or your shock or you're not I can't make it he's a liar Lies coming out of his mouth Hallelujah who knows nobody knows he said nobody else knows just God alone I am trusting that every one of us our names are on that book if mine was on there I'm sure to be there if it wasn't I won't be there that is all it's up to God is that him not run it but God damn sweat Mercy unless you know God has shown you Mercy you have summoned the praise God about that's why when the lamb took the book and Luther seized thereof they begin to worship they begin to shout they begin to dance the elders cast on their Crown the ball word is the Lamb that was slain for thou has redeemed us what's that word redeemed thou has redeemed Us by thy blood okay the Lord I shout in the house my feel good this morning well glory to God present tense Redemption that was redeemed Us by thy blood out of every Kindred of every tongue ordinary Nation Glory love God [Music] [Applause] how come if if the message will claim they see the name of the book and they have no praise no Rejoice then what book that is a Catholic book that is why they can't shout that is book do you understand for your name to be in the blood section oh God what's that section now not just the book The Blood section of the book it means he for a new you before there was a moon before there was a star before there was a beginning Oh Glory the court he was in the back part of his mind he was thinking about you and he put your name in blood he come to adultery fornication lying drunkenness all kind of stuff but you made it anyhow Oh Glory of God you come

to his infrared Mercy is child and forever I am oh God help me this morning they can't keep this fire they can't keep it they get out it the devil then started he came out it okay the Lord has shout where was thou when I lay the foundation of the earth and the mornings are sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy thank you foreign [Applause] let's go there's some future home of the brand second of August 1964. listen to this profit by these passages one might think that the whole planet of this Earth will be destroyed all right I make a new Heaven and I knew it that the heavens will be gone and it will be gone completely unlisted but a close study with the help of the Holy Spirit we can see the truth of this it is only the atmosphere around it and the sin that's upon the Earth that will be destroyed it says disappearing on the heaven disappearing no it's the atmosphere and we realize that Heavens means the atmosphere above what does it do these tissues and sickness and death and politics and sinful man and silver woman and evil spirits will be gone and deleted it will be done away because we are going to live right here shout out right here right here you have no wings to live in heaven Oh Glory to God hallelujah you have no wings to live up there you are going in a holding place a hold and be the sixth Dimension where you're waiting and compassionate and what did John said though has redeemed us unto God and has made us Kings and Priests and we shall peace out rain on the earth look at the Lord some Praises but they call it the rain in heaven God call you the rain right down here we shall reign on the Earth all right let's continue all this in existence in the earth now man-made systems politics sin or can I even spirits that the world is contaminated with all heavens above us in here contaminated with evil spirits we're gonna get deep in it all that exists the atmosphere the Earth which is now the Earth holds those things it wasn't made for that purpose sin causes to be like that and all of our bodies that we live in now was put on the earth when God created it [Applause] so one God said let there be Earth he was saying let there be your body because your body comes from the Earth so when you go and sanctify the Earth sanctifying our body giving you a new body you have it here for me you're my body you're coming with a glorified body back on the earth oh glory to God do you are you with me for all our bodies that we live in now what's putting the earth when God created it because you are Out of the Dust of the earth it was all laid out there when God himself created you were in his thinking and in him the great Eternal was the thought which is the attribute Hallelujah Satan is still here that's the reason or he is still here and all of his evil forces are still here notice why the earth now is fulfilled why this come and ridiculous things goes on Bloodshed War politics sin adultery what kind of Fitness goes on because Satan is the ruler of this Earth and this atmosphere you say the atmosphere both the Heaven and Earth now is contaminated with Devils that accuse us before God Jesus is there to intercede for us while the accused I keep pointing a finger they did this they did this they did this but the blood still covers he came to redeem the elected he foresaw oh God have mercy notice God may explain to us his Plan of Redemption testosterone my soul when I saw it he makes plain to us the Plan of Redemption what God has done to redeem his people he done the same what God has done to redeem this world he done the same plan through them as people so when the Earth was baptized with water in Noah's day it was baptized what was he doing Redeeming the it when Jesus died his blood shed on the ground he was Redeeming the Earth and all the Earth will be consumed fire fire baptism which is the fire baptism we have to have we have to get of the Holy Ghost on Fire just as God within the Earth so if you only get water you have blood and you have fire to come if you get water and blood you have fire to come but your car escaped the fire the fire is the spirit of burning the fire is God's judgment upon you for Glory to come and he consume the world consume the sin consume all the unbelief and there is nothing less but God himself oh give the Lord some praises hallelujah praise God let's go first step repentance towards God isn't that right then water baptism is not right you can't repent for what Adam done you've never done it Adam did it you just get forgiveness what you've done the old nature is still there so you repent but the old nature is still there they get baptized but the old nature is still there you really spoke one box but the old nature is held there but what Peter's talking about was divine nature okay the Lord some Praises for help me preach somebody Oh Glory that what Peter was talking about wasn't the old nature the Hidden Mysteries hitting you but the old meter is out of here history hitting here but you hold it inside of there or cannot keep Revelation deep interpretation hidden mysteries on the Mysteries High Mysteries no Mysteries all kind of mysteries but the old nature is still there but she Peter said I Hallelujah divine nature I'll give the Lord some Praises or get me started this morning oh glory to God hallelujah sitting in church 20 years in a message but the old nature still there but that gonna change after the day that's gonna change we'll give the Lord some Praises there's a seed in you that the devil input and the devil can't take out okay the Lord some Praises that seals in your soul come on now [Applause] foreign technical thing do some stuff for that but he draw a heart is I'm long as I'm being an artist he's a human heart and over here is a snake in it that is sin and he has his life this one over here but govern it which is Holy Spirit and he has a life too it's a heart have a snake and wearing long dress [Music] is still there for Glory to God nothing wrong with his snake you know this don't get button that's why we're born in suddenly make for TV come in his book speaking lies because we come in that snake that snake is from the serpent that circus from the adamic nature Hallelujah from the sinful nature but there's a fire coming that's why John said I I I I baptize you with water but there is one coming here but he is among you now he's gonna baptize you but with the Holy Ghost on Fire he doesn't say Mysteries he then said there's histories he didn't say this Revelation talk about that he said you're gonna baptize you as I baptize with water you go get deep in fire you will get Destiny anoint him if I get there in the power oh Gloria according maybe seated you know why there's not preach much because it had especially when man can produce it I am the baptizer I can produce nothing I'm here to say Buddhism I'm not here to say what you want to feel so I'm not speaking to your human nature it's fixing up one time years ago I met it was a sister I believe and she kind of talk to me and whatnot and um she started to say um justification a stupid motion as soon as she said that I'm not going to go off key because I know what he did say that nobody prophecy he said Dirty Glass they pick it up nice justification just pick up under the glass you don't drink from my duty glass what do you do you wash it that is sanctification then you say a party milking it that's the Holy Ghost so when the sister come and talk about moss on top this stick I watch any training stick with Moors in it she sent me a scrape of the most and then that's on vacation then you shape the stick that he only goes I say that he seems thick not net change I say you're fighting for the milk god you're afraid in milk let's come back to what your Tipsy you see all them Revelations cuckoo is a train Island same old nature with moss in it yes nature still there you know same thing you know I didn't ship him and he's looking good he had a nice shape church member you know he's teaching to be worship the believer and he's shaped with all nature oh God help me this morning is there anybody in the house hearing what we are preaching this morning oh glory to God so when I bring it back to what the prophet says you pick up the glass you'll wash your glass and you pour milk in it that's the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost introduce something new something different okay the Lord some Praises ain't no shape And all nature it's not putting all our new garment foreign [Applause] like hell Hallelujah nutrients are changing you basic company same dress every Sunday and say God change my nature you know if they tell somebody there's a fighting because people see me boy I've read I see him just last week before but let them talk about you where the same dress tell them you have come to address the company Holy Ghost forget the Lord some Praises Hallelujah so watch let's go when you ask for forgiveness of sins watch but the thing that made you do is still dear the old root of evil it's still there and then you repent to get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and he forgive you of your sins and secondly comes sanctification which sets our mind in order for holiness watch sanification is a compound Greek word means clean and set aside for service it is not in service yet but it's set aside next Comes This is the prophet now the baptism of fire and holy ghost that God might dwell in US and the fire of God cleanses our hearts from sin and puts the Holy Ghost Inside who said that the prophet said that the word said that the fire of God cleanses our hearts he has no Mysteries no histories no Revelations no man of God that they are and who and the church in a special Church Your Privilege should be here because it's right that's a lie the privilege to be among three kind of believers say we just had to manage the ratio of the unbelievable to the True Believers we can't afford the unbeliever they make believer to overtake the Believers so we want to believe us to shout and praise God and worship God and and join the Heavenly chorus that's what we want we want that hallelujah praise God praise God praise God hallelujah all right next come the baptism of the fire and holy ghost at God by dwell in us and the fire of God cleanses our hearts from sin and puts the Holy Ghost Inside then we bring forth the same life notice sanification sets the mind and heart in order of Holiness a man can repent of his sins and a immoral man and an immoral looking woman he finds he's a drunkard every time he smells the drink it is still there but when he gets Sanctified that cleanses the desire out of him oh praise God so God take this the desire of it out isn't that right he can still be tempted but it takes the want of it away he is not right yet then he is baptized with the Holy Ghost on Fire cleansed hear the word burnt out cleaned up and then put into the service of God or could you give the Lord a shout in the house to sanification only sets aside for service it's not right no he called the church to justification and he took it to a process that he himself the Holy Spirit himself the Son of God could dwell in the human heart it has to go through that before he can come into it so he's talking about the Holy Ghost itself and the Pentecostal wrapped up the baptism or the bird but to the birds Hunter at the life the Pentecostal rejected the word from the prophet so they couldn't add on the life to go on to adoption Oh Glory to God they couldn't get the seven steps to go on to charity Oh Glory the God is not right hallelujah praise God praise God praise God so Christ all right I'll just get that down now now watch so I was skipping and the same power Redemption is used to redeem both the world and the person that live in it so do you understand what Redemption is Redemption is these virtues coming and you and I God first redeeming your soul by the Holy Ghost with him in a spirit seven spirits coming into you and then afterwards is just the body to change waiting for that body change oh Hallelujah isn't that right but Obama said it must be baptized in water in his name the shoe it belongs to it must be cleansed by the blood of Jesus and then the Holy Fire the holy ghost from God comes down and burns out all the desire of sin all the nature of the world out of us so do you see now that if it doesn't take the operation of God then we don't need the spirit we don't need to be in church because just meditating good talk takes positive thoughts and you know I mean be nice and be like the rich homie then you know I mean he's a good Master what should I do to inherit his own life good man nice brother nice tires some fella hunting and Jesus Bible Jesus loved him and when Jesus gone inside the beginning of the bone and the marrow and inside the soul you see the money demon inside of there he said he didn't have the spirit of forgiveness you see neighbor hungry and poor not helping them he said if you want to I'll be telling like you have to sell all if you have and give to the poor because when you give no you release that tight money demon offer you [Applause] [Music] gifted upon follow me and he went to be said because God saw that spirit in him and he didn't want to let go that that lust that lots of money you don't have to have lost some money you know it could be lost for all kind of things is that is there that hole in your back that creeping you because that had to break off for you and God had to send you to stuff that was it's not that God wanted to be poor you know he wanted to get that Spirit over him and to get that Spirit over him it means he had to sell and get rid of it and free up yourself from that buying and selfish money craving loving thing oh praise God because you're categy money with you know or give the Lord some praises Hallelujah let's continue here now all right so this is what you heard last Sunday from in his presence and this is where this all this sort of boot into me to share this morning but Obama was speaking he said here I will announce he said um he said the next time when we start the Seven Seas of Revelation on the seven natural seals and when we get through in time take the Seven Seas on the back of the book that may take a little time there's seven seats that is open and there's seven plague seven trumpets all these sevens and them scenes we could take first but then on the back of the book is seated with Seven Seals Daniel heard the voices the Thunders was forbidden to write John was forbidden to write it was sealed on the backs of the book that is after all the mysteries of the book has been given out unrevealed you notice Daniel said the Mysteries and the day of these voices the mystery of God will be a fooling at that time the mystery of who God is how he has made flesh all these things should be unfolded by that time then we are ready for the seven scenes on the back side of the book so he was actually pointing to specific that these seals on the back side of the book we have to get there that's not even reading the revealed a man of the Bible spirit and full and due season for the brother well this just beautiful in juices listen to these words but in Paul I wanted to get this one up from spiritual food into season let me forget that one a paragraph 83 love

come down in that pyramid form stood there and told me to return back and speak on those Seven Seals now this is the 18th of July 1965. he said then he'll be with me he showed me what they were the lost things and this is the part I want to get to I've always taught it was sealed on the back of the book and it wasn't something that was wrote In the book but it turned out that it was made known he cannot do that it isn't something that's written in the book it is something that's been hid in the book Oh Glory to God because the book or take away from the book said carry outside of the book Oh Glory to God Amen maybe you could get all right let's see if we get it here all right look at the obvious I've always thought it was sealed on the back of the book and it is something that wasn't wrote In the book but it turned out that it was made known he cannot do that it isn't something that's written in the book it is something that's hidden in the book talk about the important hallelujah praise God it's not something there it's not witness hidden in the book the prayer man was hidden in the book Hallelujah every messenger was hidden in the book Oh Glory the god they were the seals in the book hallelujah praise God hidden who know Paul Irene as Martin Columbus Wesley all of them are Mysteries all those missionable Mysteries and the pride herself was a mystery hid under the seals for Glory to God then what seal are you under oh give the Lord a shout in the house what seal is the bride under and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour Oh Glory to God the devil don't know nothing about it we'll give the Lord some praises Oh Glory to God the devil don't know nothing about it Hallelujah silence not on Earth in heaven for

cross the other side it all belongs to us it's all ours them visuals never fail they can't fail because they come from God I believe in all that is within me we are not the Highland that will run back Into the Wilderness we will cross Jordan the separation God break to us the seals on the back of the book let us enter into this great place now for Joshua divided to the people their inheritance that God left for them so he put the Thunders the Seas on the back of the book I'm tied with Joshua tied with the inheritance titled crossing over how could you cross over without the Thunders they take the Thunders to cross over and step onto the other Shore we'll give the Lord a praise o glory to God hallelujah praise God glory love God [Applause] [Music] inside is the word and the backside is the spirit seven perfect spirits send forth to all the Earth glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God listen to this bro Mike this this always blow my mind this is the 18th of June 1961 Revelation chapter five part two brother I'm talking about he said horn means Kingdom days before this he's breaking 63 right this is 61. you remember they crung upon the Beast Daniel it means Kingdom Seven Ages and what Jesus said some fell asleep in the first watch one in the next watch next age and then in the seventh watch the bridegroom come then all of them awaken remember that so it's seven ages seven horns seven churches dispensational body Believers what what's this 1961 hear the prophet the seventh and last one of these seals when they are opened is found in Reverse in the 10th chapter since 1961 he said the seals the seventh one is found in Russian ten [Applause] [Music] in other words when you talk about the seventh seal you have to go to the Thunders in relation 10. to understand what is under those seals okay the Lord has shout this is 1961. okay the Lord some praises the seventh and last one of these seals when they are open is found in Revelation the 10th chapter there was a mighty Angel which was Christ came down put one foot on the lamb one for them to see raised his hands and said the day is finished time has run out time shall be no more where is that angel this morning where is that angel today the prophet has gone back hallelujah praise God but the angel is on the Earth doing what God have mercy fixing things are wrong glory to God he fix the problems affects your situation he affects your marriage and the guy has broken he fixed that Hallelujah fix that he wrecked that he served that he does all them kind of thing though he slay me and I trust him but the Lord Give the Lord take it away he take this one out of your life you take that one on your life so what you are the Bride of Jesus Christ what shall separate me from the Capstone of Love Child tribulation shall things present shall things come foreign [Music] [Applause] let me tell you something this president when he when he pressed come down and he pressed comfortably brighter he don't just press conference brighter they're trying to force all connecting in the people it'll be a force in you know God help the children Next Generation it's terrible you take a certain body getting worse and worse and I hope that parents start to get the spirit I mean on their own in that sense you have to be praying for them John was filled with the Holy Ghost in his womb when when Mary hello John and say his name Shall be Called Jesus John John John said to Rejoice the baby didn't turn for six months but when when he heard that name Jesus that done in in Elizabeth and jump about because he had to come in for around the Messiah and brother was giving a message to horrendous second come of the Lord and where the bright fit inside of there the Lord himself he's done with a shout the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God are they in a brighter not in the back if in the bride you'll be caught up in this [Applause] this is real if your name was in the book in heaven is still up there but no the angel brought it down and he gave it to the mighty Angel he gave it to the seventh angel version 10 said he gave it to his prophet and the prophet put it on books and tapes and leave a faithful Ministry to come behind to speak the word that you can hear your name and when you hear your name you get your breakthrough you get your deliverance you see what you call unto glory to God Glory ah you may be seated where is until it says what praise God praise God praise God it says here watch and the voice which I hear from Heaven speak unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea upon the land New York or London go Europe go Africa go Trinidad what is a man say that it's a go to the angel and the manifestation of the Holy Ghost is that angel on the earth trying to get the people back to the world because God could only confirm the word God had confirming me God forming the word and if you have the word and you will confirm you because the word is in you so the battle and the fight has been to get the word into the people not interpretation not an idea but the water tapes see so you have to know your promises isn't that right and I went to the angel and said give me a little book he said me take it eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter it shall be thy mouth sweet as honey sweet Revelation bitter when you have to stand on television no I'm not buying what you're selling Hallelujah took and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand eat it up and it was an emulated honey and as soon as I have eaten it my belly was bitter he said unto me down was prophesy again before many nations and Nations and tongues and people and came and that's what we're doing here right now again Hallelujah bringing the same Prophecy from the prophet and prophesying our Revival prophesying about Dynamics in the mechanics prophesying about the Holy Ghost itself prophesying our young Revival among the young people probably sign a Deliverance to the young people prophesying Holy Ghost speaking direct prophesying about healing and signs and wonders prophesy Mark 16 John 14 12 the Lord himself went everywhere with them all these prophecies hanging over you glory to God you're walking to the Hawks and Devils as you walk to the front door devil's head into the back door okay the Lord some prayer do you believe that do you believe that when you go to a house as you walk to the front door never sit in the back door Oh Glory to God because then devils and conquer the spirit before all I know go Hallelujah glory to God the anointing that was upon Paul you're knocking away from Peter the anointing now upon the early church but me back in this church I'm Alpha and Omega same fire same power same anointing [Music] let's go remember Daniel was told by the angel Daniel who the seven Thunders they uttered the voices Daniel grabbed his pen started right and he said don't write it don't write it John saw the same thing it was already written outside the Bible and had seven seasons in the back of the book and no man could open those seals that was them voices so he called the season the backup book of the book them voices here is the Bible written which is a mystery itself but on the back s the Bible the Revelation was shown to Daniel instances to be uttered that no man could open no man known what it was but the Bible said and I told Daniel also John in the last days here we go these seven voices would be known by the real true church not before church let them be not made they believe in church the real church will be known what them seven voices is those seven voices will be known to the real Church isn't it baram says in this last day these seven voices would be known by the real true church you get it can you see where the force and conquerque is trying to keep great men from places like that message these voices isn't that right so Malachi 4 Revelation 10 was centered for around the coming of Christ and Christ coming came in White version 10. one the mighty angel so Christ's message is found in Russian 10 1 4. seven Thunders came out his mouth brother George Hallelujah to do what if God has to write together it gives the bright fate it shows the right to be pure it is the price Revival they have nothing with church now there's the bride I'm not on my trailer no I'm talking about this Universal bright body I'm not going by the church now a physical church now I'm talking about the bride the body of Christ around the world that's what Christ come for every name on that book is to be redeemed or give the Lord some praises Hallelujah let's go brother I'm starting your perfect man you say first we have faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness bloody love birthday kindness then add love let me read this over again to make sure we're going to start in the fifth verse so you read giving all diligence and something like that now Peter is outlining something here for us how to get there I want to say this are you ready are you ready there are some people who have a portion of this virtue knowledge wisdom patience and so forth that don't even profess to be a Christian [Applause] so these are natural virtues I have nice Muslim nice Methodist nice people out there they don't even go to church and they better behave than people in church I'm not going there just highlighting that I'm not going there like there's too much to go there I go down that road I'll be giving us out of there nice people with patience they could wait long of Jesus Christ they have control they have Temperance let us meditate let's do yoga but that is not the temperance of Jesus right Oh Glory to God there's Faith they are Faith they expecting this they believe in this and they believe in death and all kind of thing but they're not the fate of Jesus Christ so if that natural person comes to church with the natural virtues and they drop mysteries on top of that where are you getting a mysterious natural man do you see what's going on in the message you know [Applause] pumping Mysteries a natural fit natural virtue Natural Animal figure he's he's the perfect manner some of these clones I call them clones they feel the adaptation they know it all the Arrogant project Hallelujah there are some people have a portion of this that don't even pretend to be a Christian it's like a black bird trying to put peacock feathers in his wings to make him a peacock he only disgraces himself it's better to say a black bird remember this morning these virtues has to be in dear before the Capstone will even come on it so before we press come down would you press come down press us because we preaching this message closed down what for listening things we don't like that's not what happened you know but the Brandon says when he Holy Ghost fell on their Pentecost hell yeah or their Pentecost Satan look they're having a good time they're excited it's just having a shopping time this morning just leave them alone [Music] it's just busy busy busy busy busy bodies the exercise and only getting up and saying

Calvary you mean as Jesus come back again okay the Lord I shout glory to God hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated what happened Solomon came the soul of the seed and he was Son of God Through The Seven Ages with the prophecy of Luke 17 son and man to come back again to bring back seed and after that son of man what's going to happen Son of God in a bunch of people called The Pride then we will connect with son of David but there's going to be a manifestation you say all these virtues that that Perfection but a judge of the coming of the Son of God oh Gloria all these virtues to that perfection of the coming of the Son of God once more the world will yet direct from God once more do we hear from the sons of God they glory to God Hallelujah Hallelujah these virtues [Applause] not these teachings not these Mysteries some people like to prison you don't like Mysteries I'm a living mystery so I like myself then and Christ is the mystery of God revealed [Applause] but if I hear nothing about the life and the death that's the mystery for me there's a mysterious preaching to me I just listen to here when they're talking about that trouble me because you see the Cross Jordan on off skateboard I ain't you're already caused Jordan because Jordan represent that to feel the chilly Waters roll Jordan roll hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah you want to cross Jordan represented there's some people don't want to die that way they love certain churches because you can do whatever they want according to go to church but this is something the bride want to make herself ready [Music] [Applause] if you want to be bridesmaid that is fine is up to you but we all want to be part of this bright body when you want to say will you take this woman to be a wedded wife you can't be looking around like if you talk not talking to you Oh Glory to God you have to be flesh of his flesh born of his bone you have to resemble him you're gonna be walking like him come on Hallelujah I want to be like him I leave the Catholic church should come to be like him if I want to remain a Catholic I'll be a little priest I've got what's going to have me to do that but that's not what God called me for he called me out of the Catholic Church to be like Jesus he said be there for perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect I come to Perfection I want Perfection I love Perfection or glory to God hallelujah and good is the enemy of perfect what can the Lord I shout in the house did you hear what I just said good is the enemy of perfect God I want you good you want your perfect that the Lord some Praises oh hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah so these virtues has to be dear before the Capstone will even come on it so you might sing you might speak for tongues and dance that has nothing at all to do with it until these things are scripturally proven and sealed into you the Holy Spirit seals you as an individual then you are Sons and Daughters of God you say when that time comes you become a Vindicated son a Vindicated daughter not a message believer a Vindicated son a Vindicated daughter when you open your mouth devil shut up praise God when you step out your house Devil's scatter when you cross the street the devil Crossing away from you he said look they come in lock the wake up lock the walking look they pray look the talking the sons of God coming into power coming into possession get the Lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so called release the seven spirits here we go God releases seven Thunders to call our bride back the seven steps to bring down the Capstone somebody gonna do it by the judge they're gonna claim them seven steps hey Hallelujah somebody gonna do it listen when Queen Esther was called by Mordecai to say you in the palace you think you're gonna Escape how do you not know you are positionally placed for such a time as this you better get you better get sense in your head sister you better get a revelation I wish you pull it all together she think about that she meditates and then she pray about it and then she accepted that she was placed positionally for such a time as this and then she told herself if I perish I perish but I'm mounting them seven steps I'm calling the president of the king fate virtue knowledge Temperance patience when she hit that brotherly kindness hope all glory of God not born hot not one clutch not one on the leaf and she stepped into the presence of the king that Holy Spirit oh what do you have me to do Esther maybe she did King extended his run of authority and Power [Applause] praise God so the seven Thunders was loosed to caller Brian back to seven steps to bring down the Capstone Hallelujah what for to bring on the resurrection we can't call the Resurrection on the brotherly kindness it has to be the Capstone has to be divorced with dark angel you have to be the Lord himself in a bride isn't that right call back the seven steps to bring back is this the sign of the answer he said could it be that Mighty Thunder or the seventh angel and the Seven consolation the pyramid form three on one side one at the top they drop from eternity is this here we go let's take it slow is this the mystery of the Thunders that will bring back the headstone you mean the Thunders of a mystery they're gonna bring back the headstone because the pyramids never capped you know the premieres never was kept The Headstone is yet to be The Headstone is yet to come it has been rejected let's continue he said it might be closer than you think it's got me scared I haven't done enough where are we at time shall be no more he announced that time is over what happens what happens could that be so no Brethren see as you think if it is then the pyramid is kept by the seven tunnel so he put the Capstone as seven Thunders which is the holy spirit slot Captain those virtues or glory to God hallelujah do you understand that that [Applause] to cut them Seven Virtues walk in the Lord a house shout in the house in other words the pride of God becomes the word and the spirit comes upon the bride gives the bride a voice the spirit and the price had come oh give the Lord a shout your family coming your loved ones coming God will give you that voice the problem of the final voice to the final Age The Spirit Will Mock The Pride [Music] so this spirit this second Bible is not kept by teachings Revelations Mysteries he says he says seriously if it is then the pyramid is kept by the seven Thunders then he said you remember the prayer message it's a Capstone what did it do the Holy Spirit capped off the individual not cap of a church they have no capital of no church kept coming to individuals shout out individuals say it again individuals say that can individuals that means individual will praise God individuals will worship God indivisible join the Heavenly chorus individual of lamb worship individuals would give God praise in the good times and the bad times individuals gonna do that [Music] he said what the Holy Spirit kept up the individual and sealed it and we keep adding to our faith righteousness and goodness and faith and so forth we kept adding until we got seven things the seventh one was love which is God that is how we mix the individual and it caps him and seals him with the Holy Spirit so why it is you don't see love in the message and it's even crutches and Alton this pastor clanging so the next past and treats right into it what kind of nastiness and foolishness because that is not there because the Holy Spirit can be hearing one man and misbehaving another man okay the Lord I shout like did you hear that the Holy Ghost can behave in one man and misbehave in one another man the Holy Ghost God is his behavior the character of the Holy Ghost is the behavior it shows whether it's the holy ghost or not are you already know what the seven one was love which is God that's how we mix the individual caps him and seals him with the Holy Spirit then if that be so the individual now has seven churches that he had seven Mysteries that the song away and they fought for to bring back I know the headstone comes the cap of the church does the Thunders mean that my bedroom and every Minnesotan Pastor all over the will have to answer that question and we see a big fat yes it means just that seven steps to bring down the Capstone to cap the individual when we add it to our faith virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience and calmness and partly kindness and the love of God and then child he sees the whole building and then you are sealed unit of the love of God no leaks [Applause] the Bible called charity the bond of perfectness [Applause] [Music] the glue that glued on all the virtues and sealed in outside our charity you'll be contemporance the leaking patience somebody again your Vex all your patients run out you lick your temper and say holy of temperance pipe at Birth you know if I was doing things that you're not supposed to do for your Temperance because your heart temperature will last me last weekend he said leaks in the building leaking godliness leak but when charity comes it seal the whole thing you see when God gave out and God gave Noah the revelation of the actability act it was soft wood the critics outside laughing because what kind of word is that that goes that that will absorb and Float but God wait for the last minute to break a seven seed Revelation to put Pitch on the inside and out because God know that wood will absorb the pitch absorb the tar and it will be sealed on the inside and the outside I will make it waterproof they didn't expect that Revelation to come and the devil didn't expect this Revelation to come because them Seven Virtues when it's sealed by charity makes you devil proof hell proof Darkness proof Bulletproof fireproof lion proof Red Sea proof whatever the general control on you oh give the Lord a shout you know what a prophet said not even death gonna stop this bride when the Grim Reaper see you you turn around you come with a big hook but he can hook you because we who are alive and remain them devil can't take all we're not all going on sleep there are some gonna be alive and remain Give the Lord some praises Glory love God you may be seated go take some of our loved ones Among Us here so when Resurrection can come they can appear and say time to go in the Bible many of them that were dead or Rose in the Center many they go appear unto the elected and said we ready now to go could you imagine all them brothers gray hair and they come back young they want to know who is that and they had to identify themselves they will recognize their you know praise God praise God they said time to go Resurrection time well glory to God see them with black hair looking like 19 years old God help me this is this real glory to God when paramam was lying on he saw his buddy he wanted to know if he had to go back to that that old test house because he said oh God our precious brother sisters hugging him and no sensation hugging this one and no sensation brother you led me the Lord when I was 100 years old Oh Glory to God and see them 19 18 years old thank you thank you thank you thank you hey get the Lord some praises [Applause] [Music] the reason what the world in this traditional that's the reason hasn't got any effect there is nothing will come out of it because it's been mixed up you listen this one now you can't put genuine coin in something let's say it won't grow you can lay it in the sun keep it warm you can do what you want to it takes a certain kind of hurt it must be there double corn it must be buried it must be under the right atmosphere to make it bring forth here we go now so does the word of God you can't take a church and bring it to life on some tradition you might bring members by the millions but you will never bring down the power of God until you get back to the original world again back to the foundational word back to the blood but they don't talk about blessing message at all like this blood is blood Jesus and the blood is the weird and important right back to the blood back to Jesus Christ back to old-fashioned permittance back to God Hallelujah glory to God what he's talking about you you cannot bring the power of God down on Traditions interpretations men's idea that is how I know all man's effect can influence going to run out every Minister that is of the word of God going to be exposed every church that is not taken word by word and bringing them promises one day we'll wake up and find out they dry as a biscuit and they've been looking for the Holy Ghost because that Cafe challenges the hour the angel know what he spoke to that prophet and they are not even comfortable that spoke to the angel whatever God spoke to that Prophet is Spirit spoken word or Spirit given words that's why I have been zealous all these years to bring this word by word by word by word that you will know what the tape say and when you read it in the book you know what you have heard you know what you read it's right here in the book listen to this piece when the Holy Spirit begins to move and to give discernment that is to bring the presence of God Among the people objective of the discernment just like singing A Hymn shouting a message give me in unknown tongues or something it brings the spirit of God Among the people you heard your pastor preach plenty of time on the word until the spirit got among the people and they just screamed out they could not hold their peace any longer because it's the spirit of God so God bring gifts and talents and so on to bring the spirit when they say you're saying a specialist not like us inspiration or like a like a song a song sting of sort like a gospel concert the object is to bring the spirit and not just a sin is to get the spirit moving like how the prophet said he loved the song only believe all things are possible and when they start to sing that song The Angel come into the building he's attracted to that their spirit is attracted to certain things it's not attracted to argument about the foolishness that can't bring the spirit of God you want the spirit in your house you have to create the atmosphere for that let's go about a George had sentences to me this was in his presence he said what you're talking about Modi one of them guys was preaching he preached the government in such a way he stood in Boston Massachusetts in a little bit window because there was no church could hold his crown he stood there with a mighty Force preach hell such a place until working man in the baskets under the arms fell into the street and screamed for mercy in the presence of God great preachers who have been able by the word of God to bring the presence of God to an audience by the word to bring present the objective of the world is not for you to see how smart the preacher is that's why Paul said I did not come with you with words of enticing man's Wisdom because your figure arrested me because you see but I come that your faith and rest in the power of God that's a realize not my might not my spirit is the power of God that is ministering to you do you get it now there was something he's a five yet that man would ever be so shared in their hearts till they never recognize the presence of God he said the first man as soon as he has sinned he couldn't come into God's presence he went on high in the bush we know what Adam right and he would not come out and could not come out until appropriation for him now usually before God gets ready to do something I should say before he does anything he always make it understood or gives a warning or gives a witness of something he's fixing to do God meets in the Council of man one time with 500 one time it's 73 even to one person that is why we can have such consolation to know that no matter where we are or what condition we are in one word will bring his presence to us that's why you come to service and one word and it starts it's over for you whatever you're going through it's finished right there because you get a word from the Lord really that hallelujah praise God he said we see Nations united we see the world united we see coming in Iceland he said and never before since the early church was the pillar fire ever among the people since the early church never did they see the things to be seeing today and this was only made possible when God sent the Seven Seals and give us a Sign by it and send seven angels from Heaven they come to bring that scattered word in them denominations and tie it back in the word of God again to bring down this Holy Spirit so the object of the Seven Angels was the God of all the scattered world all the Loose Ends so concede and this and that all kind all together and when it was all goddess together the world become a channel for the Holy Ghost itself to come down then he said he was sentences to prophet of the true word it's only for sale with a message to return to the original word of God and the fate of the fathers to bring down the power of the Holy Ghost amongst the people I think that word reading again it's from the first c u p paragraph 398. he would send us a true prophet of the true word with a message to do what to return to the original word of God and the faith of the fathers to do what to bring down the power of the Holy Ghost among the people all right you're going good for the brown this is a big one here and the devil can impersonate any one of those things but he cannot be the Holy Ghost the devil could imprison it any gift but he cannot be the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is the token that the blood is applying but the important to put up this one for me you think about this one and the Holy Ghost is the token that the blood has been applied because it follows the blood all the way from the book of redemption so the spirit follows the blood because the blood of the life so when the blood is applied to you the spirit comes upon you could you get a bigger body I guess that's how it formatted right they're so small you see that and the Holy Ghost is the token that the blood has been applied because it followed the blood all the way from the book of redemption that was the purpose of him coming to following every age every Edge he followed out to sea it brought forth so in this age God sent seven Thunders the blood of Jesus Christ the splash upon the bride that blood is what upon you that's why we could feel the spirit because the blood is upon you oh the Democrat accused so much he want to accuse but the blood is upon you and because of the blood we have the spirit that follows the blood from where from the book of redemption it's a bloodline or glory to God it's a bloodline praise God praise God praise God Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God so listen this and in this last days the Seven Seas been open was to pick up every struggle I've been left over it and make the whole thing in one great body of the bride and then we'll live back there was not perfect until this church be perfected this bright group in the last days have to bring them in and all together taken up this bright church have to take them in that means this bride have to come to Perfection to bring the resurrection and to come to Perfection you have to add the Capstone and to get to the Capstone you have to go up them seven steps oh give the Lord a shout glory to God has seven steps to Perfection walking up seven steps of affection Jesus Christ the holy spirit is Among Us we should reference that we can't humble ourselves enough taking off your shoes getting on your knees wouldn't expect wouldn't satisfy it it wouldn't suffice us but the life that brings forth the Fruit of the Spirit and what is the foot of the spirit Joy love peace could we continue question and answers brother Brown this is 28th of August 964. will the foolish version be saved no whatever happens happens now after that time she will have to go through the tribulation period and the reason of it is because she has rejected the atonement in its fullness this year is the foolish virgin let's continue she is a believer in the message a professed believer but she will have to go through the tribulation period because she didn't accept the atonement in its fullness and the atonement is fullness is the blood which Peter identified as virtue and knowledge and Temperance do you understand this answer every issue in your home your loose tongue is not by Temper temperance [Music] knowledge is there wisdom is there virtue is there patience is there have patience with your wife have patience with your husband have patience with God and ambitious with yourself oh give the Lord a shout in the house [Music] yeah foreign she will have to go to the tribulation disbeliever here now because they believe the seven sea but nobody seven times you have the nomination person you believe the Bible yes you tell them go to Malachi foreign you believe the message yes what about every seven times not for you it's only for the bread that's the only exclusive I promise you know everybody but this meteor no this this meat this rip fresh freshly killed kakas this is only for the Bride of Jesus Christ lead it's slipped at hands he couldn't hold it with the greasy hands of unbelief see if I'm looking to hold it look in the catchy book say thank you hold it it went back to the hands and original owner so God took back the book he took back the deed he took back The Inheritance Adam was the one supposed to call your name Adam had the book Adam was supposed to call for you Adam was to make sense like himself he's a replenish multiply make Sons like yourself we fell into sin we fell into sex and when Jesus come he's accepted he born again of the word and spirit so God come back to bring us back the word and spirit as we were supposed to be glory to God because we're going back to Eden [Music] glory to God there isn't really any home stress stick with me now write with me now we are going back to the original [Music] Boris let me see that listen to this this man without barram shop and woman God take a manner they decided and that man fell so if you follow we're talking about God fell in the gardener Eden so you that's why God pre-break a provision for your falling that's why you put a blood atonement that's why you have a lawyer that's why he plead your case that's why you interceded on your behalf that's why the lamb paid a price I give the Lord some Praises I died for them I pay the price for them hey if though this door for you I don't know what will [Music] Glory tell me the describes and Pharisees watching Jesus he come inside the place invited by them and no feet watching funky nobody washes feet all the mess along the road all them drop droppings from all them animals on Jesus clothes on Jesus feet and them days they wearing sandals when they come in somebody's house you have somebody to wash their foot nobody wash his feet now Jesus sit down if it's sticking up and all prostitute woman all little failed woman watch that and said that not right that many message so long then preaching Bible so long then facing the spoken books so long then press and play so long what kind of treatment is that how did she say my Lord like that and she broke through she went by his feet she began to cry she no much man she was whipped she the most rum she drink she no much smoke and she did too much party she went to she was crying she was repenting and Jesus said nothing or give the Lord some praises he said nothing and then Hypocrites telling themselves if he only know what kind of woman is that he will never alone by his foot and he said Simon have a word for you since I come in here nobody washed my feet but this woman whose sins are many hey hey hey this woman who sings that many she is free you are free this morning you are free today or pouring of God hallelujah hallelujah who the son of man set free it's free indeed or get the Lord some Praises this morning Hallelujah Hallelujah hallelujah amen amen amen amen amen amen amen foreign all right [Applause] Blu-ray [Applause] glory to book let me see this for yourself this morning from what your mama think about you what you never think about you what your sinner friend think about you you have nothing to do with that is what the son of man revealed to you is what your Father revealed to you my God listen to this there were 10 versions went to the middle bridegroom half of them had oil in the lamp half of them didn't that's the part of the body that's dead and that's part of the life the five wise the cry come behold the bribe didn't come they all trimmed their lamps I'm going to the wedding supper but when the foolish virgin said give us some of your oil our lives are gone out give us up your oil not sow Nacho wrong [Applause] you should have come before but this is the time for not so not so watch not so we just got enough for ourselves go and buy go and buy it and always Pompey the price it cost us our Revival has cost Holy Ghost has caused break through those costs pressing this cost it cost us when you see people get a breakthrough it cost them oh glory to God watch when the when the proclamation went out they decree the problem coming everybody wanted to get right quick in that hour in the hour when they're writing on the wall but I'm saying oh he experienced it oh we want the baptism of the Holy Ghost we won't distract the other but while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they left outside whether it be weeping unwilling a nation of teeth death doesn't do nothing to a man but changes dwell in place it doesn't change your nature it doesn't change your fate it doesn't change nothing in you but your dwelling place so which way your nature is this morning if you're a daughter of God's word you will be a daughter over there so I don't care how old you are how you live how good you live it wouldn't change you one bit to die just your dwelling place and if you can't accept the whole word of God the way it is written you won't do it so don't worry you won't be there you have got to accept it in its fullness and the power of His Vindication and the revelation of what it is then you become part of it oh glory to God and the pride the church reject the atonement and its fullness oh praise God I'm I'm on the home stretch here now oh let's look at it you know brother you see the atonement in action let's hope Alabama describe it you talk about two Nations right more than Israel Moab is Believers in Jehovah they are the prophet Israel had a prophet both of them are prophets one is balam one is Moses now they come now they were organized right the nation coming up the curses of the nation watch those two prophets fundamentally speaking them both of them was exactly right notice Balaam the bishop told them no bill me said monitors so Bill in my revelation of seven altars isn't that right said Miss complete on each watch a perfect example of the day we're living in watch bailam required a ram on each altar that was speaking of faith and become a messiah one Prophet on an Israel Camp had the characteristics of God and the word of God he stared with the promise of God for that age as far as fundamental part Balaam and balak could be identified as Moses was you see Moses being the correct prophet of God not only had the fundamental parents but he had the identification of God he was in the liner Duty with the promise of God for the age God's characteristics identified in Moses and let's go a pillar of fire was following them he had the atonement in action not speaking of it but had it in action now what will be but what is right now but Glory no good so you mean there's token or the atonement or the blood after coming to action yes it will be an action among the bride notice you're a brass serpent they have been lifted up for the sickness and disease of the people the more Moses was practicing Divine Healing he had the atonement the brass symbol the brass Supreme symbolizing that God in the camp he had the Smith and rock following him that was identified God and then they were traveling lying the promise that was another identification to show God's characteristics no matter how fundamental this other one was with the word he had the fundamentalism plus the identification and the characteristics of God among them God identify himself two prophets spotted them prophets both of them fundamental but God identifies characters in Moses because they are the characteristics of God with him now God's characteristics are really is always Supernatural the Lord I shout on that one because he is Supernatural and God is Supernatural God deals with individuals he's so unusual to the way of thinking we get off the trend we have to believe it this way and then God comes along with his word and he promised identify himself with the word this group can't go to it because they don't believe it see watch my Lord praise God water blood and spirit isn't that right so the blood atonement attracts the spirit isn't that right so the Holy Spirit Falls in every inch praise God to bring forth those names that was in the blood section of the book not just the regular section but God put your name in the blood section of the book therefore I know this morning you are going to be filled with the Holy Ghost despite what you feel despite what you think God had put you on your blood section for the evening here put you in the blood section for nothing if you're dead you will come alive if you're sick you're gonna be healed if you're born you're gonna free you if you're in a fisherman gonna quickly then you'll be a fish of men or give the Lord some Praises praise praise praise God praise God praise God so there's blood atonement is what will bring down the presence of God this brother told me is what we have here in Hearthstone Tabernacle that is why we have the presence of God because there's a blood that's speaking Oh Glory to God hallelujah let me at the home stretch here glory to God Museum Hallelujah for the brand of them you're the final stretchy there are seven steps that goes to God for seven spirits comes down all right seven steps that goes to God he said in perfect mind when you say I want to get closer to God what you are actually saying I want to grow in God that's what closer means do you understand it now so when they get on the Fate I'm gonna close with you you get virtue oh God I want more of you you get knowledge God give me more give me more give me more you got Temperance on patience and cognitively counters and then you can't get any more because in John 42 is it at that day you shall know I'm in the father you and me and I and you can't get closer now you are one wit oh give the Lord a shout when you see me you see my father Oh Glory to God are you with me now all right here we go here you are seven churches seven steps God building his church is like one person into an individual into himself the glory the power of God coming down through this well in it together no matter how strong you are built up it's got a weak link there's where she breaks now if you possess this and don't have this she's gonna break so if you are possessed knowledge and I know how virtue it will break you don't have Temperance and go break so hear what he said if you haven't got this thing on a break so when you surrender your complete being the Holy Spirit pours through you in these virtues then you are a living Tabernacle then the people say that's a man full of virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brightly kindness full of the Holy Ghost a stature that the unbelievers can look and say there's a Christian there's a man or woman who knows what they're talking about you've never seen a Kinder sweeter Godly person you are sealed a sealed shows on both sides whether you're going or coming you see the sea just the same there you are and when a man here we go a woman that means that preacher is only man or woman possesses this these virtues then the Capstone comes down and seals them into the kingdom of God which is the Holy Ghost then the word coming from here manifests itself to each one of these beings making this a competition a Tabernacle of the Living God a walking living example of Christianity this is what I want I want to be a walking living example of Christianity what Christ was these people are because his life isn't there they are in Christ and their life is dead and hid in Christ through God sealing there by the Holy Ghost First Corinthians to have you reckon yourself dead then you're born of faith and vote you on these things are added till you are perfect image of living God and through that he has brought 70 changes to show seven steps that he brought building his individual into his image Oh Glory to God you get a terminatory forming yourself into the word image you have bricks this building here was once bricks and cement gravel Sun that is building materials but we have to take the building materials and form it into a building Oh Glory to God you can't boasts you have it on books you have it on tapes you listen to it that is building materials but it has to be formed under pressure and the trials and the tests and the tribulation and all what to go through helps form you or give the Lord a shout Glory love God final page man we took it today from feasting the trumpet Feast of the trumpets going to the prophet's chamber and
