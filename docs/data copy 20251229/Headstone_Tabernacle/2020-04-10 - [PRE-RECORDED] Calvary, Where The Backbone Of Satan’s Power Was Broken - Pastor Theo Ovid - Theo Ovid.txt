something that want to perpetuate itself it want to grow it want to spread is one two shades poison and I have no respect for his country doesn't care what kind gender doesn't matter that is what I was thinking about that that this virus is nothing going wherever you want to go they are loyal to take him and I was thinking about the opposite of that I was wondering if people got infected but the whole eco I wonder what will happen overnight I wonder if that could go to every nation all peoples just the Holy Ghost and fire lilies the prophets in the Holy Ghost walk across the world overnight I am believe that I believe that all my heart now this virus could be tested they do have the cure the dollar vaccine by the Knesset and this Holy Ghost could also be still isn't that something this whole he goes to be tested too you know hallelujah though this virus because is one virus is not to one tree is one haven't named it - I have an infant but Israeli a demon that invadin bodies knockin all old people taking our lives but this whole egos the Spirit of God looking to invade bodies - looking for houses looking for heart and a life and if virus could knock a man down and take him out why the Holy Ghost can strike you and bring you up [Music] we still we still development two forces and two kingdoms and every battle and every issue is connected by those two forces until Kangnam I

Switzerland everybody close at the border don't bring it here don't bring it here don't bring it here don't bring it here we don't want it so if they're saying the world and what what you should want you should wonder peace you should want Holy Ghost you should want revival you should want deliverance you said one preacher you should wonder great man power he said what that you believe are you sending a squad which church so we used to bring no Jubilee and no revival just lot Senate there okay who bought use they pebble me take it up the world did you know what I said the devil needs to get a blow when Jesus was here he could blow it out or chlorine accordance add a call-out Jesus people Jews even move we know who they lacked Paul yeah please don't tell them the DC said hallelujah Wednesday night we were speaking of us talking about David and Goliath and from my natural perspective you seen two men two human beings but in the spiritual realm was not two men was two powers was two forces the Holy Ghost behind David and the devil behind Goliath and we said the lab was a principal spirit challenging the armies of the Living God and when the devil know you have one on you he will Jam you as much as he could he will not let up if the devil you have one on you he will Jam you as much as he could but when you know that God is on your side and God had made our ways he promised to make a way for you you have the victory and you can never get the picture you will get the victory if you never know what victories in your life you're gonna know what victory is praise God the problem is too much our defeated people when they get too much Alex after why do you believe that you're born for this thing come like a farmer plants and every time you've planned something so if you chop pick up that blight mealy bug this that that I saw you get frustrated but for all and mealy bugs are nothing else pray for that too but a poison so as they come well go I have a poison for every needy bug the antidote of the Holy Ghost it's so powerful the Bible said I shall train deadly thing that it shall not harm them it's so powerful [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] if I snakebite them shake it off hallelujah this this holy was powerful you know it sit on a minute [Applause] we not on my church and just mention people and clothes and think about that didn't we don't behind me close behind the bench in the human being we talking about that be there was a cuspid with an email Christ we understand that but when that man that fella bit God that man was the powerhouse that every devil in hell could recognize that's why the devil said Paul I know please I know it was emotionally close he had no money he was a Russian of the outside gamut it was something on the inside huijun out on the outside god help me this morning glory hallelujah may be seated and all this word you're hearing hearing urine when this word become flesh then the invisible becomes visible so David and Goliath was a physical manifestation of a supernatural battle don't ever forget that David and Goliath was a supernatural it was a supernatural battle in a physical form that you could see with your eyes but behind there is demon activity Rachel and if God can take the scales over your eyes you will see what I'll be attacking your house what I've been attacking your family what I'll be attacking your system all along you is devils and demons all glory to God but or have a message upon my heart this morning lots of stuff on my spirit or glory they like oh we stand every one of our word [Music] Hebrews 10:1 a read from verse 1 to 14 and first Corinthians chapter 1 with something 229 it's kind of mind-blowing oh we get here but we are here we still have no fear Hebrews 10 1 2 14 and let's read see what we have yet for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offer year by year continually make the comers they aren't too perfect for then would it not have ceased to be offered because that the worshipper once purged should have no more conscious of but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins aware for when he commits unto the world he said sacrifice and offering don't word it's not but a body has not prepared me in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin though has had no pleasure but ice then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will O God above when he said sacrifice and offerings and burnt offerings and offering for sin though it is not neither hats pleasure Darren which was offered by the law then said he lo I come to do thy will O God he take away the first that he may establish the second by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all and every priest standard daily ministering an off time offering of time the same sacrifice which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expect him till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he are perfected for dim that are sanctified honey wanna read from first Corinthians chapter 1 verse 17 Paul speaks for Christ set me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lease the cross of Christ should be made of none effect on the line that in your heart lease the cross of Christ should be made of none effect for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God for it is written I have the sheet I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and I will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe for the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling-block under the Greeks foolishness but unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God because the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men for you see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble a call but God had chosen the foolish things of the world to confound it - wise and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and the base things of the world and the things that are despised had God chosen he things which are not to bring to nought things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence let's pray father we thank you for your word and any man could read it but Lord they take the Holy Ghost to come and inspire to the people here and all your prophet said he could preach till all the hair fall off his head unless it's inspired to the people during the same condition but we previous morning that the inspiration of the Holy Ghost will come here today and inspire a word to your people and change and transform their lives Lord made a demo be routed you said if we follow you the angel you will be an enemy to our enemies lon Oh God come among your people and lead us here father by your spirit in Jesus and we

supernatural realm or Gloucester this service so understand this this morning this service is not a natural service this little lecture is that a normal discussion we talk in something and kill in tank this is not that there's a war going on right now when I come beyond the pulpit is a war when Satan's Amica behind Estes is angry he's upset because he know this is a channel that God can use

going to be loosed upon the earth this is the introduction you know the battle called the beginning of Sorrows this is the introduction that the whole creation is groaning and travailing for the manifestation of the sons of God with born sons Sons speak and the word is backed up be a proper teacher nothing okay the Lord we are talking about teaching we chose another preaching the gospel and the gospel is nothing would only attend power let them features like that but then powers of demonstration of the Holy Ghost [Applause] Laurey oh yeah I joined a bunch of madmen a sign of a madness Mita was a crazy man he was done the Catholic Church Wesley was another madman or take the Lord a shout we tried a bunch of Mad Men all Julius's worship God in the heresy you know be seated this is brother Branham he is praying to be seated from loud Eastern Church she said now friends you better stand on your feet and are trying to accept the sweetness of the Lord Jesus the same Bible that tells us that these things would happen brought them to pass exactly the way promised it now the promise said Peter is unto you and to your children to them that afar off even as men is a lot of caution alcohol you stood up because you want the blessings of God on you and as a servant I pray for you I pray that God will give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I wonder if you could do this in your heart if if you sincere if you would make this promise to God God I from this time standing on my feet seeking this baptism of the Holy Ghost I shall constantly pray and wait until you fill me with the Holy Ghost without you make that promise to God by raising your hands I will constantly pray constantly until you fill me with sweetness and goodness of the Spirit I offer my prayer for you now as we borrow his and that he begins to pray you see our Heavenly Father they are trophies of your presence they know that these words are true because they are yours they know that they have been give by the Holy Spirit because they are the wood of God and they have been convinced that they need you that they need sweetness of the Holy Spirit in their life to give them overcoming power and they will receive power from on high receive the power to live a Christian life to receive power to overcome temptations as the song we just singing they gathered in the upper room and was trained in his name they were baptized with the Holy Ghost and powerful service came and at what they want powerful service to come upon them I pray thee father as your servant as you have seen them reason their hands that they have made a pledge to you and a promise a day shall never cease they will not lead a sight but they will pray until you fill them Lord to a satisfying portion of the holy presence in their life I offer my prayer in their behalf Lord as your servant that they'll be filled with the Holy Ghost Lord I pray they will not leave this church until that happens that will be right there under each soul it's filled with the Holy Ghost granted Lord doe-eyed God the Almighty he was manifested in the flesh to take away the sins of the world you rose on Eternia cells on high and you are here tonight among us and in the name of the Holy Spirit we pray father that your precious Lord you will fill each one of them with your own self and may they be a blessing to your kingdom and in the world that is to come and one day when you finally see another Road maybe today yet we don't know whether we'll be but may I be able Lord to be counted among those who go in the rapture may these be the ones that go in the rapture may every person and divine presence that's forbidden spirit belongs to you go into the rapture they are yours no I commit them to thee so this path to the Holy Ghost another imaginary thing it's not a distant thing it's a promise that God mean and it's a promise for you it is something to happen to you and happen in you and that is your please note if you believe this Laurita got the new bird you have to have the new but by being believe in Allah Jesus Christ my having faith and accept him as their Savior that's bit because you are passed from death unto life and if you want to scripture he said send John 5:24 he that hear my words and believe it on him that sent me has everlasting life see he's got life because he believes no watch but the Holy Ghost is power for service so when you talk about your gut to be born again and I pilots at the Holy Ghost many of the Methodism so forth along the air Cannady it won't cope with true the scripture you getting sideways you shall receive the new but after this no you shall receive power acts 1:8 after the Holy Ghost I come upon you they are already had eternal life so forth but they had to have the Holy Ghost for power you shall be witnesses unto me after the Holy Ghost come upon you because the Holy Ghost is a witness of the resurrection show in you have become an adult in Christ I think I want to say that again the Holy Ghost is a witness of the resurrection showing that you have become an adult in Christ and it's Wesley hadn't stepped out on the word and got a bad name and was called a crazy man and everything else he would have never be able to achieve but Wesley was one of God quits scientists Luther was one of great Godwin scientists and they didn't care what the churches said what the

wish it is I am so Jesus was almost nondescript it wasn't somebody or some people and have personality power when you walk in a room it's you but Jesus didn't seem to be like that there was no these Communists that your desire him what he is despised rejected of men a man of sorrows acquainted with grief we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised we esteemed him not surely he had borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted underline that hallelujah yet we esteemed him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are here with all those stripes there was no healing oh glorious got if the devil only knew if the devil only knew what that day of Calvary was going to produce he was gonna tell Jesus don't go there don't go there down only stove OD it but they was calling for his blood didn't know what it was calling for because he didn't have the blood of a man he had the blood of court or glory the God who you wanna choose Barabbas or Jesus they said give us Barabbas what do you

humor whatever condition [Applause] he was wounded let me see for transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes were healed and all we like sheep have gone astray not some all we like sheep have gone astray we have telling everyone it is always and the Lord had laid on him the iniquity of us all of us all of us all the issue today the sin that is why we needed a savior because she was still sin that is why we need a tournament the issue is still sing of Calvary or cattle or - oh if you could save yourself he did not go to the cross if you could do it yourself you did not even have to go to the cross but because you can do it because they couldn't get back because they wouldn't come back to God somebody mess away [Applause] [Music] maybe season so your filthy self-righteousness is boo I know someone you would get that because I still filthy self-righteous if keeping the law couldn't make you perfect then the law study on

the man along and manifested up with them random date that he had come there people along and lift that and that was God Himself living in the people because he was an answering of his world so that's why the Prophet said they're not interested in living it they interested in debate in it so they wonder brains are doctrinal argument but the manifestation is interpretation so they don't want a life

the church said still the car said still you will sit still without the dynamics without their spirit everybody said still oh my hallelujah so no matter how much you see I sympathize I believe every word of that you've got to have some of this fact that off to make a 100 octane go to foreign and the big truth of God go to move in is got to take the mechanics here we go with the dynamics nothing is wrong with the mechanics but lacking dynamics and I think that's what the matter with the church today we lack the dynamical power to press the word and make it live for this day so it doesn't matter hold right somebody is in the doctrine where is he dynamics to press the word to make the world seven lives because that's what we want the world to live the word to walk or the page of the Bible manifests itself the see cancer defeated listen every action of Jesus was to expose the sit-ins kingdom when he cast out devils it expose it only in them the maniac man he exposes the kingdom he

but over before we go to the rapture we have a stop yeah I thought we just compensation consumed the rapture no no no you have a stop he said the dynamics of the promise would has to get in the church and drive them because they're not volunteering to go ahead the payments had to disappear inside here nobody up could you show me the direction to Calvary anybody knows I want to get there quickly no

and where banham says he says okay that day was so important it was one of the greatest days he said the one great importantly at Calvary means to us under the world it's settled the sin question once and for all man was found guilty of sin and sin was a penalty that no man could pay the penalty was so great until there wasn't anyone could pay the penalty and I truly believe God ordained it that way that the penalty would be so great that no man could pay it that he could do it himself now if the penalty was of sin was death and we were all born in sin and shape iniquity come to earth speaking lies therefore there was none of us was worthy or they could find no one on it that was worthy and sin did not stack and sin started in heaven Lucifer the terror was a condemned creature for his disobedience before he ever struck the earth sin began in heaven where court put the Angels upon the same basis that he put human beings on knowledge the tree of knowledge or the Tree of Life

earth back in the beginning like a sheet of blackness fallen upon the heavens it literally paralyzed it it showed every creature any good all of Ag all creation and bondage man was under bondage of debt sickness trouble sorrows all nature of elevated sin was anesthetic anesthetic that actually paralyzed the earth and when we set a hopeless cause every creature note was subject to it everyone born on earth was subjugated so it had to come from someplace where there was no sin it could not come from the earth one could not redeem the other Oh glory to God so that's why the prophecy for Messiah had to come a full change shall conceive so wanted to bring the egg and sperm outside the realm of human or Gloria caught but he had to be a kinsman so he had to go through the baby process to

that the divine gift can do is to stir your fate to that storm but healing you will save nine years ago when Jesus Christ paid the price for the sins of the world and he was wounded therefore every person is building tonight that is sick has been healed nineteen hundred years ago when Jesus died and if a person can't just take God at His Word and see the work finished here Calvary I'm accepted in his own life that's Atlas right here it is all that necessary but this is power I want to get to gorgeous brought the world into existence this very world that we're setting on tonight is nothing as but the Word of God materialized if it didn't where did he get the material to make it out of and there was and every word of God has got to be so and He is God are you ready now everybody up and alive what he is God and he has to keep his word and you take any divine promise in your heart and see that is my personal property it belongs to me I am a believer and accepted on that basis and watch what it will do it will make the cancers move it will make blind eyes come upon it will make the Clippers walk and you'll make the death here I know what I'm talking about so I possess it a test and an experience over years and years around the world and the world knows about it [Applause] just a few more on reclose so get excited if your eyes want to close don't put the toothpick and roll it up that was not the time to get your eyes closed on this one every sinner in the world was forgiven when Jesus Calvary are you still with me but it will never do you any good until you accept it you have got to accept it then it becomes your personal property then you can get down there the altar you don't necessarily have to come but I believe in altars get on the altar you could cry you could pray you could walk up and down you or you could pull you're here just go on but that isn't what sees you you say you have to believe that you are saved until you believe you have to believe and when you really believe no matter if you are the altar or out in the street wherever it is when you believe it and accept it then it becomes your personal property a gift of God by grace oh my hallelujah oh my this is a Padawan again he said the next thing every sin and he has saved right now that have ever been that has been since you sinned but will never do you any good for either one for your healing or your salvation until you accepted as your own personal property then it comes to effect when you begin to accept it as your personal property or praise the name of the Lord and this our
