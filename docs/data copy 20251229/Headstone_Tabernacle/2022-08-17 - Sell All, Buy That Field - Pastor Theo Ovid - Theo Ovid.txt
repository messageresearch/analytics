magnified be glorified in almost in jesus name i ask it amen amen god bless you and welcome thank you so much for coming out this first round that we back in church it's good to be back in church after all this coronavirus and everything else we are getting long to business so tonight if you have your bibles i'd like to turn to matthew chapter 13. i want to read verse 44 to 46 of matthew chapter 13. thank you once again for being here tonight jesus speaks matthew 13 44 again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hid in the field the witch when a man had found he hide it and for joy thereof go it and sell it all that he had and buy it that field again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls who when he had found one pool of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it let's pray again lord we have read your word and i i was inspired by this treasure here in the field and lord i came here tonight and i'm dependent upon you to interpret it to your people father bless it in jesus name i ask it amen praise god you may be seated amen sovereign title tonight strange title but uh i'll give it before i say that i want to appreciate brother stephen alvarez tonight the life of the redeemed thank you so much what a uh inspiring message i certainly appreciate that thank you for blessing us so long we have good from breast even but you delivered amen praise god so the title after that is sell all by that field that's the title i have tonight sell all by that feel not any feel that feel filled with the treasure praise god that verse uh that we read verse 44 the kingdom of heaven in the amplified says the kingdom of heaven is like something precious buried in the field which a man found and hid again i like that part he found it and he hired it then in his joy he goes and sells all he has and by the whole field to get the treasure you have to buy the whole field because he feel has the treasure you want the treasure you have to buy that field what do you mean by buy pay a price this is going to cost you something it's not free it's going to cost you hallelujah when you see the value of that treasure you prepare to sell all because you know what you're getting you know what you're buying or give the lord some praises okay let's continue let me say this any doctrine teaching that hinders you or keep you from the kingdom is of the devil any doctrine any teaching that keeps you away from the holy ghost from the kingdom of god is of the devil doesn't matter who teach it who preach it who unveil it to unfold it doesn't matter who he is because the only two kingdoms there's only two forces is the kingdom of light and the kingdom of the darkness and jesus the bible speaks about he keeps he's the kingdom of heaven is at hand oh praise the name of the lord i'm going to read matthew 4 and when jesus was 12 had heard that john was cast into prison he departed to the galilee leaving nazareth he came until in capernaum which is upon the seacoast in the borders of zabalan and naftalim that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by is the prophet saying the land of zabalan the land of nephilim by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilei of the gentiles the people with saturn darkness so a great light so them which sat in the region of the shadow of death light is sprung up oh praise god from that time jesus began to preach and say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand oh glory to god so his first message of introduction was the kingdom of heaven is at hand in other words this natural world kingdom with demon activity hidden jesus was about to expose satan's kingdom hidden on the earth he was going to expose it by casting devils by opening the blind eye by healing the sick by raising the dead that's showing there's a higher kingdom that the kingdom of this world and that's why jesus said my kingdom oh glory to god praise god the angel going to fight for me but i represent a different kingdom altogether glory to god isn't that right he said repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand matthew 23 13 he said born to you scribe and pharisees hypocrites for you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for you neither go in your cells neither suffering them that are entering to go in there is something to go in the kingdom you have to go in what killed you getting lost some praises you just sit and hang around you have to go in this kingdom the bible says the kingdom is preaching every man every man every man pressed their way into it could you give the lord a shout tonight i feel good being here i was excited to come tonight i earned a great expectation oh globe buy that field tonight oh you have something to purchase hallelujah you have a price to pay are you willing to pay it hallelujah praise god he said born to you scribe and parties hypocrites for you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men they're not going in and they don't let the people go in they're on the surface and it's a conference of intellectual or gymnast verbal gymnastics i call it flipping here and flipping there glory to god brother branham oh god make men and women rise in the power of the spirit you hear that oh god make men and women rise in the power of the spirit let that unconverted that dejected devil that has harmed the human race down through the age stand here and defy the church of living god say it and come out and leave in the name of jesus christ a rejected rejected spirit looking for houses he has no house he has no home this eight is not his home he was kicked out to heaven and the battle of angels became the battle of men praise god causing african families homes life bodies and everything else but tonight we're going to expose him tonight jesus is raised from the dead alive forevermore praise god and there's a higher power a higher kingdom oh glory to god holly my kingdom is not of this world or give the lord some praises i want to say it again he said my kingdom is not of this world let us go now you that's got strength enough to yield a sword now you have got understanding enough in god's word to claim it to be your personal property oh glory to god not just a generalization when you start to claim this thing as your personal property the holy ghost is mind joy is mine healing is mine all glory to god deliverance that's mine still freedom that's mine or give the lord some praises personal property not general for everybody this rapper is not a general thing there between a bed one take and one left there'll be two in the field one taken one left this word of promise have to become your personal property you're not here because of me you're not here because of your wife or your husband or this church you're here because god has oprah put your name on the book and he died that he might reveal to you your inheritance that is your personal right like brother stephen preached praise god on sunday it's your right or give the lord some praises oh hallelujah the bible tell us we are no longer strangers but we are fellow citizens of the household of god when you are citizens you have rights when you're not a citizen you don't have rights oh glory to god because you're not a citizen but when you are citizen of the country you have rights in that country and when you are citizen of the household of faith in the kingdom of god you have redemptive rights that jesus died for and tonight you can claim your redemptive rights to be healed to be delivered to be sealed to be baptized to be refilled to be adopted to go right back to where adam was before the fall or give the lord a shout because the lamb already took the book loose the seven seals to reveal our redemptive rights by that field tonight the treasures in it or give the lord some praise it worth selling not all oh hallelujah praise god you who have got an understanding enough of god's word to claim it to be your personal property who can pick up the word of god in your hand hold it in your hand of faith and say i take my side with the lord i'll be oneness with my god from this on i would yield this sword of the spirit in this word i'll cut the devil to every promise that god has given me god set it up that way for you to fight for all your rights fight for your blessing is that right he said now what is the van healing does it mean that we have to wait till tomorrow night to be healed he said no sir do i have to come to church no sir the moment you believe god and accept it as your personal property it is finished right then praise god praise god but the kangaroo will share with me uh some minister was talking about all the people that recovered from from from fourth stage cancer the all of them when they checked them out they had to forgive because unforgiveness brings on cancer and brings on human brings on all kind of stuff in people's body and all the people that recovered their people actually recovered from fourth stage cancer and every one of them had was to forgive heart was to release that forgiveness i forgive i forgive i forgive and drop your heart and be a bunch of christians loaded praise god sell it say lord what you got hallelujah then would it praise god get rid of it praise god the moment you believe oh bro okay let's see do i have to come to church no sir the moment you believe god and accept it as your personal property it's finished right then that's right when i was healed by the branham i was saved last week i was saved night before last 10 years ago you were saved 1900 years ago when jesus died for you at calvary and every redemptive blessing that god has for you jesus said at the cross it is finished everything is done paid for oh glory to god you have to accept your redemptive rights you can't accept and feel bad by being so rich you get quiet inside of here you say rich yes i am very rich rich in faith rich in forgiveness rich in love god could bless you with so much riches praise god your rich man don't even know it hey of the it oh give the lord some praises hallelujah you have got to know positionally first christ where you stand you are heir to this it's your personal property you see this here is not striking just yet it's your pool it's not property it is still general you hear any word but your feet have to hook into it just say that his mind you know hey that's my i'm not a stranger to this thing you know it's not like i had to beg of god could i could i have it please it's not that you know it's you it's yours something you died for it come like somebody pay for some sandwiches or pay for some food for you and it's paid for and you're going on any line like if you know like if you have to pay again and you're not sure you're supposed to line up to get this food you say but it's paid for where is my food is it this one that one or that one you cannot be denied it has been paid for you have the ticket of purchase you present your ticket you have to give you the food they can say you're paying for that that's not in the business praise god you're not that you're money buy it that is none of the business and you can tell them that's none of your business it is paid for i have a right i want my food i want my box i want my sandwich whatever is paid for i want it oh praise god but you're poor that i have nothing to do with him in the same closet away where last week he went this week that i'm gonna do with it it's paid for and i want what jesus paid for what jesus died for i want that if it's the same penny i want that if the same day i want that if the same holy ghost same sensation same sign same wonders same staggering praise god hallelujah praise god i know they like the one without sensation we want all what it have without sensation with sensation we taking all we are picking and choosing is the same spirit the same spirit that justify the lutherans sanctify the methodists baptize the pentecostal another different holy horse the same one is now setting an order the coming of the lord jesus will give the lord some praises tonight same holy spirit praise god them cigarette smoking their drinking justified people they were justified by the holy ghost but when sanctification came that same holy ghost that justified them came and sanctified them and when the pentecostal came that same sanctifying power of the holy ghost began to baptize them fire glory to god give the lord a shout oh and that same holy ghost is here tonight that they said god that same holy ghost is here tonight jesus said i will not leave you comfortless i'm going to come to you little while the world sees me no more but you are going to see me god said so oh that every man will be a lie and let that bible would be true oh hallelujah i'll give you another comforter whom the world cannot receive but he's going to be in you he is now with you but he's going to be in you it's a word i promise it's the word of god we're we ain't talking favors we are talking nancy stories and we ain't talking about foolishness from no dream or no vision we're talking the bible oh glory to god when paul got to the experience he went back and check it back in the bible oh glory to god he went and finally his experience match up with the word then he could come along and preach with power and preach with faith in so much you say for angel come from heaven and preach any other gospel let him be accursed he was so convinced that the same pillar fire that moses met is what he meant he was convinced that the same jehovah god that spoke to moses was speaking to him to unveil the old testament he said if any man take him spiritual or a prophet let him acknowledge what i say is the commandment of god but if he be ignorant let him be ignorant oh glory to god he was convinced and he was a star in the right hand of almighty god oh give the lord i shout glory to god be going right back to the days of the apostles you hear me church we are going right back to the days of the apostles same holy ghost same discernment same signs same wonders same miracles oh give the lord some praises glory to god glory to god note i did not say anything about revealing mysteries on unveiling seals but i see to bump you now i always do talk seals talk mysteries talk talk talk stuff and jesus incredible teacher he only spoke things that they could connect with in those days when they are treasured they had to hide it banda said no no no start you know and and and and i guess the the best place to hide it was in the field nobody looking no fear so when you have your treasure you hide it hide it from bandits sorry from rubbers you hide it somewhere and this man passed into this field see some kind of thing and suddenly make him dig and check it and he see the treasure he said well he no fool he's taking them hiding again you know he can't rub if you take it he's a rubber yeah he can walk cause he's a teeth he can't take that out to the field he has to hide it somewhere else because somebody somebody see the same thing and dig it up and take it so he hide it somewhere else i said how much would that feel when they call the price boy he said but i know what in that field it worked and then he's at a cell he's at a cell oh i forgot something here an inspiration what are you prepared to give up pray my expression is a question what are you prepared to give up because when he saw the value of the treasure he started to sell sally said he said your house he friggin stove he's had a cell people thought he was crazy praise god but he was selling because he found something of a greater value that what he was cherishing all along what you holding on to what you can't let go what you don't want to give up praise god when you see this great treasure it changes your thinking all the things you wouldn't let go all your things you wouldn't let go and give up you give up your pride your lust your passion whatever it is praise god he begin to sell sell sell sell sell until he buy that field and know once he buy the fever you have the treasure oh give the lord a shout god put a treasure in the seven seals and that treasure is seven thunders that treasure is seven voices that trevor has seven mysteries right inside the deer ministers don't want to go inside a deer but that is hidden inside a deer that's a bright call that's a bright calling we'll give the lord a shout seven thunders give faith for that bride call the bride together show the right hope to prepare is the prize revival it's something hidden inside the seals or give the lord a shout oh hallelujah mysteries inside that book it's been applied to us it's becoming effective but there's a price to be paid [Music] that is where life begins eternal life when you come to cut you're hearing it but it's a strike in here because this is not we're not preaching anything new this is slain here but some point in time this will be quickened to you when you go home and you start to believe everything is yours and this is yours then you either tell that devil get off but you will say get off in a different way it's a different faith that you're going to have to say get out look the exit there what are you doing here look the exit is there oh glory to god every promise belong to you hallelujah praise god do you know the angel of the lord and camp around those that fear him praise god what what you're fearing any angel and camp is what you want to emphasize it's what you want to look at you're looking at the enemy or you're looking at the angel you're looking at the enemy armies are you looking at them then firings are all around you praise god you said that i said open this boy eyes he said there is more for us than against us it was always so praise god no power of the devil could overcome the power of god that's a lie from the peter hell he had been defeated every time satan is a loser man jesus is the winner man oh give the lord a shout he lost his battle tonight oh glory to god we have the victory here tonight just to be here in church and that is the victory glory to god we overcome laziness fruitfulness tiredness don't want to go to church fed up tad covered overcome all of that we have this flesh to overcome we overcome time too because time shall be no more or give the lord i shout this corruptable will put on incorruption we're gonna be changed or give the lord a shout we'll overcome them five senses we're gonna come their flesh senses are we gonna go into rapture in faith rapture in grace and we're gonna take off like a bullet or give the lord some praises glory to god have a word we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in a twinkle of an eye oh glory to god the trumpet of the lord shall sound thank you lord jesus every promise is yours it's all yours it's to you maybe you haven't searched it maybe you haven't looked down to find out where the promise is for you you can't come and receive the holy ghost unless you really believe you're gonna get it and if they don't believe it they can't get it that is why the foolish virgins never get it or give the lord a shout but you wise virgins here and on online world you want to ask and it shall be given unto you you're going to seek and you shall find you when the knock on the door shall be opened unto you we'll give the lord a shout tonight oh glory to god everyone and ask it receive it everyone that seek and find it everyone that knock it the door shall be open keep on knocking come on now keep on seeking come on now keep on asking if oh god have mercy jesus said if we wicked as we are nowhere to give good gifts to our children how much more god going to give the holy ghost to them that ask him if you don't ask him you're not gonna get it don't talk about being done with me according to that word that was from mary that same marriage in the upper room they said no be it done on me according to your word at all miss location of scripture may be able to hit the upper room and stagger like every one of them lose our pride and everything else for a long and staggered this systemary was shaking like a leaf up in the upper room you were too same power same fire oh glory the same anointing praise god you ever see people under the anointing of emotions they win a prize they win something the winner special they will come first and you see them get all emotional and whatnot that is something real you know that there's something happening to them you know and christian's dead as an o'neill what's wrong with you oh when god headed he is still alive one songwriter said feeling in my hands i feel in my feet i feel him all over me god's not dead he's still alive hallelujah praise god praise god praise god hallelujah they're shouting ball games they're shouting cricket they shout that football and people don't want to shout for the kingdom of god we're with you when jesus come right now a donkey listen oh glory to god thank you jesus we belong to a kingdom i hope you see that tonight not church whoa glory to god by one spirit we are baptized into that kingdom he said you cannot come and receive the holy ghost unless you really believe it's going you're gonna get it god is more anxious for you to get it than you are to receive it [Music] so there's a hit to receive more anxious he wants you to have it it's yours it's your personal property [Music] nowhere he said you are at it you are holy spirit nowhere you say that here you know that's a lie from the bit he said you have to get it you have to receive it jesus said receive thee the holy ghost it's something you have to receive oh glory to god hallelujah are you with me tonight hear the prophet now i can go on record for this tonight if any people will take the right mental attitude was any mac any divine promise that god ever made and claim it for yours don't miss that party don't just say promise you know but claim it for yours watch god will bring it to pass if you take the right attitude towards it knowing if god said so the promise is yours and it's your personal property the very minute you receive it that way that way there's a way to receive it and when you receive it that way it becomes your personal property then you're walking in faith by revelation hey and you could speak by the revelation of your faith oh give the lord some praises tonight hope you see it hallelujah so what god will bring it to pass if you take the right attitude towards it knowing if god said so the promise is yours and it's your personal property the very minute you receive it that way then it has to come to pass he's not hoping so i'm guessing so oh my praise the name of the lord mark 10 17 we read and when he was going forth into the way there came one running kneel to him and asked him good master what shall i do that i'm inheriting eternal life and jesus said unto him why call his dawn me good there is no good but one that is gone don't know is the commandments and jesus introduce a few to him that's what jesus is there he he almost like he beat him he he put out certain ones in him and these were the ones do not commit adultery do not kill three do not steal four do not be a false witness five defraud not six honor thy father and mother so jesus presented six and the boy and the man said he answered and seven say master all these have i observed for my youth then jesus this is the tough part now behold in him loved him i said unto him one thing though lucas now this is a class act even jesus presented to him go thy way sell whatsoever dog has and give to the poor and those shall have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me and he was sad at that scene and when we grieved for he had great possessions now obviously he missed some commandment there he missed helping his neighbor he missed seeing people who in need are not helping them he had he was in power to help them he did not there was greed there there was lust there but they are humans they could love and everything else by the spirit that is there and even though he was performing the outward church message thing there was something still lacking now let's look again at the same scripture in the same story in matthew 19 and i want to read it from the script the young man said unto him all these things have i kept from my youth up what la yet so you get a confirmation that these things are what he does so i'm fine to that point what i'm missing here jesus said unto him listen matthew 19. if thou will be perfect so this gave a different spin on this whole parable now if thou will be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and those who have treasured heaven and come follow me and when the young man heard that saying he went to be sorrowful for he had great possessions oh my buddy you see if you don't go according to the will of god the way that god has given us to go they always get messed up and take off in some organization or denomination he said watch you talk about this boy that boy was confronted with he had been a member of maybe the pharisees or sadducees some great order of that day he was religious as he could be i've observed these commandments i don't want to listen to this is a story you know i want you to see this as message folks yeah i want you to see this as religious message people he said i've observed these commandments i've been taught since i was a youth and jesus loved him for it but he refused to be guided he refused to accept the real leadership of jesus christ to give him eternal life notice he believed there was something different than what he had or he would have never said good master what must i do now no he wanted to do something himself that's the way we do we want to do something ourselves the gift of god is a free gift god give it to you you don't have wanting for it he ordained it to you and you're going to have it see notice he knew it was there he believed in it wanting it so i want the holy ghost to want the blessing i want dynamics i want breakthrough let's continue but when he was confronted with how he had to do it what he wanted i want the treasure you know it's hitting the field but how are you guys in the field you have to buy it how are you going to buy it sell all sell what you have i hope this is helping someone tonight when he was confronted with how he had to do it it was different from his ritual it was different he could hold his money and belong to the church that he belonged to and so forth but jesus knew that he knew he hoarded his money there was a demon a money demon back there a demon a lust and god want to free him from the lust not god want to make him poor you know sell to give is not to make him poor you know it's to get him delivered from that spirit because spirit having bone if he give it will lose him from that the spirit had no connection with that he can't this period can ride on that he said go and sell your gut and give it to the poor come take up your course and follow me and you'll have treasures in heaven but he couldn't do it the other leaders that he had in his beautiful days here we go this is deep had such an influence on him till he refused to accept god's provided way which was jesus christ the only one who holds eternal life the only one that could give you it not the church can give you eternal life not your neighbor not your pastor not your priest not your creed only jesus christ himself can give you eternal life why people hold on to their pastor why people hold on to their creed why people hold in their church and only jesus christ can give them eternal life or give the lord some praises hallelujah then the prophet presented this no matter how good you are one what you quit doing what you start doing you've got to accept the person of the lord jesus christ and then when you do that he is the word and then your life fits right into the word and it's manifest itself to the ease you're living in how could you be in the message and have no forgiveness that is madness when this message is forgiveness how could you be in this message and don't have the spirit of brotherly kindness and forgiveness to forgive your brother when that's the only door to enter into the holy spirit slot god put broadly kindness right there when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any if you're fed up on me talk with early kindness you're gonna get fed up again because i'll keep talking about it praise god there's the entrance door to the holy spirit if you can't strike brotherly kindness you can't get in the holy spirit oh glory to god because faith for the holy spirit is based on forgiveness or give the lord some praises tonight oh give the lord some a shout tonight hallelujah praise god what is the kingdom of heaven the church was built upon divine revelation of god flesh and blood had no reveals unto you peter but my father was in heaven has revealed it to you and upon this rock spiritual revelation of the word i will build my church jesus talk about my church not our church here you're talking about his church his church is built upon what revelation okay that means the spirit reveal it not pastor unfold spirit reveal what he's saying my reveal pastor could speak but the spirit should not take the word and reveal and when it's revealed to you it's a revelation and that revolution is yours that is your neighbor owned by your husband now your iphone is yours you could be sitting next to a husband wife whoever and god given you revelation they cannot know your revelation or give the lord a shout because it's himself revealed to you and in you oh give the lord some praises tonight hallelujah and that's why the prophet said divine revelation is more important to you than you think not understanding revelation because people understand a lot of things but they don't have the revelation of it because revelation is fate revelation gives you authority revelation help you to stand whitening abram staggered not for 25 years it's because he had a revolution the doctor couldn't fish it over him demon his physical body couldn't tell him anything like he can say his body dead he said but you lying i'm gonna have a son praise god watching sarah buddy that they threw him off praise god he can make excuse well backsliding are drinking no because here about the old is a tough thing to believe that even was not foolishness he said god said so anytime he never presents him god said so shaytan you didn't hear what god say oh what go and listen back again play the tape and see what god said i ain't changing it god are changing it he can't change his mind about this word i am going to be changed in a moment in a trigger where i i'm going to wait till my change come oh give the lord some praises when joe finished digging his balls what jib job said he said i know my redeemer i love it that was revelation talking there pray though this king won't destroy my body he's not denying that yet in my flesh he's prophesying i shall see god for myself personal property and not another or give the lord a shout in the house that's when man break into revelation no devil in hell could stop that the devil tell god he gonna make job curse him and job made the devil a liar or give the lord a shout in the house and i don't care what you have been through what the devil say about you you're gonna make him a liar oh give the lord some praises you are going to overcome you're going to be filled with the holy ghost god going to heal you god going to steal you god god to deliver you i'm going to raise you up i'm going to give you a revival oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah glory to god so his church not our church his church is built upon revelation and god graduation is suffering in god so we gotta go don't give she don't give he go give them foolishness god god in charge of revelation i thank you jesus that's it god the father holy spirit is in charge of divine revelation pastors preachers bishop and message pope is in charge of divine information not divine information information sorry they could pump information pump understanding and mistake that but it's your revelation they don't have to give they can't give that the spirit alone can give that oh that's wonderful tonight you know what that means nobody could keep me back from i feel like flying tonight nobody could stop me from getting revelation i will call him a liar and tell him go back where they come from or give the lord some praises i feel like dancing tonight the spirit alone is in charge why why is syllable over because jesus asked who do men say i am what what all them had a testimony men say you're dismissed they're glad to talk about somebody else what are they talking about let's talk men say you're this man say that do you say who do you say i am when it comes to the personal property thing personal revelation thing personal understanding all them get caught they could say well men say but they had no revelation of who that man standing there three years they couldn't see who he was over a certain piece don't got the christ something come upon peter you know jesus identify it he said flesh and blood did not reveal that to you you may gather for no person no bishop no teacher no apostle no man of god of the hour no message pope you ain't get that from them but my father has revealed upon to you and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall never prevail against it oh give the lord some praises peace out with a rock in his soul no demon can take that out he denied christ but not inside his soul no devil could get inside a deer god put a seed inside a deer not gonna be baptized with fire and with the holy ghost and the same god that put that seed in peter he put the seed in you not gonna be baptized with the holy ghost on fire oh give the lord a shout glory that seed in you go get fire on it you will not be the same you can't be the same oh hallelujah praise god let's continue he said looter methodist wherever they are whatever pentecostal whatever they are doesn't make a bitter difference when the church of god moves on in the power of the inspiration she will move right on and on and on and on and no denomination can stop it i'm still reading nothing in the world will stop it upon this rock i will build my church and the case of hell cannot prevail against it spiritual revealed truth no watch now the next he says i don't want peter and i will give unto thee watch because he had the spiritual revealed truth that's the reason he know the difference between father son and holy ghost the name of the lord jesus christ he had a spiritual revelation and that's what you are understanding tonight where the holy spirit is opening up to us he said don't watch simon and i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever you bind on this earth i will bind it in heaven whatever you lose on this earth i would lose it in heaven did he say in matthew the 16th chapter whatever you bind on earth i will bind in heaven whatever you loose on it i have loosened heaven i will give you the keys to what the kingdom of heaven what is the kingdom of heaven the holy spirit oh give the lord a praise we answer the question tonight brother congoley what is the kingdom of heaven the holy spirit oh glory to god what did jesus say the kingdom of heaven is like a man passing through a field oh glory to god and find a treasure my god i feel a spa tonight oh and what he did he sell all and he bought that field sell all buy that field oh glory to god hallelujah what is the kingdom of heaven the holy spirit the bible said the kingdom of god is within you now he said some standing here won't see that until they see the kingdom of god coming in power just a few days later was pentecost see some standing here right there the same thing some of you standing here you are being transfigured you won't see debt until you see the kingdom of god coming in power the bible said the kingdom is within you or when jesus rose from the dead remember he had on his side the keys of death and hell not the keys of the kingdom that was given to the church and peter had the keys do you believe jesus would keep his word if he doesn't so peter said i give you the keys to the kingdom in other words to the holy spirit whatever you bind on earth i will bind in heaven they said men and bridges what shall we do to be saved and what's peter he had the keys to the kingdom and when jesus rose on the third day he did not have the keys to the kingdom of heaven did you know that he said i got the keys to death and hell but not to the kingdom because it had been given to peter so peter had to unlock the kingdom and he said peter said whatever you loose on earth i'll loose in heaven whatever you're pine on it i'll find heaven now here he stands with the keys to open up the blessed thing to the world and here he got the keys in his hand they're asking him what shall we do to be saved no matter what the apostle said to do god has to recognize it in heaven as he give him that authority and peter said repent every one of you so god was honoring peter's word repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost does this apply or it does not apply or give the lord a shout peter had the keys to the kingdom oh give the lord some praises tonight wish the whole church was here hallelujah praise god praise god hallelujah you shall receive together the holy ghost that's right and that's the reason the key is turn in heaven to any other name any other way any other form it turned on earth it turned in heaven and jesus didn't keep his word to peter and it or jesus didn't keep his word to peter and every place in the bible they were baptized after that they were baptized in the name of jesus christ and their they were baptized before had to come and baptize over again in the name of jesus christ to get the holy ghost because peter unlocked the holy ghost by the key of the lord jesus christ or give the lord a shout in the house and therefore god can't honor any other thing but the baptism of the holy ghost by way of the lord jesus christ repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive something you shall receive something not a message book not a message but the gift of the holy ghost and you can put the message book and tape on top of that or give the lord some shouts in the house oh hallelujah praise god praise god hallelujah jesus said if a son acts a bread in your view that is a father luke's 11 11 will you give him a stone or if he ask a fish will for a fish give him a serpent or if he asks an egg will he offer him a scorpion if he then being evil know how to get good gifts onto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy ghost to them that ask him oh my if thou would be perfect so we read the scripture about that young man and the other scripture brings a different context of it that that selling all has to do with perfection if you want to be perfect you have to call a seal you have to pay a price it's not a huge price it's an individual price it's not a church cost it's an individual cost it don't be perfect sell oil so brother i'm talking about burnley kindness holy decency place in christ three steps three phases however you want to call it isn't that right very love holy since he placed in christ in this step and stage nobody forcing you this is powerful nobody forcing you and this is important to understand if doll will be perfect you have a choice to sell or not to sell you have a choice to buy the field although by the field you know the body feeling nobody forces anybody it's up to you if they will be perfect sell all so i want to read the scripture read again again the kingdom of heaven is like about under treasure hid in a field this is the kingdom now describing what the kingdom is like it's not the king of it like mangoes and a mango tree or apples and apple tree and you're walking there and you pick it and you pick the kingdom no it describes the kingdom as a treasure hid in a field that you discover hallelujah and when you discover it you want that treasure but to get the treasure you have to buy the field the whole field it doesn't matter the course you know because you are prepared to sell all right brother branham i want to say this he said rapturing feet is lean in the message in other words rapturing faith the faith will leave here is hidden in the word did you get that the thing to leave here is in the wood let's read when he started to write his other seven thunders he said don't write it you have to be commissioned to write everything he's seen but when those seven thunders open version 10 uttered he said don't write them at all they are mysteries we don't know what they are yet but my opinion they'll be revealed right away and when it do it will give faith for that rapture and grace for the church to move out we want to receive rapture in grace we want to be able when that mysterious thunder turn is out younger and the chase is taken up we want to be ready to receive it lord granted one more that's the reason i do believe when the bride is called out one and elected to and set in the book of life tree there will come a song from heaven that will take such a baptism of the holy spirit into that pride that will take her from the eight in a rapture in greece god promised it is no mystery doing that channel he said a baptism coming that will come into the bride such a powerful baptism it will take her off the earth oh are you in the church i am front are you in the savior's bride come and be baptized into the body and forevermore abide. so god is not forcing anybody to do anything you don't have to sell but if though would be perfect jesus said to the man go and sell oil that thou hast so tonight is up to you because matthew 5 40 it says be there for perfect as your father in heaven is perfect how does this perfection come for the brown eternal life has no end because it had no beginning it can never die because it never was born it has no beginning of days it has not enough time now the only way that we can live eternally is to receive in something that is eternal and god you see how he's saying that he's bright and born bright and thinking gotta receive something that is eternal and god was before there was anything it was god god never had a beginning on end and god he's digging down deeper was this great spirit we pictured him seven colors of the rainbow the bow would cover the earth right he says now this eternal god he was the perfect love perfect peace perfect joy perfect satisfaction all those seven spirits as we get in revelation they come out was make up god was perfection so he said the seven spirits which make up god was perfection so when you see that pyramid you know that is perfection or give the lord a shout in the house everything else outside of that has been something that has been perverted from that so that seven rainbows that seven rainbow is that perfection yeah he get a bum now and the only way that we could come back to perfection is to come back with that perfection which is god then we come back to perfection as we come back to the rainbow in the beginning was the word but before the beginning was the rainbow in the beginning was the logos but before the lowest was elohim self-existent one seven perfect spirits so he said to get back to perfection we have to get back to the semi-spirits all glory to god but in the beginning was the word to get back to perfection they go back before there was a word oh glory to god the word beginning argument there is no argument before the beginning oh give the lord a shout it was perfect oh glory to god perfection the rainbow elohim oh glory to god hallelujah so perfection come by the seven spirits of elohim forming us into this word image form in form and that's why the trials come to form and to change and to transform you that's why your faith had to be tested our feet have you have to be approved hallelujah we said it before we said it's more than more than once the dynamic struck the pentecostal and it couldn't bring the perfection because all that was the gifts they didn't have the word so god put the word in that when the dynamics strike us we could unfold and we could come to that perfection isn't that right because we have the opportunity now to be formed into the word image forming this touch of a perfect man this is the being hallelujah that's going to tie this there's a message i'm teaching that ties the man that's going to be redeemed oh glory to god talk about the redeemed life but this teach him such a perfect man seven virtues hallelujah is what tied a man that's going to be redeemed and this that this being when it's completed completed is the servant of god in the church of god that's going in the rapture if that is not completed he's not going in a rapture i don't care faithful how loyal how long we're preaching how long the gray hair is it doesn't matter how much mystery review that has to be completed at the end of the sermon he has to have seven virtues tunneling inside of him that the devil could recognize that's the thunder that shake the devil oh glory the god exposes the devil shows up the devil oh give the lord some praises perfection coming by seven spirits forming us into the word image through ii peter one four through seven by these promises we become partakers of his divine nature having escaped the corruption of this world through lust giving all diligence up to your faith virtue and devote your knowledge into knowledge temperance and patience and goodness and probably kindness and then the love of god will come the bond of perfectness paul call it oh glory to god under brother branham when he come as that big seer prophet he said that sees the whole building that nothing will leak out the building the pond of perfectness covering your being you're filled with glory and the glory is sealed inside of you you are sealed on the inside you are sealing the outside just waiting for rapture to come oh glory to god waiting for the body change oh give the lord some praises hallelujah praise god thank you jesus hallelujah glory to god go and sell separate yourself from your lust hallelujah your desire your over desire for money for whatever it is hallelujah praise god get rid of your life yours lust sanctify yourself praise god follow me consecrate yourself dedicate yourself give up sell pray go go all in praise god not just step two in this thing go all in praise god hallelujah praise god do you believe it praise god get rid of anything that's going to hinder your obedience to the holy spirit get any everything i would hinder the operation of god flow into your members or give the lord a shout then you recognize yourself as a tabernacle of the living god god want to dwell in your house god want to look to your eyes here to your ears and speak through your lips want to wear your tie and put in your chews and put on your dress oh give the lord some praises hallelujah praise god what are you prepared to give up are you prepared to sell oh my i'm going to finish i'm going to wrap up here matthew 6 19 jesus speaks lay not up for yourself treasures upon earth where molten rock does corrupt and where teaspoons steal but lay up for yourself treasures in heaven we're neither nor rust not corrupt where thieves do not break you and steal for where your treasure is dear will your heart be also you see when that man found that treasure in that field his heart oh my his heart was so stimulated that's where his treasure is that he was willing to sell all when he went back to his wife he said honey we selling the hopes we suddenly caught she said what are you going to do he said i see her feel i see a field i want to buy it have a house in it no it's not a hoax don't worry but we selling it all he's selling it by the field the treasure in it will give him house lanca it will double up triple up quadruple up whatever he'd have it have treasure in it praise god oh glory to god this thing happened to the life in it and i spoke with power in it it'd have sun come out and shine four days in it and i have a kind of miracles and omnipotence and and miscellaneous being restored and have signs and wonders and miracles in it oh glory to god they have the manifestation of the sons of god in it everything you think about every redemptive blessing in it that's why we're locked up that's why he's a treasure that's why it is hidden that's right have a key to the door oh give the lord a shout you don't lock up something that's not worthy of locking up you don't hide something that has no word or no value you hide it because it's worthy you hide it because it worth a lot oh give the lord a shout that's why the seals were sealed with seven seals seven seas on the inside written seven tons on the backside oh glory though good seven voices seal and the devil knew nothing about that that's why man god pulled back the seventh seal there were silence in heaven only for half an hour but one day that half an hour will be up and god gonna unveil what he has failed god must always be failed we have that treasure in our turn vessels oh give the lord a shout oh glory to god the kingdom of heaven is the holy spirit oh give the lord i shout my god my god my god my god hallelujah for the branham jesus rather for where your treasure is there will your heart be also this is matthew 6 21 the light of the body is the eye if therefore that i be single my whole body shall be full of light but if i be evil that whole body shall be full of darkness if therefore the light that is indeed in darkness how great is the darkness no man can save two masters either he will hate the one and love the other or it will be whole to one and despise the other you cannot save god and mammon pick a choice hallelujah therefore i sent to you therefore i said unto you jesus speaks it is in red are you ready you're almost done mission come on please take no thought for your life so he's cancelling worry immediately take no thought you were dead there you go in the glory they tell you if he's a liar take not taught their life david said young old and never seen a righteous forsaken or seeded bread that bread take no thought he cancelled worry take no talk of your life what you shall eat what you shall drink or yet for your body what you shall put on is not life more than meat and the morning born arraignment behold the falls of the air for they saw not neither did they reap nor god in the past yet your heavenly father defeated them are you not much better than they which of you by taking taught and not what cuba is stature why take a total arraignment consider the leaders of the field how they grow the toilet nut neither do they spin yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these wherefore if god so clothed the grass you saw jesus talking simple is that jesus connecting the death to them showing them lily feel valley he's talking to them that they understand anybody could understand the parable that he is of the kingdom of god he said take no thought you say wherefore if god so close the grass of the field which today isn't the more his casting day of them shall not much more clothe you and he busts them oh ye of little fit you're doing my faith to get close you don't have faith god of fear are you know what the amazing page you never went hungry hungry you never went in starvation you know only god kept you all these years come on for after all these things to the gentiles seek your heavenly father know it that you have need of these things but seek first first first the treasure first the kingdom seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added to you so make this your fullest parody i'm going to close paul i'm going to skip now paul paul became a prisoner he said the love of god has been so tremendous on such a revelation that he could not get away from it that's the true experience of every believer who meets god you come in contact with something so great you become a prisoner to everything else you get away from everything to imprison yourself to this it's expressed one time where jesus said the kingdom of heaven is something like a man behind pearls and when he find that great pearl he sells out everything he's got to get that one and that's the way here you have had intellectual conception you had theological experience but when it comes to a time when you really find the real thing you just sell out everything else and you close yourself into this and paul knew what it was he found out that he was harnessed to something like the fellow horse is a harness to pull something paul knew after this experience and three years and a half of typing the experience he had with the bible he realized that god had chosen him and had harnessed him by the holy spirit the experience he had to pull the gospel in the presence of the gentiles the spirit itself harnessed him and today as servants of christ we become harnessed hooked up we can't go anywhere without us harness to the word no matter what anyone else says you harness it there is something about it it's it's that you just can't get away from it you have been yoked up by the holy ghost has yoke you to the word no matter what anyone else say is the word that has harnessed up with it put the yoke with it to the word unto the spirit and i'm done with the final scripture reading from second corinthians four one to seven are we going to close you'll begin to play something paul speaks therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we think not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftsness no handling the word of god deceitfully now he is saying that because it is possible for a man to handle the word of god deceitfully that is why paul is saying that here but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god but if all gospel be hidden it is hit to them that are lost in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them that believe not least the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is in the image of god should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness had shine in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god another verse has bought hers heavenly father we thank you for your presence lord what you give me i have given to your people this kingdom of heaven this treasure hidden a field is hid lord and that man went and bought that whole field we exhorted tonight to go by that field god made that treasure that treasure coming eating vessels here

deliverance and restoration for the many be healed delivered set free both here in the church and those that will be connected online father may glory fill the house maybe something like another day
