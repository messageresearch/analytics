believe it shall not make hist or shall not be ashamed I have a title tonight the stone which the bill is refused o praise the name of the Lord has the title of the night the stone wish to build this refuse all right let's see what will the Lord will do amen this one is your life what is the gospel the prophet speaks if Russia had accepted the Pentecostal blessing 75 years ago when the Holy Ghost fell in Russia they wouldn't have been Communists today so the rejection of the Holy Ghost bring that communistic Spirit upon them that is why Russia is a how old they are because of rejecting the Holy Ghost do you understand that it's not just Russia Russia Russia you know the Holy Ghost failed in Russia itself our purpose itself a Redemption for salvation for deliverance and that Holy Ghost was rejected isn't that something now 75 years ago they had a great Revival in Russia God come among them they had great revivals way into Siberia what did they do they rejected it and today the country is gone the churches can't have church only under permission and they are doomed into judgment and have gone off on this wild tangent of Communism so low to the devil so rejecting the Holy Ghost rejecting their Stoners and have consequences that goes with it he said 50 years ago the Holy Ghost fell in England he's not talking about sermons eh he's not talking about messages huh he ain't talking about Mysteries here he's talking about nice unfolding of the word I like that thought either thought he's talking about the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost do you understand that this message know nothing about that you know it has something called the Holy Ghost fall in the Holy Ghost outpouring we'll give the Lord some Praises not spoken word books Holy Ghost not present player tape Holy Ghost not Minnesota explaining Holy Ghost as long as we get it as long we get you had to get it you know Oh Glory to God Holly let's go 50 years ago the Holy Ghost fell in England and after that come George Jeffries FF Bosworth Charles price Smith biggest uh Smith um Wiggles smoke with those great warriors of the Fate 50 years ago and offered England the Holy Ghost Revival what did they do they laugh at them put them in jail call them crazy thought they'd lost their minds the churches refused the people to come hear them oh Holly this holy ghost thing the churches lock up lock up the people they don't be able to hear this holy ghost thing they thought they had lost their mind the churches refused the people to come to hear them and they heal the sick they cast out Devils done great works and because England as a nation rejected the gospel her sins is known throughout the world they hardly are more apostate nation in all the world even including Rome and France than England she's a nation praise God a mother of apostasy right where Finney and many of the Great Men preach in the Haymarket Charles Finney and Wesley and horndong she turned it down and now even last week in the papers you find out their great men are so weaken to the sex of women until spies come in and the head man was found with among them and let's get that he said what she had an excuse she's finished England is all washed up with God long time ago America 15 years ago the great human Revival continue from Pentecost broke out in the nation and there was revivals on the capital Washington DC the president the vice president great people Governors great thing taking place governance men were healed like Congressman upshot being crippled for 66 years and they could not turn their face and say it was so it was right before them and they turned it down and tonight that's the reason this nation stays she is doomed there's no hope for it at all she crossed the line between judgment and mercy she is elected in what they've got there to control the nation she is rotten to the core of politics is written the malls of the nation is lower than anything I can think of her religious system is roughner than the morals she becoming doing this she has now joined herself all these churches of the nation into the Federation of the churches and has taken the mark of the beast what a thing Christ has given them the opportunity come to my Feast the Feast of Pentecost which means 50 and when the Holy Spirit poured out on Russia they was called to the fees of penny because it's a spiritual feast and they turn it down England the Holy Ghost has poured upon them and they turn it down America the Holy Ghost has brought upon them and they turn it down he bit them three times he went out and they didn't listen to The Feast he said go and compel those people to come the table has got to be set the table is ready and yet there is room Oh Glory to God go get that Gentile Pride Oh Glory of God called kept that pride in Trinidad oh and yet there is room oh hallelujah praise God do you love it tonight hallelujah praise God I believe he said within a few months or something a year whatever God is going to send another shaken across the country for there is somebody still out there somewhere that is predestinated seed that the light has to fall on somewhere in the world the nation itself is gone I believe there's a prophecy right inside a deal there'll be one more ride I'll ride a trail once more the Holy Ghost the white horse rider Or Glory God you're gonna ride Hallelujah turn on the western right back oh blessed be the name of the Lord do you love him tonight o praise God let's continue praise God Israel in the church listen when they build the Temple of Solomon and you missions here no this is pretty good they brought the series from Lebanon they floated them down as far as dropper whole element by Oxford and so forth and they cut out all these Stones all around the world Was Heard because the wisdom of God come down upon Solomon with all the drawings and all the dimensions and descriptions that David left that they could apply for all around the world to bring this bring that bring that bring that and everything sized perfectly in Oh Glory the God Hallelujah from all around the world oh God and slide them perfectly perfectly Oh Glory to God do you believe that Hallelujah let's let's go now watch and they cut out all these Stones all around the world and they come together and it was perfect mystery and in 40 years in building of the temple there wasn't a buzz or a saw or the song of a hammer every stone went one was cut this way one was cut that way one was cut back this way every one of them went together they started laying the thing putting the building up getting along fine and they found a funny looking Stone they didn't want the thing they said they don't belong here and they kicked it out they throwed it over the weed pile come to find out they build on and on and on come to final the very stone that rejected was received Cornerstone Oh Glory to God are tonight pray under the section have the funny Stone Oh Glory to God hallelujah and today the Methodist the Baptist the Lutheran the Pentacles are everywhere if you don't watch out friends the real Cornerstone you're rejecting it and the Cornerstone in the building of this spiritual house is the Holy Spirit as the Cornerstone a stone that will start from Hallelujah you afraid of it and I believe people afraid of it you are afraid of it you're afraid of fanaticism I know we got a lot of old scarecrow and mockery why if there wasn't that it wouldn't be a real one there's a genuine article of the holy spirit in the baptism let me say it again there's a genuine article of the holy spirit in the baptism that's true no they have rejected it oh we can do that well we can't have that brother Branham watch he said if this Christian religion is to take its first film stand upon the ability of intellectuals then we don't need the Holy Spirit that's right if the Christian faith exists upon educational programs upon the nomination and so forth and the building of big buildings whatever we have today then we do not need the Holy Spirit to run the church but brother this great new spirit that we are speaking about is this new church that Ezekiel Saw was not to be run upon by intellectuals it was to be run by the Holy Spirit that's why they thought about Peter a man and learned filled with the Holy Ghost Oh Glory to God they were unlearned but they were held with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah a man on land but he got the key to the kingdom okay the Lord I shout in the house glory to God and write on the deer is where the brother Brahm said that we said it last service Sunday you cannot bring a message of this brand new Holy Spirit baptism into a dry formal greedy Church you just can't do it you can't hardly get the message to the old former believing and Jesus spoke of that a long time ago when did Jesus talk about that how did Jesus talk about that you know when you talk about that the parable of the new wine in all bottles Oh Glory the God he said cannot put new Holy Ghost wine in dry message bottles oh Gloria God did you hear me tonight you can't put Holy Ghost Wang and dry 40 50 years in the message bottles glory to God he said you put new wine in all bottles well I thought what difference does it make today here we go is he had to go back to the context that Jesus was speaking of to understand that all right it context he said now today he said we have glass bottles but whether it is New or Old it does make a difference but when I visit Eastern countries the Orient I found out the water bottles of that day was made of animal skin and when the animal skin was fresh new skin and when it got all and dry set to take new unfermented wine and put a deer with new wine on fermented with the germ of life in it when it begins to ferment the old butter was so Seth set and stiff there was an explosion it couldn't hold it so Jesus gave the parable you can't put new wine into all bottles the fresh skin or the new skin have oil in it and the oil make it flexible oh God you could stretch you could raise your hands you could say hallelujah they could jump a little bit you could walk a little bit you could dance a little bit Oh Glory to God because it's Holy Ghost this holy ghost that I have the world doesn't give it to me the world and give it the world can't take it away or give the Lord some Praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah how far are we in the message from the scriptures but upon people said dry before they even get you wine do they get new oil to get his skin a little flexible because I'm all in your skin in my ball Hallelujah you might you might even show okay man yes your hand might even go up you might even stand up Oh Glory to God because it's a new bottle depends on you wine these people are not drunk as you suppose Or Glory they're covering the Holy Ghost selling them in the upper room Peter step out and say these people are not drunk as you suppose but this is that wine that the prophet Joel speaker they shall come to pass afterwards I'll Port my spirit and God sent a prophet to turn our hearts back to the Pentecostal fathers back to the faith of the fathers back to that new Wayne back to new wine skin oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God so if you put new wine in all bottles you lose the wine and the bottle too Oh Glory to God are you ready let the prophet preach you tonight he said you can't take this brand new heaven born Pentecostal wine and mix it up with them old-time Creed all set in the way died in the world if you do you're gonna preaching about the Battle Holy Spirit Divine Healing signs and wonders the old skin will try to stretch and blow the days of Miracle is passed I can't stand it no more I can't even stand through this sermon blow ye out the doors it goes that's right you can't do it to put new Pentecostal wine you have to have new bottles new bottles is new skin it's got an animal oil in it and a new skin will stretch Oh Glory not sit down and dry up stretch who glory to God when that lamb took the book John said all on it all under the Earth heard I John praise God under 420 Elders worship God and the eldest brother George and Technical and pass it out is that a stretch and give God Praises because we shall reign what Satan is finished because the sons of God are coming back oh glory to God them disembodied spirits that was

Panic herself this is what this promise here will shut your mouth praise God we go rock that jump sham them out of the critics who give the Lord a shout the old sense say well Dr Jones Don't Preach it

inside here tonight but you don't know Christ The Mystery of God revealed by the holy ghost or give the Lord some praises the olds can say Dr Jones don't teach it like that see there you are that's the difference what we need to do is a brand new set of Pentecostal Heights so don't come here still you know get some oil and come here there's some oil and say amen and say glory and and hallelujah praise God the devil fight and worship a long time now you know why why because he want worship because worship may cause God oh give the Lord some praises and he didn't get it he lost him for it he

sons of God to come back and take back from the devil everything he took weeks take it back waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God when born Sons Sons anointed Sons predestinated Sons speak and their word is back up [Music] so think about the Supreme Spirit God Elohim Eternal one Fountain of eternal life could only walk through Sons the things he can't do he limited to the operation of his sons and the Earth oh Hallelujah because you are supposed to be the god of the earth oh Hallelujah to conquer the devil here to put sons and say he will put them under your feet every place you

get to that rest that Holy Ghost rest my Lord hallelujah so watch it bring them back to the feet of the fathers the Pentecostal part in the restoration time our resource said the Lord amen no Pentecost is not your denomination no Pentecost is an experience you don't hear that but it's true Pentecostal Pentecost is an experience it is not a denomination it is what you receive it's for methodists Lutheran Catholic just as much Pentecost and sometimes a whole lot more than those who call himself Pentacles it's an experience when you can take it and when that new life begin to work and you read in the Bible I am the Lord that heals all that diseases then the new skin as the light begins to enter in stretch out and say Amen I believe in restoration so you can't leave church talking negative the cats leave church talking a set of nonsense and foolishness and whatnot [Music] you won't burn nobody with your problems people don't hear problems 90 of people don't mind send me

word Sunday is the word resonating the spirit Sunday is the spirit it is word and spirit okay the Lord some praises [Applause] all right let's continue [Music] brother Brown if the Baptist tell me no the methodists the Pentecostal upon the initial evidence speaking in tongues being the Holy Ghost that's the reason we are not Pentecostal we don't believe that speaking with tongues makes you feel with Holy Ghost no more than we believe living in a band would make you a pig no sir or if you have four wheels in our garage could be a lot more can't see that no more than believing enough King's Palace will make you a king you could be a servant you could be anything are you ready We Believe not better overbelief he said We Believe that you receive the Holy Ghost by an experience that don't need no interpretation that really amazing business after all that beat on me according to a word foreign all right let's continue We Believe that you receive the Holy Ghost by an experienced not by mythical intellectual conception of the scriptures but by an experience that you alone know and if you want to know whether it was the Holy Ghost watch how your life patterns after that and it will tell what kind of spirit coming to you or give the Lord some praises so that's a defining statement we reveal the Holy Ghost not when you believe but by experience the other 120 brand new sheepskin bottles not good skin sheepskin it makes the best 120 green bottles were setting up a room all plenty of them stretching and growing pains they had their hearts open they catch anything God would pour upon them today we say I'll go over there I'll tell you what I do believe I don't care how much it brings this out of the Bible I never believe it where your old cowhide and goat skin what's the matter anyhow here was a 120 green bottles set in there and all of a sudden they come new wine from heaven like a Russian Mighty Wind and it failed fill all those green bottles until they were growing pains and they were bunks all over the country said this is that brother and if this isn't that I'm going to keep this till that comes that is one short thing speak this marvelous Grand holy was experienced of the resurrection of Jesus Christ his person and being working in US to us all are wrong what a thing it is what a wonderful thing it is it's got life in it the Church of the Living God is full of life it's the unfomented wine it's still got the bacteria germinate that's filling it and growing it and pushing it and shoving it that is what God is doing oh glory to God notice what he said the Dynamics is the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost is what as a refilling of the Holy Ghost that we have worked in a small measure while the Holy Ghost coming down oh praise so God give you a small measure to work with it the Dynamics coming to connect with that measure that God gives you oh give the Lord please please please be to Jesus Hallelujah is it what we need today is experiences of the new birth no I want to watch the order that Ezekiel brought it in he said I'll give you a new heart I'll give you a new spirit I'll put my spirit in you I want you to watch there are three of it a new heart I will take the old Stony heart away that's the old different heart you have I'll give you a new spirit how many times there's been terrible Mystic people has thought sometimes that the new

new spirit so you can get along with the Holy Spirit mean nasty Wicked evil creepy Behavior praise God guaca line up with that so God said give me a hat I'll give you a new heart give me your spirit

word tonight you know this is not my Revelation you know this is what was brought to us Oh Glory we've got to make us ready to make us prepare for the coming of the Lord a new heart that's a new spirit and I'll put my spirit inside of there oh give the Lord some Praises so let me say it again he said he said the new spirit he said you could even get along with yourself with your whole Spirit or you're going to get along with the Holy Ghost so God give you a new spirit so you can get along with his Spirit a new heart a heart of Flesh so you will receive it a new spirit in the heart then I'll put my spirit in that new heart new spirit my spirit okay the Lord I shout he'll have no man in there and have no power staying there and have no dick no hell inside of There It Is God giving you a new heart it is God giving you the spirit it is God giving you his Spirit Give the Lord Our Praise hallelujah what man is inside of that [Applause] how many times we try to make that thing well as soon as they get the new spirit you quit your stealing you quit your line Hallelujah you got it and you find out the first time anyone crushed apart he said you blew up like a frog-eating box shot let me tell you about it that's the reason you never got God's spirit you said he step on my toe I'll just not put up with that that shows what you got in you that is true I'll put a new spirit in you and then I'll put my spirit in you the heart is in the center of the emotions of the human being your heart is in the middle of you so God puts a new heart in the middle of the old man and puts a new spirit in the middle of the new spirit or the heart and then put his spirit in the middle of the new spirit now watch here we go it's all like the mainspring in a famous watch they got a little clock over here ticking and it's working it's wheels are turning but it's all controlled by a mainspring now the trouble if it's the day we have left off the main spring we try to make ourselves Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Belgrade churches look what I find what I got look what I find stem look at the face out of it it got rubies in it it got jewels in it it's wood it's wood but it don't keep the time right that's what the matter today we try to make Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal we try to get the prettiest Church the best pastor the smartest man and our church just don't keep time with God's Bible you know what's the matter you have left off his spirit as Jesus said have you heard the stone that the bill is rejected has become the chief of the corner the main spring no when the main spring is in the watch and this watch is not a self-winding it is God whining watch the only thing you got to do self-winding what the only thing you do is your emotions with the watch is what winds it and your emotions towards the word of God is what winds you up at the Holy Ghost that's a big one so if that's why you can't come and dry keep it yummy keep saying that over and over no emotions you're dead you expect we'll just jump on you to do what you kill him Holy Ghost Holy Ghost recent time coming on you when the Holy Ghost appeared on them they were so flexible you know [Applause] not that kind of wine not that kind of early morning wine this is new wine this is wine from heaven your glory to God this is that that the prophet Joel sake of oh God have mercy on one of these days we're gonna say it we're gonna speak it it will be expressed this is that what the prophet William Dunham speak of Oh Glory to God the manifestation will be the interpretation no explanation required hallelujah hallelujah on your emotions your emotions so you can sit down dead no emotion you're going to a cricket match or football match president on that good goal yeah four runs four runs four runs to win or four four one and one weekend to go there there are four runs to win and demand by ten days in your side all of a sudden man so if your team wins good win I just like and bad wait wait I'll find more runs I think and it's in the part that the last part people go to four or five days where these foolishness that's not foolishness all right so yeah if we're on top of getting in the spirit you go to a football game you drink my water you're saying no popcorn no water no food nothing at all why they stay home for the most boring man it doesn't have that the people who go to these things they're excited they're under expectations all of a sudden the whole the whole stadium is brethren it's football Bridge oh basketball Bridge you know whatever everybody happy my team my name but when they come to church it's so long like a lump on a log settle like you want to kill the preacher not this one you know not this one I will send fire right in your seat I'll send fire on you Oh Glory either you're either getting the spirit you run right out and they're running you run straight back out Oh Glory to God I ain't come to prisoner Catholics no Baptists and Methodist and death church and I ain't comforted Jehovah Witness just his Kingdom Hall talking I'm not here for that you have to be in the spirit if you wouldn't expect an unexpecting myself from God Oh Glory to God I come here in the spirit the preacher's word this word is spirit and you in the spirit you cut the hair from Heaven oh give the Lord some Praises we are here killing time you know we're here getting ready Oh Glory to God Amen so I like this quote and your emotions towards the word of God is what wind you up with the Holy Ghost if you're taking God's word hallelujah I believe the Pentacles of church has got the back of the Holy Ghost so it takes a baptism Holy Ghost to come into the human heart to make the thing run right the love of God is love and unless each one of these gifts is put right in the center of love it will become selfish and indifferent and pull itself off an isolate itself and cross over and first and stew but when it's anchored right into the middle of love it is fellowship everywhere that's exactly what we need the church is dying for love brother Dying For Love notice what do you say tonight the stone that the bill refuse who are the builders the ministers the pastors plainly fool is he plasters giving trouble that's why God had to do something about these false Shepherds he said I will come down and clean them out I will come on myself oh glory to God and pull my people out and give them certain kind of shepherds Oh Glory the builders praise God damn billing you know but they rejecting the stone which is the spirit because if we get to the spirit or you can fight me is the heart oh give the Lord a shout in the house say what you want but you can't produce Jesus Christ sit down and shut up don't even say it again oh Glory at the end of it the equal sign must see Jesus Christ Jesus Christ I don't care what to say the prophet say they have to see Jesus Christ when the word made flesh to Invisible is mean visible look you've got to see God when the world made flesh if the word may preciously man fighting man human being in action and the devil shadowing behind that oh glory to God he said we need the love of God that controls the whole thing your watch is all right your means and your organ and spring is all right little second is all right but the mainspring now what you mean spring works when love goes to weak you know what happened the Methodist said come on Baptist let's rock together oh glory to God come on Presbyterian you Pentecostal let's all join together and have a real city-wide Revival he said when that time comes when the church finds his broadly love when the church finds his whole decency when the church find his peace in Christ it will call to the other members of the body come and rejoice with us we have found the corner was lost listen if the other brothers have it already that is fine be happy that was prophesied manifested among us we'll give the Lord some Praises when the church finds his brother in love when the church finds his holy decent sick when the church finds this place in Christ it will do something it can't say keep it by itself it can't keep it a private show it will call to the other members of the body come and rejoice with us well we were hot we were lost but now we found it we are so happy the voice of rejoicing isn't a tabernacle of the righteous the Lord are chasing me sore but he hath not given me over under debt open unto me the gates of righteousness and I shall enter in the gate of the Lord until richer Isis are entered the stone that the bills refused had made The Headstone of the corner but this is the Lord's doing it's marvelous in her eyes this is the day that the Lord had made us we will rejoice and be glad in it the voice of rejoicing is in the Tabernacle of the righteous oh let the writers show tonight or give God some Praises tonight the voice of rejoicing oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah there you are the spring is beginning to control the Holy Spirit begin moving then the Baptist won't fuss at you speaking in tongues and neither will you get out of order with it and the Presbyterian and the Methodist and the baptism all together will all operate in one big unit of the church of living God or he's talking about baptist Methodist that in his time we talking about this interpretation that intervention this one and that one all of them and all of them have to get invited come on rejoice about what yeah I want to Rejoice that's your business but inviting you still because we have so many Rejoice about let us be right Joyce and be glad for the mouth of the Lamb is God I can finish here tonight his wife admitters already I'm so glad I'm not the president of the United States [Music] I'm not a prime minister you have nice lights and an escort hunting this this is a big because I've done that a life of surrender to God you can't do Your Own Thing that the company is in politics at the compromise here and there and there but this is just the word you know preach the word and see what theater ticket the whole glory to God A Hallelujah Abraham said the bride will have Dusty load or keep still not not a dream last night and I know I've seen it so and the prophet pick up a pack of cigarettes and pitching a man's silver I think a man filter I pick up some box and and some conflict box and put some kind of thing that's not that you know I ain't playing no mini professional you know just the perfect do that do that here too I don't need to do that God take a Seven Star Messenger bring a message for the entire age and I had to go and try to pray messenger mini Messenger to you like not my calling my calling the echo with the prophecy because the spirit the prophet and the bride say the same thing and what they say is already said in the word Oh Glory to God so what I say in here supposed to be refreshing your mind if you're in the world you will know we say in the word are you saying what I think and feel that tell me what the prophet said oh I find any promises for you isn't that right Oh Glory to God hallelujah when the main spring begin to tick when the stone that's rejected you mean this don't have to be rejected that's right then they found the fault where the man who was the word now the refining fault with the word working through the man so the stone has to be rejected then that rejected stone is what will become The Headstone whoa so you mean the brand will be Joseph yeah Abraham fit Isaac love Jacob Greece to the perfection so you mean a Joseph Perfection bride going to be rejected that's our portion oh glow that's the brightest portion Hallelujah that's serious I could imagine the timing of it yeah it is when that main spring begin to tick when the stone that's rejected when the love of God is brought back amongst the people of God then you're going to see the Church of God all fellowshipping with one another without any friction at all do I hear a shout on this here [Applause] friction going you know when they come back to me in Spring friction getting boots when it come out to love of God coming back among the people you mean have to come yes because of iniquity will abom the love of many gonna watch call but the prophet prophesy there'll be no love left except among the elect only the elect go have love you can't get love outside the elect the elect belongs to love because he let go into the Land of Love praise God praise God could we continue just a little more now you remember when the service in the Bible said our Lord delay is coming that's a prophecy too what's the evidence of that then they begin to devour one another and fight and fast and stew that's ministerial Wars no so when Minister clinging inside and bringing the congression in the fight that's that evil so then the whole congregation now against this man here that they never met they never Fellowship where they don't know he have an issue with that Minister and he bringing sword and climbing sword and sowing seed killer murderer breaking the effect of announcement my and what that life and behavior speaks the Lord delay is coming the law taking long to come so we could fight one another the bride will say the Lord already said what a shout so we have no fight because we had to get a love to get over here if we don't get love all of us say marketing revelation after 50 years adoption meeting that makes no sense somebody at the professor don't worry it will be there all right yeah watch the beginning of our one another and bite and fuss and stew and the Lord came and caught them that way they had their lamps but no oil in them and they were cast into outer Darkness brother why take a substitute when the genuineness here at hand when you get the mainspring working within you so now they love come back in the church I like what but I'm chilling down you know you're talking about it booking within you now when you get the mainspring working within you Christ the love of God in your heart working within you then it will begin to express these kind of tick love joy peace long-suffering ticket wait ticking you're taking love Joy peace long suffering goodness gentleness patience Faith we'll see a tick right reduce oh my Hallelujah almost done all right so this materials that was brought from different lands but I'm talking about here now it fits so perfectly in the space of 40 years from musliman Temple and take him to put a construction up there one stone had to be restored there wasn't a buzz or saw not one stone had to be restored there wasn't a buzz or a saw or Sangha hammer for 40 years you talk about mystery architecture no that showed that when we are doing anything and doing it in the pattern that God has set for us now many of those stones look very odd and there was a place in the temple for every odd peculiar Stone God had a place for them our Ministries which is a beautiful type here or anti-type to it shows in our peculiarity our way of worship yet when the temple the real Temple that we will come to in a few minutes come together there will be a place for every odd acting person we may look a little funny to someone else and act Alfani but remember it's the place there for us and God is cutting out his church and every little Stone has its place to fit exactly to it now remember it was cut away from the place it will be put together at so this was not International this was God cutting in this country cutting in that country and cutting in that country and cutting that country but one day it will be assembled together do you get that it was cut away from the place it would be put together at but when it come together it didn't even need honing it was already honed God made it so it fit perfectly into its place what a type and here we find of the spiritual how that every gift of God every odd Act of born-again Christians in their peculiarity yet it got its place it fits in the body it goes to its right place now many of us we will try and say no that's not of God a good holy consecrated soul of the Cross and we say now we stood in the church the other night we heard such and such and such that can't be of God but if it is in line with the pattern if it's in line with the Scripture it may be odd but it's going to have its place it will fit right in it won't even need honing or polishing it's got to its place for the great architect Christ is dependent or odd one to the other now we notice in the building down here the next chapter in this building there was one stone that was actually too hard to fool with so the bill has rejected it and they pitch it over in the corner that stone was used actually two are to be used there's no such a place now remember it was the builders who should have known different and Jesus spoke of it come to find out they build the building so high until they missed the stone they didn't know where their Stone was they might have searched all their ships they might have run down every Ox cart they might have sent Messengers to Joppa and has another load come in did you lose one on the road there is something wrong we just can't find that stone in this place and when they couldn't find it nowhere else come to find out it was right on the ground it was the Chief Cornerstone but the bill is rejected and Jesus spoke of it and said have you not read of the stone that the bills reflected was the Chief Cornerstone the head of it all where the rest of the building rested upon and I think that the building today of the spiritual house that God worshiping I think there's been a great big failure today among the builders we have come to our denomination we have laid out with sincerity we have sent our boys to school educate them speak well before the congregation learn psychology Bible History we did everything the fine pews made high tower Steeples deliver music but we find out there is something wrong we try to build out a man-made material what education could produce what seminaries could produce but as the ability begin to materialize they realize that all was left the Odd Stone fitted to the Dutch and that is where the spiritual building is today that is why the bride building of Christ is not ready for the big room who said that Prophet said that that is why the bride building of Christ is not ready for the bridegroom it's because the builders has rejected the Chief Cornerstone that was laid on the day of Pentecost which is the baptism and of the Holy Spirit it's odd act funny Oh Glory to God give the give the Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Oh Glory Lori we find out when they come down to the actual building All We Got Is Morton Rock the building did not go on they rejected the way the stone that God had prepared for it they rejected it oh my Hallelujah no we already have the stones the stones got 14 we have got them all the way from efficans to loudicia we are only waiting now for The Headstone that the builders rejected waiting for the coming the captain Stone brother Brian I'm almost done you know you know the great things he may be set here 40 years trying to get enough money to buy in some crutches but he couldn't do it but right in the most unexpected place and the unexpected time and the most unexpected insufficient people he got what he wanted I am so glad that God does it then he giving his own testimony here by the Stephen he's saying a bunch of little so-called Holy Rollers one night I found what I wanted that money could not buy in a bunch of illiterate uneducated poorly dressed people Negroes to begin with out yonder in an old converted Saloon on the floor I found the price a jewel when that old ducky looked in my face and said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe it was something that I wanted I didn't expect to find it among those people but they had what I needed or give the Lord a shout in the house glory to God brother could thank God when that man said have they received the Holy Ghost since you believe oh my Hallelujah a Roman comes over here he scratches his head that's what America is talking about a German comes over here America goes there why you got spirits of them countries you come from and that's what makes us so different to the world you are born you are citizen of another kingdom that is what the Holy Ghost is to make you a citizen of the kingdom of God and if you are citizens of the king of God how does it make you act like God does in his kingdom what does God do in his kingdom it is Holiness it is righteousness it is purity of thought purity of mind it is power and love going to the laws here in the sick performing Miracles doing great things then to the world you look crazy them guys are off their head but you are a citizen of the Kingdom Oh Glory to God hallelujah do you believe it [Applause] one more scripture if you want to write it down John 12 24 let me quote it to you right quick Jesus said if a corner wheat falls into the ground and die it's a bite alone right it cannot bring forth Another Life One closing remark remember then for the brown it is absolutely no to you people it is absolutely essential unnecessary and compelling and compulsory that you receive the Holy Ghost now for if you don't you can't come in the resurrection Oh Glory though there's a prophet exalting us tonight it is absolutely essential and necessary and compelling and compulsory that you receive the Holy Ghost now if you don't you cannot come into the resurrection and from what is the Holy Ghost he said upon this place we wish to approach a subject which is I think outstanding subject today what is the Holy Ghost what is it no you the reason I have taken this subject in lying like this here's why you cannot come and receive the Holy Spirit unless you know what it is that's one you cannot receive it if you know what it is unless you believe it is given to you so it's unfair to the people when a minister tell them you can have it 24 hours a day and be still be lost there's a quote he can say if it is baptized in their flesh in their Spirit or their soul you just use that outer context and the people believe they don't need to have it because the seed is in their soul now if they even want to challenge themselves intellectually and see what we've done in it because he wasn't his soul why did that go to your room white Peter couldn't walk up by faith he preached already he he preached he healed the Second Son why did Jesus tell them go in the upper room because he can't break the word Ezekiel say a new heart a new spirit and then my spirit the reality is Peter didn't have his Spirit just yet until he rented me up a room he said as my father sent me so send are you the father that sent him was in him and God wanted to come into Peter and for God to come into Peter he's breed up on him he said receiving the Holy Ghost it was a breath it was a presence it was a power it was an anointing that breathed upon them that they could come under expectation for a manifestation if you don't know it's for you you cannot expect it okay the Lord some Praises so that in context here he said you cannot know what it is you can't receive it until you believe it's given for you and it's for you and you cannot know whether you got it or not unless you know the results it brings so if you know what it is and who it's to and what action it brings when it comes then you will know what you got when you get it I'm closing praise God are you ready and the cap of this message tonight for my message after the Holy Spirit and there's a prophecy right here this is I believe one of these glorious days when this United Confederation of churches goes together and a new pope is brought out of the United States and put over there according to prophecy then they will form the image like unto the Beast he said when the car closes on before time they can't come out the timing the prophecy had a watch then they will form an image under the Beast and I tell you here we go there's a prophecy here now the True Church of God will be droved together the real true believers this is not the builders nowhere they believe us the realtor Believers out of Methodist Baptist Presbyterian that is them that time now we're saying all the different message groups all right whatever they will be will go together and be cemented by the love of God that will make the body of the Lord Jesus Christ all the Believers and the agnostics and shallow-minded will be cast to one side they will go into the confederation of churches so you go take pressure you know it will take something to get the crap out of this message Hallelujah it will take more than argument and debate and explanation and who have Revelation you go take more than that if we really take the love of God and brother Branham had it he demonstrated it God tested him with forgiveness brotherly kindness to be American love in church and go tell him whatever he will say visit that is dead whatever you say honey say I forgive you he was contaminated woman and he had to come to the experience and say I forgive you I was wrong to condemn you because God forgive me isn't that right I'm closing with these scriptures here first Peter 2 4 says to whom come in us until Livingstone it's not a dead stone it's a living Stone disallow the need of men but choose not quite unprecious he also has Lively Stones Lively Stones not dead stones that's how you have to be in church that's how you have to be as a Believer as an individual you also has Lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ but see if we could play something wherefore this containing the scripture behold I lay inside our Chief Cornerstone elect precious he doesn't believe in him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which you believe he is precious but if the damage be disobedient the stone with the villages allowed the same is made out of the corner a stone or stumbling a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient burned to appointed where unto they were appointed but here a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation peculiar people that he should show forth the Praises of him would call you out of darkness in this Marvelous Light which when time passed were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but nor obtain Mercy their beloved I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the stone so the builders stumbled over the Capstone manifestation disguised as a seventh under Revelation the builders reject seventh on the revelation and they don't understand that it cuts them off from a seven Thunder manifestation Ephesians 2 final scripture you could play something personal praise God Ephesians sitting down therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens but the Saints kind of the whole school of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom the all the building fitly framed together grow it into Holy Temple in the Lord these Seven Virtues was in the early church that was the Cornerstone Church that was the foundation to call it the foundation the apostles and Prophets and that is why we have to come right back to those Seven Virtues to be living in US God takes seven ages to restore it and now that voices virtues have to be in our bride let's all stand on Worship the Lord tonight oh blessed be the name of the Lord Hallelujah no longer a stranger but a fellow
