we have communion i just want you to remember me in prayer tomorrow leave for nigeria and also going to benin so you want to remember before we read the scriptures we had a real tremendous time in prayer meeting i wish all of you could have been there for the prayer meeting i just want to bring a few things back from the pramitan that we had on friday it was a powerful atmosphere i was there and you who are praying you are who is holding up the church holding up this inspiration the one that are praying and sweating it out and something like that and um the script we read was from second kings 3 15 to 17 where elijah was upset and the acts were minstrel at the play and the minister plead and the hand of the lord came upon him and the spirit the music uh was able to bring him in an atmosphere so it's not just plain but the right kind of a plane amen that would bring an atmosphere upon the prophet or let's say this we bring it in the spirit so we appreciate brother stephen this morning with that song service the right kind of singing atmosphere and this is brother branner he said hey heavenly father we're happy tonight for the privilege of standing on this church and praying for the people we are thankful for your word lord and i pray that you would send the revival that we're asking for and now lord i'm asking you something personally myself please heavenly father put in the people's heart an expectation let them never forget that all down to the nights if we shall continue in the meeting may they remember tonight they're expecting it to be come every night say well it never happened last night but you'll be expecting it tomorrow night i'll be tomorrow night i'll be the one i'll be the one that received the holy ghost i'll be the first one at the altar to repent of my sins i'll be the first one that god sanctifies and takes all the world out of me lord i'm a shame of my life i'm ashamed of the way i've been doing i want you to take it away from me give me something so great lord that i don't want to go back to that hog wallow again as the bible said as the soul returned of wallow and the doctors vomit we can see lord that many of our pentecostal people are acting the same way come out of the world and going right back in it again god please let me not think lord i'm trying to scold them but merely trying to put the scripture in front of them that they'll have to walk over it lord and push it aside to go any further and i pray lord every every person and myself all of us will take inventory of our lives and compare it with god's requirement granted father forgive us of our sins forgive us of our mistakes and our errors let the blood of jesus sanctify the little church tonight oh god may every person in here get a touch of the holy spirit right away granted father let it come please do lord start a revival right here in this city granted lord make this church an example an example church and let the people come from different parts and look in here and see the way their conduct is and how they shut back from the things of the world and back into the real genuine pentecostal path the genuine pentecostal experience walking with you blameless granted lord then other churches will see and they will say well if that brother can have his church like that and all them people can be together and their hearts can be won then they got the ammo for everyone and look how much difference there is in them lord that they will hunger and taste you said you are the salt of the earth god bring back the server in the sword quickly oh glory to god hallelujah praise god that the people might walk in the door and see the power of the resurrection of the lord jesus moving among the people showing himself alive oh glory to god hallelujah [Applause] i'm almost finished here you see i'm traveling i think there's a great thing that i've seen missing in the church today one of the greatest hindrances in the church today that keep the revival back is the lack of godly love that christ expressed when you will see on earth it is easy for you to love someone that loves us but with jesus didn't have that kind of a love he had god's love and god love his enemies forgot to love the world when the world was unlovable god still loved the world oprah it's a different even in the expression of the words of filio and a couple of divine love and if there's anything i believe listen listen listen to this this looks like simple there's no big hard mystery that you have to scratch your head if there's anything that i believe that would start a revival of los angeles would it be a time that we could break down all over different barriers and come together as christians in love that's the pentecostal the baptist the presbyterian and all together we would express to the world that we have loved one for another and jesus prayed that prayer that we might have loved one for another as he had loved us oh glory to god amen hallelujah glory to god do you believe that today let me close with this here no one can love like him you can't manufacture that kind of a love it's the gift of god that comes by the holy spirit the only way you will ever be able to have that love do i speak with tongues of men and angels and have that kind of love oh my amen praise god oh i love him this morning he said what we need tonight is the water of god the vision absolutely interpreted god's will to a dying persian people what did elijah said he said don't look for wind don't look for rain just dig ditches just in other words don't let your senses fool you don't bother don't mess with them senses because if you're looking for water you expect rain or you expect wind he said look for that just dig ditches and you go get water just take just dig just dig the more you dig the more water you got just take don't lose your eyes don't lose your feelings don't lose your emotions let's dig just make way for water oh glory to god amen hallelujah praise god so this one could be stan let's play nothing let me watch again just flavor welcome holy spirit live inside [Music] we are in your presence we are [Music] welcome welcome welcome holy spirit oh welcome home [Music] god bless you and welcome this morning we want to turn to three portion scriptures ezekiel chapter 47 i want to read from one to nine psalms 46 maybe you read that whole psalms 11 verses and saint john chapter 7 want to read 37 to 39 ezekiel 47 from verse 1. afterward he brought me again to the door of the house and behold waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward for the front forefront of the house stood towards the east and the waters came down from under the right side of the house at the south side of the altar then brought he out me out of the way of the gate northward and led me about the way without onto the utter gate by the way let's look at eastwood and behold they ran out waters on the right side when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward he measured a thousand cubits and he brought me through the waters and the waters were to the ankles again he measured a thousand he brought me through the waters the waters were to the knees again he measured a thousand and he brought me to the waters or to the loins and afterwards he measured a thousand it was a river that i could not pass over for the waters with risen waters to swimming a river that could not be passed over and he said unto me son of man has not seen this then he brought me and caused me to return to the brink of the river now when i had returned the hole at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and the other then city unto me these waters issued out towards the east country and go down to into the desert and go into the sea which being brought forth into the sea the waters shall be healed and it shall come to pass that everything that liveth which move it whereas wherever the river shall come shall live and there shall be a great molecule of fish because these waters come thither for they shall be healed and everything shall that live with it whether the river comet let's go for psalms 46. 1 god is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore will we not pre-fear though the earth be removed do the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof roar and be troubled do the mountain shake with the swelling thereof silla there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of god the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high god is in the midst of her she shall not be moved god shall help her and that right early the hidden rage the kingdoms will move he uttered his voice the earth melted the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge come behold the works of the lord what desolations he had made on the earth he make it was to cease unto the end of the earth he break at the bow he cut the despair and sunder he burned the charge in the fire be still and know that i am god i will be exalted among the heathen i will be exalted in the earth the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge our last scripture is from john chapter 7 reading from verse 37 familiar scripture and the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man taste let him come unto me and drink he that believe on me as the scripture had said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this speak he of the spirit which they that believe in him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified let us pray one more time father we have read your word and god i i i need you to come and interpret these words to the people this morning take me out of the way lord may the pillar fire rest on my shoulder and may you speak lip to air speak out to your people by direct inspiration and revelation in jesus name i ask it amen and amen before you have your seizures turn around and shake somebody's hand this morning in my oh it's uh our title this morning there is a river thousand thousand one i have a question for you are you tasting are you tasty and can you swim and where are you planted hallelujah it's amazing what you know why there was such a contrast in the scripture when he says here in psalms 46 therefore shall be not fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried to the midst of the sea though the waters roar and be troubled through the mountains shake with the swelling thereof it means in the shaking times you have to know that there is a river that makes glad the city of god hallelujah praise god that's not a normal river you know that river began healing that river have living waters in it oh glory to god that river is living waters you know anything that river touch will come alive what a river touch gonna be here may that river begin to flow this morning may that river touch your life this morning may you don't walk over here the same way you came this morning oh glory to god amen let's read but listen listen to me and i really appreciate it when you see a servant of god get so sincere till he's on his face with his hands in the air praying to god and blushing because of the iniquity of the people then you're going to see a revival start a man cannot lay in the presence of god a church cannot stay in the presence of god under repentance unless the holy spirit come down and give unction and power to start a move a god among those people he said it's got to be so the holy spirit have to start a move of god not a man move not a move of man but a move of god how many want to see that how many want to see a move of god oh glory to god holy he said show me a man show me another calvin knox finnish sankey any one of those that feels the burden of the people that will lay on their face and cry and pray before god send us another judgment of the baptist church who prayed all night for the iniquity of the people until his eyes will be swelled shut next morning from weeping till his wife would lead him to the table to feed him his breakfast out of a spoon show me a john wesley again a fireman snatch from the fire i will show you a revival oh glory to god hallelujah noah river is not a dead thing a river is not a lake a river is not a dead thing oh god a river is a life a river have a beginning and a river have an outlet to go somewhere a river have a source you have to start somewhere and what we read in ezekiel it started from under the altar it's starting from right on the side of there they have to start somewhere this river of god have to start from somewhere and it go in somewhere a river goes towards the ocean oh glory to god that the lord i shout hallelujah praise god do you believe that praise god this is the prophet he said no i presume being that this is a pentecostal sponsor that most in here pentecost are people and there's where i throw my luck because i never did join any pentecostal church no certain nomination they can have whatever they want to but you draw the lines god don't take like god don't like lines built in his church reminds me of a fellow one time had some ducks he cut their wings so they couldn't fly out of the pen he had some ducks on one side and ducks on the other and water began to come in and the first thing you know the water got higher and higher and the ducks got together and that's what we need today let the waters go to rising and then the ducks get together you will see that we in the same water the nomination barriers can be floated out just let the waters get deep enough oh glory to god and i am prophesying this morning [Music] oh glory to god the water is going to come so much that them just gonna have fellowship hallelujah praise god oh hallelujah glory amen attention you may be seated what are you saying preacher we got to go deeper first there was water for only reaching ankles hallelujah some people just have their toes in it yes depending on wetting the foot and then when they check again and they take the next measurement it was up to the knees all glory to god wearing in the water just up to your knees when they take the next measurement it was up to the west oh hallelujah but there was one more step there was one more praise god when that river began to flow he said it was so much water he had the water to swim in you couldn't wait to that one you couldn't walk to that one you couldn't get your toe in that one you have to swim in that one can you swim this morning because we're going deeper oh give the lord a shout the water's gonna get high oh hallelujah glory to god hallelujah glory to god is not normal waters this water's up here in it you have deliverance in it it have great you in it oh you have victory in it this is special waters accord is in the midst of her oh god going to help her we are talking about the bride we are talking about you oh glory to god hallelujah oh praise god praise god hallelujah hallelujah so how deep do you want to go anchor d needy who is deep or what is this women there's still any water you know but you see your knees good as ever because only water will hit in your ankle well let's continue but imam says when god gets a hold of a man the first thing he does in a church is to bring it from worldliness to holiness he brings us from death to life it's born again its ideas are new what we need is a revival like that oh we had a dip of the spirit we had spiritual blessings and spiritual uprisings but we don't need that no more we need a revival of the spirit of the living god in the hearts of the people we don't need so much dips of the spirit or spiritual awakening we need a revival a revival of what we got why are you preaching that because our people in church with anger with temper with odds with hate with malice with evil thinking and attitudes bad spirited people but they're coming to church [Applause] now if your door say hey man i'm still talking about you you know [Applause] [Music] let me say that again if you don't say a minute still you are talking to you know i ain't come to talk to the carpet i can't come and talk to the ceiling this is for you [Music] and who the cab fit wears it or give the lord a shout in the house my god say him and somebody say him and somebody we're going to get a clean out [Applause] all right let's continue we don't need much the tips of the spirit or spiritual awakening we need a revival revive what we've got not a spiritual awakening sometimes that brings mixed multitudes but we need a revival that will sift down shake out and cut out all the things hallelujah stand in puerto rico a few weeks ago when i see the great sea and the great storm the waves were higher than this tabernacle and i said you know what it hasn't got one more drop of water in it when it's beautifully calm but what does the training on the jump in what does it mean it throws all the trash out upon the bank that is what the church needs is a revival not a revival of specials not a revival of singing not a revivalist inspiration not that but a revival avoids the trust of the church special is good so inspiration good but this is something other than that [Applause] [Music] oh glory to god hallelujah we don't know ankle water revival that's what luther had oh glory to god we don't want no knee high revival that's what wesley had we don't want to waste revival that's what the pentecostal had we want water to swim in that's what the prophet had oh give the lord a shout that's what the church means is a revival to shake from it all the willingness and the things of the world and bring back purity and wholeness of god in the hearts of its believers humility as a powerful word humility when i say that i would call humanity everybody's somebody everybody in some big somebody who humbling itself humble what wait what name that see but when man suits himself they don't get a revival once in a while on their spirit okay when they don't get a revival once in a while on their spirit they become so carnal and so indifferent till they get self-styled starchy and self-righteous let me say it again so you get good no i ain't hitting you good you know so you understand what we see in here good that when that revival spirit is no longer there people go to church but they're natural they go to church but they can't hurt they go to church but they're starchy they're going to check but they're self-righteous they're judging everybody so i'm staying home right now watching us and they're judging us they're not even in the world don't forget they're sending yourself together but they're judging us i can't judge them because not sitting in the house but they're looking in my bedroom here oh get the lord i shall hear what i said yes i'm talking to you i'm talking directly to you yeah i'm looking at them straight straight in the internet world oh give the lord our praise hallelujah praise god you think i'll bother with anybody my headquarters my sources from god i don't care what people think i want people feel i am ordained to do this glory to god hallelujah there is going to be revival in trinidad no devil could stop it no ministers association could stop it no man could stop it we are going to have a seven tunnel revival [Music] glory to god amen hallelujah praise god you may be seated i will be in nobody church business don't mess with minds hallelujah praise god that will be nobody business i see my god's business i have the answer for this group he said what we see should make a church that will make a revival that people will fly in and see the thunders is being manifested not being explained we have 50 plus years of that explanations revelations but i'm telling you there's going to be a bunch of people that are going to want a revival they're going to call for revival they're going to want a manifestation they're going to have a manifestation [Applause] you'll never be seated say freedom preaching how you expected or you don't know what to expect if i started preaching expect a great great man in the hour i'm looking for him and about he is here are you looking at me here but well this man you all have been here for a long time but the money away doing one thing 30 years killing time then you had to realize this is no matter you always standing behind here the money always the holy spirit jesus christ when you start to look for him when you come to service you're looking for him you're looking for not preaching looking for him you're looking for that brother you're looking for him you want to meet the man of the hour you want to be that fire you want to get in contact with that living water get me excited right now no mechanic here to preach you want to be seated when jesus when jesus needs foster samaria to sit down and not well with that woman she's she's waiting for the woman to come the woman don't know she have an appointment to meet with he himself she doesn't know that she knows she messed up she know she tangled up and tied up and so on but she's going to be free this morning she doesn't know that yet praise god she doesn't know that yet because she'll meet that man yet that man is waiting on her she don't know what she has needed she comes to draw water oh glory to god do you hear what i'm saying she come to draw water from a well jesus everyone give me some water to drink i'm not the draw i'm going to pull out she said we're not supposed to be talking we're not supposed to be fellowshipping you in one church are another truth you one group out of a group hallelujah i don't see it like you i don't believe it like you jesus said if you do talking to you you will ask me for water live in water [Applause] if you only know who talking to you and the water that i will give you you will never test again oh glory to god

hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah where is he still be watchful and strengthen the things which will mean that the right to die if i have not found our work spoken before god i wish it could have been said that the sedition age was the restoration instead of reformation he said um i kind of see that the world does not call it restoration but certainly calls it reformation had it been restoration the age would have been another pentecostal age but it was not the best that could be said striking that which remains that is ready to die there was something missing there certainly was this age was justification but it had missed sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost that is what god's original plan was that was what that is what they had at pentecost they were justified they were sanctified they were filled with the holy ghost why listen to me the reason for being justified and signified is to the end that you might be baptized with the holy ghost that is the reason there is a church it is a temple of god filled with god even the holy ghost the same spirit that was in jesus while he was on earth causing him to do the mighty works which he did back in the church at pentecost so that they did the work that he did this age did not have those works they had the written word but not the revealed word this was the reformation was going to be start of it he was going to according to promise take the tish back from the depths of satan in the dark ages to the depths of god that had a pentecost and which was a few years before now be careful get this it says in this second verse and i read for i have not found thy works perfectly before god do you know what the meaning of not perfect really is it is unfulfilled so he put his magnify grass not perfect it means unfulfilled this age was an unfulfilled age it was just starting to get him back and that is why i said the bible called reformation not restoration is that started out in the doctrine of justification which meant salvation was all of god now luther preached the sovereignty of god and election he knew it was all grace he separated the church from the rule by ecclesiastical hierarchy he taught idols he cast all confessions to the priest he denounced the people it was wonderful god had 1500 years before luther you are going to start things your age will see it all on fulfilled i'm leaving that till later he knows the end from the beginning luther was his messenger it didn't look like it as we examined the flaws so luther had flow and if you want to see flaws you can see plenty with looter and you can see with me and everybody else too is what you want to look at are you let's continue now but there was a man called jonah he had flaws in his life too he was a prophet though you might not want to say so on the basis of how we acted but god knows them that are his and he has his way just as david jonah he had his way with luther in that day and he will have his way until the confirmation oh could we give the lord as praise offering now let's look at the next step logically we think it's the actual forming and harvesting of the grain the completed cycle but not so there's another stage and that stage is when the husk or chaff is formed to cover the seed and that is exactly what happened in the spiritual cycle at the turn of the 20th century in the start of the lodestone age there was a widespread belief that the holy ghost was falling exactly as it did at pentecost people were talking in tongues and claiming to be baptized with the holy ghost with evidence of speaking in tongues but i've walked through the grain fields many times and here in summer plucked the heads of wheat rub them in my hand to get some green and to my surprise there wasn't any corner wheat in that shaft though indeed it looked as if we were there this is a perfect picture of this so-called pentecostal move now here we go just want to get to and this is a proven fact it's found in these people organized on a doctrine and bond themselves see that is where people go off when they pin down their doctrine and say you have to believe it like this and then nail it down like a thesis and hang it up and unless you don't believe it like that you're not brothers pharisees are the things are diseased here it is and jesus can't bust all the things so then he was a he was wrecking the churches as far as they can say and people had to bust it out from them and he had a whole following i went in come also he bust them too except people flesh and drink my blood you have no life see them getting licks all around because god want the word living so when they thought jesus was the next kind of one of them to start a new organization and take over to rome and they're gonna anoint him champion rebel and rebel risen and king and what time jesus said my kingdom is not of this world get it out of your head i ain't coming to fight rome for you my kingdom belongs to different realm all together in my kingdom you have to love your enemies you have to do good to them that mean to you or give the lord some [Applause] praises so listen from a natural concept he was gonna appear to be like crazy a crazy belief because everybody had a little stone behind they're waiting to build some roman soldier and she has nothing to be stolen anything peter was a swordsman you know when they come for jesus he just draws sword cut off my nails he fighting for jesus jesus will pick up ears and put it back on the heal at one time he said live by you so they died but he saw this ain't no sorting hallelujah that man was living something completely different hallelujah and we are caught in something completely different [Applause] god is about to shock the world with another bride completely different not not just walking by faith but living by faith [Music] jesus made it so simple preaching the five thousand people my god he wanted to dismiss them now he dropped seven and a month on them he said what we have here what we have here what we have here nothing nothing all them pelvis content a boy with five lows two fishes he said bring it somebody said what are these among so many what's your go going magical that are words what's your god go embarrass that statement what is this among so many this little thing yeah the other thing bring it bring it down come jesus it is all bring it and come bring it and come just take it bless it and say share it and all you do break it and share break it down share break it down share days i've realized that miracle going on just breaking and sharing breaking and sharing breaking and sharing brother you're studying deepness studying or not studying just breaking and sharing breaking and sharing everybody

messages come and say he's alright don't bother him he dead people love to carry about music but jesus doesn't inspire them you know what happened you know who did you know this happened to this

tell them that you know he knew he stayed back a little while on papers and look at our attitude when god stayed back for us we vexed we fought him are you lord moving so save him all these years you're long in the business but you did a long time and a little man come to jesus said my savings secret sick i'm not worried to come in my roof just to speak the word and someone shall be healed jesus said go your way we might run back run back run back he said what what i mean with you not if not let your doctor check him what time or the same time jesus spoke jesus said never never never see that kind of faith that was a gentile man that was one of you there was somebody like you so don't tell me you don't have that you have it that man reflected if you have it you have it for your children you have it for your healing you have it let me finish up here the chaff maggie 24 deceive any luck if possible now hear how brother branham tied in this scripture with ezekiel 47. it's going to blow my mind this chap stage was the danger period that jesus spoke of in matthew 24 24. deceivingly very elected was possible oh man felt that this husk the so-called pentecostal it was a true seed but it proved to be a carrier to carry the life over to the age in which the true restoration comes and the wheat bride is manifested in the power spoken by ezekiel 47 2-5 and now he connects that with the script we read and when the man had that line in his hand watch then he brought me out of the way of the gate northward led me from the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looked eastward and behold iran waters on the right side and when the man had the line in his hand when fought eastward he measured a thousand cubit he brought me through the waters the waters were ankles again he measured a thousand and the water went to the knees and he measured a thousand brought me to the waters to the loins i asked already measured a thousand it was a river that i could not pass over for the waters were risen waters to swim in a river that i couldn't pass over oh glory to god he said that's the way it was done by god's perfect will and programming the lutheran had the holy ghost potentially under justification the method has had it potentially on the signification and today it has brought back a restoration the holy ghost is here so brother panama restore back the person of the holy ghost water to swim in oh give the lord some praises people hallelujah almost finish here watch to watch contains not only the idea of being awake but to be alert the idiot expressed is two words watchful and strengthened to be the otherwise instrument in insinuous danger and loss to strengthen means more than just to give strength it means to fix and establish for permanency that's deep these two commands refer to what is left of the truth which in itself is ready to die this expression of the spirit comes before me as an illustration a group of slaves in total bandage physically and morally has risen up and escaped their captors indeed this is what saddest mean the escape points they are pursued and their great and glorious gains are all but lost they have not been retaken but about all that they can be said that they have escaped not clean escape as some according to the word they have but they have lost much of their liberties now the lord say you are potentially back in captivity see that you don't go back to keep from going back become alert remain ever watchful concerning the things of your captivity or you would lose all strengthen yourself now in what you have left in such a manner as to permanently establish what you have and thus ensure against future laws in other words you're cutting your losses and you remain unsafe [Applause] this will not be an opportunity to fulfill that you have not fulfilled but where did they go on no sir they did not heed this voice of the spirit they went to another age oh my hallelujah jeremiah 2 11 and 13. god speaking in jeremiah 2 here saying have a nation change their gods which are yet no gods but my people have changed their glory for that but not profit be astonished oh you heavens of this and

them christians that's why they love the churches outside they can do whatever you want and you're a believer you can do anything you want and you're a christian you can do anything but when you come to the lord you want to do what his will is [Applause] because amen if you love me you keep my commandments if you love me you keep my words not come to church keep my words but a genuine fountain of the power of god it can't stay there almost done he said i am the function of living waters they left me to dig themselves some system a fountain of living water is not dead it's not stagnated it is living it is constantly changing bringing up something new all the time moving on coming from its resources oh glory you don't need no filter you don't need no strainer when you're getting water off the roof you have to put a filter to the barrel because you're getting rain from off the roof you need filter but this fountain he said he'd believe it on me as the scripture had said out of his belly
