again for being here and um if you have your bibles i like to look at ephesians chapter one and revelation chapter two ephesians one we want to read from one to fourteen revelation two you want to read from one to seven to ninth i want to take a peek at ephesians god's pattern and overview tonight we want to take a look at that ephesians in the book of ephesians quotes pattern and overview and we want to read from ephesians chapter one reading from verse one paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you and peace from god our father from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ what blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ notice this is a given adoration and praise to god and testifying of what god has done in christ jesus according that he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be one holy and two without blame before him in love having predestinated us so all this is god's operation now this has nothing to do with us and you are sinner and saved by grace this is god's plan and program having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us accepted and beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace all of this is still in christ jesus wearing he had a bounty towards us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purpose in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which in heaven which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who look at all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom you also trusted after you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after you believe you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest or the down payment of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory i want to look at revelation chapter two reading from verse one if you have your bibles you should have your bibles this is the bible study revelation 2 verse 1 unto the angel of the church of ephesus right these theater these things said he that who led the seven stars in his right hand who walk it in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks i know that works and i labor like patience hold up stance not be them which are evil i was try them would say the apostles and are not as found them liars as born as patients of my namesake as labored has not fainted nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love remember therefore from wednesday what foreign and repent and do the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and remove that candlestick except out of his place except or repent what this dog has the dog hate is the deeds of the nicoleta which i also hate now when this age was a deed later only became a doctrine those seven heathers have an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches to him that overcome it will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise that god made god bless his word saints brethren church i feel so strange tonight i feel like we are underground you know like if not like dark ages but we are like right now underground christians we not in church we are communicating and it's not the normal scenario and yet we have to press on to save this living god we're not saving a different god a god of our own imagination and thoughts but we are serving the living god so tonight i felt you know to bring this to you about this book of ephesians and we know it parallels the book of joshua uh this is the book of redemption as joshua was a book of redemption joshua is two parts coming out of and going into and this book reflects that this book of ephesians but i also wanted to tie it in with the ephesians church age and to show the quality of spirit and attitude that god people uh had in that time nobody called ephesians the standard is like a template of god's pattern that's what ephesians really represent and it is original it is the harvest of the resurrection on display in a body of believers at that time the church this was god's ideal church which was the alpha church and between the alpha and the omega church you could call it processes whether it belong in the ground whether you looter wesley the jewish history was like processes but it has to have an omega church which is an exact replica of the original alpha church so this is where we have to get back to this this this this this alpha church which was the ephesian church so this book of ephesians is six chapters in that book and the first what we read here dealing with god dealing with christ dealing with the fact that he has a plan and program to bring us gentiles in our sons remember he came to the jews he came unto his own his own receiving not and in rejecting him it gave us an opening that we could be welcomed into this program of god as adopted sons so even though we wasn't in the covenant of the jewish people through christ through christ and because it it it made that rich for us to have direct control and that is why it's so beautiful it says here having uh no i mean just back up a little bit having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will so then this is the dealing with this first chapter here deals with as i said tonight i'm giving over you this chapter deals with all about what the lord has done in christ jesus in whom we have redemption to his blood in whom we have forgiveness of sins whereas he knows known as the mystery of his will that in the fullness of time he might guide it together in one all things in christ so christ becomes the center post of this chapter and this ephesians church was i said the ideal church this particular gospel in ephesians had nothing to do with with all this sin any corinthians or babies in hebrews or the legalistic in galatians it had all to do with perfection this is what is just a solid church small group but paul was the pastor apostle of this church and he was really a place in things in a in a powerful way in whom also is verse 13 you trusted after you heard the word of truth the gospel of salvation in whom also after you believe you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is god's ideal order you believe you receive you're here here comes the seal of the spirit as a confirmation of what you believe or receive or a manifestation of what you have received because you receive the seed in wood form and then when god changed that into spirit by his power that becomes the kingdom of god and then and then paul in verse 16 he talked about i cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you my prayers and this was his burden and i want you to see paul as a contact person a person that is alive real present sharing it with ephesians church that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory be given to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him this was his burden to the people that the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance and the saints what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in christ and he talked about fire above principalities and dominions and so on and so on like that so that is chapter one chapter two he began to describe where he came from and many times in christians they forget where they come from it's sad it's unfortunate uh they tend to be evangelically hypocritical but judgmental and almost arrogant um in in understanding where god took them from and god said you are the quicker who were dead in trespasses and sin whereas in time past you walk according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the ear the spirit that now look at the nature of obedience and then you're talking about our conversation the loss of our flesh desires the mind so he's talking about the condition of rat and the condition of hell and the condition of the flesh and the ways of sin we were in but it was for god who's rich and mercy and we can praise god for that tonight god who is rich and mercy would you give god some praise to that tonight god with rich and mercy for his great love where he loved us even when we were dead in sins had quickness together by christ by grace i received and as you raise us up together make us to sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace towards us and he went on and say we are his workmanship created in christ jesus so all of this is positive stuff things that we could look at remember that he being in time past gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision so he's bridging the gap now that at that time we were without christ okay being aliens from the covenant of israel meaning that we were not covenanted like they were and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope without god in the world but now in christ jesus ye which is us who will sometime are far off are made nigh by the blood of christ so he's showing you how the jews and gentiles kiss together through the cross of calvary bring us our sons in the sight of god isn't that wonderful tonight it's not a beautiful thing tonight that god threw the blood of the cross has made us sons and he has become our peace and he has broken down ever here we go the middle wall of partition between us i've been abolishing his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments and that law of commandments is what separated the jews as a people unto god from the rest of the world because god came unto moses give them commandments give them order we are gentiles we were just like barbarians whatever you want to say uh we were away from god didn't know god but through this cross he broke down this war with his commandments and then make that bridge so that he said now that contain the ordinances to make himself twain one new man making peace that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain enmity nearby and you talk about and through him we have access by one spirit unto the father and yet his glorious part here now verse was 19. no i know i'm spinning through here kind of quickly we just went overview tonight because we could drive slow on these things and everyone here is like a service assumer you could get us someone from every and here and therefore we are no more strangers and foreigners and fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god we can stop right there and preach our own life tonight you can't be deported this is no longer strange is your land if they can't kick you out you can't say their passport with your visa and so on like that so this this year is a sermon we could go down a road tonight here and take over that tangent and take our own this year alone you see on this um immigration regulations and so on like that the angels can't handle that we are sons you have to open the gates we have access to christ ephesians one tells us that and we are grateful to god for that and said no and i built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone of whom that he described in a particular way the building fitly framed together grew it into the holy temple in whom we he also are building together for a habitation of god to the spirit so paul give this beautiful reference of our building this body making up a building to become the habitation of god to the spirit and of course we know also alternatively we become a temple of god a temple of his spirit okay chapter three paul give his testimony about the dispensation hold by revelation he made known to me a mystery and he's given his testimony which of ages was not made known unto the sons of men but is not revealed by his holy apostles and prophets by spirit that the gentiles glory should be followers of the same body hallelujah and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel so paul was excited to share that this revelation that we as gentiles are followers of the same body and then identifying his ministry where i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working on his power who is the least of saints and i'm so happy he said that i should preach among the gentiles the unsociable riches of christ so this is very paul is excited the jews had their story daddy abraham that isaac that moses that jesus and so on now paul is on ministry and seen a door slam open to this gentiles the gentiles his new land the gentiles is exciting and he is considered a grateful and awful thing to call to minister and preach to these gentiles that to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery from which the beginning of the world have been hitting god and then he went on and on and so on therefore my desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory for this course i bowl my knees and i think he's praying again unto the father of the lord jesus christ of whom the whole family of eminent is named that he may grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that you be rooted and grounded in love that you may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and here we go now and to know the love of christ which past set knowledge so this is a different level altogether and that reminds you of when brother branham saw his wife across there she said bill you preach about it but you don't know what it is this is the land of love you see it's an experience it's something at a higher level altogether so he's talking about the love of christ which passage knowledge that you may be full filled with all the fullness of god now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask for think according to power that wicked in us unto him be glory i want you to see how poor life was emanating glory to god not ever in my fight oh god oh god pressure no no no no he was saying unto him that is i believe and i said correct me that this letter was written while he was in prison this this was no let paul you know what i mean let's fellowship brethren i mean he was writing under pressure writing because was a higher order writing because you know maybe maybe that prison was given that sense of isolation that he could hear direct from god to inspire him to write these things unto him be glory in the church by jesus christ showed all ages without any amen paul no and that's what country no and then now so so so so so all of this is about christ about us gentiles getting connected then he broke into something now about the church so now he hit and now the church idea for chapter four a prisoner of the lord beseech you that you were worthy of the vocation where you're called no we cannot tell people what if they don't know what to just the calling is all about you kind of tell somebody hey walk right what you know you know who you are you don't know who you are so the revelation from ephesians chapter one chapter two chapter three we are being quickened we want in sin turn of disobedience oh god god has been good to us god rich and mercy now your predestined adoption no no walk worthy of the vacation where you're called you'll walk foolish don't walk like no sense walk smart walk with wisdom walk with understanding i pray that you'll be filled with knowledge with wisdom with revelation that's my burden for you because i want you to see where god took you from stop complaining stop fussing and appreciate and love god let's continue you say with all loneliness of meekness that's a big word boy with all loneliness when i say that with loneliness people always up to tea and proud with all loneliness and meekness with long suffering that's the whole mixtape and they're not just one thing you know like you're making a cake loneliness meekness long suffering for being one hour with love there's plenty things there when you're mixing that day it has to come out right you're shaking some loneliness shaking up some meekness sprinkle some long suffering add some forbearing another endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace but every time somebody comes they want to have a you're going so they're going so the pastor says so well i ain't moving so i feel like so i got a dream last night so not that not that this is church now this is church now mark them who trying to make division mark them let's give them a tick on them see that brother he's trouble i want his trouble yeah mark them and expose them identify them because this tries them supposed to be the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace so you don't say one piece at all cause in the go to war the unity of the spirit you know what way in the bond of peace here it is how old glory is the bomb there is one body one spirit even a call by one hope of your calling so so paul is lining everything in a straight line for them there's one body there is one spirit there is one hope of your calling there is one lord there is one fate there is one baptism there is one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all so do study two gods two ways to no no no no there's only one i want to line up with that one for every one of us is giving grace according to the measure of the gift of christ and righteous the problem all around people don't understand everyone is given grace according to the measure so my measure might be small like this little 10 year old piercing your measure might be the whole pen but thank god for your measure but don't despise somebody who have a small measure medium measure big measure it have all kind you know like as we been saying planting i just discovered so much things it's amazing that's so much different kind of lettuce so much different kind of kale somewhat different kind of pumpkin so much different kind of mangoes you name it gold is called a variety it's everywhere nature so if you figure you have the ripest mango the best mango the only mango forget it you'll feel shame when you see the liner mangoes come so when you talk about gifts god isn't quite a variety it's an evangelist but everybody not the same evangelist everybody the same kind of pastor everybody same kind of kind of prophet either prophets who lie to the side prophet who do this prophet all these guys are different and you are fearfully and wonderfully made you are different don't compare yourself to nobody else when god make your mole he cancel everything else you see not another one like that coming you are you who you are and be grateful and thankful so that gift where wherever he said he has sent it on high you let captivity get captive and i'll skip that and he gives some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some personal teachers why is it that he didn't have one gift alone let's say a pastor everybody passed everybody's ship why you need to have apostle one cent a prophet direct word of the lord evangelists amen to green souls and so on pastors to anchor the people stay with the group and teachers that would break the mysteries on revelation why it is that you have all these gifts he knows why and these gifts are for the perfection of the saints work of the ministry yet he founded the body why these gifts are needed till we all come into confusion an argument until it fights the law until we clang swords that's not what the bible say you know until we come to the unity of the faith knowledge of the son of god the perfect man unto the measure of the structure of christ that we henceforth be no more children touched and throw carried about by every wind of doctrine by the slave of men con craftiness were by the lying way to receive speaking truth and love for who the whole body fit so he's talking about the church here now this body church so we come from predestinated adoption we come from where we come from you come from paul saying i'm a minister to you gentiles and here is no he's talking about the church talking about perfection walking in love and this i see therefore that you walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of your mind so now paul is making a bridge of this gospel of this world that must be effective in our lives i want you to get that tonight it's not just okay you have religions where you do things how your beads close your hand you do things to deity and whatnot this is not that type of thing this is word coming to you that it could be effected in your life you won't see the effect of what you're hearing in your life on a daily basis let me see it again you want to see the effect of this gospel on your life on a daily basis if all you are content with is to hear the gospel on a sunday and a wednesday as a church basis you are really uh a very nice fine church member you follow because the gospel is not that come like you go to the temple then you let this put this way and you make your offer in them and and you worship your god then and you come home knowing that your entire ribbon or you do whatever you do and you come back and you go home and you can fight with your neighbor you can cuss your husband you could embarrass your wife you could run out and slam the door and do anything but you know you give the offer you know you worship your god you see that is what the heathens do that is what worshipping other gods this is living god no this is not that because even though the tablets came out in stone god said i'll write it in your heart so therefore because the people were ignorant of god's law and of god's word he first had to bring something that they could connect with though shanks might steal those shall not commit adultery remember this day he had to bond the mind and bond the head with the law to give them a sense of order because that's what the commandment do you know put you in a rigidity you know what you know i go there you know because this is the law this is the law this is the law this is a law so that law put them in bondage but that money was to keep them from themselves keep them from sin and keep them but they couldn't do it because the nature is sinful because adam fought adam phil and because how we were born in sin not born and sin applied born in it so because we born in it is part of us and therefore that's why christ has died to deliver us from what was in us so when you put christianity as a cloak over you that don't mean sin that means you put a cloak so jesus come and correct all others and say you must be born again meaning inside have to transform and when inside is transformed then you have a new man you talk about a new man we found out about this later on paul talked about so then he said uh our nice uh this i say therefore that you walk not as a gender as walk you know your agenda awoken in the vanity of their mind having their understanding darkened alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the gladness in their heart giving themselves on grieving greediness and penis so you have not learned christ so if so that you have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in jesus that you here we go got you what put off concerning the former conversation the old man so now he's introducing something that connects directly to us to our life that this gospel brings on a new man and you have to put off say the old man say no lord the old man you have the point of what the say it again the old man watch that you put off the former conversation of life the old man which is corrupt according to deceitfulness and we will be you and this is important be be you renewed in the spirit of your mind now ramsay you see a child child born three four year old put some boogie woogie music the child will dance because it is built in it is built in because of the nature that is there think about it now our whole life has been channeled by the world by what we see by our senses and everything else so therefore come into the gospel now our mind have to get a refreshing and that's what renewing is and that reminds you of what what isaac always emphasized about meditating in the word once in a while day and night they are night what that is doing refreshing your mind of what god has promised i will keep you i will preserve you i'll overshadow you you'll be my rock you you i'm on your rock i'm your shield what you're doing you shout your mind uh you are my protector even this corona virus you have to be anointed something you can't be looking for quantifiers you're not looking for him he is wherever he is but what you looking for is god's hand of protection god be my shelter god be my shield called me my rock now you can stay fight now and lock up the stephanie basement and look what i told him but that doesn't solve yes i'm saying that just you fearful up there but you still have to be aware and doing all that needs to be done that you have trust in the lord so he says here now that you put on the new man which is after god is created in righteousness and truly says two things here you have to put off one and put on one you're putting off the old man and you're putting on the new man you are responsible to do that let me say it again you see the minister preaching the word that is one thing you see when you go home you have an old man and a new man and as which one you want to feed you could see the old man with movies with books but this all kind of crazy stuff or you could feed the old man or you could feel a new man if you feed a new man you want to worship you want to pray you want to seek the lord you want to get on the scriptures you want to apply the word to your heart you're working on that new man wherefore put away a lion you got to put that away too so everybody who knew they're not spoiled they're not fully speaking the truth in this room here doesn't have problems speaking full truth you have to put away what is not true like speak every man troop with his neighbor for we are members one another be angry and still not let your not your son go down so this is practical living i like this this is perfect this is a complete package you know sometimes you get a sandwich and something listen in it you have no lettuce it have no something there's a kind of boring sandwich this sandwich this this this menu that called quotation efficiency is the full menu a full menu you talk about supernatural before the foundation of the world you are predecimated you talk about you have been quickened you talk about the british cross or you talk about the building you talk about the unity and everything else and always talking about the practical application of this world to your life be angry and say not let not sun go down upon your rat and i used to take that real personal when i got married i remember whenever we have a foster something in the early part of our marriage the sudden when you start going long i'm making sure everything's straight now nothing you're going back the next day and you're not talking and you're not saying nothing at all no no let not sun go down up on your right neither give place to the devil let him that stole steal no more rather let him labor who came with his hands the things which is good that he may have to give them an either i like this one there's a big big one you find somebody working hard like they want too much of money then they'll be pointing that basically i'm thinking but here at this point labor that he may have to give that needed you know bible says no blessing to give them to receive but you can't give away you have think about it it's more blessed to give them to receive right i'm not straining a little bit here but is you in order to give you have to have and to have you have to get and i get you after labor let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good so this year the church can't do this for you you could hear mysteries revelations uh uh new tongue new name new language other language and so on like that you can have all these things but let no corrupt communication position anymore because you see you could know all them things and then oh okay corrupt communication you see so then here let's go again let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of a define that it may minister grace to the hearers and big one grieve not the holy spirit whereby you are sealed until their redemption let all bitterness which some people still have and the bible says sweetness speech speaking it about with prayer so you know going on the devil or you pray because you know what i treat now now it's one thing that bitterness you know but you can't let it stay too bitter yeah they get it by sweeten it up right and rat and anger and crap now listen he's not talking to gentiles outsider this is church people in case you're he's talking about you and either jewish folks he's talking about believers he's talking about brethren so i don't always look again could somebody say amen out there so he says uh little bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor he was speaking we put away from you with all malice and be kind one to another that's a wholesale monday on kindness i think this message need a message on kindness knowing that any preachers in our midst want to work on something on that but people need to be kind so it's not a common word um it's not a word that is um because kindness is demonstratable kindness is demonstratable it's not like i have a text on kindness and the text i'm going to reveal the mystery behind kindness no just be kind and we get the revelation industry right there too just just be kind and um be kind one to another tenderhearted that's the next um my grandson uh my grandson samuel i tell him uh one time i sell them i said um your mommy would say samuel come here he said um my mommy don't speak like that so i said how does your mummy speak she says softly i just was amazed because that is how his mother speak oh that's kind of speak very soft so i recognize he's aware of how his mother speaks he's aware of how his father speaks so if anybody speak to him rough and gruff it's a different tone altogether but you have to be tenderhearted uh even as christ even as god for christ's sake have forgiven me you realize that um we i don't know you currently measure sin in terms of so much sin i i understand seem to be sin but some sins are you know more terrible than our sins if you could use it that way but the fact is christ has forgiven us and is because of the heart he has for us because it's not like he forgive us when we say we you know when we we were nice and we were good he forgive us why we were against him why we were in our condition and and that redeeming love is what reached out to us in our condition it's not that we were clean we were filthy but his love reached out to us and until us and then chapter five chapter five he's going long again uh to the believers he's going further in christian living be followers of god yet children walk in love that's just actionable as christ love us and give him himself a sweet self offering fornication all uncleanness consciousness letting that be named among you neither filthiness or foolish talking or justin uh and and and this no no monger no opine person no covetous man had any inheritance in the kingdom of god let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things common iraq on terminal business of children disobedience you talk about ye who were sometimes in darkness and now light in the world walk as children of light and the fruit of the spirit aha let's go the fruit of the spirit some people claim to have these spirits some people claim to be anointed with the spirit and uh touch will be spread hallelujah right but the fruit of it is goodness righteousness truth proven what is acceptable unto the lord have no fellowship with the unfruitful work of darkness but rather reprove them for it's a shame even to speak of those things which are done in secret but all things are reproved and so on see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because these are evil so he's talking about aha let's go and angle and whereby be not unwise church listen to this part this is verse 18 verse 17 but understanding what the will of the lord is i think i trust god gave you a burden that you would want to know what is the will of god for your life we all have our decisions and choices and what we want to do but you want god's will for your life and be not drunk with wine we're in his excess but be filled with the spirit 19 speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord so if nobody talking to you you could speak to yourself if nobody encouraging you you could speak to yourself in psalms and hymns if you're already psalms you're not you're not going to get back something from the word so sounds and sings and spiritual songs singing and making a melody in your heart to the lord so even if you can't sing like you can't hold a song in a bucket you could say something in your heart if your voice out the tune and that is okay but you're sticking in your heart if you if you if you if you if you're personally wrong you got complaining about your voice and so on singing yeah and then after that you're singing all of the spirit atmosphere creator and then giving thanks always that's some people like to complain oh gosh they i don't know we call them yeah yeah yeah yeah it just happened yeah yeah they're complaining complaining complaining hinders your feet let me say it again complaining weakens the faith when you feel to complain just say lord i bless you i praise you right thank you look how much people come with congratulations where are you supposed to complain so when i went and had a good time by election they had a good time and bars that a good time all the good times are over they're on a bed you follow them saying that people get reacted and different kind of things like that people careless some people were careless and so on there were some who were not but there were some who were like one man understand he knew what he had but he went here you went dear you want to go to private hospital this and that and that and a lot of people got connected so it's not right because right now through this whole thing you recognize how what we do affect others that's big that's big enough when you think deeper how one person represents the kingdom of god and then how does the kingdom how does your life or our life reflect in god's program and you know but i thought sometime i go talking about working in the business only business and above the business and we're going to go down a little bit to that when we go to the church it's just part of this whole exhortation tonight to see how god has seen things at the church level which was fighting the labor in and it and they find all the apostles who sit there nothing from liars and so on and that is at this level here at the ground level but above level god's seen something different he's seeing the love is lacking he's seeing working like a mule he's seeing labor but he's not seeing the love that's supposed to go with the burden of the world and it gives a different tone when we begin to see not at our level but at god's level and sometimes i wonder if people think at all how does god see our behavior or our attitude or our action how does god see that we're not talking about people now because the people consider god bless praise the lord and so like that you could do a performance but as i say you know acting a hollywood performance you got award but when you go to the level of watching it's different and it comes back to how goku tell by the branham be more sincere because god was seen in his heart we as humans can't see that we can't see i know what is going on people's lives we see somebody whole they might be smiling or they might be crying on the inside they might be smiling or they might be in pain in a pain and so on like that and only god could come and give that kind of healing and that he didn't touch so given tanks and then all this is in five we almost finish this part of it here and um he's talking about giving tanks always always for all things under god and the father let me be that slowly this one to drive slowly slow down the gear we don't want to drive this one too fast we want to drive slowly on this one given thanks always for all things unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ giving time thank you lord this will happen this happened this did not happen as we say you're tanking god for the nose as if it's here yes because he knows protecting you you want this god said no and you you instead of getting upset say thank you lord hallelujah thank you you told me no because you know best and that demonstrates trust in god what i have in this point you know you should not abraham you should not know what you should not have every son that committed god will be trying so god wouldn't have no others as you do nobody see past behind no god does not it's kind of different all right and then i went on to said wives submit yourselves unto your husband's under the law now this is not um a suggestion this is just the word it's not opinion this is just what the word unfolds how why is supposed to behave husband is the head of the wife he must christ the head of the church and what paul is doing paul is comparing the behavior with the revelation of the mystery of christ and the church so this husband and wife thing is not just about the writing this husband and wife thing is a little deeper than what we see it's a reflection of what the operation is supposed to be of christ and the church could imagine the wife of christ busting a slap on him could you imagine the wife of christ abusing could imagine christ's wife and send him back and being disrespectful i want you to think about that then you come down to the natural husband and wife what can i behave is dear you know the christ fight walk out on him i ain't coming back oh my god done so watch therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let their wives be to their own husband in everything no to to put the balance and that husband's love your wives how not as a father of your mother just talk about that but as christ loved the church and gave himself for it that so in other words uh you have to put your wife above you in order to love her when i say above you in order to treat her well okay value her cherish her because love is demonstratable i want to say it again love is demonstratable you see the new name or the mystery of the trumpets and the vials you can't demonstrate that you're what i'm saying we could teach that um the mystery of the woman on the seven hills the mystery of revelation 17. all these different mysteries are not demonstrated they are i know it's not a word revealable they could be revealed or unfolded but this here is demonstrable husband love your wife how christ of the church give himself that he might cleanse it by the washing of the water by the word that might present himself a glorious church not having a spot a wrinkle so what meant to love their wives as their own bodies see that love it his wife love it himself if you do love your wife you answer that personally no one is his own flesh and then he says we are members of his body his flesh his bones and so on and for discourse shall a man leave his father mother shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh without the mother-in-laws and in laws of outlaws and getting involved because the man is mature a man going into his family his blessings and that's it all right now watching nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife imagine himself and see that the wife reverence a husband or respectful husband chapter six okay chapter six talk about children will be your parents still demonstrating honor your father and mother that it may be wrong well with the fathers do provoking children you see all of these are living mysteries all of these are things that could be applied all these things are life skills life stories uh life and godliness this is it right here in chapter six for children servants will be in their uh masters and so on singles of heart not with eye service um they just get down there quickly no finally my version is verse 10 of ephesians chapter six you talk about put on the old armor of god destroying the lord of might and here it is after the destination after his quickness after he talked about uh one lord one thing on baptism after he speaks about all these life skills and stuff he's introducing something new in this whole chapter now the devil the enemy what we want against so it's not so that's what i'm saying ephesians is a complete package it's a holistic package here it is after you talk about put away rat for the rebittance and whatnot so that's you know so you have your own challenges you have your own thing so put off the new put off the old man put on a new man love your wife do this do that subject yourself and whatnot here it is he's introducing for irrational not against flesh and blood so we fight besides our own personal problem we're not about lucifer we're not about demons not about demon activity we're not talking about that here rat and anger and whatnot that have to do with us putting away this rejecting this walk away from this that's you and what you have to do things that you have to do illusions you have the time no in addition to that we understand by the word that we are not wrestling against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual weakness in high places therefore you have to put on the whole armor of god to stand then he explained the world armor of god and so on like that taking the shield of fate uh taking the shield of faith uh helmet of salvation sword of the spirit praying always with all prayers application and the spirit watching unto all saints and something like that and for me that will be given that's it grace be and that's it so i trust tonight that you were blessed here in this scripture and um i just have an excellent power to go through considering tiny little ages but this is the ephesians ephesians what abraham said is the plumb line okay let me just look back at one more thing in the future i forget to talk about this um right above all taking a sheet of fate whereby this is 16 whereby you shall able to quench all the dust of the wicked take the helmet of salvation the sword of the spirit with the word of god praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit watching therefore with all perseverance and all supplications with all saints and so on like that so paul was saying praying always in order to bring praying and other life things into a habit because that is what praying always does praying always is is praying until you become a habit you're going to pray on dead bones so you make praying a habit so pray becomes part of him part of the operation i think there's some statistics that show how long it takes for something to be active in you then in repeating it when you keep doing it over and over and over so like all we have this zoom study as we do this over and over and you're getting benefit from it and they get trained from it afterwards you look back and say but this is who how could we how could we not do this you see because we are we have benefited from it we are being strained from it so brother branham this uh he's he spoke about a key that was given to him that determined the messenger of each agent is the most scriptural one he said it's called the keystone of the bible it's the revelation that god never changes that his ways are unchangeable as he is that's the key the key is what god never changes now that's that's on top here that's that's the upper level now down here it have man who introduces things like if god has changed but the reality is he's hebrews today he's jesus christ he's saying yesterday and forever and ecclesiastes 3 14 15 says i know that god whatever god do it it shall be forever nothing can be put to it no anything take me from it and god do it that men may fear before him that which has been is now that which is to be had already been and god required that which is past so here it is and i'm changing god with unchanging ways we want to take our time slow here what he did at the first he will have to keep on doing until it is done for the last time there will never be a change apply that to the church ages the kind of man that god choose for the first age and how god manifested in that man's ministry would be the example for all other ages what god did in the first church age is what he will do in all other ages so therefore this is the pattern this is the key all right so the beginning of the word was that god the word was and word was god no change to him now if any man shall take any words voice from the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part of the book of life out of the holy city and the things that are written in this book here i want to get to what the church was at pentecost is the standard remember the class what the church was at pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern i wanted to stick tonight no other pattern no matter what scholars say god has not changed that pattern what god did at pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church closes glory so when the quote be a custom reading from adoption when a church is groaning that the holy ghost is just as real as when it fell on their pentacles how they groan and cry and when they are born and positionally born then god sets in the church apostles and teachers and prophets and evangelists and then god sent all the other gifts inside of you but watch what you have to believe that the holy ghost is just as real i was there pelicans why did goshen a prophet what was the mission of that prophet to turn our hearts back to the fate of the father the purpose of sending a profit was to get us to connect back with the original which is what's pattern that cannot change no minister power of authority to change that to show that that is not the pattern that is the pattern there has to be another day of pentacles there has to be dynamics upon this last day right it has to be the power of god as never before no man can change that nobody can preach that out these scenes reveal that the quickening power has to come back to the church that the holy ghost was born by praise and dogmas but is it being loosed by the even time message that is what this message comes to do loosely holy ghost hallelujah not just loose men around the world with the interpretation you could find out you found out what they meant these guys but the loose equal equals and the holy ghost has been loosed since the prophet came the holy ghost has been loosed but it has been loosed in the form of promises god hide the holy ghost any form of promises and people let the promises go they have their own interpretation they preaching their own mysteries they're preaching on revelation but the seed the secret is the wood and the bride god then promises thunder inside that right now the bride have their promises and god going and change them with same word inside of you after spirit what a dynamic i know we haven't have a tremendous revival and coronavirus can't stop i'm not promising stopping and revival no no virus is stopping the revival this revival come from god god ordained this revival he called that bright survivor you chose to understand we got revival right now we underground hallelujah god allow this could you imagine we have more services than ever before we have more things operating than ever before think about it think about it who arranged all of this the same god that had the print and press introduced before the word come to print and get looted to spread it in pamphlets and whatnot the same god that had west leader run around the world with the same god hallelujah that do all these different things that that tape recorder being invented that we could get the days of the voice the same god that invented internet that we could do we're doing right now he's a god that do all these things we're still under the anointing of god the devil hallelujah all we never tried all this kingdom god using it there's a divorce but around gone and we are the voice still here hallelujah and there's a people in the land under their messenger all glory will be the final voice at the final age what a wonderful time so the church at pentecost was the pattern what god did at pentecost he has to keep doing until the age closes those scholars may tell you the apostolic is age is over don't believe it susceptible is wrong on two comments first it's wrong and then he explained this and he went slowly across the scripture of acts 2. then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the mission of the sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you and he says the promise of power which the apostles been doing that pentecost is to you the jews to your children jews and to all them that are far off gentiles that's the interpretation of that scripture it powers unto you jews your children jews to them that are foul of gentiles as to many as the lord of god shall call both jew and gentiles until he stops calling the pentecostal message and power will not cease hallelujah hallelujah i will connect with that i will stay with that it cannot cease what the church had at pentecost is an inalienable right originally she had the pure word of god she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs and wonders and gift of the holy ghost and then he read the scriptures of hebrews two one to four therefore we ought to give more uranus he to the things which we have heard at least at any time we let them slip but if the words spoken by angels were steadfast and every transgression and disobedience to the word receive a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so greater salvation which at first begin to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard god also bearing witness both with signs and wonders with diverse miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his will that original church was not organized by men it was led by the holy ghost it wasn't very big it was hated on the spice it was oppressed it was prosecuted we counter debt but it was true to god it stayed with the original word pattern now don't let get let no don't get astray he said when i said that the church god and his ways never change i did not say that the church and his messengers could not change the church isn't god so she can't change what i said was that because of the unchanging god with the unchanging ways we can go back to the beginning and see the first scientific act of god and then judge by that standard that is how it is done the true church here we go will always try to be like the original at pentecost that is the aim that is the target what it had at pentecost we are striving towards that the true church today will try to approximate that fully first one and the messengers to the churches having the same spirit of god in them will try to approximate the apostle paul they won't exactly be like him but the true messengers will be the ones that come the closest to paul who was one free of all men that mean no no hierarchy behind them all right sold out to god and gave forth the word of god only and manifested the holy ghost in power none else would do you have to work from the original as like begets like the true church would always be the one that tries to follow in the steps of our founders at pentecost and our messengers will follow the apostle paul the first messenger to the first church age it is that simple and that wonderful isn't that glorious tonight so then he talked about with this key he was um he was just selecting messengers and so like that here is part i want to get to know since you understand how we judge what the true church was like what she was at pentecost and she was the in the apostles age set forth by the word in the book of acts we can apply that same rule to show how the church failed the basic era or errors that crept into the first church were revealed in the book of acts and revelation also new pistols will become more and more visibly manifested in each subsequent age until we come to a complete blackout in the laodicean age now out of this first key we have received of the lord there comes another slightly less wonderful truth i said that the true church will always trying to be like the book of acts that is exactly right but we have discovered that the word also teaches an invasion of error until there's a complete blackout of truth in the last days when the lord is about to appear the question now arises in our minds does god forsake his own and let them fall into a state of complete deception there's a prophecy does god forsake his own and let them fall into a state of complete deception he said no a no account so god will not let the bride or the elect fall into a state of complete deception some deception but not the complete one no because god will bring his elect out of deception all right so watch on no account for the scripture said the elect cannot be deceived for they shall rise force christ false prophets shall show signs and wonders and so much if it were possible they shall receive the very like then what then the answer is clear before us there's a true church and fourth church there's a true vine false fine of course that false church and false fine body will always try to use the position of the true church and contend that she is and not the elect that are real and authentic the false church the false will try to kill the truth that is how it was in the book of acts that is how to set forth in the century of ages and that is how it was declared in various epistles that is how it has been that is how it is now it can't change so let's be careful that we are not confused at this point thus we will seek the word to validate this claim and then he talked about the gardener eden two trees one was good one was evil one produced life one produced debt and then there are two brothers cain abel we understand that they worshipped and that order had his reflection almost done o praise god so these illustrations depicted the parable of the lord jesus christ when he said that the kingdom of the heaven was like unto a man who sowed good seed and only the enemy come and plan tears among them whose good seeds all praise the name of the lord so i realized that something has been cut short here but god is good you love him tonight oh my i wish i could hear you all but god is good i want to get one more thing here are we going to the degrees of god there's not something here i want to get okay okay all right so then um revelation two two the three i knew that i works that labor like patience how do cancer bear them are evil although i tried them would see the apostles and are not as found them liars and as born and as patients and for my name as labored and not fit how beautifully the savior praises and commands his children he takes full account of their fine spiritual attitudes and behavior he knows that there is weaknesses among them and yet he does not crowd against it isn't that just like the lord he knows how to encourage us in the right matters discourage us in the wrong matters we could all learn a good lesson right here in running the church and our families and better still we could all learn a good lesson in that god deals with each one of us in exactly this way don't ever be discouraged saint of god for god is not on gracious to forget your labors of love whatever we do even giving a cup of cold water to someone has a reward and blessing from the lord i know thy works thy labor by patience as he walks in the midst of his church he's aware of the suffering of his people and he cares as it was in the days of captivity in egypt when he heard their cries he who never changes still hear the cries of the oppressed as he walks among them the very word labor signifies awareness through oppression god's people do not only work for him in a label of love but they suffer for him with joy they are patient and they're in the yolk this age suffered great persecution he had to work hard to preach the gospel check for truth the high calling in life was to serve god and when their hopes and life were belighted they were patient committed all to him who had promised a lasting recompense in heaven for what they had given up for humankind i think we ought to stop here and deal with the thought that god's people have always been and always will be persecuted genesis cain abel and so like that he said listen to this something i'm gonna i won't close almost finish no matter how just an upright a christian is before the public how gracious he is to his fellow man doing not but good let him confess christ and his the operation of the gifts of the holy spirit and tongues prophecy healing and miracles and he will be condemned the spirit of this world hates the spirit of god and because it can't overcome the spirit of the lord it tries to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit of truth dwells push aha persecutions and trials a natural normal part of the christian life let me say it again so all the people who are trial weary and test weary persecution and trials a natural normal part of the christian life there's only one thing you can do about them one thing commit them all to god judge not leave the outworking and final judgment of god dog cancer via them which are evil doers try them which say the apostles and are not and has wronged them liars these ephesians believed that god's people ought to be holy h-o-l-y according to this verse they took steps to keep the body unlevened from sin most evidently the apostasy had already started sin had entered into the church but they were beaten to the words of poor when he said to put away the wicked from among them they were separated people they had come out of the world and now they weren't going to let the world enter amongst them they would not put up with sin in the church holiness as if i want to close off with them wasn't a phrase with them or a figure of speech it was a way of life let's bow our heads hallelujah heavenly father i thank you for this session lord this overview of ephesians entirely with the ephesus church and lord closing with this thought holiness wasn't a speech was a way of life father me the believers somehow may their minds be enlightened tonight may they be inspired tonight to connect with this ephesians church that was there in the beginning because that is what this message came to do father to get us back to another ephesians to one lord one feet one baptism father me a presence fill the hearts of your people here fill them with revelation fill them with understanding filament and wisdom and knowledge may they put off the old man put on a new man may their lives be changed as they reflect on this supernatural church this church that was in the beginning original this explosive church that everything ties right back to this candle this light this star and you had paul to have this great overview over this bridge between the jewish and the gentile church now we thank you that this day as the gospel about to go back to the jews here we are the climax of the gentile dispensation the closing of the gentile dismissal here we are lord waiting on you looking to you at the dynamics of the holy spirit we pour out in the church father of your way tonight in the name of jesus may you bless us lord bless the time tomorrow the service we're going to have for the streaming otherwise granted lord in jesus name we ask it amen and amen this time i want anthony to sing a song and uh but isaac would close us in prayer praise the lord praise the lord but anthony amen open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart i want to see you want to see you oh sing and open the eyes of my heart open the eyes i want to see [Music] i want to see you to see shining in the light of your glory lord pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy glory oh tonight won't you open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart i want to see you [Music] shining in the light of [Music] lord pour out your power and love as we think shining in the light of your glory [Music] oh [Music] i want to see you one more time holy holy oh holy holy holy oh holy holy holy i want to see you i want to see amen god bless you tonight uh certainly blessed with the teaching tonight and there was so much tremendous that was said and um before it was in prayer you know there's this there's a scripture but i've been reading ephesians and and um you know we say it in different ways and uh i believe i would have said it uh last sunday where david encouraged himself in the lord you know and as beloved was reading this one this was ephesians 5 and 19. he said speak into yourselves in psalms so it's not just in one way it's not just of words to yourself but speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs so paul is actually making a distinction between psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody so it's not just singing so he's making a distinction between singing and making melody in your heart to the lord and then he goes on to say giving thanks always i love when there's this displacing of a condition that you kind of debate giving thanks always for all things unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ and one of the best remedies for feeling down is given thanks to god if you're ever feeling low just start to give thanks and i want to challenge you as homework from tonight into tomorrow and the next day i want you begin to give thanks and many times we don't realize how much there is to give thanks about you know we take so much for granted and if you go through your day looking for a reason to be thankful you will shock yourself the fact that you can even move your hand before you before you reach off the bed and it's at the stretch thank god to be able to stretch we could have people this morning couldn't stretch we we are rich only very yet to know just the fact that you could stretch that people can't open their eyes so before you even get off the bed you're tanking god that he could open your eyes your tongue go that he could stretch your tongue go that you can move your foot because that people have to get help to come over in them when you're tangled they can move you and i decided to go to instead of complaining they thank god for for hot water that the kettle could work that he didn't have to go and get gas at gas tank this morning and after a while to realize how much you have to thank god for and then you move from the natural and you move from the the stuff around you to the spiritual blessing of being able to give thanks to god for his word for this great message of this elijah prophet malachi 4 and how it has sustained us and knowledge us that is enough to be super thankful for tonight so i really want to appreciate and be thankful tonight for our pastor brother for this wonderful uh teaching tonight you appreciate our pastor tonight really really a blessing really and encouragement and um i want to acknowledge but uh leno terrado diolo bendigo merman but eleno is here with us he was a tremendous blessing at the convention translating in spanish and he has also been translating some of the recent messages uh in spanish as well but over and over on a brief call with a pastor from mexico and honduras yesterday or zoom call and um you know fellowshipping on one of the message uh but over preached a couple weeks ago uh feasting on the unfeeling body word that bertolino translated into spanish and they played it in their churches and um testimonies have come out from from that message so we tango everybody leaner who's here with us tonight as well as for those around the world who god is touching in different ways so can we just bow our heads for word of prayer tonight our gracious heavenly father lord we are so thankful lord and we take the words of the great apostle paul lord as he was speaking to the the ephesians church that church that still stands as an example to us lord of lord this this this this template so to speak lord of that alpha church lord that father this omega word bride lord would be lord so much like that alpha church lord and lord to take this great ministry lord that you left for your bride to fulfill that was gathered throughout all the ages but now lord coming to its fullness to its climax lord so we thank you tonight that we could take lord the space of grace this opportunity lord through your servant and our passover to take another look at the book of ephesians lord and overview a bird's-eye view of the book lord and to see lord there's so many things in there that lord touch family touch church touch our daily lives our conduct our behavior our attitude our disposition lord of spiritual warfare law the arm of god the whole lord let this there's so much in there as well robert said we could preach messages and sermons and still be in that book for months so we thank you tonight lord in the midst of lord having a day here in trinidad where we have we have experienced record announcements of cases of the virus to see lord has gross darkness over the earth and above the people lord to see all these things unfold lord and to see that father they are still light of your word they see light of your prophet's message that is sustaining us and we can come together lord and we are so thankful lord that you are protecting your people and we pray you continue to protect continue to bless continue to guide us lord we see so many things happening so we want to just be lord so grateful and to remain in the spirit so may you bless us tonight may you bless the service tomorrow night and the prayer meeting this coming friday and lord what you have planned for this sunday father we are trusting on you knowing that you already know what is going to happen so father we are totally surrendered to you we thank you for every brother and sister that made it here tonight we thank you for those that could not make it for whatever reason and we pray that you continue to bless them and strengthen them and strengthen the church and lord may you continue to provide for the needs of your people we commit the church into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen praise the lord god bless you and shalom by the lino thanks for stopping by i appreciate it praise the lord amen so god bless you saints look forward for that service tomorrow we're looking for a great time with the lord god be with you are we going to close off at this point
