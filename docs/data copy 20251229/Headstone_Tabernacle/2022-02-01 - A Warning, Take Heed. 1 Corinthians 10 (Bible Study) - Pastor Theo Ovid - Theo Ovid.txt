this friday coming here will be your holiday of praying fast first friday of the month and uh we're gonna cruise off with the zoom permission uh this comment friday so god bless you and uh we want to go straight into the bible study tonight and um it's very or that i still um connecting with the message where the isaac's speech speak i spoke about this great deception in the world and in the church and in the message this this this deception and tonight i want to go a little further i just felt like to do this it'll be a different tonight and i'm going to give her what i have titled a warning take heed first corinthians 10 bible study this is a warning to take heed and this is the context the main scripture we're going to have is first scoring since then we're not going to read that just yet but we're going to we want to get there so we see what the lord will do so the first scripture i want to read tonight and if you have about us with you is hebrews chapter four in verse one two hebrews chapter four verse one and two and we're going to already have a a ride a rocket ride in the scriptures today and i want you to see something that god how god sees things um i want to transport you not from this zoom room i want to transport you into the realm of of dossier the lord oh god speak to his prophets oh god give his word forget me tonight i am just let's say uh repeats repeating instructions repeating his guidance and so on like that right so forget church you just want to hear from the lord hebrews 4 1 and 2. and this is the scriptures here let us therefore fear least a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it so this is not you are in church and you're fine this is being confronted with the scriptures itself verse 2 for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it now remember for a while now a few services i'll keep talking i'm not but i'm beginning to see more and more that even though people may all hear the same things they don't process it the same way they come like you could be sitting here tonight and want to know what is my objective what is my motive what i'm trying to say if i'm trying to say this i'm trying to and i'm not trying to say anything i'm trying to share what god put up on my heart which is his word i do have a dream to bring for you from last night i do have a fancy total as such i'm just trying to obey god and present to you the word let's turn to now to hebrews chapter 2 verse 1. [Music] we want to read from verse 1 to 3. therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard so therefore you could actually come to a place where you're just hearing things yeah karen you know yes it was your you know go in out you hear what you hear you know but you're not listening closely you're not taking it deeper you're not as bad as i could always said meditate on the word you can't meditate on something you have not studied you meditate you chew it over like i listen to a fish corinthians 10 over and over i'm listening to it i'm trying to soak it in because i want to get right into it this is where i feel like to go tonight and when you study the word you could get the opportunity to meditate on the word so watch therefore we ought to give them energy to the things which we have heard least at any time we should let them slip for if the words spoken by angels were steadfast and every transgression and disobedience receive a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which is that the first begin to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them not indian so what paul is presenting here is that we should not take things for granted we should not second timothy 3 familiar scripture if you want to go to ii verse 1 says this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own self covetous posters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truth breakers false accusers in continuing fears the spices of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers as i said see that dear lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god the bible says because iniquity shall bond the love of many will work school that's church folks love the president of the lord for his fight having a form of godliness but in the message now but denying the power thereof from such to no way for of this sword are they which creep into houses and the captive city woman leading with sins literally redivers lust ever learning never able to come to the knowledge of the truth but the air is close to the ground they're learning the hearing they're receiving in that way but not coming to the truth let's continue verse eight now as janice and jumpers with submissions so do these also resist the truth now imagine that resistance to men of corrupt minds reprobate considering what concerning defeat but they shall proceed no further for their folly shall be manifest unto all men as theirs also was and now paul is going into the life cycle now but don was fully known by doctrine manner of life purpose faith long suffering charity patience persecutions afflictions which came under me at antioch at iconium at lystra what persecutions i endured but out of them all the lord delivered ye and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall shall suffer persecution but evil men and seducers child wax worth and with deceiving and being deceived but continues out in the things which dog has learned and has been assured of knowing whom though has learned them so paul was actually pointing and this is the reality of the scripture that they're going to write evil men church folks ministries ministers that are going to be deceiving and themselves deceived but continue down in the things that always learn now paul he is the one that says this angel come from heaven and preach any other gospel let him be a curse if i come back and change the original presentation let me be a christ in other words god can come and have a new version of it i improve version of it it can't be done now remember friends that the jews who rejected the gospel that jesus brought that rejection gives us an opportunity as gentiles to come in and paul identified it in romans 11. if you want to find the bible take a note of it 15-22 paul said if the casting away of them talking about the jews be the reconciling of the world what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead for if the first fruit be holy the lump is also holy but if the root be holy so are the branches and if some of the branches be broken off and dao being a wild olive trees of gentiles are grafted in among them and with them partakers of the root and the fatness of the olive tree both not against the branches but if double boost though there is not the root but the root zee there will see then the branches are broken off that i might be grafted in so paul is bringing the balance of the approach with the revelation to understand the context in which we gentiles were grafted in he said you will see then the branches were broken off that i might be grafted in well because of unbelief they were broken off and those standards by faith be not high-minded but fear and if you're reading it in your bible i always see it with me that last part be not high-minded but fear say it one more time be not high-minded but fear for who's 21 if god spared not the natural branches take heed release he also skinner d behold therefore the goodness and the severity of god on them that fell severity but towards the goodness and looking for the condition here if thou continue in his goodness otherwise thou shalt be cut off now there are many people take god for granted take the calling for granted take the election predestination and they believe the message and god open their eyes and they god i serve and call kuala mutal they take all of that for granted but when you put layer after layer of scriptural truth it shouldn't be taken for granted he says the goodness and severity of god on them that fell severity but towards thee goodness if if many people start is not who start is who finishes and not only who finishes but who finishes without taking shortcuts or uh and get disqualified at the end of the race if thou continue in his goodness if you don't continue in his goodness what happened you'll be cut off colossians 1 we want to read for 17 to 23. colossians 1 17 and he is before all things speaking with christ by him all things consist and he's the head of the body to church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminences for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell on having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether there be things in it or things in heaven and you speak on us that was sometime alienated an enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now had he reconciled in the body of his flesh to death here we go to present you holy and unblameable unreprovable in his sight the fine print or the condition comes next if you continue in the face rooted grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under him where i paul i made a minister the part i want you to underline the part i want you to get is if you continue in the fate okay so let's let's run right now familiar scriptures this is short versus matthew 24 4 and jesus said unto them take heed that no man deceive you warning of that deception that's going to be the world that's going to be in the church there could be a message that in the amplified says jesus answered them be careful that no one misleads you deceiving you and leading you into error i just love how that is presented deceiving you and leading you into error matthew 24 jesus speaking and many false prophets arise and shall deceive many okay all right so we want to go now to the old testament deuteronomy chapter four and i want you to see what god shares to teach our sons and our son's sons how god is presenting his thoughts and his word to these people okay deuteronomy deuteronomy chapter four wanna read from verse one now therefore hearken o israel unto the statutes and unto the judgments which i teach you for to do them that you may live and go in and possess the land which your lord god of your father has given you now note the land is promised but as we say to everything there is a process you want to buy a house you have to have the application you have to have a job you have to get uh being able to within the range of the mortgage requirement you want to get a car you have to have your license you can't just ups and want to buy a car you can't even drive and to get the license you don't want to pick up analyzing a dispensing machine you have to test an exam you have to go and do driving tests then you have to pass these exams and you get your driver's license and this is the life the process you want to have a garden of oranges you just say lord let there be a kind of oranges it doesn't work that way you have to tell the soil cut down the land get the orange trees to plant your plant you wait nine months ten months two years how much years it takes to grow and then you get your garden so everything in life is processed the baby is not born an adult that's why the baby the baby grow and grow to process becomes an adult and just like that we don't born big in god or born perfect in god or born as uh adult and god we grew and this is what this life is a process so so in other words i want to read that verse again this is from tutoring chapter four heart know israel under the statutes and judgments which i teach you for to do them that you may live one two and go in and possess the land which the lord god you have given your father has given you two you shall not add unto the word which i command you neither shall you diminish it ought from it don't take away look at it that you may keep the commandments of the lord your courage i command you your eyes have seen what the lord did because of the alpha for all the men that followed blpo the lord thy god had destroyed them from among you so these people saw judgments of god and you know of time i keep seeing a lot of crap a lot of nonsense and foolishness continues and go on his message because this message has not yet seen the judgment of god they have not they don't know what that is they they have books and people arrogant and you can't tell them nothing people don't want to be spoken to and you know all kind of attitudes and stuff here's why they feel blessed they feel this and the other one mine and with the modern here they have a car they have a house they feeling proud they feel like there's all kind of stuff going through their mind but this what i'm saying here is god and this is coming okay so what for god destroyed him among you and ani but ye that did cleave unto the lord your god are alive every one of you this day so this is acknowledging you know what you are the bunch that cleave unto the lord behold i have taught you statutes and judgments even as the lord my god commanded me so moses was under command to present and teach statutes instructions and judgments that you should do so in the land whether you go to possess it for six keep therefore and do them for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations we shall hear all these statutes and say surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people for what nation is just so great who had god so night unto them as a lot of our god is all things that we all call upon him for and what nation is there so great that had statutes and judgment so righteous has all this law which i said before this day this night here we go only take heed to thyself and keep thy soul diligently least go forget the things which you think eyes have seen unleash depart from thy heart all the days of their life but teach them thy sons and thy sons and thy sons sons so we could take something out of that that you have to keep your soul you have to take heat to yourself that you don't forget the things that you have seen and heard at least they depart from your heart now you know you know you see people in church and you see them backslid slide and sometimes you sit down and wonder how did they get there how did they go back so far that means they were dying on the inside they were backstriding on the inside a long time ago people doesn't just follow you they're backstage on god the physical body comes to church sing a man raise your hand and smile about god bless you but the heart is going away from god see and then if your heart not where it's supposed to be how will you teach your sons if you're not in the place that you're supposed to be how you will teach your son's sons you know in observing over the years if you find the parents disrespectful or the mother disrespectful or the father disrespectful look at the children they're going to be just as disrespectful if you see the mother of bad attitude or the father look at the children you will see the attitudes go down the challenge is when it flip over to the next generation and you could see how god is so concerned because he wants it to go from generation to generation the statutes of this world so let's continue deuteronomy chapter 4 powerful scripture this is moses this is moses telling the people why he is not going over verse 20 this is very instructive this is the prophet moses man that have god's ear but the lord verse twenty fifth and eighth generation fourth was trending but the lord had taken you and brought you forth out of the iron fullness event of egypt to be unto him a people of inheritance as he are this day furthermore the lord was angry with me for your seeks now this is the prophet and he is telling them that god was angry with him let's continue and swear that i should not go over jordan that i should not go into that good land which the lord thy god give a thee for inheritance they are mine this is the same moses said stand still and see the salvation of the lord of god this is the same moses that open pirate see this is the same moses that the challenge pharaoh this is the same moses that saw these two million people come up and this is that same moses saying the lord was angry with me and the lord said i should not go over to jordan i should not go into that good land but you know like god gives a deeper inheritance but i must die in this land i must not was 22 over jordan but ye shall go over and possess that good lie take heed unto yourself and if there is one taking part that i think we should get tonight is from this this is a man that killed one man run away and 40 years and he backs their desert and conquered the pillar of fire called send them to egypt we know the story not going over that not right now and here it is that this same man given consul in other words don't take things for granted brethren go take your mother for granted your father for granted don't take the pastor for granted don't take the choice for that don't take the books for granted don't take the word for that don't take the instagram don't take anybody for granted the day you hear somebody um last week you get them okay and then they sweep the dead and this one died and this one died don't take anybody for granted take heed to yourselves verse 23 least you forget the covenant of the lord your god which he made with you and make you a grievan image or likeness of anything which the law thy god are forbiddenly for the lord thy god is a consuming fire even a jealous god when thou shall beget children and children's children that he shall have remained long in the land and shall corrupt yourselves and make great images or likeness or anything i shall do evil in the sight of the lord thy god to provoke him to anger i call him on mannered to witness against you this day that you shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereon you go over jordan to possess it you shall not prolong your days upon it but you shall utterly be destroyed and the lord shall scatter you so moses is prophesying the lord shall scatter you among the nations you shall be left few in number among the heathen where the lord shall lead you and there you shall serve god the work of men's hands wooden stone which neither see nor hear no eat no smell and if if from dance though shall seek the lord thy god thou shalt find him if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul when thou art in tribulation and all these things that come upon thee even in the latter days if thou turn to the lord thy god and shall be obedient unto his voice for the lord thy god is merciful god he will not forsake me neither destroy thee nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sway unto them let's give us some praise right now for the lord he's a merciful god and he's merciful to my father we thank you and bless you for your mercy and the grace let's go to deuteronomy chapter 11 we want to read from verse 13 deuteronomy chapter 11 verse 13 and it shall come to pass shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which i command you this day to love the lord your god and to serve him with all your heart with all your soul that i will give you the reign of your land in his due season the free stream and the lettering that thomas gathered in thy corn and i wine and i oil i will send grass and i feel for that i cuddle the dog means eat and be full take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived this is this is something you mean your heart can be received yes be received and you turn aside and serve other gods and worship him you could make your house a god you can make a wife a god you could make your car a god you could make your own pride of god you could make your own achievements of god yes you can make a chair in a god to live your life to your children you can make a job of god you worship that job so much and you don't even see retirement retrenchment coming all right take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived and you turn aside silver the gods and worship them and then the lord's wrath the kingdom against you and he shut up the heaven and there be no rain and the land yield not a fruit at least he perished quickly from off the good land which the lord gave at you therefore shall you lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul and bind them for a sign upon your hand that they may be frontless between your eyes and you shall teach them your children this is so powerful so when you absorb it when you receive it when it is active in your life then you could see the great need all god will say teach them your children speaking of them when those cities in thy house when the walkers by the way when no lies down when they're rises up those shall write them upon the to oppose something house upon thy gates that your days may be multiplied and the days of your children in the land which the lord sway unto your fathers to give them all the days of heaven upon years and if you shall diligently keep all the commandments which i command you to do them to love the lord your god to walk in all these ways to cleave unto him then will the lord drive out these nations from before you you shall possess greater nations and lighter than yourselves every place where upon the souls of your future tread shall be yours from the wilderness and lebanon from the river deliver your fruit is even until the uttermost shall be of course be there shall no man be able to stand before you for the lord your god shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that you shall tread upon as he said unto you behold i set before you this day a blessing and a cliff a blessing if you be the commandments of the lord your god which i command you this day and of course if you will not obey the commandments of the lord your god but turn aside out of the way which i command you this day to go after other gods which you have not known you want to turn to jeremiah chapter 14. i told you i'm going to give you a scripture rightly but we're going to get the flow of it jeremiah 14. i want to read from verse verse 10 of jeremiah chapter 14 all blessed be the name of the lord jeremiah 14 thus saith the lord unto these people does have they love to wander they have not refrained their feet therefore the lord does not accept them he will not remember their he will not remember their iniquity and visit their sins then the lord said unto me jeremiah pray not for these people for their good when they fast i will not hear their cry when they overburned offering an oblation i will not accept them i will consume them by the soul and by famine and by the pestilence then said i our lord god behold the prophets say unto them ye shall not see the sword neither shall he have funny but i will give you a short peace in this place this is jeremiah telling god that verse 14 listen to this then the lord said unto me the prophets prophesy lies in my name i sent them not neither have i commanded them neither speak unto them they prophesy unto you a false vision and designation a thing of naught and the deceit of their heart therefore thus fear the lord concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name and i sent them not yet they say sword and family shall not be this run by sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of jerusalem because of the famine and the sword they shall have none to bury them their wives nor their sons not their daughters for i will pour out their wickedness upon them lessons that we could take from this they are prophets pastors ministers that god has not sent that god have not spoken to that prophesy stuff from the deceit of their own heart god doesn't speak to them they prophesy false visions false revelations and and and god will judge that we are not the judge of that god will judge that but in the new testament and this is where we go to ephesians and ephesians 4 from the scripture but you can turn it and he gives some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers what for for the perfecting of the saints as i always say not for the glorification of no man any pulpit not for glorification of the minister what for the perfection of the saints one two work of the ministry and that's the ministry of jesus christ and then for the edifying of the body of christ as a body of jesus christ not just by not just you your local church okay but stating till we all come into the unity of the faith that's the object of all this ministry to get into the unity not of churches and groups but of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god onto a perfect man and then you get unto the measure of the statue of the fullness of christ why why do we need this why would you just measure the statue of the fullness of christ which is that maturity okay what is the purpose of that that answers in verse 14 that we henceforth been on our children tossed to and fro and carried a boat with every wind of doctrine by the sleigh of men and common craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive now this is pulpit guys okay with the doctrines with the slave with the craftiness the line with receive but speaking not lovely the truth but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is ahead in christ not only amplified it says this year so then we no longer be children talks like ships to unfold between chance gusts of teaching and wavering with every change in wind of doctrine they pray of the cunning and the cleverness of unscrupulous men gamblers engaged in every shifting form of trickery in inventing errors to mislead oh my hallelujah so we hitting something they will test newton's met now first corinthians chapter 3 we want to read from verse 18 very interesting scripture first corinthians chapter 3 reading from verse 18 let no man deceive himself let's stop right there so all jesus said let no man deceive you right so all this is prophet's son and other side outside no this is inside them let no man deceive himself you mean a man could deceive himself i think this is the worst deception let the man see himself if any man among you see not to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise 4 verse 19 the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god for it is written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and again the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they have been therefore let no man glory in men i wonder how much people see the scripture or no the script at all therefore let no man glory in men people find that beaten this number six heart but look the scripture says here let no man glory and men for all things are yours whether paul or apostles or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are yours and your christ and christ is god now it's from galatians chapter six reading from verse one so this is a sort of continuation of intelligence and paul presented this way brethren if a man be overtaken with a fault you with a spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness so paul is saying a brother backslid a brother in the condition he is he's he's fleshing out the approach in restoring someone okay so the approach in historians restoring someone is not that you so righteous and you're so up here and they don't dear and there's like a pity in them and you know i mean it was you he was gonna do so no no that's not the way brethren if a man be overtaken in a fall ye which are spiritual restore such a one how which but what we in the spirit of meekness considering thyself least thou also be tempted be one another burdens and so fulfill the law of christ now these are those i want to come to for if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing he deceive it himself let's read it again for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself in other words this person have a high opinion of themselves they give themselves a high return they tick themselves off his forces but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoiced in himself alone and not in another for every man shall be his own burden let him that is taught that is you the believers in the word communicate unto him that teach it that is the ministry in all good things so we're supposed to be able to get effective feedback from you who are hearing what is being taught okay there's a word for you that's the instructions let him that is taught that is you are hearing us tonight in the word communicate unto him that teach it in all good things verse 7 be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man saw it that shall he also read let's look at that galatian scripture in the amplified brethren if any man be overtaken in misconduct or sin of any sort you who are spiritual who are responsive to and controlled by the spirit should set him right and restore and reinstate him without any sense of superiority with all gentleness keeping an attentive eye on yourself at least you should be tempted also beer endure carriwana's burden and troubles moral force and in this way fulfill perfectly the law of christ the messiah and complete what is lacking in your obedience today for if any person thinks himself to be somebody too important a condition to shoulder another's load when he is nobody of superiority except in his own estimation he deceives and deludes and cheats himself but let every person carefully scrutinize examine and test his own conduct and his own work and he can then have the personal satisfaction and joy of doing something commendable in itself alone without resorting to boasting comparison with his neighbor this is a great scripture this is a tremendous scripture my goodness so therefore you know some people 10 years ago we know it your candle light don't sign brighter by blowing minds out so if you want to do two words and blow and blue and huff and puff and you know tearing somebody down doesn't build you up actually tearing somebody down is just evidence you are dumb you want to pull them down to where you are that is why you would be at them at them and so like that so what is saying there you don't have to feel security superior superior because you're comparing it with somebody else you're boasting because your car is better or your household line or whatever money or status or rank or whatever it is but you have to know in yourself what works are you coming through to do for every man should have the beer be equal to understanding and calmly receive his own little load of oppressive thought let him who receive instruction in the word of god share all good things with his teacher contributing to his support be not deceived undeluded unmisled god will not allow himself to be smeared at scorned disdained or mocked by mere pretensions or professions or by his precepts being set aside he inevitably deludes himself who attempts to delude god for whatever mind souls that i want to do he shall reap all blessed be the name of the lord so of all the deceptions i believe one of the worst ones is self-reception because when somebody's received by another person it's not like they they're going to be deceived that is like a kind of temporary session because you don't know you you're hearing things they believe in things and nothing like that you see but when somebody is self-deceived that is something different he is deceiving himself he wants to believe the lie he doesn't resist defeat he really collaborated with it against his own self he gives up the fight he enjoy being deceived that is somebody just self-received in other words to be self-received is to lie to yourself self-deception has to do with an over estimations of self-worth and i got this from the internet about self-deception defined and it have this year self-deception is the process and i'll skip that one subreception is defined as the act of lying to yourself of making yourself believe something that isn't really true an example of reception is someone who convinced herself or her boyfriend loves her even though he has told us several times you want to break up let's just get us off self-deception is seeing the world the way we wish it to be rather than the way it is and when people have self-description they use their hopes needs desires theory ideology prejudices expectation memories and other psychological elements that construct the way they see the world that is what's the reception all about not accepting the reality and it has here and you have a couple of signs but i just want to take away one or two signs you are lying to yourself you don't even know it one of them is your emotions don't match your words have you ever tried to convince yourself that you will not you and you were not hurt or angry but your emotions told a different story you have tears running on your face or steam coming out your ears even to do you see everything is fine your emotions may even cut you off guard you wonder where these tears come from and why you are so mad when your emotions do not match how you see or think you feel there's a good chance you are lying to yourself but one of the big ones that struck me was this one when you are not open to input from others often often there are times you don't even want to know or accept that you are lying to yourself you believe that what you believe is the only thing that matters therefore you shut out any commentary from outsiders you don't want the input different perspective or opinion this will only shine light on the fact that you are lying to yourself and forced you to own up to it learn to accept feedback from people and you know i think what sunday is talking about people sometimes they want things to confirm what they really have in their heart whatever they have in their heart they tend to connect with something out there but it's already in the system but this is the big one here you are never wrong no matter what happen it wasn't your fault even if it was your fault you convinced yourself that it was not the problem with people who they blame others they're not accepting anything and i know that the others in church we have it all around people you cannot accuse them of anything it's not me it's not me it's not me it's not me they blame everybody else by themselves but here the problem with that the problem with this is that you will never write your wrongs or learn from your mistakes you tend to repeat the same scenario over and over again with different people or places you lie to yourself because you cannot accept that maybe it is you but let me assure you it is you and that's okay you can learn from it you can grow so that is something that i got i thought would help um i've seen over the years people not changing and it's almost like if i went to the don't care but you know it's just just getting old because you're not learning and to learn is to grow and learning is when we could say you know i already make up i made a mistake i i i shouldn't have done that i shouldn't have said that moses and all come out big prophet moses said you know what god told me that i'm not going over crossing the land he was angry at me for your sakes i i play myself he told me speak to the rock and i smoked the rock and god was displeased with that okay so let's go down now to our text that we wanted to get to which is first corinthians chapter 10. praise the lord i want to get to that text first corinthians chapter 10. define it praise the lord that shall be the name of the lord fourth christian chapter 10 moreover brethren i would not let you be ignorant of how all our fathers were under the cloud and all paths to the sea and were all baptized into moses in the cloud and the sea and they'd all eat the same spiritual meat now notice here all baptized all eat same spiritual meat verse four and then all drink the same spiritual drink for the drunk of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ but with many of them god was not pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the ex in the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lost neither be idolaters as was some of them as is written the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to play neither let us commit fornication some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand knew let us tell christ some of them also attempted our destroy of serpents nina mumma yi are some of them also women are destroyed of the destroyer now all these things happen unto them for examples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come wherefore let him that think at his time to take heed at least he fall they have no temptation taking you let's back up a little bit in verse 12 wherefore let him that thinketh his standard ticket list before that applies from pulpit to backpack was the team they had no temptation taking you but such as is common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are evil but with the temptation also make a way of escape that he may be able to bear it wherefore my dear beloved free from idolatry so let's take some notes out of the scripture here that and and it was listed in a certain way to show all drunk or eat all baptized but god was not pleased with all i wonder if this same god this god of this scripture is to come around now how would this god see us i'm not talking about how you see yourself i'm talking about in the light of this scripture we all baptize we all in the message we all believe god's in our messenger prophet malachi 4 with a marian brown you know we all go to church and so on i wonder this god we're talking about that i'm saying you cannot take his word or his truth or his servants or the facts for granted and you know um there's so much voices today and verbal which i mentioned about the voice of god in the last days and it draws out the voice of god it does it does the voice and everybody is now like a professional everybody because they have youtube and facebook and their live stream live face and whatever it is and everybody could talk hey we have a mouth and we have a camera is there a phone it was a reporter everybody's a news broadcast and they have tick-tock now everybody making some click on some story and they wanted to go viral and everything else so it gives people in their homes and houses people like you don't know if this living under umbrella but they give them a voice as long as they have a sim card on the phone they could talk to the world and they could change from the entire world and depend upon where they present somebody take it up and share it and whatnot so all these activities get people so busy and caught up in social media and everything else and yet the bible said i am god and i change it not he does not change he is the same what we want what we need what we must connect with is the god of the bible and we have to see ourselves going back to the bible back to the scriptures to get in contact with this living god i think i think on sunday or sometime i was talking about could you imagine a minister with complexes he would have the complexes he would be really complex a minister with issues it would be dear it will be affecting the the clarity of the word and whatnot if you have certain fears he'll put those fears on the people which he ought not to because we are supposed to be like like mute we supposed to be like like a microphone we have no song of our own we supposed to be a channel by which god could speak to his people his word his truth not a channel that interprets it for the people to tell them nice things and three things and things that the people want to hear that is politics that is politician they they tell people things that people want to hear and they give promises that they can't keep and this scripture about to read right now is one that's astonished me it's from isaiah chapter 30 we want to read from verse one to three and then we will go down to eight to fourteen isaiah chapter three this scripture just blew me away description this is god speaking about his children woe should rebellious children see the lord that take console but not of me and cover with the covering but not of my spirit that they may add sin to sin that walk to go down into egypt and have that ask at my mouth to strengthen themselves in the strength of pharaoh and to trust in the shadow of egypt therefore shall the strength of fear will be your shame and the trust in the shadow of egypt your confusion so you want to go in the world you want to benefit you don't want to put god god take you from where you are and you don't heap god bring you from nothing god bless you and whatnot i know you your your strength is the strength of egypt no longer the strength of god let's recognize that same thing one going to eat with it god speak it now go write it before them in a table note in the book that it may be for the time to come forever and ever that this is a rebellious people lying children children that will not hear the law of the lord this is the one that blew me out which say to the seers see not unto the prophets prophesy not unto us right things speak unto us smooth things prophesy deceits wow i read that one again which season the seer see not unto the prophets prophesy not unto us writings speak unto us smoothings prophesy deceit this is a people that don't want truth they don't want truth firstly them get out of the way turn aside out of the part cause the holy one of israel to cease from before us wherefore thus saith the holy one of israel because he despised this word and trust in oppression and perverseness and stay there on therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall swollen out in a high wall who's breaking comments suddenly as an instant and he shall break it as the breaking of a potter's vessel that is broken in pieces he shall not spear so there shall be not be found in the boosting of it assured to take fire from the earth not to take water out of the pit and i want to read just with nine and ten in the amplified for this is a rebellious people faithless and lying sons children who will not hear the law and the instruction of the lord who virtually say to the seers by their conduct see not unto the prophets prophest prophesy not to us what is right speak to us smooth things prophesy deceitful illusions oh blessed be the name of the lord i'm going to church jeremiah chapter 29 i'm going to go back to jeremiah thus said the lord of hosts the god of israel jeremiah chapter 29 verse 4 unto all that carried away captives whom i have caused to be carried away from jerusalem to babylon building houses dwell in them plant gardens eat the fruit of them oh my hallelujah praise the name of the lord blessed be the new i think i'll leave a part the scripture but we'll continue okay but isaac read the scripture when he was preaching about 2 thessalonians 2 let the man deceive you that they shall not come except they have fallen away first the manners will be revealed now when it goes down further it says even him who's coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because you know why they receive not the love of the truth that they might deceive and for this cause god shall send them a strong illusion that they should believe a lie that they might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness but we are bound to give tongues always to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god hacked from the beginning choosing you to salvation through the sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth you have to see the truth as a living reality that god wants you to be part enough so i want to still let's see oh one second say things so they get it i still want to read a portion from this deuteronomy 29 verse 4 to 12. all right all right i'll i'll confident okay praise the lord so so for this scripture here though because they receive not the truth the love of the truth that they might be saying for this cause then go to send them a strong delusion to believe a lie and it amplified it says and by unlimited deduction to evil with all wicked deception for those who are perishing because they did not welcome the truth but refused to love it that they might be saved therefore god sends upon them a misleading influence a working of error and a strong delusion to make them believe what is false in order that all may be judged and condemned who did not believe in who refused to adhere to and trusting and rely on the truth but instead took pleasure in unrighteousness oh my hallelujah oh praise god i know what happened i think i peace and i cut the scripture in between another one so that's why i couldn't seem to find it but in in the to jeremiah 29 scripture it says here verse 8 for dust see that the lord of hosts the god of israel let not your prophets and your diviners that be in the midst of you deceive you neither happened to your dreams which you have caused to be dreamed for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name i have not sent them said the lord and i want to wrap up this last scripture as we close we are coming close i'll share some things hebrews 12 1 and 2. wherefore seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every wheat and the sin which that so easily beset us and let us run with patience to race that is set before us looking unto jesus the order and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endure the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god friends i want to bring this to you to as a warning i i believe that this is what i felt to do and lord wanted me to share this with you not i warning you this is a warning for all of us a warning that all come to this word and this message and so on but that does not mean all is going to go in and you have to make your calling an election show you have to work out your salvation with fear and trembling you have to know what level of respect you have for god for his word and his servants and just remember this a man could claim to be a servant when god had to make a man his servant his servant many men makes claims but as if god has vindicated those claims that they have made we say and preach it over and over about the virtues about the bond of perfectness charity commenters feel the whole thing and the prophecy when that time comes prophecy then they become vindicated sons and vindicated daughters we know the scriptures power as many receive him to them give me power to become the sons of god power to grow power to add we know the scriptures jesus grew in grace and knowledge and he knew that the judgment of god was going to be poured upon him because he had to pay the price of of our sins and that's what caravea is all about we know there's going to be a press come down we know that the bride will be a hundred persecuted group a lot of stuff is yet to unfold and we have to search ourselves out to see how ready we are how prepared we are when the slaughtering angels was about to be loosed and the voice said stop there's an incoherent writer and the voice said go and put a mark upon those that signed cry upon about the abomination that gonna be people that have the right kind of good those that sign and crying that's a hard thing that's not a head knowledge thing you know immaculate beast and this and that and logical sequence and so that is not that that is being marked to be sealed marked by the word marked because of your attitude what did the bible talk about cornelius nation the bible said there was a memorial in heaven for him with his arms given on his constant prayer he himself was a certain spirit and attitude he got the holy ghost before he was even baptized in water that is how right his heart was in terms of condition peter himself didn't know why god bring this invitation to him to go there peter didn't even know he had to unlock the keys to the gentiles that the holy ghost could be loose among the gentiles but he had us to do it and god didn't tell him the whole story peter got a corner from when you speak the word or fall no god didn't do that god let it unfold that peter could say of a truth this holy is not for us jews only all those that fear his name could receive the same holy ghost so friends let me encourage you tonight let us run this race with patience let us put aside stuff i hope and i trust tonight could be the first day of the rest of your life that is different that you catch a seed of how god sees things that you're not you do not ever fight you but over a fight and we see it and this understand that we talk about tree rooms on sunday humanistic divine revelation and vision we could leave out the last one for now which is vision but you see that one in the middle divine revelation you need it not divine understanding not not understanding revelation because revelation gets the clarity and the understanding the way god sees it i can't remember it was in the bible somebody was in some kind of condition and um you know the judgment of god pouring out and and and they take a javelin and kill the person that was in that filthy condition and stay the hand of god and god was pleased with it because they want righteousness and they have to understand it's not that god wants to pull judgment his law is it is almost like an automatic thing that sin will attract judgment of beat off key bad behavior bad attitudes have a fruit seen and unseen consequences but as i will say this with secondary consequences of your actions and your attitudes and sometimes people think they're so very right and they wouldn't pause and say but if i'm not right suppose i'm wrong wrong in my thinking because you can't change if your mind doesn't change that's why you have to know things that are in people's hearts that's why we don't try to bomb and beg and harass people and drag them in because a man convinced against israel is of the same opinion still so friends you have to have in your heart tonight a desire to serve god in the true spirit of how you supposed to serve it there are many too many people just going to church and going back home it doesn't have the effect upon their lives but many god was not pleased the word is not mixed with faith if you know you are doing things that are wrong stop it if you know you're going places that you not supposed to go don't go there if you know you have the wrong kind of friends you are more friends in the world than in church you know you have a problem you have more unbelieving friends than people who are christians you have a problem you actually have a problem because you feel more comfortable with these unbelieving friends than with christian friends and sometimes people adopt that because they don't want to be exposed they don't want to have a testimony generally because you see your unbelieving friends you in them and he sends them as you may know more and more scriptures and so on so you like a you like a star but among your peers you might really find out how much you already starring but that is how god have us sword clinging against sword shocking one another where we could encourage one another or we could build each other oh my hallelujah and i was thinking so much covert deaths among the churches among believers among trinidad among the world and i'm thinking to myself how is such a lonely road a lonely debt this discovery people dying of covert you know on a normal basis when somebody dying you could have the family along the bedside you know little pronouncements and so on aunt quinn grandmother mother father whoever but with this school victim when somebody have covet there's no visit it's a lonely thing it's not like you're getting a visit from a loved one and somebody's saying farewell god bless you nothing like that everybody have to keep the distance because it's just sin contagious contagious you know unbelief is contagious yeah when those 10 spies came back and they said to the people we we speak we none of the good man and and we cannot take it that anointing that disease that that virus those twelve ministers bro those ten ministers broke when it dropped on on the people they they it take them when caleb come with some kind of inoculation to tell them you know what we are well able let's cooperate once it was too late it was too late and gold got angry look at god's position now let's listen i'm gonna close look at god's position 400 years waiting unless people to cry out to begin to cry he sent moses he releases power to deliver them he bring them out he gave them water he gave them food they journeyed the wilderness the wilderness was not the test the wilderness was just trying to get rid of egypt they come out of egypt but egypt's still in them he knows that and god give them time to see if he could get not often and forgive forget the things that are passed and i'm gonna press towards the mark i'm going to i'm going to see a new one i'm seeing a new land i mean food milk and honey i'm going to what's that okay they had their challenges along the way they couldn't plant nothing in in the wilderness that's not the land here they come at king spania here they come at the junction here they come let's see 2022 here they come they come to a place with a junction a junction in which the next move has to be a move of god the next move have to be uh if we can only get started god will do the rest and here it is god so you know what fellas all the very tribes send me their ministers their man of god five four ministers they claim to be let them go help spout their land bring back evidence to my people not my people it's not them they are not staring they have to bring evidence to vindicate that god is god to prove he's alive to prove he's not going to keep his promise and here it is they're going out and they come back and they come back yes the grapes is good and is good we see giants did the giants see you no we we didn't see us but we were like graspers through those guys when joshua and caleb came back they were astonished the place in mourning the place all dark dismal they had no anointing there's no worship there's no thanksgiving there's no praise there's no atmosphere that's almost insulting god came to stood up and said we are well able to take it and when they finish their drama god say you know what all of them 40 years judgment the same people that came out judged the same people that came out they had books they had tapes they had services they had the prophet moses they had specials they had singing they had some such inspiration and all of that and they perished because they failed to go on and faith to believe what god had said and god told them that generation not going to make it that is what the wilderness was about that is what the was about that a new generation could be raised up a new people in the land dear children so god is not only interested in what is in front of him he's interested in the next generation what we share with our children what we share with our family what we share to each other positive or negative they are positive people they are negative people negative type people you don't want to be around i don't want to be around them no i want people of a spirit and an attitude like how they said caleb yeah that's another spirit with him you want people that would encourage you that would be supportive of you getting closer to god and fellowship with god and if you're truly in fellowship with god you will find yourself in fellowship with each other let's follow him almighty god i thank you lord for this time and i know it's a lot of scripture it might just sound like if we just read and read and read and read and but it's your truth it's your word many times we may not even go in the old testament and study a while lord we have seen from the scriptures prophets and men who claim that you that you sent them and you did not you yourself said you didn't you speak to them they got things from their own spirit their own mind they prophesy lies you didn't even send them but yet they are dear speaking to your people but god you promise that your elect in the last days will not be deceived father i didn't go down deep in it but lord it have self-deception and you talk about a man who thinking himself higher than he's supposed to think of himself and you spoke this in another scripture believe his philippians let no one think of himself higher than he's supposed to be and people think themselves above this above that they don't want to humble themselves they don't want to follow instructions they want to take guidance they want to govern and rule their own lives and you allow them to do that and if they continue along that road god is even a greater deception ahead help us lord to connect with the spirit of truth because jesus himself said you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free free lives here today lord may they not stay in the backseating condition business stay in that lukewarm condition and most of all may they not stay in iniquity iniquity is knowing to do right and not doing anything about it father help them tonight may your blood speak on their behalf and deliver them help the parents in this room lord parents and men them got married young and they got old and they try their best with their children without the tools without the means without the know-how and because of their spiritual attitude they have not received and learn and grow to direct and to give and to lead and to bring the kind of needed instructions in their home and families and no son one way daughter one way cheering this we and that we and this troubled father but all tonight do you forgive may you cleanse do you restore may you infuse a fresh vision of fatherhood motherhood a fresh vision of how we could give support lord the bible talk about let the older woman teach a younger woman how to love their husbands and because the older woman some of them never got debris to their own self they can't even teach because they don't even know what to teach and how to teach but lord raise up women raise up people that could participate learn and grow that they could help others if ever there was a time of people needing help and support is this time years ago without all this financial burden of home and mortgage and whatnot sisters are mostly home husband working bringing in the money and sisters feeling about the children it was different life was so much different but now two people have to work to pay the mortgage pay the rent do this do that it's tough times like you said perilous times shall come but lord you have released a power a power that could give us knowledge wisdom understanding you give us a word you give us ministry you give us bible class bible studies it gives us preaching and teaching that we could apply to ourselves and see our lives change father may you do something special tonight release a special anointing of the scriptures upon your people that they will have a burden to dig deeper to go further to drive floor and listen again not to a man but with your voice and your voice is your word and your word is the scriptures take us right back to the bible where every issue and every problem and every challenge could get the answer bless them tonight bless the service tomorrow night they'll be streamed and bless the permitting on the day of prayer and fasting on this coming friday and jason we ask it amen i mean god bless you saying thank
