he is multitasking I'm your hand with God is good even so we wonder Stan I want to read a scripture on this yes on the before he comes on from 1st Peter chapter 1 and we want to also read from Philippians chapter 3 I believe it is it was up to two rather so reason first Peter chapter 1 read in verse 1 the 11 Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to the strangers scattered wrote Pontus Galatia Cappadocia Asia be near elect according to the foreknowledge of God Father through sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ risen to you and peace be multiplied blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which had according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible undefiled and feed not away reserved in heaven for you oh praise the name of the Lord praise God thank you Jesus let's go to Philippians chapter 2 reading from verse 1 the eleven if there be any therefore consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfilling my joy that she be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord and of one mind that nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves praise God not every man on his own things but every man also lit things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who been in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in a fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross and we forgot that I highly exalted him and give him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow on things and heaven things and in earth things under the earth that every tongue should confess to Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God may God bless his word you may be seated oh praise His name let us say the name of the Lord ah hallelujah blessed be the name of Jesus the Bible talk about the cluded with humility be humble one to another isn't that right so this morning I just have something I'd like to share with you about humility but Brian was talking about our the privilege in my life of meet and greet men it's remarkable to notice how things can be I've met men that was greet men and when I met men that thought they were great men there's certainly a lot of difference in them a great man will always not be a stuffed shirt and he will try to make you think that you are the great man and he is nothing and the man that is nothing trying to be great it's just the other way and that's the reason I know that Jesus was the son of God he came to earth without even having a place to be born he had to borrow room he had to borrow a manger he had to come to a borrowed womb he went to aboard Greaves the Foxes are then the birds of the air has nests but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head yet the king of glory the God of heaven made flesh birth among us and that is what made him big that is what meet him by we he was his humility humility the way daang is always the way up the way up is long and he will humble himself will exalt Jesus met with men of all walks of life he met in great circles one time he met with thousands five hundred at once twelve at once three at once even will come to one that makes him great because not even one person kind of a call on him but what he will be right there at their side that is what make him God because of his humility Elijah he stayed with God in such a way Kilgore was pleased the Sendong is that spirit is not right God loved that spirit I was upon that simple uneducated woodsman from back there in the woods somewhere it was so obedient to the word that he could say you I do this and I will do it and God hid himself India in such simplicity that old crank don't have nothing doing him but one day when he got all his head was born his whiskers hanging down grief you hear he had hanging over his shoulders his there those skinny arms and a meat flopping like that come walking on the route of Samaria and that eyes looking towards the skies with crooked stick in his hand he wasn't very much to look at but he had dust here the Lord for this be and the bride will have thus saith the Lord he didn't stammer he didn't stutter he didn't say no greedy hab he walked on and said not even Jew will fall from heaven till I call for his God had honored his simplicity now you see while in that simple way everybody against him anyway that is true all the Ministerial Association everything else without is true that's true trying to get rid of him everything else but in that simplicity even though he had no cooperation with his campaigns whatever more everybody thought he was a crank God was higher than himself but when it comes here you when it comes time for that seed to get right that has been planted God manifested himself by selling Scioto heaven and looking up the sacrifice God hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself in the same all of her greetings God you say God he speaks of great big things he will come and you do this and do that I will catch what I'm saying it will pass right over the top you never seen it God lives in simplicity to manifest himself in greatness I love that God lives in simplicity to manifest themselves and simple in greatness that is what makes him great because he can simplify himself that's why the Bible talk about Habakkuk right the vision and make it plain that he that readeth may run not right the vision and make it more mysterious because that was what spurred and he was too mysterious and he wanted to reveal themselves that is why he released Jesus right and Christ is the mystery of God revealed Word made flesh Oh hallelujah have the word become flesh that invisible God will become visible and would be seen through your flesh that's why the word must become flesh Oh blessed be the name of the Lord praise God blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah fries Gordon or skip down something you know other story but environmental please and so this girl another drill twelve years old and one of us foot was shorter than the other one and she was all crippled up and so on he said sorry for her and she came up to him and hold his jacket and cried and whatnot and he couldn't talk as a language and she said Jesus cried heal you but you couldn't understand what he was saying and what not and then he was doing this prayer line and then it was about finished and Jesse felt led to tell them continue on call some more numbers and so half now after he say call for some numbers that number came up and was the girl so he was describing and I thought she was the next number and here she comes she was just smiling you know wanted to talk in front she was smiling you know trying to get to me and I said did interpreter just see what I see she said all right brother branham I said you are going to see something already took place no while she left after she was crying and and hold on to his jacket and so on he saw a vision of a walking so she knew she was healed depletion saw her walking she was here and she didn't know yet what does the vision say about you my you should be streaming that's why the vision is so important not your condition division not your division not your cancer division not your sick division not you around the vision knock you in prison division what does the vision be the vision say I am free presently I am healed the vision day I have delivered that's what the vision faith and then you're going to walk into the vision okay let's continue so he said I said you want to see something already took place I said sweetheart he was a girl that I met me a while ago she nodded a little head as the interpreter spoke I said listen listen is that I want to get to your respect to Jesus Christ you're you approached in the right manner that's a lot of times the way we Americans don't get anything we don't come to God reverent enough we just know more or more about it God lives in humility and simplicity so I said God rewarded you honey he healed you oh dear and I want you to go over there and sit down and get some man to unbuckle these breezes and things from a wrong view and let your little hand set on your hip so her foot one foot was dangling and the brace was balanced in it and the next foot and so on so we had one foot shorter than one all in braces he said just go and sit down there I'm right you can let your little hand set on your hip and just as they bring the braces off let your little hand slide down your leg just as far as your leg is short and I said no you do that over there then show me and then I call the next one and Holy Spirit was showing the vision when the vision was going on I heard her scream and yes she come across the floor crutches in her hand braces overhead screaming at the top of her voice right up the steps she went right down and across up the other way appear feet barely running as hard as he could she was perfectly normal and well because I respect and love the Jesus Christ brought his blessings down upon her [Music] all right let me seize it so now you have no excuse for your arrogance for your pride you call you forget nothing you have no excuse me noise toy key puzzle on unit when know what I'm talking about but you know I talking about hallelujah no excuse for that now because Jesus he he retorted not robbery to be equal with God he took on the form of a servant and he humbled himself and became obedient in a punch no I'm not talking about humble because you're in sin and you're walking because you had condemned again I'm not talking about that I'm not talking because I ascended above grace did much more BOM I'm not talking about that I'm talking about humbling to God and when I could humble to God they can humble demand you could be loaded with humility and put on humility of an apron something you wear come on Arthur Miller something you put on this one you wasn't born with this you were born in sin come in the world speaking lines you were born with your pride in your love my stealth that we talk about that to yourself everybody want to be somebody but you want to be somebody I've got to be a dual body I'll get the Lord I shout in a house liquor fear the prestress moment hallelujah humility very difficult virtue is already get into because the biggest sin really is pride because act what confronted this angel was the son of the morning named Lucifer this is all before he was Satan he said I will arise I will be like the most I I will sit on the condition among Hamby worship and pride is what was this curse he wasn't able to Humble himself God at the key mode notice what he told Eve you shall be like God but forget that each of every G is a god no if you either back if you shall be like Austin or things that's what's the promise you be like a good and he tap into that desire that is the man with Eve as he fell also we are confronted with pride and the humility that produces seed because genuine humility believes the dead you'll never see with Leto obedience to God is not humbly walk with the schola then also your Hamid a number like on virtual the local the false humility stop walking human see we don't matter humility that brings you in obedience to the word obedience and structure to Christ hallelujah humility dictionary meaning a mother's or love you a one own importance in here to email or the Atlantic I think that other it is again hopeful with you humanity a mother's or low view of one's own importance humility true humanities brings a part to death Oh My blessed be the name of humility must lead to die to self and things you're going to confront you to see if you humble the Bible said be closes with humility hallelujah humble to one another is not right praise God and I realize that if you get home before God oh how did you say I'm sorry forgive me I was wrong praise God I am responsible for the Hat you're not making excuses you're not defending this big ol excelsior born and grew up

therefore I will not destroy them I will grant them some deliverance and my rats are not be bottled upon Jerusalem by Hannah she shocked nevertheless they shall be his servants that they may know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries so she shocked king of Egypt came up against rusev um took away the treasures of the house of the cloth the treasures of the king's house he

the king's house and when the King entered in the house of the Lord that God came and fetch them and brought them again into the gas chamber and when he humbled himself the wrath of the Lord turned from him that he will not be destroyed him together and also in Judah things went well this is a scriptural example of when somebody humble themselves and God sees God sees that they humble themselves

appreciate the words of the pastor this morning amen how many appreciated service last week drive them out amen what a message what an annoying thing so I greet you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ wish me a great privilege and honor to be in the house of God and I'd like to go straight to the word if you have your Bibles would you turn with me to two portions of Scripture you want to read from the book of Ephesians and when we read from the book of Jude through scriptures this morning thank you musicians thank you for the Gideon for the worship this morning amen to Ephesians chapter six and reading from verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might so it's not even your might and your strength is not your strength but your strength is in the Lord finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins Girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all taking the shield of faith where it you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God and really from Jude reading from chapter one reading verse three Jude 1:3 beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the scene as can rip our heads for a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we thank you this morning to be in your house we thank you for your know anything that's already here we thank you for your presence father we thank you for your grace your love your mercy towards us we thank you for your word that is life to us it is our breath is our strength is our bread it's our water it's our songs our sauce it's up it's our encouragement is when we can't go any more we can look at the word and be encouraged father because there's power in the word is healing in the world your prophet taught us Raptor and his league in the word is in the message Lord there's power in the messages of vindicated messages of vindicated worded it needs no more vindication it's already vindicated it's already real it already pushed back the devil every single time and Lord we come this morning to apply to with our lives may you walk other pages of the Bible may you anoint me on fresh father Lord my body is under pressure but father in your presence Lord there is no problem there's no challenge there's no obstacle there's no tiredness there's no sickness there's no pain there's no heart ache there's no trial there's no test there's no temptation polymer it all it away this morning in your presence and may you speak to your people may you search every heart every life may you minister to every father every mother every daughter every son every brother every system in you break the chains and break the yolks and break the bands of wickedness Lord as your word taught us through the scripture we wrestle not against flesh and blood but there are principalities and their powers but your word give us a solution you will give us a way out your work give us a way to overcome battle so Lord this is a message this morning for the over may you speak to us me you take me out of the way may you speak with the air to your children not not my boss at my word not ever for five minutes or one hour you owe me you deliver your people probably the ones that just have but we want to have results of people don't have Church we want to have a reality an experience with the supernatural and a counter with a pillar of fire may you touch everyone and I'll miss it in the back slide and a hosted a long media you know maybe they are backslidden on the outside maybe they are fasting on the inside Lord as nobody knows there's a problem on the inside if you want to turn it over this morning and say Lord may you restore your people may you lift your people up though there are people in the house this morning a lovely joy but may restore their joy because the joy of the Lord is our strength and we can't fight if we don't have strength of faith Lord in the midst of it you said let the weak say that I am strong though father may you strengthen the weary me you lift up the feeble hands Lord and know there are many people came this morning didn't get the greatest morning it's a shame so we thank you for your brother know they'll cover the past and

there's no place for sin this morning forget about your passive don't even let your mind go to it God call you key and someone's gonna finish it [Applause] you may be seated I still don't know what's happening this morning but for a title put on the whole armour of God for a subject earnestly contend for the faith that was past tense restored by Malachi 4:5 six inspiration warriors of defeat and I told / I want to follow his message of drive them out because you can't drive them out in your own strength you can't drive them out in your own ability you can't drive them out with your idea and your way but the Bible says in Ephesians finally my brethren after you've listened to everything I've said already Paul is in finally this is the big point everything I said is important but finally I don't want you to forget this thing my bedroom be strong in the Lord that alone made me feel good because sometimes I don't feel strong in myself I throw my wife this morning I said yes that felt so sick that I felt physically down I felt emotionally dumb I feel mentally Tom I said the only thing was standing was my testimony I said the only thing I didn't know is backslide because I felt so low in my body so low in my mind so low emotionally but my testimony what still standing and it's not my testimony in his testimony because he for the word seen a German a part of himself inside of us to make sure that you are here this morning to make sure that you can worship up to make sure that when the word goes forth you hear your name is it that's me you are preaching to me you are talking to me how did the minister know what I was going through it's because the word is your name Oh [Applause] maybe halleluyah halleluyah so we are continuing to try them out no place for the enemy we are not taking prisoners we're not trying to work a deal out we're not trying to negotiate there is no negotiation there's no compromising there's no let's see what we can work out there's only three we'll drive them out we are pushing back the attack of the enemies since the prophet left brother branham spoke of all kind of spirit that were operating in his day and operating in his meetings you know the Prophet said sometimes he loved to go by himself because even within the church people would be saying god bless you but he was he the fourth in their hearts um and realized that they were not with him they were seeing the words with the amounts but they were not sincere and because he saw that even if you don't want to see it all the time it was too much for him the hypocrisy was too real the hypocrisy was too troublesome for him to the probable pull himself away but it's coming a time when there will be coherent there will be a singularity what your mind and your heart says will be the same thing what your mouth is and what your heart says will be the same things because nothing will be hidden we are moving in a season and time because in the book of acts of the talk it was people that they were talking to so when people hear what Ananias had he didn't lie to me you like what are holding us up because the Holy Ghost already went on the inside and see what's going on so we are in another Ephesians we are going to have a super church we're gonna have a church without sin we're gonna have a children where you could have made a mistake a bit but before you even sit down you run to the Ella and say pray for me because the Holy Ghost will be so real it will call them send out the church we're gonna have a perfect Church we're gonna have a Ephesus church we'll have another Ephesians up we will have a search of that what a benefits about Erica is five people if it's ten people is it's 20 people the numbers and that important at all because wanna work with the thousands of life who represents thousands of life free will put a hundred thousand subs right brother I just need a few more people to save this island to save this country the state as well you may be seated hallelujah give me liberty or give me death I want Liberty I want reality I must be free to come to the house of God and worship it cannot be that I leave Church on Sunday and between Sundays by Thursday have lost the victory by Friday I'm not feeling myself there must be a time when it's a permanence of character and it's a permanence of heat there must come a time when you are so solid in Christ as the Bible said he that overcometh will i make a pillar in the tabernacle and he will go no more out that's coming a time when you overcome and you overcome and then you become like a rock but a wind blows you don't move the storms come you don't move the Bible says you are fella in the tabernacle hello in the house unmovable unshakable nothing could move you because I've been grounded and established by word and by experience by revelation and power by blood on fire what was this morning so make a church with make a revival that suicide amphitheater seven thunders of history and made me practice I'm counting down to the date when the cripples are walking here we won't even have to pray for them buddy anointing but they all over the filling the place milky white condensate band for eyes but afterward good spot people taxes make [Applause] halleluyah halleluyah you may be seated got to do anything Caleb I haven't seen you in a while but it just takes five minutes in the presence of God the tone over 40 years of Moses for 40 years Moses have lost his way but 40 years Moses was just there in utero but he will have no prayer he was not convinced he was not concerned enough he knew there was something about his life but he needed an encounter he needed an account of with something bigger than himself of it bigger than what his wife could speak to him speaking on what his name look at it bigger than what a path like a safe and when he saw the bun and push the burning bush the only purpose you may be seen it that a burning bush served up what the attract his attention and God does many things from it a trap book interrupt you to get your attention and he doesn't need your pencil for long he just needs five minutes he does needed 182 hours but convince you because it's power connected as seen in you because that we'd call it at a deeper there's a deeper responder so even in Moses back to decondition there was something you was a year and for the assumed he was looking for that's why we nice water fire that I returned asylum I will go up because I'm looking for something I don't know what I'm looking for but it's a birth in my soul get the meter you may be seated and the only reason you could be in the house of God this morning is because there's a thirst there is a need there is a desire there's something in you that's calling for something there's something and you have needing something and we try to fill it with all kinds of stuff and the devil is good he is very good a China philosopher with all kind of stuff you may be seen god help us smooth for the reason you are here this morning it was no matter what the stuff is you have tried and how you spend your time you will never go to bed at night satisfied because God put the fish in there and the music and books and positive self-talk and positive affirmations and saying I'm a believer even seeing a man a message till doesn't quench the sense because the message coming to church the routine and the ritual that's all up here people program themselves to wake up on a Sunday morning to come to church people program themselves etc I'm in the morning it's a program that your honor but quarters and about programs these are about routines I'm little bit rich you are then about customs about whatever you want to do is serenity he could meet you on the road to Damascus of rehna team falling on the road for the do damage I'm going to interrupt him on a horse I'm going to be more than with a fireable gotta meet Elijah in a rustle of the mulberry trees got to meet you anywhere you could be driving on the road you could be on your Java but you've got to be listening you've got to be looking for him you've got to be wanting him and you've got to recognize that he is the one that you are missing her eNOS help somebody this morning finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might his might put on the whole armour of God so it's no good to put on part of the armor and before you could even put on the armor you have to take off whatever you're wearing before you can put on his armor you have to take off what you are wearing there's a same naked in the world we come a naked believe and what you wear is your character what you wear is your bias your your feelings your way of doing things your way of resolving conflict your own perspectives your your history some of us who wear this I've done it this way for five years I don't talk to people at all and I like to talk to people I don't and that's what we're wearing you can tell going to like to talk to people because when God told Peter go and talk to this one he couldn't say I like to talk to so whatever you are wearing you have got to take it off to put on his armor put on the whole armor of quarters we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil the tactics of the devil the recommendations of the devil the barrister we are ignorant of Satan's devices devices we're not ignorant of his attack Cena's planted strategy and use very good and the Bible goes on will for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places and I share this in Nigeria I heard another preacher speak about this and he said no we're from Genesis to Revelation do you find demons arguing with one another in fact when Jesus was on the earth and he was healing the sick and doing miracles those ignorant Pharisees and the people said it's by the power of Beelzebub that Jesus is doing this I'm Jesus say listen a house divided with never stood in other words the devil is smarter then allowing division in his own kingdom so his soldiers marched together so when Jesus met the man with Legion he acted who you are as a legion they were working in how many multiple spirits but I'm an attorney when you cook for one demon he goes to get back up come up with seven more that if you don't clean up the house he's going to come back with more strength because he knew it took a power to clean amount what about the Church of the Living God we cannot be divided we cannot be separated it cannot be husband against wife and are against son and church against church and opted against Papa we have got to stand united as one army because the enemy is united as one on me but it was console of the soul of that's why we're the branham's head of iphone ministry we'll help each one packing one another because we need each other it's enemy's gonna come from every side but if we put solar persona and back to back the devil is finished and the church payment Oh hallelujah what are you doing preacher we're going to expose the devil at every one of his tricks you're going to expose them because listen the devil could only operate if he is hidden but if you expose him he has to find somewhere else to go [Applause] anybody with me this morning one key is hidden he could operate but the mother is a light and open the cupboard and and lip up the bed and final way is and expose him he cannot be exposed he has to one find somewhere else behind that's why when Jesus came to that man who they call Legion and he could expose his elephant send me somewhere sent me to the pigs because I can't stay there no more he has been exposed he has been identified and we are going to shine light in every room of your house because once the light goes on the delicate I have no more and he has got to get out and once the devil get out won't that snake us out there's no room but a Holy Ghost of Hell every house the bell every room because there and all kind of live in the same house of unbelief and it cannot live in the same house life and that just cannot live in the same house [Applause] Oh blessed be the name of the Lord everybody feelin fine I'm just waitin on him this morning I have different notes but he is seeing something this morning to help you today it's exactly two months away from our convention and we have a responsibility we have a responsibility to be prayed up we have a responsibility to be under expectation we have a responsibility to fast and call upon God because there is no shortcut there is no other way to do it there's only one way and that his way and no revival comes without sacrifice nothing worth having comes without sacrifice and when you can appreciate that and understand that it changes your perspective enough it changes your perspective completely you want success in the natural there is no success without sacrifice [Music] you can live any life you want but if you want what people who work hard yet there's no shortcut to working out there people who work it you know what the day for five years and when you see them is like it successful until you are ready to do it you know it is you not ready yet and if people in the natural could do it you know what is for a purpose that they have in the app to achieve what about this virtual how much brain must we do to have good success most meditation once we do to have good success how much talking to God must we do to get him to operate on our behalf and to move things on our behalf because whenever you get into his business he's not to take care of your business my god so my message the total deliverance then just like you if you are a Christian God don't make any halfway Christians God makes complete Christians God don't make half we're preachers but the preacher can be halfway and God makes his children Christians but sometimes they're halfway Christians it's not good intentions them to be that way is their own ways got mixed up with a plan of God for their life and that's what makes them the way they are God don't want to be halfway Christian or halfway preachers compromising on either side so that compromising that giving back room for the devil to operate that's what we are going at this morning to drive them out completely Louie so brother Brandon proclaim the message let me just touch my text a little bit and see what God will do for the next few minutes proclaim the message of salt message to call the bride to war this Messer was the places in another Ephesians and I connect it to another occasion because but it's even rich a masterpiece I believe two Sundays ago about possessing your inheritance and burped over followed it with try the amount placing us in Joshua and we know from the word at Joshua and Ephesians are parallels of each other I wanted to pick it up from the Ephesian side so this message about a random brought what's the paces in another use Asians or said another way to place us into the land of the inheritance the land of promise the holy ghost land and divide the inheritance to us because each of us have our own inheritance each of us have our own place each of us have our own position and it's only in your piece or your position you could properly defend yourself when you are on your territory you have a right to defend yourself when you are on your property you have a right to protect your families when you are on your territory you have a right to do what you have to do because it's yours and this word team to let you know what is yours this word came to let you know that healing is yours this word in to let you know that the Holy Ghost is yours and once you know it's yours is put you in a position to fight for what is yours or you cannot be in the club and Piper something in the club speaker a cop is not yours you can be your open world music and fight for that because that's not yours but when you are in the will of God you can fight recklessly fighter because when you are in his will he is obligated to back you up in this world with a random talk on that Jesus is Authority was different his position when you are in your position the position brings with it a certain Authority you embassy determine the authority that comes with position has nothing to do with your standing the authority that comes with your position has not lose your standing I'll give you an example a police officer could be a corrupt police officer but when he wears the police officer uniform and tells you to stop the fact that his corrupt doesn't take away the authority he has to tell you to stop because his authority is based on his position [Applause] the Prime Minister of the country could be crazy but that doesn't change the fact because he holds the position here the authority to speak an acident bacon when you are in your position a competent authority know what the devil wants to do that that you're standing you want to tell the police officer you made a mistake yesterday so forget the uniform but get the backup because a police over like a pig miss radio and see a backup wanted but it devil says don't touch the radio forget your uniform because you made a mistake last week you made a mistake yesterday don't look in the mirror because if you look in the mirror you will see you have on the uniform don't look in the mirror because you will see you resemble the rest of people who make things happen that's what the devil does but if you look at the mirror of the world you can see that maybe you're not where you're supposed to be but your polish you have a gun on your head in the radio for backup you might be tired but don't let the devil do you make the mistake of console radio and sometimes Angelica pick up the radio that's the tougher gun because we're the gun you can take on one maybe two or three for the radio he does that I can call legions of support you know what armies I can call for them but you may be seated what do you say about Isaac there's some wounded Eagles in here this morning but being wounded has not taken off your uniform you may be wounded this morning what's that seeing wounded because battle has you scarred sometimes you get shot in this arm and this I don't know on oil sometimes that's what I write this by the way but that's the enemy's Java just kind of pull it your way what your uniform is get on maybe you lost the helmet give you but this morning but back on the whole armor of God so you can stand against every attack of the enemy [Applause] you may be seated and the Bible says having done all but a Clarence's and stand having at all after you've done all you can still send when you're tired you notice a when you are the end of the Rope you have in heaven we near the end of the rope tie a knot and hang on when at the end repair not and how long after you have done that system after you have exploded not in every door still the best haven't done all the time and you know why because backup is on its way you know how many walls people didn't think we're gonna be one and if they wore the line hold the line it's really three of us remaining the thousand hold the line backup is on the way somebody same I pray that it helps somebody this morning and every day you are in the word and the word becomes more real to you it brings clarity to your position it brings clarity to your purpose it brings clarity to what you wake up in the morning to do because when you have purpose and clarity it focuses your actions when you don't know what you are supposed to do you do 82 things that are not important an activity doesn't mean you're doing someone as relevant don't even is very goes in there people in jobs doing a lot of stuff that's not relevant just activity but the people I'm here to here the move from here to here but isn't here to here between here he's here if he is is he here how was work today work was good I did a lot of stuff activity not relevant how does it contribute to the profits I don't know does it add revenue I don't know what do you do over the cash but if I'm here is here but soon he is with me why because my boss to me put it from here to here and when I'm done putting me into here so it has to what activity we wonder when we walk with walking with direction and purpose that's when you pray in a Brainerd rambling be praying with purpose because you're praying with revelation of what to ask for so the way God taught us to pray say you princeless our Father who art in heaven first you stop and worship hallowed be thy name it's a structure God give you the formula for success our Father hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done you haven't asked anything just yet you are giving them worship honor glory acknowledging your authority you're talking to thy kingdom come Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven when you establish his authority on anything I'll give us this day our daily bread and you begin to get into your requests but when you are when you approach it in a better balanced workable approach to God it can be your way it must be his way when you approach it right then you can get into a spirit of the Lord be the spirit of this day and so what you need requests what you need and see God makes it happen because your approach is right a mature CMM and just helping anybody this morning I'm going is more concerned about your attitude than your action very estate again God is more concerned about your attitude then your action are you willing you're doing it but you're not doing it willingly somebody asked you to help them you had them but you hate her them grudgingly yeah anyone to help them I know but you have them because they know you're Christian and they ask Anya so whatever testimony area you want to give it man actually fur coat you give me a cloak - yeah I'm the one what one might even - maybe we were walking next to mine nobody can say it did walk actually but if you way you walk the extra mile you walk next to my effects so as far as you consider nobody could penalty he doesn't go the extra mana no but go on the scene is hid away his approach his attitude that's why the Bible speaks about David's men Diddley desires their command it was the way they approached they had so much respect for the man of God now when he's not as they were ready to move it means I wasn't command to them I said it as willingly so he wanted a drink of water they cut through the filling time because I know he wants a drink of water and when David saw how willing the or he said he could even drink the water he taught us sacrifice to the Lord because the attitude of his men so how about it you'd be to the kingdom and to the things of God it's a marvel to me because we're talking about warfare I'm talking about warfare me to talk about being in the army of the Lord and anybody was exposure with the Caliph or army or military there are lots of rules and standards and regulations and there's a lot of training because they're people you know the people who are in the army who never went to war and watched not they can imagine because salute take a do Organa but they never went to war but in the army their focus on the training because you never know when you call into action but the difference with us is we are in a war so there's no mass mass mass after when your trainer given a gun and your Center two one fight just go and fight fight kill something kill or be killed if you let that diabetes get you or you get it is your choice because here is my verities and my see either you clean it or you push it back this morning I'm sending it back every morning you get a diabetes your finish a brightness your village cancer your finish every day you have the tags on a rose you have keep it on on the robes you put it on the rope you're letting go as the day goes on this headache has got to go by sighs I am healed what is that work there that warfare you may be seated so you mean you mean to tell me they are sick people in here who don't put pressure on your sickness really that's what what is your cheering a pathogen and you don't clean them every day you're not serious you really wanted to come back but war fear me the devil must know you serious every day every single day Lord I clear my current against them take your hands off my children [Applause] every day but when you are complete and concerned it becomes easy to breathe because you know what you're praying for whenever I'm talking to take adopted son to travel to Philistine so how to do it it tastes heavily I'm a writer Jeph beside the kemacite and you're ready for Philistines if you're not any disruption father you have to adopt me whatever it takes and these are making guys mrs. Bates adoption today day every day like that so you want to get it full size to do the draggable - somebody's Haven you may be seated so that's how you declare war on the enemy you declare war in your house every day every day the Lord I claim my prayer lines or give me a burden for prayer locking me a pudding for praise you Anna Massey you're waiting on a taxi but you declare non you declaring war we're like the devil's with a room any of mine because you're always on the offensive they don't need to defend anymore because it has push them destroying Greene is you just ran palms you want me attack every time I tell us use it as it has to be an easier target yeah after so many easier because but it was always on the attack but is it always on yeah that's how we must be put on the whole armor of God and write them out I pray this helps some money in him because I know many people here apply the token and people don't know what to do [Music] but you know what the Prophet said he said when you apply the token you take the word yourselves you believe every word you act upon every word you claim every word and when you do that is then the devil knows you mean business and God also knows that you mean business so as a church can be pledged to be on the offensive from there there's anybody here this morning from this day on you will be on your senses from this day on you'll be in prayer from this day on you'll be in worship and commitment and dedication because that's what it takes a see result in your home in your life in the church on your job you see doors open up to you you don't even expect to open up because you're noisy all over you all around you Jesus himself had to pray the keep in that atmosphere because prayer keeps you in an atmosphere it's impossible I said if some reason is impossible to get up and pray and I'm going to argue with your wife that is too big of a leap it's too big is it there's a way off it's impossible to go from prayer to want to argue a divorce but when you are not anointed then you see things differently here as the past is not against flesh and blood is that you any detail on the ocean and the wives and husbands but it's principalities and powers and it's a spiritual walking that you are in and you have a destination because all of this is temporary why fight and spend energy on the temporary stuff when there's an eternity to go to with a land as made of gold with a fountain they could drink anytime somebody that doesn't get sick that's what we also fight for that's what I want to fight for can the church hey man can you take some more I haven't gotten anywhere with this store this morning I have four sections and I'm on page 6 of the first section my mind so malachite welcome to restore the heart of the gem back to the faith of the Apostolic fathers and we are contending for one Lord one faith one baptism to meet the challenge of the hour because every hour has its own challenge Noah had his challenge and his Deen Moses had the challenge in his day Joseph had a challenge in his day our day not only has this power and his messenger on his message but there are challenges that we have in our day and you have to be able to meet the challenge not with your own strength but by the whole armor of God and by the random tortas a whole armor of God is what he said is a baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the whole armor of God so we are yet to apply because believe and I'm sort of full obedience to the entire Word of God entitles you to the token which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the full armor of God which is the power of God I'm not talking about a book knowledge on a Pentecostal experience but some of the fullness of God himself so when DC unity that's crisis that she's at the same God that push back the devil when he was here can the church team and so this message this morning is an encouragement to you that I in the battle but maybe you are tired maybe you're thinking about giving up maybe you get discouraged but you're in the bathroom you don't understand why this happened you don't understand why I said you don't understand why this went wrong you don't understand why there are these that they're up these and you're down there and you've seen so much something you don't even know why you're in the fight but we are fighting anyhow we are fighting for our inheritance we are fighting for our promise we are fighting for our purpose we are fighting the power side of the type of war and a time for peace we are not talking about these this morning return at all because many of us we have been a key to the devil for a long time we have a louder devil to do what he wants to do in our houses in our lives in our marriages and in the church but in this day the 7th of this month and seventh of me we declare war against the enemy we are let us never know now we are taking back our friend we are taking back our worship we are taking back a revival we are taking back our position we are claiming our inheritance we will have a church without spot without wrinkle we will have a manifestation of every promise laid how my Malachi 4 can the church amen a dance gets a few more minutes and I'll close out in a message putting on a whole hour alcohol with the balance and you know in this warfare between nations it's a great warfare going on and that's a warfare between gordon's heating and great warfare it was the first walk down it's still raging but oh I'm so glad it'll soon come to an end then the lord over season has his agent out everywhere watching spying out on God's people God moves the enemy is setting everywhere watching to see what he can do but go and go get some out too so we find that these secret agents of the enemy that sits around this is the prophets weaken each nation now you bring a parallel will equipped as many the latest equipment the very latest and they study and they do everything that's trying to counteract the other fellows weapons and get a little more modern weapon a little something with a little more punch to it and if you're watching the World News there's Babbitt Awards rumors of wars this one minute is North Korea see if America does this they will do this and and America terms of shipment many we have a small island far away doesn't affect us with you over the mu CD big ship coming waiting on you and North Korea say they have the group I think is Russia say they have the mother of all bomb the who say well who's that a leaf out of all bombs and it's a competition I said that humans can even understand because one of these bumble destroy millions of people that's what the profits for them are here I'm they're trying to contract the other fellas weapons they get a little more modern weapon I tell you with a little more punch that's a lot more punch from the bow and arrow to a muscular from a muscular modern rifle and from that to an atomic did it just keep building and it keeps them busy all the time busy all the time and it's a nation's business if they want to survive they want to equip their soldiers with the best equipment that there is but a balancing well girl you know he's infinite see he don't have to think anything better he just got the best they begin with so man went from guns are born are all swords gone Kanaan signature names he did what God gives the best at the beginning he actually give us nuclear weapons he just got the best to begin with so you can't improve on that nothing to be done about it he just give us the best and that's his word that's right his was the best that can't be given God gives his people the very best that's what he shows with his children the very best I'm so glad of that I'll be glad of that now let me in the resident now God cannot make a decision to be and tomorrow come back and make a better decision because this decision is perfect he never has to change it so therefore we can rest upon whatever God says so if God's incision but is even it's perfect to begin with it means that when God called you and equipped you with the best weapon he can even change his mind about his weapon and he can even change his mind about the soldier so when God chose you for a killer he didn't make a mistake he didn't make a mistake with you young people when he call yours in the world and he put you in the house he put you in to give you the opportunity to hear this word he made the best decision he could have ever made and because of that you are going to make it you are going to overcome oh my so this is not the time church foster died already you know I I believe it over to Allah go ahead and leave me here that's at that some of us zone I better be junior long time somebody older Caleb listen there's no oh lucky Lebanon that green here is going to reverse I'm not buying that another except again there's not giving up another law when you kill em together time for young people to take over you are young people June is this process need to be refinished that speed and you make your young people some speaking to the young people and the Caleb's nor given that Tina's got to go Detroit that hip under scope in his death has got to come back I'm speaking it I'm claiming it if the super Antoinette this is imagine where is body tears are 21 your you can imagine the kind of competition we would have you imagine a bottle and then immediately the kind of competition they have dancing on the land rather up how it's gonna be we're gonna have a grand time you could have a wonderful time it's gonna be a jubilee time is there anybody in the house this morning listen I'm stressed and I'm stressing that people I never say God really knows how much to give everybody because I peepee with stress and I do with real stress every railroad stress and when you watch stress and see what makes somebody say laughter oh gosh you rue falling out and the Pipers me Bucknam and somebody holds frontally house for loans like that pipe we could patch that up dodo do like a all frustrated but I ran a prism I said why we so tossed about so easy to get frustrated you know I don't know corny but some time ago I heard some noise I was a lizard now the we need noise key embroidery I thought it was out serious crisis ism what is stress and stress no if I live there cause that brother weather assumption what happened welcome to the reality is the trials and the situation in your life and that's why gold couldn't send Goliath David upfront you have to go through the line and the beer so based on his experience now dealing with these two elements he now had a resume to prevent the king Sol then based on my job experience and my qualifications I am the only man to apply for this job and he was in fact the only applicant so when so receive his resume if you listen this job has benefits you get my water you get this and give it there with the qualifications in know feel encouraged because there is no doubt in his mind he walked here with a sling and with a stick hunting I'm sillas announced video I'll chop your head off his experience and confidence in the court that he delivered him was bigger than what he had in his hand his confidence and covers bigger and what his eyes could see or even the eyes of the East our practitioners who were reviewing his performance come to church payment but when he chopped the head off after Israel paused the people I was really dead Dennis added shoten and is rejoicing because I recognize that Gilad was finished so your trials and your testings and your lizard and your lions and your beers are all to prepare you for your own experience with Goliath because we all have our Goliath the deal with but as the pastor always says for every Goliath there is a stone with his name on it and our responsibility is to connect Goliath head with a stone that has his name on it that's what overcome irzu overcome a rhinestone the match against Goliath so they could be a Goliath in your life right now what we are trying to do this morning is to find all the stones for every Goliath because every girl is will be destroyed because baby's ministry is on the earth but a random message but the winners back the Divas ministry which is not the ministry of man but for the benefit that David is Christ on Christ and his bride in David's ministry can the church amen the musicians you get ready I'm almost done the past is being preached one so all these years we have been under military preparation what is military preparation is the Ministry of the word the minister was you cannot send a man out in the battle if he hasn't been trained and it's different kinds of training there's physical training there's mental training then psychological training if they make training when you go to these military schools they have you study what you disease are did what Napoleon did what alexander degraded what Hitler did all the strategies because when you go onto the battlefield you don't know what strategy you have to use and you can't have it in mind only in Buzzbee demonstration you have to to shoot if you know all the Therrien you can't shoot straight the enemy is there there's the enemy you telling them shoot on it and you should know me we want to be under beam you want to be on the target one of the identify the enemy wherever he is at and be able to please your target and you are directly on him because once you direct the one which is your weapon to him he has to go the sort of the sort of bridge which is the Word of God can address name in my mind you could begin to play something software a lot to finish this message some other time but every service what are we doing getting ready for a holy war a spiritual battle a final showdown and we are waiting for dynamics to take us to the final battle God has been waiting for the right keys on the right time the right people and I say this morning sir this is the time God has to pull you out from the world you have to be baptized filled with the Holy Ghost go to place of trying to reach adoption and in silence when your family could understand you when nobody could understand you God has been preparing you so I pay again this morning this is not the time for you to die this is not the time for us to run and hide a defender this morning we declare that the time has come to stand and having an oil to keep on standing don't give up after your try talking to your children don't give up stand after your replies a job after job don't give up stand after your pray for the Holy Ghost don't get up stand having it all and after your side and you cried and after your pride him and tried him and you press your way and it seemed as if nothing is working out still can having it all to stand let everything go wrong with the Barrow say let everybody else possible let the others prosper let the men who ever form of godliness denied a power but if you know I used can you stand regardless as the whole world tells you down you can just assume you won't be read from that word because the battle is the Lord's battle just keep on standing who wasn't a Lord Tidus morning and you lift your hand this morning and give God praise we have a commission from God to make a church that will make a revival another Ephesians another book of Acts to kill kill every Phyllis time every Amalekite you may be seated for a minute so I'm going a little bit too beyond to drive them out to citizen kill them all [Music] so their driver because it's your land but our ministry it's not just a tribe amount it's a kill them all because in every age throughout history and the Bible supports it destroy them kill them all destroy them kill them all there's only kill em expel the sun's energy but it is these spirits for all ages that are still in the church today and that's why we're the random talk about if we could design withstand the two-spirit working within the framework of the church but this is the only age where the Egyptians you see today you will see them no more forever this is the only age we're sittin at the end we'll be bound by circumstance bound for thousand years but years they couldn't find him they would hold her a season you would come back home but after this is its thousand years bone it's about finished and we shall reign on the earth the devil has been squatting on this earth for a long time but the bread of brought up that is the Prince of the power of the air that is infected the land is injected and that's why it's been a battle since Adam cell until now that's why God has a new heaven and a new earth cover them fire to consume this place but this brine will be that elect ladies the gamma rays up into the holy city New Jerusalem will make the rapture that when a fire consume the earth he will walk on the ashes and she was system is our earth this is our land of the Bible says we shall reign on the earth we know what I read in heaven this is our land of the devil and taking our land no wonder the trees are groaning no one the seas are groaning with a manifestation of the sons of God I listen the trees know we are coming back he earth knows that we are coming back the earthquakes are happening because we are coming back sons of God daughters of God are coming back into position and the church say man somebody
