amen and precious name lord jesus amen so god bless you amen god bless you brethren and we want to thank brother solomon for this opportunity to be of service to the bride of jesus christ we also also thank the bride universal for this virtual convention on the team the manifestation of the sons of god dynamic survivor under the inspiration placing of sun's adoption time i'm taking the scripture from ephesians chapter one three to five he said blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places christ jesus according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us to the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will i'm also taking the scripture from romans 8 22 and 23 for we know that the whole christian groaned and travailed in pain together until now and not holy day but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even as ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for adoption to with the redemption of our body and we want to thank god for this virtual convention and i want to read something also from the prophet the believer's position in christ it says and we are groaning waiting for that time of adoption and we believe that one of these days the holy spirit will move in not with a new breath for we have received that through christ in the sister one zero six one one he preached revelation chapter five in jeffersonville i also read paragraph 108 we are waiting for the fullness of adoption this will take place when at the first resurrection that's when our bodies will be changed from these viral creatures that we are and we are having a body like his own glorious body for we shall see him as he is and will be like him when he appears will appear in his likeness will have a body like his a glorious glorified body and all the tires and struggles of life will fade off into the little mist and blow away to never be no more and these athlete tabernacles which we now grown in we are waiting for that earnest for the salvation fullness in his fullness to come hallelujah so we thank the lord for all that he has done for us and we know that at the time of creation we have the plant kingdom we have the animal kingdom and we have the human kingdom now in the garden of eden and at the plant kingdom we have the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil and the animal kingdom we have the serpents then in the human kingdom we have adam and eve but when the four came king that was a product from the animal kingdom and apart from the human kingdom took the fruits to go and sacrifice from the plant kingdom ever who came through adam through god took a lamp from his talk to also go and sacrifice now adam and eve after therefore use aprons from their plant kingdom to cover themselves and we know the prophet told us that the aprons were the religion but when god came down he took a lamp from the animal kingdom to do the sacrifice and to clothe them and that blood i was using on them it was a type of the same blood that would come on cavalry but sadly when their blood came uncovering their redemption only came on adam and eve seed nothing was applied to the plant kingdom and the animal kingdom so as we speak the plant kingdom is crying is growing how does deforestation how the waters have been polluted the people have thrown abortion oh fractures into the rivers they are groaning for redemption how their whole earth is polluted the ozone layer has been depleted they are all waiting for adoption and the bible said not only day but even we we are also groaning because after birth that is not the end of it you need to be adopted and just like in a jewish custom when you take the law and you want to go through adoption you have to go to a welfare home to adopt a son by law but in the jewish custom they don't adopt by law they adopt their own children but this child has to be seen as a proper child take it to a teacher and this teacher will teach that child and then a ceremony is performed for that child through the adoption ceremony where a robe is put on him and he's shown in a public ceremony oh if we look through the bible when jesus was born he was also adopted he was born in a manger but one day on the day in the river jordan god cried out from heaven that this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased to dwell but that was not just the end of it he also went to matthew translation where the same god cried out this is my beloved son hear ye him so we can see that he was adopted and from that day he spoke just like the father if we take the jews who apply the blood in egypt that was not the end of it they passed through the rescue in baptism on the wilderness they had their trials but that was not the end of it they crossed cadiz bania and when they got to the land they were placed on the land that was the completion of that justice ceremony for them when we take the bride the brothers of what had a new breath but a new birth alone now if you ask a normal christian in town he'll tell you i'm born again i'm born again baboon again is not enough you need to be placed and need to be adopted and to be placed properly so that you know that you have an inheritance but we thank god the message through the former reign which is a teaching reign has taught us just like the jewish boy and now we have been placed because we are groaning for that adoption now on the day of the resurrection we shall say oh lord we thank you that we have arrived we are taking our position because the bible told us everywhere our future trend we should take possession so we want to thank the lord for their sons and daughters has been taught and has been adopted just like our prophet when he was born the pillar of fire came there oh in 1983 he came through the sky and said as the john the baptist was sent to foreign first coming i'm sending you to foreign coming that was not enough in 1946 in that cave an angel was sent from the presence of god to come and speak to him to give you two signs to go and look for the bride out of the gentile world that was not enough almost sunset on the 28th of february 1963 he was also adopted when he was carried up for about 28 minutes by several angels to be adopted from that day he stopped saying when he come when he come from that time he started saying he's here he's here and then my ministry is to declare that he's here god bless you god bless you god bless you amen amen i appreciate that praising him the lord amen hallelujah let's just stand and give god praise give god honor give god glory oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god hallelujah amen god bless you amen hallelujah thank you for your greetings oh we receive it in jesus name amen and amen hallelujah hallelujah oh thank you thank

falling in love with jesus falling in love with jesus falling in love with jesus falling in love with jesus is the best thing i'm ever done oh praise the lord praise the lord it's a blessing to be here tonight oh praise god amen i bring greetings from the headstone tabernacle trinidad to this virtual ghana convention i want to thank brother solomon china the host pastor for the invitation to speak tonight i also want to thank the lord for all the messages that has gone forward before us and i trust the lord they've got to help us tonight to be a blessing and inspiration to you amen so tonight if you have your bibles let's turn our bibles to romans chapter eight i want to read from verse 14 to 18 and ephesians chapter one one through verse five romans chapter eight reading from verse 14 to 18. for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry our father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then ears ears of god and joint ears with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us underlying word is in us and ephesians chapter 1 verse 5 one verse having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of israel let's pray heavenly father we thank you for your word tonight and i pray that you would bless your people oh god may the holy ghost just sweep out upon your word bless brother solomon his wife his church his family and lord is virtual convention lord may anointing continue to flow and speak to our hearts we wait on you in jesus name we ask it amen you may be seated oh praise god so this morning listen tonight i have a title at the placing of a son that's the title the inspiration of the meetings we know is placing of sons adoption time but this is what i have the placement of a son of a subject god has predestinated us unto the adoption of sons that's my subject tonight and an inspiration becoming well matured seasoned out unto adoption kind of like that one becoming well matured seasoned out unto adoption this is brother branham he's praying musical preparation he's our heavenly father i thank you tonight because we are living in the hour of preparation we are living when you are preparing the people to believe in all things we believe that the message of the day the preparation time jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and you're calling a people and have given them the holy ghost and now you're trying to call out that group of sons to abduct them we realized that the old law was that a son was born into a home he was a son but the tutor raised him and when he was of age he had been the right kind of a son now this is a prayer he's praying he was taken out and i put a purple robe on in a ceremony and adopted and that's what you're trying to do these full gospel people now to get them out to themselves somewhere alone with you in faith take that word reason again to get them out to themselves somewhere alone with you in faith to adopt them into the kingdom of god and give them the right to go forth and to do the things you did let me read that again hallelujah and that's what you're trying to do these full gospel people now to get them out of themselves somewhere alone with you in faith to adopt them into the kingdom and give them the right to go forth and to do the things that you did some just went but there are some god going to shed scent oh glory to god not just the went once the sent ones and the sent one as a jesus as my father sent me so send are you and for god to send them out he has to be in them or give the lord some praises hallelujah glory to god you say i pray god that you will take these few examples great saint paul writing said seeing that we are compassible with such a great crowd of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and today after a a tread in this gospel from 1975 to this hour i see we under the the edge of it we're just looking over the the time as it was when all things will be fulfilled you know when jesus when the cavalry a lot of scriptures start to be fulfilled one after each other one after the other it won't be long you know it will be just one after each other manifestation after manifestation after manifestation oh glory to god as we head down to the resurrection we have a journey and we have a destination oh glory to god so he's praying he said no father many are waited long they would like to run but they are sick and father i pray tonight as i've brought them again the plain simple truth of how that you heal the sick you raise the dead you commission your disciples to go and appreciate gospel and these signs shall follow them and believe and back in the old testament from genesis to revelation you constantly was a miracle-working god yoga i love that tonight you constantly was a miracle-working god and when people were ready to step out and believe you when people were ready to step out to believe you when moses prayed and then stepped towards the red sea it opened when the priest stepped into the water of jordan it peeled back to one side of the other we have got to make a step we have got to make a step we have got to try let me read it again we have got to try we have got to put for our effort to show that we are sincere for it's written the bible that faith without works is dead and just as the body with all the spirit i pray father in jesus name that you will give faith here tonight to these sick people to be healed or glory in the name of jesus christ and may as the word go thought may there be healing here healing across the internet healing remember to hear the tape oh glory to god the anointing of god will flow freely oh give the lord some praise as we love you tonight healing diabetes high blood pressure cancer tumor blindness deafness dumb you name it the quitting power has come back in the church adoption time spirit of adoption we have not received the spirit of fear we have not received the spirit to go back into bondage oh glory to god but we are breaking out into the liberty the glorious liberty of the sons of daughter of the living god who i feel the quickening power here to this morning oh glory to god the fires in the church hallelujah glory to god amen you will be seated now when they become a son yes i'm hearing him when he was adopted into the same family he was born in like that same family he was born in now listen presbyterian friend methodist baptist pentecostal when you're born again that only puts you in the family it's your character your conduct that gives god confidence in you not the man sermon your conduct your character i'm not talking this morning about the blessing of a church i am talking about the person of a son and when you say son you're talking about individual then you as an individual have a right to want to be placed and i want to give you a word you are predestinated unto the adoption of sons oh glory to god god is already pre-determined that you're gonna get up there somebody's gonna make it up the mountain oh give the lord a shout it's crowded at the bottom but somebody gonna take it up to the mountain oh glory to god hallelujah at the bottom you find church members at the bottom you find the hypocrites at the bottom behind the liars at the bottom in front of fornicators at the bottom behind the adulterers but somebody's gonna break past whoa it's crawling at the bottom but there's gonna be a place another sun abortion a field son a predestinated son hallelujah there is room at the top for you oh glory to god there's room at the bottom you find in mediocre at the bottom you find the foolish at the bottom you find the simple at the bottom second timothy heavy and high-minded at the bottom but at the top oh glory to god your son's gonna climb oh hallelujah we have not received a spirit of bondage to fear okay the reason that we haven't got the great church mashing on today is because god can't find people to put his confidence in we're not talking about believing the message we're not talking about believing a prophet we're not talking about having books and tapes we're talking about god finding people that he could have confidence in the holy spirit the holy spirit keeps saying they are tearing up they are breaking up they are doing this they're off on the lines stay with god's word that is the pattern that is the blueprint now the same son that was born into the family could be adopted into the same family or placed into the same family or give them a position in the family that he was born into and i do believe that is the work of the holy spirit today among the church is trying to place in the church positionally apostles teachers prophets no no no he said we have seen many false alarms guys are possible by god the prince and i can't make an apostle just an apostle that is apostle because they're feeling apostolicious false alarm nice man making their own claims that's not god putting that on them them claiming things watch we have seen many false alarms and so forth moving among the people which only indicated that the real genuine adoption was at hand i believe it god has to place into the church not man plays a man but god has to place into the church that's the business of god not man all glory that i'm still reading it's god's business but today i want to tell you it's god's will that you'll be placed as a son into your position in the kingdom of god and no devil in hell ordained to cut you off from that tell the devil this morning he's a liar no devil in hell not only that no trial nor testing because you it has been predetermined it has been determined before if you it has predestinated it has been predetermined that you're going to climb oh glory to god you're going to go through the mountain if you have to you're going to go to the sea if you have to but you've got to make it up there you don't belong to the crowd you have to be called aside you have to be called uphiller oh my hallelujah [Applause] you say i believe that is the time that the church has arrived at today that the great move in the church is for god he said we have seen false alarms but now god will place in his church correctly you know this is like walking slowly and driving slowly drawing jews of these quotes placed in the church correctly apostles prophets teachers evangelists not man made seminary broughton but god will place into the church not theology run overs and overnights but god will place in the church as god has chosen as the holy ghost has tooted this church and raise it up and in dear god will adapt into his position his sons god will do that god must do that god has to do that as many that led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god we are led by the spirit of god we know we are sons of god if their sons ears if their sons ears if their sons heirs it means we have an inheritance we're not here just to say we're here gloria put us here just to exist god put us here because we are ears while i reckon that the present suffering the hell you're going through the trials are going through the testing they're going through the depression the frustration oh god you're locked down oh you're wary you're tired but i reckon the present perfect it's not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in your flesh [Applause] oh glory to god oh glory to god the sufferings is not ready to be compared oh glory to god huh hallelujah oh glory to god this coronavirus bring a lot of wild people in this objection they had to adopt the bars they can't go in the bars they used to they can't go into the cinema as they used to they can't go into the party as they used to they can't go online as they used to it bring the flesh on that kind of subjection by a virus but god wants some disciplined sons god wants some sons to get an order that's why the holy ghost led jesus christ into the wilderness [Applause] into his place of trying [Applause] [Music] [Applause] if is going to church and hear a nice sermon and enjoy reserving church we all made it we reach if we saying amen all the amens across the world they made it amen hallelujah but listen to this but how can the church the pentecostal church the pentecost and the methodist and baptist church be adopted until they come to discipline oh you made me eating discipline after i'll go back home steal her son still in the family here but no inheritance still a believer simple the end on the side of the fool is foolish the mother decided to wise wise because the wives have wisdom of revelation to know it will take decline they stretch the going up the pushing past you pass your fears past your feeling because of that bondage to fear you know yes that fear that's behind you oh god the fear of the unknown the fear of getting all the fear of dying the fear of you're not going to make it the fear of not going to get the holy ghost the fear of not being healed all that is fears but the spirit that he releases not for fear the spirit is releasing is the spirit of adoption whereby we cry not our pastor not our apostle not our prophet not our church but our father or give the lord a shout god want to reconnect you with the perfect connection that the spirit can draw freely from father the son he said in sun june 14 20 at that day you're going to know i am in the father not you and the church not you and the pastor come on now oh give the lord i shall not you and some man away with man you and god how could the baptist church be adopted until they come to discipline we have got to be disciplined first to all you indisciplined people we have got to be disciplined place for all you didn't get licks when you were small you have got to be disciplined first for all your own correction we have got to be disciplined first for all you feel you get away you have captivities and faith all you feeling left to do your own thing you have got to be disciplined first god could not trust this power with the church it's hard to tell what you will do how could a father trust his business with a boy that might simply pollute his whole inheritance i miss son boy take over you ready take over and to take over my up he couldn't do it the church has to come to a place to where it is disciplined when the adoption time come if the tutor that raised the child from the child not worthy you hear who finding that out is the holy ghost right and holy ghost don't lie you can't ride him you can't say tell him tell him tell him i ain't so bad i am why is i foolish but only simple that can't make it now if the tutor that raised the child found the child not worthy they absolutely still remain a son but missed that adoption missed the adoption oh so now we find out if you could make it clean they're here and you're going to push instead of picking my option you pass it clean miss it don't miss the adoption but if there was abducting the family then there was full shell fellowship with any check that they wrote was just as good as the father wrote that's what the matter is a day brother the church ought to be in adoption right now bringing into the full phase of favors of god but the thing we are up and down in and out up and down in and out till god can't trust us with nothing hardly one day we belong to assemblies next day we belong to something else and then peter first peter 4 said beloved think it not strange considering the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened to you that's not a lot of believers go through it like it's a strange thing i mean i pray every day you're doing wrong i i achieve i do my best but look what happened here look what happened here think it's not strange concerning firing not this trial fiery anybody willing to think about that word called fiery fiery child which is which is to try you as though some stranger to you he said but rejoice that is growth now if you rejoice i miss your trial you get immature that is my kind of sin the father said look at him now oh glory to god you see how we behave i miss his fiery childs it make the devil get confused never scratch his head because he expected to give up he expected to pack up he expected to go back with the crowd oh really to god go back fishing he expected to do this and do that but yeah you're rejoicing because you know you're always at hand reward behold i come quickly and my reward is with me you know your reward coming brother but rejoice in as much as you are partakers of christ's suffering so you see paul peter here is showing that this suffering is comparing with christ suffering you can't let him suffer alone he suffer for you he paid the price name in his hand he balled my god while the forsaken me pay the price they embarrass him to shame him they beat him to whip him and you just want to slide in the ball who will really stop with his supper [Music] i i reckon that the present suffering is not worthy to be compared with not worthy to be you can't put them on the same scale then don't put them on the same scale put yourself in here and put glory here and watch the glory and rejoice for your suffering don't put them on the same scale start to rejoice because your adoption on its way start to rejoice because the reward is on its way [Applause] glory he says but rejoice in the much of your particulars of christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding joy if you be approached if you be reproached for the name of christ happier ye for the spirit of glory and of god rest it upon you for in their party evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified oh my so bad angel came to him 1946 introduced the dispensation of adoption breaking past the pentecostal anointing that fell in 1906 because they had gifts signs tongues wonders and they thought the the they all have come of later rain but rain can't come to the seed not there if the rainfall there's no seed wasting time so the gifts they had was to create an atmosphere for the world to come the pentecostal if they had received that malachi for prophet the world was going to drop just in the center of that spirit and rapture gone already but there was not elected like you are names in the book to receive this raptor message when you check them out they were shocked they were only hiding the seed the seed was yet to come and the seed was totally perfection the capstone revelation of jesus christ and that's who you are joseph to reject him that's who you are so i said climb up the critics are down there the critics are not up they are young the people trying to pull you down because they don't trying to put you down where they are don't bother with them they can't go where you are going you are called to hire order okay the lord i shout let me say it again the critics and the liars the people that are jealous and envious i'm trying to pull you down they are dumb that's why they're trying to pull you down they see you climbing up oh glory to god give me my mountain what moses said is mine and if the lord be with me if the lord be with me i shall be able to drive them out oh glory to god you have to seize the caption as yours i learn to possess a mountain to possess hallelujah oh glory to god amen hallelujah so what does adoption time be identifying adoption time the spirit of adoption being released what is that what does that do make me show monsters and say who we are no that's spirit of adoption will direct you to the wilderness we'll tack you to your place of trying because in your place of trying is where the word image is where characters are going to be formed you can form that the child supposed to bring all that all characters another gift card is a victory to get victory out of a test and when that test comes you have to feel it or pass it or give the lord a shout come on now we fail so much where we will pass and we just had to pass it will pass some more because you have to get a victory test the problem with us oh my god have mercy what abandonment said one time he was criticizing those who dancing he couldn't understand it he want to know what foolishness is this but then he started reading the bible or when they crossed the bank of the river miriam started to dance and he recognized the reason he wasn't dancing it's because he didn't have enough victory oh god that's the problem today when people don't have victory they can't dance like a sit down and vote say that number but when you see other victory you can dance like david dance that's why nobody gonna take my dance you can't take me prayers you can't take my joy you can't take me shout it's too late son i know it's too late okay the lord i shout you need victory in your life you can't sit on dead cold hard face and legalistic shower like a lemon and expect god to bless you okay the lord i shout the bible said the lord this is the lord's doing it is marvelous in my eyes this is the day that the lord had made we will rejoice and be glad in it oh glory hallelujah hallelujah man glory to god hallelujah so what happened jesus example seat son led by the spirit spirit of adoption matthew 4 wilderness matthew 17 adoption spirit adoption come upon jesus loosen me to the wilderness overcome lust of the eyes overcome lust of the flesh overcome the pride of life and then power begin to flow from him even virtue powerful service and in his trying he's been tested by the pharisees by the scribes by this one and that one and when he come true god said come up now bring some witnesses take them up the mountain and brother branham's head that's the same thing you're going to do some sons in the last days after you tried after you come to your place at times he will take you aside not to never move unless you're saved or give the lord our shout sickness cancer humor whatever condition rebuke it in the name of jesus dissolve in the name of jesus be healed in jesus name oh glory hallelujah let's continue your adoption is your pleasing your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing when we are born of the spirit of god we are sons of god but then we are predestinated think about it now all the time you know church methodist baptist church with the church and you're giving a religious symbol and praise in god and whatever but now you know by revelation not only you're born of god but you have a destiny you are predestinated onto something not to shake the pressure hand anybody could do that not to shake the deep near anybody could do that not the bombs the elder anybody could do that but you are predecimated onto adoption adoption is a place a nation is a course adoption is a road adoption is a destination you're not just born in latin eruption all glory to god you have to be placed to be adopted son how hungry are you how thirsty are you what do you want what do you want i want to wet your appetite this thing eating good this thing real nice this is a land full of milk full of honey full of power full of revelation full of anointed full of spoken word you name it this land habit oh glory to god this world can't give nothing [Music] some receive church members believe donald trump was connecting with the last trump not the trump getting kicked out the trump game trump out the amount of false prophecy and false prophets that say he'll be reelected and they keep anything across that somehow magical ego happened they never heard from god they are bunch of liars false prophets define vindicated false prophets if there was any old testament stone for them oh glory to god big stone liars and guess what they go still go back on tv still beg for money and still continue preaching and they wouldn't repent and nothing to say making the word of god a mockery hallelujah when you are born of the spirit of god we are sons of god but we are predestinated here is what i'm trying to get you to these sons in the last days we were predestinated onto adoption adoption is placing a son not just to be born but god has a plan for you to be an adopted son and daughter of god oh hallelujah go stay with the crowd the hypocrites are there don't stay with the crowd the church members they they love dear they feel they just like everybody else but you are different you are called to a higher order you are called to claim adoption is not for those at the bottom look at the pyramid where it's wide at the bottom oh glory to god the pyramid narrows as they get to the top some people as when they hit patients so just knock them down summers get bonked off on their temperance they temper hit them so bam they're dying to tempers at all they're temper taking them so they can't go further that is like back on the privilege [Music] so this is no game let me continue that's what god was done in transport transfiguration when he took his own son own son after he had been proven to be the right son so jesus come and say uh father oh overcome last year i was in the first part of life adopt me now father didn't say that the bible said jesus grew in knowledge and wisdom and found fever with good men and with god jesus had a breakthrough and spend time in prayer he said to commune with the spirit that was within him it took time like that morning lord hallelujah glory hallelujah see back receive the lord is even lord good night lord in jesus name amen no like not jesus one time he spent all night in prayer he had to and that's why i'm saying if jesus would make flesh was was have to be earnest to pray endlessly what's more what about us and are saved by grace when so so when he had proven to be the right son and understood all temptations not some so you're going on very head and aching with your house the prayer was leaders not into temptation the prayer was father don't take them all to the world they're in the world keep them [Music] the prayer wasn't that peter he said that your faith failed not but the devil is sifting devastating sifting sifting if he could see if you're just a field people sit down and they relax at home like if that is it i promise you come here take a boots on sword and gun because the wall there you know devil will like you think that he is it up you think he on the lockdown [Music] [Applause] [Music] he could still speak he could still deliver he can still move he can still annoy oh my so you are born into the whole family by the holy ghost but then we must be the right kind of children tutored by the right kind of tutor praise god so it has to be tested tried and the word here is sanctification to see how you behave on issues because until as time came joseph the word of the lord tried him not the devil loosened them the word of the lord tried him god want to see they could take the word take correction take rebuke take instructions i can't do that and i can't you always can't do because you're anything in your head religious spirits upon you repent get it off for you take instructions walk around the jericho praise god once a day follow instruction when i beat you to shout shout don't feel let the shout out to diamond oh glory to god and follow instructions he said we haven't been here before oh glory to god so we're getting things fresh we're getting things from heaven it can't be what you think last year and yet 10 years ago it can't be that [Music] my lord so listen but abraham you're talking about the holy spirit reporting to the father he sees that you can take the word he sees your nature he sees you you are mature you haven't been shaking all the parts and the father wanted to go to he sees you have been about your father's business no matter what the devil sent to distract you because the devil is just do so and do so shiny things just anything devil don't waste time you know if he can't catch him at this he tried that general he's not stopping you know he knows something how they catch you so he will push this underwater you and your trials this is you and your sonship this is you and your play sin you and your family and this one don't like you no no that they're excuses watch watch so no matter what they never said to distract you the question is oh that's my son that's my boy butterball is dramatizing the father saying this well do you think he's well matured holy spirit answer yep sure do said the holy spirit i give him test boy i tried him this way i tried him that way i thrown him down sick i put him under i stumped him i let the devil do everything to him he that he could do and he come right back up again he calmed the same coming up again i made him sick i done this i threw him in the hospital i took him out here i done this i done that i turned his wife against him [Music] if you don't say amen to that you don't you're not receiving the word you know i turn his neighbors against him i think everything that didn't make a bitter difference he said though he slay me yet i'll trust him i killed his family i took this i did this i've done all this i did this still he stood up do you slam me yet i'll sell him and people don't have one of them i did this and they want to claim adoption then i'll go back and read how much i did this thing to him let's see what we're talking about here this is not scary then the father said oh well i believe we ought to call him a sign somewhere totally a special place to have an adoption when the father and the old testament understood that his son was come of age and has been in other words seasoned out onto adoption oh glory that sounds good seasoned out you know when they put season in the meeting i just just throw the season and choose any pot it's hard to oh they call it marinate when the season's soaking in the meat and you put that to bake you can almost taste it already hallelujah oh glory to god so god have you marinated now [Music] [Applause] the trials the intestines oh glory the environment is to marinate you to get the greenness out to season you out onto a touch [Music] they're born a child their son right then but when they never be normal than a child just an ordinary son ordinary that's where the crowd is at everybody is that ordinary until they mature and show what they are then he calls them out ordinary message ordinary hold the elders and the leaders ordinary that's why i said it is not hallelujah ordinary but you god want to ripen you and you could raise you know the cream doesn't raise above the cup it is raised oh glory to god let the liars lie let the critics criticize we come along to them just now hallelujah i want to show you i want everyone to know that this is my child and i adopt my son and i want everyone to know from hen's fault i dr this is god speaking now there's not a child have a big flag this is the father identifying his son and saying i want everybody to know i dress him up special just on him i want you to know his name is just as good on any check as my name is he is my child i adopt him into my family although he has been my son since he was born since he received the holy ghost he's been my son but now i'm going to place him positionally in authority what he fires is fired what he hires is hired so displace him this adoption is not talk this is authority come out devil [Music] [Applause] he said there you are he's my son homie knows that the adoption the adopted his son's proof placing of the sun oh my hallelujah brother branham let me hit the home stretch here now i'm going to keep it long again but the old testament you're talking about when he got checked as his daddy then it had a ring in those days and they were signed they put the signet of the ring and stamped it on something like that he said when jesus had been obedient it's a blasphemous name and god placed in position this is him no prophecy when the member is born by the holy ghost into the family of god and as proven that word on the line is proof spell p-r-o-v-e-n proven to have these virtues in him not guests not gamble not roller dice and say unlucky down not seven ways wallet under lucky over seven i guess six are six virtues you roll the dice and traders get seven proven to have these virtues in him that god can't see not even your wife you're the neighbor because god had to see things you know yes yes yes god had to see disney no forget me i am out of the picture that god that your father can see virtue knowledge temperance patience brotherly kindness godliness in him then god seals them or places him and that is when you see the sons and daughters of god so right now we're in church but hear what we about to see sons and daughters of god because god gonna place sons or give the lord some praises i believe there is a bride that is predestinated i believe god said he would have a church with a spot or wrinkle i believe in predestination that the bride is predestinated she's got to be there i am hope i'm with her now it's up to me to work out my own salvation with god until these things are approved of god and then sealed into the kingdom of god there is the holy spirit now watch when the church comes to this place or the individual then he says the church is going to be there let me say it real good so you get it the church is predestinated to be there i want to be part with it but the only way i will be with it is to be part of it how do i become part of it by being in it how do i get in it by the baptism of by one spirit oh my he said here you cannot stick these things in you once i spoke with tongues that's put in peacock feathers energy bird you can't do that but when these things these seven things is operating in you by god then you are sealed oh glory to god then there is no put on you are just yourself that is when visions is perfect holy spirit works of god everything is made manifest because why you and christ become one these virtues from what's called ordination these virtues has to be in deer before the capstone will even come on it you might shout you might sing you might speak with tongues and dance that has nothing at all to do with it until these things are scripturally proven and sealed into you and the holy spirit sees you as an individual then you are son and daughter of god he doesn't see us as a church he sees your individual so you have a right to want your own mountain because it's not church thing you can't hide behind nobody you can hide down your parents you can't hide behind your wife you can't hide behind your husband you can't hide in anybody the pillar of fire is identified scientifically by some paradox by its character and everything else just the same as it was it was dwell in the body of god's only begotten son so does it dwell in the body of the abducted son for this day what is that they tell her fire ephesians 4 13 till we all come to the unity of the fate the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man you shall come to please unto the measure of the statute of the fullness of christ and the amplified that it might develop until we attain oneness in the fate and in the comprehension of the full and accurate knowledge of the son of god that we might arrive at really mature manhood the completeness of this personality which is nothing less than the standard height of christ's own perfection the measure of the status of the fullness of christ and the completeness found in him oh my god be my judge i am not i am only trying to point out something that is the truth we have chosen leaders of men instead of leaders of the holy spirit we have wanted men to unlock out our part and to lead us listen to these words we we have chosen wanted men to alert our part and to lead leaders denominations like methodist and baptists to set organization as an example and we follow that but nowhere in the bible are we to do such as that there isn't one text of the scripture in all god's bible where he ever organized a church or where he ever spoke of realization not one place in the bible but always contrary to it onto the adoption or the placement of the people how that god trying to place his people and when god places one the whole church wants to be like that one have the same kind of things do the same thing we are cut out different we are made different we are matured nature different we are positionally placed different each one for different work maybe one for a little kind of work another for a large work watch and we are going to stop for a second on adoption and balaam says let me hear you say it and he asked the congregation to see that placing and the corrections say placing the body the body of jesus christ of jesus christ positionally positionally in christ in christ where the holy spirit where the holy spirit is leading us that is being placed hallelujah and he said the book of ephesus is to do that it is god's pleasure to do his will it is god pleasure to place you it is god's pleasure it does give god's joy it pleases god to place his people oh glory to god oh hallelujah that's what he does he sent for the holy spirit and given the baptism holy ghost i want you pentecostal people to get this out of your hearts pentecost is not a denomination pentecost is an experience it is the holy ghost and you couldn't organize the holy ghost now placing the sun first thing after the sun was in he become a son but then we find out his behavior is what set him to adoption whether he behave right or not not perseven not his teaching not his revelations not his mysteries his behavior do i know all mysteries and i am badly behaved i am messed up i'll see no more on that after you have proved yourself and sanctified yourself with your good behavior obedient to the holy spirit no matter what the world say but ibrahim said i'm going to rub this really hard because i don't mean it to be rude please don't really the only thing that i'm mean i don't want to be what worries me is to take people and preach to them gods and truth and they turn right back just keep on doing the same thing and say they got the holy ghost that just really ruins me they come right back to the same thing just like the general israel they want a king so the king could rule over them and make them act like the amorites and amalekites and philistines we should be so on fire for god we should be going day and night nothing should be able to stop us we should be so sweet so pleasant so kind so christ-like in our lives it takes our everyday life not a sunday life not a wednesday life our everyday life the crowd they're not every day they could be sunday then he says it takes everyday life and he dropping jesus said consider the lily of the field how it grows and toil right solomon had robes that was a raid with glorious silk and needlework and things but that wasn't what he was talking about in order for the lady to grow it has to toy day and night so there's a mystery inside this little talk it's not just an illegal way no the toil the climb because the crowd is at the bottom there's no toil you fellowship in here you're photoshopping here you're talking here talking here moving here moving here retoilers is the one who makes a difference they get above the noise and the higher you go the less noise there is and when you reach midway people say i can't make it forget about it you can't reach it up there at the bottom but they're telling you climbing you can't get up higher if you listen to that and hear that and let it stick in your head you start to slide back down forget them there is room at the top for those who willing to pay the price there is room at the top for those who are prepared to claim paul said forgetting the thing that i passed i press forward oh glory god i push forward the getting here that pass i pressed towards the mark where's the mark the mark is up there i'm almost done my where are they at show me where they're at god is calling his children aside by manifestation they don't have to say one word about it you see something happen positionally placed in his son getting him in order just exactly with the same things and he's just as in much authority his word is as good as archangel and better the son was adopted put on a high place set out there change his robe change his colors the father of ceremony said this is my son from henceforth he's governor he's ruler he's over all my heritage all what i got belongs to him so watch the church is supposed to be predestinated under adoption he could begin to play something he says when a man god can take a man and adopt him into the family and give him something god could do that right first try that nothing that will get he he has that no he said try that maybe we have already tried that yeah who claimed to be apostles be trying that too who claimed to be prophet we're trying that too who claimed to be minister man half son of man want to be son of man son of mine wannabe we're trying that too hallelujah trying everything and see if it is right the bible said try the spirits this man claim a certain thing try it see if it's right if it is right move right with it lord send us something else keep moving just keep moving say till every fellow take its place then you're going to see the church of god begin to get in this place then is when the philistine will go to backing up the shorts will go off here we'll go down faces will be washed singers will be missing that's right and then we'll have the church and gets into his mighty power and then is when you're gonna have an asset to fire a few of them you will see when that holy church stands together in its power positionally priests are sons of god adopted into the family of god a powerful church that he's coming for oh my place another son i'm finished last quote take him out to a sitting place have a ceremony before angels place him positionally what he is in the body of christ then that person has the authority let me say this if you me as a fanatic from this night on that very same thing i'm speaking of will be done there will be a power put into the church and now it's coming in that the holy spirit was so annoyed the people till they will speak the word i will create itself right there we haven't seen powers like that coming the church now i knew it for a fact see unto this mountain don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you say shall come to pass you can have what you have said the placing of the church and position where the fullness of the power of the holy ghost comes into the church then the critic's mouth will be shut it will be a short time jesus come right off the mountain when the calvary it won't last long but it will be here let's all stand and give god some worship father we bless your name lord i pray a bless the service lord bless your people for everywhere father god may the holy spirit sweep upon them i mean they recognized
