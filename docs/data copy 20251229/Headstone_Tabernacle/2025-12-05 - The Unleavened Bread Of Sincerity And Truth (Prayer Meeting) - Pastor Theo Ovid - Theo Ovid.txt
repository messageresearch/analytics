Sister Bernardet sending this request. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we thank you for guiding us together tonight, giving us this opportunity to approach your throne in grace and to hear a word from you.

For we surely will meet you. Bless again the words that be shared tonight. Take me out of the way and be magnified in our midst and deal with the hearts and lives of your children this night in Jesus ask it. Amen and amen. God bless you. Thanks again for being here. We always consider it a privilege to meet and if you could in a position to put on your your um your mirror, your screen, we appreciate it. see smiles tonight. So that is very very good. Okay. So there's something on my heart I'd like to share with you tonight. And um you want to turn our Bibles to 1 Corinthians 5. We want to read verse 6 and 8 6 to 8. And Paul was speaking to some condition in the church and he's saying in verse 6 of 1 Corinthians chapter 5:6 your gloring is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leavenveneth the whole lump? Purge out therefore the old leaven that he may be a new lump as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us. Therefore, let us keep the feast, not with leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleaven bread of sincerity and truth. This feast is a fasting. This verse eight here, I read it again. Therefore, let us keep the feast or the fast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but the unleaven bread of sincerity and truth. So, I have a title tonight, the unleaven bread of sincerity and truth. Purge out therefore the old leaven is that that first one and the second one is purge the out there for the old leaven and Paul here is lightning malice and wickedness as living something that would make that lump of your life raise like a bread okay so let's go malice the word malice is a desire to harm someone. Malice is ill will. Malice is vicious intentions. It is one of the destructive fruit of the sinful human nature. Malice, a desire to harm someone or the feeling of pleasure at someone's misfortune. Like somebody said, "Good for him. Good, good, it happened." Malice is often the cause of false accusations. Malice is connected to corrupt inner motive and evil intent of the heart. You cannot have malice by accident. Malice by its nature is intentional. It's intentional. It's an intentional act to hurt others or get pleasure from the misfortune of others. Malice is likened unto yeast which raises the whole lump of dough. And that is why Paul said, "Purge out therefore the old leaven." In other words, get the leaven out of your system. Get the malice out. Get whatever it is. Then he used the word wickedness. and wickedness. The state of being wicked. A mental disregard for justice, righteousness, truth, honor, virtue, evil in thought and life, depravity, sinfulness, criminality. This is Proverbs 15:8. The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord, but the prayer of the upright is his delight. The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the Lord, but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness. Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way, and he that hateth reproof shall die. Now, this malice and this wickedness that Paul was speaking about here, he wasn't talking to unbelievers. He wasn't talking to people outside the church. He was talking to church folks. And he is saying we need to get rid of all this stuff and replace it with or have the unleaven bread of sincerity and truth. Now sincere sincere means free from pretense or deceit proceeding from genuine feelings honest pure true. So the definition of sincere being in reality to be you know sometimes you hear me sometimes at funeral I say it was a story of a of people went to a funeral and and when they started to talk about the person in the box in the coffin somebody get have to look to see if they're in the right church because what they're saying about that person in that box and what they know the person to be is not the same thing. So being sincere is having the character which correspond with the appearance. So in other words, you line up with your testimony. You line up with what come out your mouth. Sincerity, the absence of pretense, deceit, hypocrisy, genuiness, truthfulness. Sincerity is the virtue of one who communicates and acts in accordance with the entirety of their feelings, belief, thoughts, desires in a manner that is honest and genuine. That is being sincere. Now the scripture we read speak about the unleaven bread of sincerity and truth. Now I wrote this here. Before you can be sincere, you have to come to the knowledge of the truth of what you are. You can't be sincere when you don't know you. When you are acting, when you are putting on a show or image. I remember years ago the Lord was speaking to my heart certain things and one of the things Lord dealt with me is considering impersonating or copying others and I saw it this way that if you are impersonating let's say I'm impersonating brother Clarence and I say Lord kill me then who is going to kill the Clarence I'm impersonating or me now if I am in Clarence B or operation or way or mannerism and I say Lord I want to die kill me Lord kill me which which God say which one you acting like Clarence yes they know who you are yet so to die you have to come to you this is very very important because this is where Jacob got to a place where he was alone and he could see himself and he could see the truth about himself. Now, when Jacob was ripping off his family, ripping off his father-in-law, ripping off anybody could rip off, he ripping off. He is a ripoff artist. In his mind, he is seeing himself as successful. In his mind, he is seeing himself as winning. He is seeing himself as achieving. And from a natural standpoint, when you look at Jacob, he is successful. His fox has grown, you know, spreading wide. I mean, the man is living large, but his fears of meeting his brother give him away as a defeated man, as a weak man, as a man despite his stature in life, despite the office that he held, he was weak and he knew it. And God got Jacob to a point where Jacob could see himself. And this is what I should say. Jacob could see himself. And the truth about himself and then he could confess. Who are you? I'm a trickster. I'm a deceiver. And then he can be sincere in wanting transformation. So you cannot really come to sincerity unless you come to truth. This is the same with the prodigal son. He was making style, have a fancy car, spend his money, buying the pizza and the works, having a lot of friends and so on. When misfortune hit him and he was pretending that everything was fine because he still had good clothes to display on the outside, but the pig food nobody was seeing him eating on the inside. But when the Bible said he came to himself, he came to the truth of where he was at and he recognized this is not right. This doesn't make sense. This is foolishness. I may as well be a servant in my father's house. And that is where something changed and something switched. So when Jacob came to the place where he could admit, I'm a trickster. I'm a deceit. He can be sincere. I will not let you go until you bless me. Until I'm transformed, and he was transformed. It will take God to reveal you. Making excuses. Listen carefully. Blaming others does not solve you or your problem. I want to repeat that again. Making excuses, blaming others does not solve you or your problem. You still have to see you in the So God brought them out of Egypt. God brought us out of the world. And he gave them this symbol of unleaven bread and no east, nothing added to it. And he tell them how he want them to eat it. So it's not a matter of what but how. And in all things of God there is always a fine print not just of what he wants but how he wants it done. Not what to do but how he wants it done. And I want to bring this part to a close here by saying this. This is David coming to his true self before God. He fell in sin. He fell with this woman Bashiba. No excuses, no blaming others, no sidehows, no deflections or deceitful disinformation. Just the truth from the inward parts from his heart. He had sinned and he is now before God. He's not saying, "Well, you know, if Bashiba didn't go up there, I might not look." And none of that. So, this is David in Psalms 51. David starts off, "Have mercy upon me, oh God, according to thy loving kindness. According to the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin." Note, David not pointing his fingers at anybody. He's not blaming. He's not accusing. He's not saying this, that, and no, he's not doing that. Verse three, for I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, and thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight, that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest. Behold, I was shapen iniquity. That's truth. In sin did my mother conceive me. That is also truth. Behold, thou desire in the inward parts. So God, we could pretend and try to impress people with the words we say, but God is who sees a heart. And David is identifying it here in this way. Thou desires truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part. Thou shall make me to know wisdom. David continues, purge me with hissup and I shall be clean. Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow. Make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken may rejoice. Hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities. Create in me and that's we sing that song so much. Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away. Cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit. Then will I teach transgressions thy ways. So David understood in that condition he can't teach anybody except he be purged except he be cleansed. Then I will teach transgression thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee. Deliver me from blood guiltiness. Oh God, thou God of my salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. Oh Lord, open thou my lips and my mouth shall show forth thy praise. For thou desire not sacrifice else I would give it. So this is David. It's very clear to him. Listen to these words. For if thou desire not for thou desire not sacrifice as I would give it. In other words, he is saying if there is something I could do to bring me out of this condition to make an atonement for this condition, I will do it. Then he said these words, thou delightest not in burnt offering. So the physical efforts and your body to be burned and and killing oxen and goats and everything else. He said you know that delight is not in burnt offering. And then he said these words the sacrifices of God a broken spirit a broken and contrite heart. Oh God I will not despise. So we see here David clearly came to himself. David clearly wasn't making excuses and David was deeply. Now God's truth is the means by which he get things done. We are to become a reflection of the truths we believe and practice. Not just belief but the practice. What we practice is what would make the difference. Now many things are not innate in us. Many things are not built into us. We have to acquire them. Like the Bible say, put on the new man. Throw off the old man. We have to acquire skills, talents. We have to acquire, if you're learning a foreign language, acquire language, acquire new skill, acquire new information, study, application, and so on. Practice, not just a belief. And Boran said this in oneness. Now keep those things in mind. The church, here we go, must believe every word, every promise, every iota and claim it for themselves. One, two, here continuation and exercise themselves in it. So when Jesus washed disciples feet, he say don't understand. I don't know what I'm doing. Let me do my do. He wash their feet. Then he begin to give them a testimony on that. He said, "I am your lord and master. Look what I'm doing. I want you to do that for one another." It's not that they are accustomed doing that for one another. He is setting an example for it to practice, for they to exercise. Okay? We get that. So the church must believe every word, every promise, every iota and claim it for themselves and exercise themselves in it. Psalms 81 11 God speaks but my people would not hearken to my voice and Israel would none of me they don't want me. Yes. So I give them up unto their own hearts lust and they walked in their own councils. Oh, that my people had hearkened unto me and Israel had walked in my and this is where God set up a ministry. God set up a pastor to bring counsel, to bring advice. And if people don't want to hear the voice of God which will come through the ministry, if they don't want to hear that, God would leave them up to their own hearts these hours and you'd find yourself in trouble making poor decisions, wrong decisions, off decision and sometime when you make a bad turn. Sometime it take not just months but years to get back on track. United States have some some long highways and so on and when you miss a turn to go way way way down sometime it throw you off half an hour hour two hours a round turn so friends we have to have a desire to hear God's voice to take to ask questions to ask information to ask for prayer ask for guidance that's what this is about oh Matthew eating tree going good. I said verily I say unto you this is Jesus speak except you be converted and become as little children he shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. This is Jesus bringing a compar of how we are to become. Let's look at a child. A child is completely honest. A child is without guile. A child is completely trusting. A child is completely sincere. A child is completely open, completely dependent. And Jesus said this, except you become as little children, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. What is guile? Gu is shrewdness, being skilled in deception. The synonym of guile is craft, cunning, foxiness, craftiness, gilliness, deceptive cunning. Guile goes beyond simply lying to include insidious cunning craftiness and the use of trickery to mislead others. Guile deals with lack of integrity is a contrast to righteousness and guile have negative consequences. Psalms 32:2 blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputes no guile and in whose spirit there is no guile. 1 Peter 3:10, for he that would love life and see good deeds, let him refrain his tongue from evil that they speak no guile. So we have to get closer to what we speak on our heart to be the same. In other words, you become deeply sincere. Now this has nothing to do with ministry or post or position. This have nothing to do with prophet, pastor, teacher, evangelist, apostle. The office doesn't change this because when God look at the prophet's heart, he says you have been given power but be more sincere. It meant that the Lord himself sees something that needs attention and the prophet went and had a time of fasting to deal with what God saw as of lack of sincerity. And in trying to do God as it was without it being God's will, he says how we thank you God. As we set in this solemn moment almost like a funeral for we are facing a burial of a dying dead world, a dying dead church. Father we completely Lord Jesus bless thy people. Father bring sincerity and deepness to the hearts of the people. May we get off those fragile bubble dancing. Settle down into the deep riches of the honey of God. Grant it, Lord. Keep our hearts established with love. Okay, we almost there. Matthew 16. Are you hearing me clear out there? Are you hearing me? Okay. See, there's some kind of internet issue here. All right. Matthew 16. And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread, which is physical bread, literal bread. And Jesus said unto them, "Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees." And Jesus is very interested in how he presents, you know, the word to the people and the reason among themselves saying, "Is it because we have take no bread?" Which when Jesus perceived faith, why reason among yourself? because you have brought no bread. Do you not understand? Neither remember the five loaves of the 5,000. How many basket you took up? Neither the seven loaves or the 4,000 and how many baskets you took up. How is it that you do not understand that what I speak? It is not to you concerning bread that he should beware of the le of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Then they understood how he bid them not beware of the leaven of bread but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. So doctrine could come as le doctrine could come and pump people up the wrong way. It could make people feel superior, greater than, more revelation than more spiritual than closer to Jesus than more bright than. That is doctrine doing that. All of that is that's how Jesus saw it. Beware of the living of the Pharisees. Are you with me? All right. So, we talk about malice, destructive nature, desire to harm someone or pleasure someone's misfortune. But this is where I'm going to wrap up here. You know this story we touch it many a times and baram talk about a vision he had and this vision was that of this black mambber everybody was afraid of it and there was such a danger in these days and this great heist thing was death when it strikes you and he said there's nothing as poisonous as a mambber and the snake of course represents sin and death so that what this is about okay now he said, "Uh, going to skip now." And he said, "Um," and he was on the highway. I thought, "Well, this is it." So, I look at him talking about the mamba. He was looked at angry at me. He licked his tongue and here he come and he got right close to me. He would run off fast and then he would get slower and slower, just quiver, stop. Then something would hold him off. He couldn't bite me. So even though this was a dangerous snake, a deadly snake, it couldn't harm but a brown and he would turn around the other side, try to approach on the other side. He would get back, get a start, swish right slower. Then he would shake like that and move back. He couldn't strike me. Then he turned and looked at my friend and always he went after my friend and I seen my friend just jumping way in the air over him over him and and trying and just trying to strike him. I thought, "Oh, if it ever hits him, it'll be instant death. No wonder everybody is so scared because when this it is instant death and it was just striking at him like that and I threw up my hands I said oh God have mercy on my brother. If that serpent ever strikes him it will kill him. And just then the serpent turned to me when I said that and look at me again and a voice came from above and said, "You have been given power to bind him the worst." And I said, "Well, God, what must I do?" He said, "There is one thing you must do. You must be more sincere. You must be more sincere." I said, "God, forgive me for my insincerity. Let me have sincerity." And when I raised up my hands to him again, there was a great something came over me and lifted me up. Seemed like it my whole body was charged with something. And I looked at the serpent and he started towards me and he couldn't do it. And I said, "Satan, in the name of the Lord Jesus, I bind you." And a blue smoke flew out of him. He curled up and make like a sign like a S a S backward and and means bind this one or anything below him because he was the worst. Blue smoke fell out of him. His tail choke his own self to death around his head and he made this backward S like a sign like a hand sign and the brother was free and I went over and mashed on it. I said, "Now, I've got to find out about this because it's a and and and and then a voice came unto me also." I said, "Satan, that I might know, I unbind you." And when it did, he started coming to life again, wiggling, and then I said, "I bind you back in the name of Jesus Christ." And when it did, the smoke flow of him again, and he choked himself right back and turned into crystal. And then when he did that, that voice said, Now you must be more sincere than what you are to do this. Then it left me and I was standing in the room. Now this is a very very important lesson because the issue wasn't but a brown. The snake couldn't strike him. The snake couldn't bite him. The snake couldn't kill him. But it could kill his friend. I'll say it this way to you tonight. It could kill your wife. It could kill your husband. It could kill your children if you are protected. It could kill a loved one, someone close to you. So what I'm saying to you, we, not just you, we in this room here tonight is confronted with the unleaven bread of sincerity and truth to be more sincere because you want God to hear and answer your prayer. Not just for you, but for those around you. Maybe you are fine, maybe you are covered, maybe you are protected, maybe all is well around you. We are not talking about that. How are you going to feel if you know this mamba that cannot bite you or hurt you could hurt your family, your friends, your loved ones, someone close to you all because it's given into your hands to be more sincere that God could work through you because he said by and through the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised. I'm going to close. Oh, praise the Lord. Oh yeah. All right. What about now? Then it left me. I was standing in the room. So I slipped off into the den room. I got down on my knees. I said, "Lord Jesus, I don't know these things. What must I do? The children will be calling me to take them to school in a few moments." I look around. I said, "Lord, if you will forgive me, I do not believe in open up the scripture and taking something out of the Bible. But Lord, in case of emergency, he said, "Uh, the kids will be in an hour yet before they be gone. Could you show me?" I took the Bible and pulled it open like that. My thumb was laying at 1 Corinthians the 5th chapter in the 8th verse. Hallelujah. Tonight, and it says, "When you come to this feast, which a fast is in the body is a feast with the Lord." We know that. So when you come to this feast, don't come with the old leaven or the leaven of malice and so forth, but come with the unleaven bread of sincerity and truth. Just exactly what he told me in the vision. God is my solemn judge. Come with the unleaven bread of sincerity and truth. And that is the word. Then I seen what he meant as he years ago when I see the Bible come down. God, it wrote here and a hand came from heaven and pointed down to Joshua and I read the first nine verses and Joshua come out of the wilderness and he said, "This day I will begin to magnify you among the people." So I went to the woods and prayed and prayed and fasted in studying church history. And yesterday I wound up with the complete life of St. Martin and in the very secret of his power was in humility before God. And we find today that the church yet teaching its power and teaching the signs to follow the believer. Yet we find them puffed up. Big me little you. It isn't like that early church. You see they were humble, kind to one another, sweet understanding. It was so much different today. And I wonder if a lot of this hasn't sidetracked us from the real kernel of the message that we want to humble ourselves. The more humbler you can be, the better God can use you. And I'm finished for tonight. Let us bow. Almighty God, I was doing some work outside and these words came to my heart. the unleaven bread of sincerity and truth. I pray God that it will mean something to your people tonight that is not fasting because the church is fasting fasting because the pastor called fasting fasting because this is what we do and like we just stay hungry or stay without anything but it's not so much the what but the how. How you want us to do it. I remember brother Brandon give a story of a husband and wife and they're custom kissing each other and they had a fussing and quarreling and they just do it from a traditional standpoint. When the husband had left the house going his way, his wife, you know, his wife wasn't in a nice mood. Something wasn't right. He turned back and when he kissed it a second time, it was different. It had feelings in it. It wasn't a performance for the neighbors to see. It was real. Oh God, help us to come down from floating on this religious seesaw or Mary go wrong and on the ground to be sincere in heart, to be truthful, to be honest, to be genuine, to be real, to be authentic, to be original. No put on, no makeup, no acting, no performance. just what we are. David said it so beautifully. Have mercy upon me, oh God. Unto thee have I sinned. But Isaac mentioned it about confession even in the last Bible studies that we had. It's not fairy tale. Lord, you didn't put a ministry among your people for idol or just to waste time or to be a front, but you speak, you put it there that truth could come, Lord, present in truth that will minister to the needs of the people. You know exactly what is in each heart here tonight. And you know why the Holy Spirit brought these words to your people. May their praying tonight be different. God, we can't even get to that spot yet to pray for our enemies. That's what you tell us to do. Pray for those who despitefully use you and and so on. And and you you said how we supposed to be among the the children of darkness, among this world, that we should be like lights, not like darkness ourselves, but we should be reflectors of light, the true light that light up every man that comes into this world. and you send this end time message that we could be like real lamps, like real lighthouses, shining in our homes, shining in our communities, shining wherever we go. Father, I pray tonight that you bless your people. May your grace come to them. May they realize that if you could tell a prophet that is protected, that is covered, that the mama cannot bite him, to be more sincere, and that sincerity is to apply to see his brothers delivered, to see his brothers protected, to see his brothers covered much more for us. Oh God, help us tonight to take charge of this responsibility that you place upon us as called the elected in this hour. God, many has listened to tapes. Many have read books and that's as far as it reach. What they hear, what they read, what they know and understand. There is no application, there is no practice, there's no effort. But Lord, you said faith without works is dead. You call us to apply it. You call us to claim. You call us to believe. You call us to seek after you, Father. Oh God. Lord, you said that people seek after me, but their heart is far from me. Don't let it be so tonight. But create in me a clean heart with spirit. Create in us a revival. Renew a right spirit. A right quality of spirit that you could say, "Wow, this is my people. They getting right back on track with sincerity and truth." And remember the prophet talking about people sending others to offer up lambs for them. No sincerity at all. They just know it as a tradition. Offer up a lamb, offer up this, offer up that. They're not even going themselves to lay hands to be identified with the death of that man. Here we are tonight, Lord, after 50 something plus years of this end time message on this earth. Here we are going on to a crucial time, going down to the end of time, the time of the end. Oh God, the closing of the gentile dispensation. And here we are asking for a supernatural intervention in homes, in marriages, in lives, in finances, in every condition in the church. For the sickest body on the earth is the bride of Jesus Christ. That's what the prophet said. And the only thing to heal it is brotherly love. It's the spirit of forgiveness. There's a even have to go to the person. If they know somebody have something on them, they could go to them and talk to them. But if they have a they could just simply drop it, let it go and do like if it doesn't exist, it doesn't is have no way to go back to it, Lord. and they could free themselves to enter into a perfect fate where you could honor their fate. Father, forgive us as we forgive those who trespass against us, oh God, for that is the kingdom upon the glory. Oh God, give us this day truly our daily bread. Give us daily strength. Give us your daily mercy. Give us your daily grace. Bless the elders. Bless the officers. Bless the ministry, Father. Bless all the helps, Father. Pour out your love upon them. Deliver the backsliders and restore them. Send a revival. I said a charge into the church this coming Sunday. Father, may your power explode. May people, oh God, hit the altar. Father, may lives be transform and change. Oh God, may the witness of the spirit come down. May the pillar of fire come down like it came down on Mount Si. May it come upon your people and may there be such a transformational experience in the lives of your children, Father. Oh God, as we said, Jacob came to his own before he could be sincere to said, I will not let you go till you bless me. and to show how sincere he was. When the angel tried to leave, he said, "No, no, no, no, no. You can't go now. Not, no, no, no. I need a touch. I need something more. I need a inner change in my heart. I need a transformation." And when the angel was finished with him, he had a new walk. He had a new talk. Fear had left him. He was ready to face any situation, any time, any place, on any condition. He was fearless. He was anointed. He was inspired because he had a supernatural encounter. Oh God, tonight I pray for your people. I pray for even the young people, supernatural encounter. Father, arrange it. Set it up, Lord. An appointment with the supernatural. May you come and confirm your word tonight with signs, wonders, and miracles. May you come and confirm your word tonight with healing and deliverances. May you come and confirm your word tonight with the baptism of the Holy Ghost being poured out right in the homes and lives of your children. Oh God, revive the Calebs tonight. Send fire into their faith. Send fire into their heart. Send fire into their lives. Send fire into the homes tonight. Oh God, send down that quickening power. Oh God, send a revival that will strike the headstone tabernacle. Oh God will be noised, Lord Jesus. The voice of rejoicing is in the tabernacle of the righteous. The Lord had chasened me so but he had not given me over unto death. Oh God grant it, Father. Oh granted. We see it, Lord. The rejected stone is become the headstone. Lord send down the dynamics to the mechanics. Send on the Holy Ghost among your people and empower them in faith to believe you for all things granted God in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. Give the Lord some praises right where you are. Praise the Lord. We love him tonight. We thank God for his mercy. We thank God for his grace and we looking to see exactly what this the Lord will do among us tonight. So God bless you as we get on in prayer. God be with you. Praise the Lord. Heat. Heat.
