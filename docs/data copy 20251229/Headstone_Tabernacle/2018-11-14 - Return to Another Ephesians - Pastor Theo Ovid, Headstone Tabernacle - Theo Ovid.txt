verse 1 to 10 script everything tonight Ephesians chapter 2 God if he's just after two we have a voice one on you had he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins where it in time passed he walked according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of Wrath even mother's sooner was no differentiation at all but God but God who is rich in mercy for his great love where he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved and that raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of His grace in his kindness towards us to Christ Jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith I'm not of us it is a gift of God not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them may God bless his word amen you may be seated oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah how many feel good to be here how many feel good to be in the presence of God and where the tools and trees are gathered there we are there he is in the midst amen praise God but tonight our title returned to another Ephesians we turned to know if you just last time we spoke with him with us when zero but return to that first love getting back to that love getting back to that word isn't that right and we spoke about the food on his act please God the passion to know his word the cry for reaching over his spirit or begins to feed and instead of the church being on fire with the fire of God has cooled off and become a bit formal that is what was happening back to Ephesians they were getting formal the abandonment that God was dying out and the people want to careful about what God thought of them as they begin to be careful our what the world thought of them so you see when they come to that spot where you're more concerned about what God thinks about your mother husband father brother wife what about you doesn't matter what people say humans you want to study what God says Oh God feel about your life how God feel about your actions and your attitude and so on then it be so Ephesians Ephesus knees relaxed driftin a mat and relax and higher aims but they got relaxed and we can't afford to get relaxed that's why we want to push up the key a bit have that all-night prayer meetin you want to keep adding and adding an errand because we want to know we making that progress you say butter mom says you got to do something for water honor there are people who do like new kind of sacrifice they want what a bless em as they are you see but you see we once were sinners we once in lust we wanted all kind of stuff but God written but God rich rich rich and mercy had weakened us that's the word we want to emphasize tonight quicker quick and us hallelujah lively hope quicken us to a higher order thickeners what has to quicken you that's why all the father phone you called email you have to be called of God to be quickened hallelujah nonny let cannot be quickened but you can be quickened think about it now you were down in sin you were doing whatever but what quick on you and give you a sound that you may see that you could put your foot and walk that's why we could come and worship that's what I could come and express your feet and love to go on because he actually quit can you understand these people are just trying to press to go to church like they stand up to peel the plane lot oh I'm gonna say them or something like that no no no their lineups it to play lotto they line up to take the gamble then line up the ones on so like that but they're not line up to come in a church go out too quick on you and then your soul is being fed by the word you can be service because your soul is being fed by the word every service are getting strengthened every service are getting quicker every service again in Revelation every service should be empowered and you're going from Greece by grease to grease to grease the green from glory to glory from poet apart from strength to strength glory time evangelism this is background in from last week according to Malachi 4 used to bring back the faith that was once delivered to the Saints bring them back to the faith of the fathers the Pentecostal part in the restoration time this message is yet to see the Pentecostal part hallelujah we have message Pat teach and Pat word pack but as a Pentecostal part in the restoration time we have to move into that part that's the Holy Ghost part that's a spirit part that's the quickening pact that's where the quittin power comes within the word who you owe glory God hallelujah understand what the holy wasn't for to anoint the promises to yourself or glory that the promises that oh dear the promises is here because you are pointing it to yourself you have the spirit to anoint it to you or that's right just what that's a key like I say if the Lord be with me if this krypton power be with me if this anointing be with me if the Spirit be with me I shall be able to or give the Lord a shout in us do you understand he wasn't talking intellectual talking or he was talking spirit talk if the spirit be with me when the Spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart you see what David did when the Spirit come upon him what Samson did when the Spirit come upon him all those brothers when the Spirit come upon them that's a different thing altogether that's a different man altogether the spirit have to come upon you oh good I want that switch off on you tonight that you must know you have to go back to another Ephesians we don't want a Corinthian church we don't want the Latian church all that is good that's Scripture we want Ephesians we won the original because you can breathe back the original little plant and get back the original or glory to God hallelujah your concrete battle hybrid no mule Oh blowing Oh God original turbine horse you could get back that because he knew his father is his grandfather is he a thoroughbred horse and when they get a true word believer he is thoroughbred just chopped the word at him and is a big hearty Amen just deliver the word to him and because that's nothing but the truth that's a thoroughbred horse believer a thoroughbred word believer you don't want gorgeous you don't want God to bless you in your own thing there you want to come out of that you want to be quick and like the scripture says hallelujah we were once this way once that way but corner quickness in today's high order but above the animals but a little lower than the Angels Oh glory love God so it's a Pentecostal part in the restoration time I'll restore see it the Lord now everything is hybrid even they got hybrid churches not only hybrid corn hybrid churches hybrid Christians took in my shaking hands they can just better use that the English and so forth but that ain't got no life in it you take a big fine a of corn hybrid maybe it's twice as pretty as the other one plant it it will die because I have no life in it we don't want nothing hybrid we want the genuine thing do you want a genuine thing you haven't got it still it still stay there till it comes my accepts a substitute when the Pentecostal sighs are full of real nothing hybrid it won't stand you always have to spray a hybrid plant to keep the bugs over it and that's the way with some of these hybrid Christians you have to baby them promise them they'll be eaten and all kind of things I give the bully bugs if they get if they're what what what if it if you otherwise you want to leave the church you might join a lot you can join a Methodist Lodge Baptist Pentecostal Lodge but you can never come to Christ but if you ever come to Christ you will be born into the church the mystical body of Jesus Christ you are no more a hybrid you know mother hitchhiker trying to top me way to heaven anybody can I ride you can't tell me way to heaven you have to be born again that's the first message Jesus preached you must be born again what I'm father give me first birth but this is a second bit this is the new birth you have to be born again you say how of the world and the spirit not world only it has to be wood and spirit I said again not word only it has to be wood and spirit not a bleeding message only it has to be the equipment power the spirit and that's put me in mind all of these so-called hybrid Christians they have hybrid church until they got the disease of spiritual amnesia they can't reproduce nothing again they talk about hybrid corn hybrid corn is nothing it's the worst thing ever putting them out anything hybrid that's the season you have hot dead plants the reason of my plants and hybrid stuff straight dr. baby it but that genuine thoroughbred you don't have to put more disinfect on him he's got power within himself to keep the bugs over here never get him free Bible and get him Kentucky chicken to come to church you have encouraged them with this and encouraged jump on that and get him this card I'm shake the hand wrong and whatnot you know thoroughbred terrible go glory to go to my main chi well about five people in the world kindly I said fly or night that one - it's a five people Richard fly or die imagine a tree fly out Oh glory to God I didn't come to them tree I come to the Tula dreaming it was a trick kiss a fire I would imagine that in truth preaching the five people at the mud fly or die I'm saying come to regional church members I guess what some flying some still alive tonight still flying look what I can do is still flying over 50 plus years still fly oh those were the days man or rocket gospel boy Damon that wasn't a gas lamp you know what nothing less easy I was on a gas lamp God when you look back noise it had to be a crazy preacher here be some than a crazy man wasn't crazy was the reality that this message come to haunt the elected seats but a fisherman caught his net is fishy gonna catch you know but when he pulling in her crab snake wanna be all kind of thing bring Nicole all of that but his fishy want and God selling the catfish from fish identity bar some fish smoking and drinking some fiction swims and sin but gotta to find them we think what fine you you look look look at me like a born a Christian what God find you wherever you are you have to hunt you wanna find you then then you know look at you you had it quicken if you're not quitting here you will be quickened because the seat alone can be quicken or give the Lord a shelter knows only to see the loan can be reborn when God created a church he created a Pentecostal church no no dead message sitting on chairs talking about the original church that official church was a Pentecostal church that means that shouting singing and jumping praise God Pentecostal clapping you can't tap something is wrong because ex-factory Pentecostal experience then leaves clapping and then the work of the bingo fruit in the midst of that Pentecostal atmosphere before God cos in a prophet he had to send on the atmosphere 19:06 the atmosphere top-down and even before that God said behold I set before you an open door so he put a blood rain in the age we fall out he's here to bring the spirit itself without no man messenger or give the Lord a show he said before thee an open door I thought was normal open a new mental shut and God open the door to the spirit putting a man inside of here so your duty now man to promote the spirit of the law so the spirit is already here he believed that the dynamics is here if we could only get started God will do the rest we have to get started let's get started tonight we went back to Ephesians then fight for the door the Corinthian church the thorn Hebrews babies you don't want legal a second donations you're doing them simple Corinthians you want Ephesian Church you becomes God's workmanship Oh hallelujah every good work you become God's workmanship he is working on you tonight to be really something out of you all glory to God you are going to be a Woodman ship not our man but the workmanship of God shout why you think the Lord Himself descended from heaven with a message a message I don't have a message God set the message we are echoing a message from a twentieth century prophet your hearts in your hands back to the faith in the flowers because the faith is to go back and pick up what they have back there I want nothing less than that I want another Ephesians I know all our messages are not Ephesians I'm a bunch of people sitting there warming a judgment is another visions you must think it's we could claim it believe it walk into it supercharge some of another Ephesians I just read a little deduction personal Ephesians or glory of God in Ephesians you have a faithful ministry in Ephesians husband loved their lives in Ephesians turn Albania parents all of us any features we brush them against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers or irrational decisions for the Tablas finish in Ephesians whatchamacallit Ephesians Calabrese blood in his visions rights will be any husband's NEC sons husband luck their lives or cattle or - of all relative Ephesians he went back to that be going back to that honey features have to faith that was once delivered to the Saints be going back to that preacher fit but hang on to you the bride has to see the test have to hear the clip after war after war is not a half season in this original championship match Ephesians was caught heavyweight champions our original undefeated undisputed that was the original church masterpiece that's a man bacala makin such as I have give he was association put mission to do anything Peter was standing alone he said this was never done before anybody abused before everybody wasn't asking a question what was the precedent lawyers can be so miserable he could have my president when course I do think I know precedent Anatomy this was never done before all right right right right now the lawyers have talked about in the case studies all right the law says show and ten years ago and this judge see so and so but God only with that mysterious this still precedent doctor say what this case was ever here before and when you saw Berenson we understand all things are possible [Music] who's they they that believe they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover or glory a good day boys that believed not them who do Milly forget them that's kryptonite for them but then I believe that's you I'm talking about I am a believer you are believe her it's millions upon the sickness shall recover oblak they shall speak in new tongues that's not the Pentecostal thing that is weakling or cuz I wanna show tongues get a bad name but that is our team that is Sigma 16 in action we shall speak with new tongues on them [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'm Paul indicated that when the snake bit him and he the snake off honestly didn't kill him you shake it off show you the power of the blood is more powerful and snake poison think about don't think about it the power of the blood of Jesus is more powerful than snake poison was a Pentecostal church do we get that a Pentecostal church filled with the Holy Ghost men and women led by the Spirit of God not a man from somewhere stiff neck are not circumcised he was a pity it was no preacher he say you do resist the Holy Ghost man watch watch a panic on such a favour the Holy Ghost men and women led by dispersed but man cordon leave that alone he wanted to hydrate the church so he bred the world with the theology doctrines in all the nation you see they could argue over that because they might talk to better than your tortured doctrine that wasn't what one had in beginning co-pending we copy talking explain to my the doctrine because he was an unknown fisherman all he had was defeat that was delivered and defeat was Jesus Christ in him see when you have defeat education doesn't count because the wisdom of God is right on the shoulder [Music] [Applause] so that is like whatever choose a man named soul over until in the poor because he was in the enemy camp a soul so what are you offering because what Modi neither educated man together in them scriptures to break the old testament and reveal the New Testament so he couldn't get Peter to do that get a final not Jews an educated man a learned man but fill that with the Holy Ghost so when that sigh up fill in the pores for fall/winter the desert know he won the same gonna go to ten commandments such a right ball to get ball revelation and force I do in my revelation I walk with Jesus I am pissed with Jesus I have walked on Galilee I see this I see that but I all a prison of Jesus Christ i paul an apostle to the Gentiles well blowing according any man thick enough to be spiritual let it not know what I said it's the commandments of the Lord that's a man sent from God he could speak for God they could speak like God Oh get the Lord our shelter [Applause] ibaka take Paul Fricke mover hallelu support of the double agent hallelujah system thought he was working for but he was always agent of God sky and then poor sad I say what you think you to send up a traditionally Pharisee of Pharisees I like porn in dis and only that and I come back a done a fully qualified the top o night O Holy talking so you can be no Pharisees into me I am our the flesh of the Pharisees I knew this thing well good man this flesh thing I know this thing I know this gum and his tall hat and all this varies and tears and what that I know what all that it open scene I was pushing in the chest obscene talk I had sealed I was running that down point a merciful me my voice and fire to run me down I got truly of my house or Paulina I know who is and I know who I am Oh glory to God give a loaner show [Music] so don't give up lending anybody rancid air like a bloodhound we'll go after them holy woods go after them pray for them we still believe in God I've caught that delivers the call that rescues a core that restores okay the law and I showed you that when I said yes so you can't miss an event tonight he could break the pants off for you under weights off on your life that is what the gospel is form the upper room to wait there until the Holy Ghost come upon him to be ordained ministers of the Lord but highbreed and bringing the church and the theology instead of letting the Holy Spirit lead it they bred in bishops general overseers when the Holy Spirit is called originally of the church they hybrid the church and they did chicken they did the same with the mule you did the same with everything as I present making it different prison in the world basketball games soup suppers Bunco game all kind of things it's prettier bigger build and polish lots of people singing is more orderly in the notes in the notes of sometimes we sing as information and we said the inspirational we need more inspirational informational because we have to get in the spirit Oh glory to God hallelujah please God you old-fashioned Pentecost of a tambourine and the guitar but it hasn't got the seed it hasn't got a ring to it life is right inside readin God wants it the way that admitted to the beginning so the church has been hybrid and know it come to a place where the church is more like a lunch any Church never though that left its original foundation has never be able to come again I know people don't like this but it is the truth when God sent luta yellow revival he swept the world but they organized it hybrid over the world and they produce a Catholic child when they did what did he do he would use a bunch of renegades hybrids never rolls and never arrives along come John Wesley safety after the messenger Gandhi pull seven a gourd gone they hybrid it and that's it now here we go let's take a tree of feet now Eve taking of this forbidden tree of unbelief then we can we got tears come out of it it was feet she disbelieved God's would go to the citizens and thing will happen she what to have left it alone she ought not believe that the way God said about know sit on committees theology mixed it gives you given to Adam it cause a hybrid feet it's a fit and it have hybrid feet and that's what the church so call have a hybrid feet it is mixed are you ready this fate is Mitchell fears don't frustration if it was genuine feel it would move genuine faith will say God said so that's why the Prophet said when a church is believing that the Holy Ghost is just as real as it was under the authentication how they grown and crying but when they are bored and positionally born then God sets in the church pastors teachers I don't never be breached when they believe the Holy Ghost is just as real your dormant unless Holy Ghost they don't want a modern world Eagles get over the interpretation Holy Ghost they don't want to be the Holy Ghost before getting the Holy Ghost you want the same illegal got celery a penny toss Nora Bulls nose but the whole yourself the same one people Danza fire sat upon them and the pirate said they were filled with the Holy Ghost the Bible never said they were the Holy Ghost as a full revelation please God no no no they were filled with it I mean but her mom said I believe so we got the Holy Ghost but you have enough to stuff right I want going to fill every fiber European you know

building and although he will be taken out it has to happen because we have to put back to one of the Ephesians we have to fall back to that first love that love descended it was upon them it was the bond of perfectness was charity the price absolute Oh glory not caught up on a bunch of people that that love concealed may be seated that love can feel go see if the prostituting going to pull the

coming of the Lord Oh glory to God a man he said stay away from it it's evil it brings down maybe I'll be healed that's everything that's Church faith we want courts feet then he say why wish my words were wrote with an iron pen stay with what God said it's the truth hybrid feet really booster Tina said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and when higher if I come and say well in a sitting way in a sitting really dizzy you guys are you see my noticing every same condition come here after after seminary he has to forgive the same way you have to heal the same way you have to reason that the same way Devils have to cast out the same wing because he's the same yesterday that the other Ella you have to prove that in this message it can be caught was with Berta ranima where is God today no he's the same yesterday today and forever he is still a God of miracles but you have to believe in miracles you have to want a miracle you have to be expecting a miracle we are looking for America a work of our own soul for your own cycling on body for your spirit so I don't want you to be contented I want you to shake off that spirit of contentment but I want mess up the message the day b-besides over the past I have added sure it's nice already elders a bit EQ everybody like winter night Church and that nice world nice teachings and so on and they happy with the man but it's what happy with it it's what happy with the church is the church back to Ephesians what do we have this church not be exhorted and sharing thoughts every Sunday every Wednesday or do we see a as a vision that's my target then that's my golden yeah I'm ivy passenger corinne chest but i went to a destination that's my passion true so we become different churches with a destination you pass to them because it wasn't tally enough to what it's supposed to be but you have to see the vision of we're supposed to be the same right the vision and make it plain and has to have a good vision a scriptural vision God planted original seed where is that tree it had denominational branch grafted in and what keep cutting them off cotton law and the tree keep pushing up pushing up pushing up but at the end another original branch will come forth will produce another original freak because it's God's plantain faith like them other seasoned sided here but the original branches portion we want another Pentecost people say we get them they outright head because we don't want that because we know second one as we don't want that that because with word world would we don't want that we want the same thing we are returning to another leader [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] behind behind but what I realize is had to be translated go glowing either God whatever currency you know the currency is fit you can show what a prayer Bible and say God because I have this in my hand you have to answer my prayer Ubuntu like to kinda like that expect God to answer you because you like together go and say what is that what catch I'm sorry that that can affect the kingdom to candle burning they to or far and really marry that the kingdom what are you hearing that we call it three seas anger a man make that God came here and this man come up to me temple and boy Lord I am not like that melodia I paid types I decided that the Manzano Mesa nothing going to achieve all God have mercy upon me a sinner Jesus GSA which mama righteous man and I outside he recognizes the cinema this man is a sinner a noted not attributed because of what he does to be righteousness and god watch it attribute but I was an event so the confession I'm a sinner you either come in lord have mercy upon me God recommend that I heard of him adam wainwright just because he caught long and he got mad looking white corner look in the garment gonna look at that coat God looking at what's in the heart so it come back to our gospel in the heart and that's what he Peter got converted is a converted now the man is a gateway to be shown the main channel to get long to the womb of your spirit so it has to have a channel which is the main that's where you would have to confess so first is always mental but it jumps into spiritual it drops into the heart and it becomes a divine revelation that you actually possess possess it when it dropped on us outta here if it's yours I wanna jump in your SATA here there is no demon could go beyond their to what God put in your heart and that's why the Prophet said whatever your soul will never fail leave your soul to believe that is yours or blowing overreact one scored leave your sword of faith to believe in that if you want Oh hallelujah praise God or glory you understand that so the woman with the blood issue there was no scripture saying if you touch any garment she took that for herself she told herself that and it went so deep it went like a revelation into her spirit so she was convinced and if she only get here she'd be healed that's why she pushed it when she push if she was on this level when she see the crowd around Jesus back go back home but she said today's my day ain't going nowhere some big big fella stand up there that any intermediate or knock a bunch of men stand a bit twiddling their beers and watching Jesus cookie I shall not do with that they don't believe nothing the only come to try to interpret the master but she come for touch touch the hem of His garment that's all she comes rushing over my touch she comes in he bared his words she comes the question is words she'll come together Porton debating thing a doctrinal theology or Qi what is a touch because she had a problem and she had a need and she needed a pit road and she push a cheap press something struck a heart I went something strike your heart that is how you could push on press if we can strike in half you have no pusher and you have no person you're just thinking about it or glory no cover wants to strike your heart is there wait a minute the mean I could live higher than that wait a minute I could get a picture tonight wait a minute my home to have to have that atmosphere I could change the atmosphere around my life I can live in a higher and when you see that it was personal with the press no let me create atmosphere now you could believe God no or glory leg or are you it with the knife hallelujah glory not God so what the Bible teaches the new birth and there's some heated handshakes everything else a new birth but he can never take the place of the new birth it's got to be an experience to be born again so the intellectual st. a new book is the revelation of Jesus Christ maybe was experienced not as a coat but the promise that new verses experience so the question made after which is first is it an experience or is it revelation those were revelation and stick with version alone the other people just however Elisha so I'm born again but he said a new put got to be an experience something that you know a Brit is a mess so what we see now the religion come first experience come after support the revelation and then go getting experience that's something else quicken in your life we believe that hallelujah glory to God so watch a being a baby is born we all know booties are mess when I baby is born if it's on the floor even in a shop I'm if it's a thing that crazy hospital it's a mess but it brings life and that is what the new bird is it's a mess no no no a mess it's a mess it's a mess but it brings life that's what a new word is it's a mess but it brings life it in style or put on or decoration a crease is about to really go so I will do believe the doctrine you have and I go see it so much I believe it different what are they do it the new bird means quad blood saw the flow inside of you you know what means that you are quickened into life the new birth mean you are son and daughter of God then under the blood of Jesus we get a fellowship because the blood of Jesus covers you it covers me also isn't that right so watch now I know you get up from the altar crying and boo-boo and squealing and slobbering it brother brings life it takes the starch out of you it makes you something you ought to be it takes all the world and stiff neck out of you isn't that right and it you said no what I take Jesus and my personal Caesar today what kind of say I take Jesus for my personal Savior listen that will never take the place of the nooblet when men and women come to the altar and forget where they are and who is wrong them until they rarely die out and are born again all night provisions and the power of the Holy Ghost get back into the church again Oh glory to God and that is why we have an all-night parameter from 10:00 to 6:00 on Friday coming here right here in the church anybody you don't see you tell them don't miss it Oh glory to God hallelujah praise going come on Russ a bit cord come and cry out come and be born again come and do but come and get set free oh please God so men who are born of the Spirit of God is God's sons and daughters they don't mix with the world they're not high grade esteem it God they stay with the program they stay with the Spirit they do want naanum hybrid stuff don't be carried away with hybrid stuff it's not right it will finally come to his end it can't go back when it's hybrid it's finished it can never reproduce yourself again oh my hallelujah freeze God do you believe that glory hallelujah praise the name of the Lord thank you lord so John what was John to do restore the faith the fader was once

the Lord comes that's John mission the Anointed One that's where the manna to bring back the feet all glory to God so oh my hallelujah I'm gonna skip that whole praise a name of the Lord thank you Jesus hallelujah Rory the corn mmm we are which he said version 10 in version 10 we find out the last messenger of the last gage during the time of his prophecy that seven seals would be open the seven mysteries Sevenfold Michigan left off in every age had some left off uniform I didn't have time to take care of it there's a lute I preached justification my feet and he's gone and then come weary sonification not only a penny coaster but we are promised corneration ten going to Malachi 4 are going to look something there's a common Ephesians it is that's the prophecy there's a comma infusion to this and that these Sevenfold missions of the world must be unfolded and it's the loudest an age where this takes place I believe we in the shadow of the coming of the Son of God and as Joshua just before the features raised up so they turned about the razor just before the next Ephesians and we are promised another Ephesians that's a promise that's that's the promise you say what this promise not for in chance not Hebrews not Galatians Ephesians respond that's what you're looking for nice try to come in a church for you want features man I've got to stand in the pulpit one that have Ephesians 4 he's not right past the teacher prophet that's what your mother's either here Oh glory to Corinne Lynn Allen leave a man Karthik a family catechetical support that's been mapped officially Oh glory to man can take a family or whatever it is how could be the image take Kerry hosted or doctor that could go good for Corinthians but divisions so when it features ministers of the lineup of the world when that which is perfect is come that much as pat has done over it well he features is that much is perfect so all this part preaching on Pat ministry and practice that is finished with when we come to visions so when you see it come to read Ephesians ministers will have to sit down who know qualify for that level we didn't talk about being placed and the body and please positions coming back to that it has to be visuals you know have a read the word standard the correct and the Deacons the correct kind of elders everybody ought to stand up to it didn't I tell you I'm abortion oh that is decisions all man Jack lined up for that it's not my standard is quite standard in other words is the prom line when I meant put the plumb line you just hang it like that if you build em crooked it took it died not a plumb line fault you cap then the plumb line you just chopped the plumb line become my show you on straight edges if it's pocket it'd be probably expose it because Ephesians has the problem it has the original line the original world the original scene that's like operationalize in Ephesians the Superman assuredly you know church was not succeed in action is false see though the original Church if you just really pouring it the Lord Himself with everywhere with them Santa knows that we are coming back to that same at 16:20 the Lord Himself went everywhere with them confirming the word with signs following or glory no God we have a confirmation of the world as we breached organized shout oh this is going good tonight hallelujah hallelujah redemption is in two parts come on I'll tell I'm going in to begin with a Catholic or the Methodist or the Baptist but we got to go decisions come on come on come on now becoming to the message but we have to go in teens lesions [Applause] how many messes Macrina go for profit hanging over seven prophet elijah what is good they commented the message but the message the catching divisions God sent Moses to get Israel out each opposed the promised land so you want to build a church in Egypt thank you my gosh if your name even feel right how big it set up send on bricks layer but the promise is not Egypt so when choose if the all the die you say listen give me a pledge when you leave in here not if when you leave don't leave my bones here take my bones with you because resurrection is in the promised land my wedding rapture is is diffusion another a political jet rapture is an official you have to go into bodily features to put the rapture because that's a body fit is that and you have to have wrapped in faith to be changed not hybrid fate rapture in faith that's why raft with hybrid fittest evil its core is a deceitful fate it makes people think because they believe the message they have arriving and that time the on a journey they have to pour nominee visions and it's a battle to get here because it's shortened in front of you or get a little shock or give the Lord a shout be in the world tonight this is dossier the law tonight this is the message nobody wanna cross Jordan before the water is cold it status Allison is depth of what we painted is better what you feel for the last twenty years I really important rocking you because a new season about the Brit upon us don't miss that on my primitive people or - Oh Oh hallelujah the president a seizure oh how the placement Ephesians heavenly places in Christ Jesus are we gonna strike it I know we gonna hit it you know it's just gonna hit Ephesians I was raised up for this I believe I was born for this we go to hit another Ephesians nobody could stop it nobody is hindering you nobody's in there in me it's just a fate that God said it we believe it that just settles it Oh glory to God we are returning to another Ephesians the church member friend that too may be seated hallelujah all incasa person who ever and bad motives and whatnot and negative people insider here tell them that when they started negative tel-aviv back on Ephesians and that can survive in Ephesians hallelujah Tellem liars that can survive individuals because the Prophet said clusters and masses the fire was judged in 90 fishin's if you have the same kind of judgment again because fire Bobby upon Peter this is a mango be upon Peter Holy Ghost is ernment the anointing will be upon Peter only goes to Hebrews 4:12 these are torture intents of the heart to return back into the church no liars are coming inside idea no even workers coming to be exposed Oh glory to God because we quaint pattern of the Ephesians Silke a common because we impact on our anything please just being a chill stuck not even sin to come inside of it it'll be called out repented of dogs tears before they come upstairs Oh blowing up love hanging over the building the church hanging in the pulpit all around will blow in applaud Wow we going back to LA DC jokes angelic host angelic visitations angel of Lord and camping around those who fear Him or can the Lord praise return back to angels we going back to angelic host become eternal seasons going back to the supernatural all this ordinary natural things supernatural where there is God never supernatural you can't express cloud without the supernatural all this world will murder cop to be beyond the word hallelujah that's why pause and I come with preaching that your faith rests in the power of God I've got the wisdom of man Oh hallelujah continue for evil God hey man Oh be on target tonight this is the word tonight let's continue Redemption us to different paths come out of antenna into first you have to come out of some people want to bring the world in with them but you're gonna come out a little to enter the Christ you got to come out of underneath to enter the faith they're gonna be wanting in your way for really a genuine Saint you must absolutely leave everything contrary to the world behind and this book of Ephesians of the Old Testament is Joshua and Moses represent the law that could not save no one what Greece could have Joshua here it means you have a savior I know we find out we have come to another Ephesians where here we go in our intellectual denominations and all our educational program has come to extraordin so now after 40 years of preaching and teaching and explaining and beaten and exhort him it comment on any where's the power Jordan we must them what that what watch in our intellectual denomination and so forth all our educational programs has come to children then we must have an Ephesians again we must have an exodus to come out and go into full rapture for what for what so Ephesians is for the rapture then to go in a rapture you have to return to Ephesians could we give the Lord a shout oh my name is Hannah tonight how many see that rimmel the point the rapture you have to go to the rescission [Music] from the one of the greatest pieces of The Full Gospel Church is not positionally knowing what they are in Christ Jesus I already said I made two classes of people one of them is Full Gospel learned man fundamental fundamental knows where he stands positionally only he's never reborn again we had on point he Mountain point he could talk on point everything is forget it you can't you can't get away from how we can explain it we're not born again just fundamental teaching alone so he doesn't have any feet and if there's no feet of course you expect no miracles right no signs no powers no worship no one knowing to know not to because if it is not there now the understanding of who they are that's they but not defeat but watch so it's just and the full gospel have been born again but do know instance now if I could get the full customer Pentecostal faith and the fundamental believers or the fundamental believers doctrine and the pillar of faith we have mean it's like a man I can write a check but he has not any money back when I signature but you know money the other men have money remark but he can say thanks trouble you need to get it together you won't have money and this is Asia I think anybody smiling right now but anyway you want not money but I'm signature he said he has to be Jenny you can't honey bun okay so watch one got the money in the mouth we can write a check they don't have to write a check I'm gonna want any back but if you get those two together or praise the name of the Lord so what a bomb says if you put the life of Jesus and Donna body I believe us it will be the same food the first one did they will write another book of Acts behind them because it with the same life see what I mean you can't get away from it playing leaders of the body God holds this key alone theologians can tell you it is not known is it from them they vote nothing about it God here we go is known by simplicity and revelation of Jesus Christ to the most illiterate person not my geology is the revelation of Jesus Christ as the Spiritist self-revealing that's why you come in the spirit that's why you're singing that's why your worship because in the spirit you forget the revelation God making himself known by revelation but God doesn't only Pickens I've got my revelation he mixes my manifestation also hope Laurie love God hallelujah upon this rock I'll build my church Nora rocks accepted nor schools accepted no nothing exactly the revelation of the Jesus Christ true the new world is born in there he injects his own life your life is gone and the life of Christ is put checked and so true you with the preeminence is to the people and they see the very life one works two signs wonders that he did is doing true you are you ready outside of that the rest of it is not even quantum at all outside attack we've just said it commences watch God's great revelation and fallen by lack of this revelation is why we have so many divisions among us so much mockery so much official among us is because the people like that revelation the revelation the teachers he say the teachers it is Jesus Christ Himself being revealed again isn't that right so Paul said I come among you and I talk about a Joris could with not really exited your speech but he came to you to testimony of God I come in weakness and fear much trembling and my preaching was not with enticing words of my wisdom but here we go in demonstration of the Spirit and power you see there is the gospel going into world and preach the gospel didn't say go teach so all this teaching please to positionally that is just part of it teaching place of positionally that you could have the fear to receive the spirit he didn't say go on teach he said go preach in other words here we go yet interpersonal demonstrate the power these signs shall follow just teaching doesn't do it it takes the actual spirit itself demonstrate and designs remember the clients not teaching teaching alone can't do it so all this teaching on teaching for hours teaching teaching three hours teach and teach and ten hours teaching teaching that alone can do it it will take the spirit or glory no thought and all you get in that no you're gonna cry that they would have pray forehead they're gonna fall and God forever you're gonna get in a spirit of it it will take the spirit it has to be a transitioning into the spirit realm in this message we are going nowhere the wrapped in intellectual thing if it not be so we should be in already if the rest of us books on the official I'll be long gone because we're all in this thing no oh gonna be great in this thing no oh glory is about Brazilian it will take a power so you see when the power of this church Rises it will print the Brethren when the power of that church Rises it will bring the Brethren oh is it national force put the church and work of the churches but the power of God will put the people in the bride up to the law - off the unwanted tonight I feel inspired to make because it will hit the power board not a mighty teacher the power of God not to make your puzzle the power of God but the mighty Vangelis the power of doors the mighty pasta the power of God the mighty press it the power of God it will take the power to put you inside a deal with me parts and the power just know I'm baptized everyone I'm done then I have a few more things Oh music playing oh glob this fellow won't do it it will take the power on demonstration Oh glory could you imagine

cinematic our pray for sick people I can see crippled come inside of here I could see lame walking I can see blinds and gonna have to demonstrate his power God has to do it where there is God but
