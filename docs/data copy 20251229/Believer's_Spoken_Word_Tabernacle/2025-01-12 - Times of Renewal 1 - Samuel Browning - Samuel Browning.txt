know you that you are our father Lord father to know that oh God what you've done for us in our lives how you've changed us Lord God placing such a desire within our hearts oh God lord the only thing that we desire is to be pleasing to you Lord father to be so United with this word oh God to where the very your very life Lord is expressed through our lives Lord I pray Lord here this morning as we God have gathered out from our homes and ventured Lord through all of the weather and elements and things through the pressures of life and circumstances Lord now father may you come Lord just speak to our our hearts Lord for what we would have need of Lord you know our needs Lord father I stand in great need of you this morning lord lord it's without you we can do nothing Lord we need to hear from you Lord this morning and I pray heavenly father that oh God you would forgive us Lord of our shortcomings our mistakes Lord and we ask God for your divine grace for your presence to move in Upon Us Lord may you continue Lord to bring healing Lord Lord to those Lord that are recovering Lord in their bodies continue Lord to bring healing father I pray father to Sister Stephanie's family to the Pedraza family Lord may you just continue to minister to them in a very personal way watch over the different ones as they would depart Lord to return to their homes and we ask that God that you would just Lord just bring healing to our hearts and our lives here this morning as well Lord we love you and we thank you we just Lord commit ourselves into your hands now and we ask it Lord For Your Glory in Jesus name amen and amen amen if you turn with me to Joshua chapter 8 want to say God bless you it's so good to see each and every one of you and different ones that have made it have made it back here and I know it's a definite relief for you we've got uh from sickness and so forth but we thank God for his mercies aren't you thank God for his healing touch amen and amen we're just uh so thankful for the mercy of the Lord and um I know uh we just want to continue as you mentioned just to continue to keep um brother Richie and sister paty in your prayers and the family and uh there's a lot of things that I know that they they've already been dealing with and going through and um so uh you know with everything that that comes afterwards but we want to remember them in prayer that the Lord will just continue to give them strength and and uh and comfort and then as well to uh sister Stephanie's family as well you know she had lost uh her nephew here at the U beginning of the week and so we just want to continue to remember them in prayer as well sometimes there's there's a lot of things and times within this life and when we walk that um if we're really honest we don't understand and uh we don't understand sometimes why certain things happen and why certain things take place and and I think of where how that brother brandham mentioned it in this way he said what I've learned he said uh he said it in the message Shalom he said when he went through everything with when his family his wife passed and his child passed he said what I've learned he said is just to put my hand in his hand and to trust him and you know that's something that you know that we can't manufacture it's something that rises from within us that you even look into your own heart and life and say where is this coming from from for it's certainly not coming from my own resolution it's the strength of God Amen and I'm so thankful for that and we have all been in different uh times where we have felt the strength of the Lord and through prayers and so I just want to continue to encourage you those of you as you went through there on Friday evening and you you seen uh brother Richie sister py and the family that was there and I can just say this that is a result of prayer prayer is the most powerful weapon that's ever been put into the hands of the children of God and that's why may God help us never to take it lightly if someone comes upon your heart or you you know just go to prayer for them that's part of our warfare that's part of the Warfare as and and so we just want to remember remember that in prayer as well amen also remembering next weekend um Saturday Saturday at 6:00 brother Trevor Eman will be here to minister and then as well as on Sunday morning at 11: so we want to um remember that in prayer as well I want to look here in Joshua chapter 8 and uh and I want to read a few verses of scripture and this is beginning in verse 30 Joshua chapter 8 and verse 30 then Joshua built an altar unto the Lord God of Israel in Mount eel as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded the children of Israel as it is written in the book of the law of Moses an altar of whole Stones over which no man hath lift up any iron and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the Lord and sacrificed peace offerings and he wrote thereupon the stones a copy of the law of Moses which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel and all Israel and their elders and officers and their judges stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priest the Levites which bear the Ark of the Lord as well as the stranger as he that was born among them half of them over against Mount garim and half of them over against Mount ebal as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded before that they should Bless the people of Israel and afterward he read all the words of the law the blessings and cursings according to all that is written in the book of the law there was not a word of all that Moses commanded which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel with the women and the little ones and the strangers that were conversant among them and I just like like to speak here this morning on time of renewal may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated say brother Bill we'll certainly be praying for you yeah I just found that out the other day on a meeting with brother Paul that that you are going so I said it must have been definitely spur of the moment uh so we'll certainly be praying for you may God may God just uh bless you richly you've been such a blessing Amen to those the country there and and interpreting in Central America and um so I know that I know that uh the people will be really refreshed to see you and so we just certainly want to remember brother Bill in prayer how many how many days are you going to be gone this there you'll be coming back this coming Saturday night that's because you're traveling with a pastor and brother Paul is noted he is very specific to say I'm not a missionary so so uh uh that's wonderful so we want to remember brother Bill in prayer as he um is away I want to take a look here at this thought and I actually uh here was um was prepared and preparing to go into a different way actually thought all the way up through um yesterday and this thought I had come would looked at here before and just the Lord just I I couldn't get away from it and even in the wee hours of the morning and um so we want to approach this here this morning and I want us to consider where we are standing when we read from the book of Joshua we recognize that as Believers that the book of Ephesians and the Book of Joshua is is an absolute parallel and it speaks of the the time and the hour and the season that we're living in Paul would write in Romans 8 that the whole earth is groaning and travailing waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God that's the promise of God that is upon the Church of the Living God in this hour and I want you to think that within that you you are I are not able uh to make ourselves or to bring forth in our own selves that manifestation but brother Bram would would put it so clearly in the adoption series that how that when this word that God is opening and what God would be speaking forth when he's making known the mystery of God and that mystery of God is where that God himself coming down paying the price tabernacling fully deity within that body of the Lord Jesus and then the sending back of the Holy Spirit back upon the Church of the Living God to where that now it's it's God living his own life through you and I that's that's the achievement of God see it's just like any man who has a work or has something on his mind that he wants to do he starts out with a plan and starts out with a purpose and God God said as has spoke of this all the way through through the Old Testament through Ezekiel through so many over and over of God's desire and purpose to so get back to a place of fellowship with his children children and that place of Fellowship is that where God himself has come to the very depths of our life and this is where that you know the Holy Spirit works on our life to call our life through justification in Repentance and then the same spirit of God begins to work on our life to set our mind in order for Holiness and begins to work then through the sanctifying power of the blood to clean out the worldly desires from our life because God has a purpose that his purpose is to fill us with his spirit and then after we have been filled with the spirit of God then there begins to come forth a growth of a son and daughter of God and I want you to understand that when we are speaking of uh the of the working of the Holy Spirit and the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's not just a change of desires but it is where that our lives have become so United with God word where it's it there is an amen that rises from our hearts there's not when we have been born again there's not one word of God that we can't say Amen to so so I just say it in this way the word has not come to discourage us it comes to encourage us if where wherever we find ourselves at in our walk with God no matter where we're at we always want to be pressing forward that's that's always the call that's always the direction and so when we consider this and look at where that God himself has has brought the people of Israel to this place and they have already come through two great battles they've they've come across the river they they died to self that's what Jordan is a type of and then death to self Then There came the circumcision where there is a cutting away of all the Surplus flesh a dying completely to the world and being completely dedicated to the word of God and you know to think about it when you know when there is no longer any lean or any hold you know how it is if you were going to buy a piece of property if there was anything against that property you have to pay that in order to release that property it might be a pass tax bill it might be uh you know an overdue water bill i' I've read those things where it can be sometimes in the thousands but you recognize that what the circumcision of the Holy Spirit does cuz Paul brings that of what was given in Tye where they would be circumcised In the Flesh Paul says now that we are circumcised with that circumcision that is not with hands whereby it is the putting away of the body of this death and you would look and say well I'm still here within this body of death but Paul is dealing with the complete uh uh removing of that nature that that you and I lived under and it's completely separating unto God to where you and I are no longer Twain but now we have been United with God and so with that here we are we've heard about the Covenant we hear we feel the spirit of the Covenant moving Upon Our Lives drawing us but now through circumcision we have become one with the God who made the Covenant so it's no longer to it's not us it's not us and and like the prophet said in the token where we're you're they were offering up sacrifices here and the law was written over here but he says now the difference under this Blood of the Lord Jesus and through this circumcision it is now coming under the blood which is the atonement for our sins and the word not two separate things the spirit of God and the word of God are one one and the same and that's why that when when there has come that uniting this is where then the word has become flesh that's what sets the difference between just the baptism of the Holy Ghost and now we're the word himself moving into our lives because we can have there can be baptisms on our spirit and on our flesh but it will never last but it's God it God's desire was to come to the very innermost part of our life and this is why he said let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them in the midst of them it was God laying out his type all the way through that he might dwell inside of man as a matter of fact when he takes us there to Revelations 4 and you see when John is is is addressed and there is an open door that is set before them and he says come up hither and when John is beckoned to come up hither what he what he beholds is one who sat on a throne and if you look at all the characteristics that's wrote there in Revelations 4 you actually see the temple of the Living God and it's not something of brick and mortar but the Temple of the Living God is the body of Jesus Christ it's God coming and dwelling in the 4 and 20 Elders it's God that is coming in the midst of our life and he's the influencer his desires to be the influence of Our Lives Hallelujah I don't think anyone who's ever come in contact with God would desire anything less than that God would be the sole influence of our life I want him to be over the decisions I make for he even knows what lays ahead of me tomorrow and next week God grant to me the influence of the Holy Spirit maybe it's just something to move me in a certain way this morning so I'll be ready and fitted for when he will I'll be presented with that decision before me tomorrow but I want to look at this here in our journey uh in looking at this on overcoming hindrances where we've been at and also looking in our lives of of these uh moments in the promised land because you realize that as we've come into the promised land and crossing over and being circumcised we're we're not free from Battle as a matter of fact this is the land of overcoming and so remember that overcoming itself is always if if you'll just take two words if you have the table app on your phone or in your tablet just take these two words and go directly to the message how can I overcome and it's the two words already don't don't quote them but just leave them separate already and overcome and there's there there are three exact statements that the prophet makes in how can I overcome and it deals with where you and I must and realize and recognize that the God in us has already overcome the thing that we're facing and to recognize him in the midst of Temptation by just staying humble to his word Lord I need you in this situation Lord I Need Your Grace and and here he's already you see what you and I already have within us when you have been born of the spirit of God you already have within you the overcoming power and that overcoming power is necessary because in our lives not only is Jericho and AI but it goes even much deeper than that because once Jericho Ai and sometime some of the bigger cities and and Kings then it's time to come into our inheritance this taking of Jericho this of AI is is God letting letting us know this is the same plan that will be used when you come into your individual position and remember Satan's desire within this that we we have to battle with they had to battle with it and the prophet picks it up through the adoption through as I was with Moses on and on and he would talk about how he says that you know many times we have Ephraim wanting to raise corn in manasseh's corner and somehow we we feel and we can become when we look at one another and instead of and we can become to feel insufficient instead of recognizing God God has a place he has a part for our life and that part is just as essential it's just as important it may not be on the platform it may not be anything noticeable but you know what as a real son and daughter of God it doesn't matter that our name is called it doesn't matter that we're noticed the one thing about it is is Lord that I'm doing what you've asked me to do and that the word of God is living out fully in my life this is why the prophet would going on to say he says Oh how we need an the leader in this end time he said to come with that word he said because those individuals of Israel when they came in to their promised land and they came into their position as they abided there they became the cream of the crop so it's always Satan's desire to somehow belittle minimize what God is calling us to do and then then and then you know then you could sometimes battle and the the battle will come and well you know this one's a greater you know this is a greater tribe and you got a greater position or this all kinds thoughts and and everything is all around but I I want you to understand those things are only there to try to hinder us and keep us back from yielding because when our mind is all taken up with so many things like that and occupied and sometimes we're trying to prove our position in our mind that's Satan's trick and trap is to try to get us to where we are standing constantly as trying to justify our position of who we are this is where the achievement that belongs in the heart of the believer is to believe every word of God and that includes the word that God has spoken over your life and the word that you see working in your life that you yourself are standing in amazement at the god you see working in your life and we come to these moments this will be a part in in in the journey as as as a as different ones will take their position so as we even as coming into position these will this will always be this this thing that we're going to speak on just for a few moments on a time of renewal this will always be a part of our lives and I just want to say this to you that times are renewal are not are not moments called by man right that's good these are not called by man but times are renewal are called by the holy spirit it's God who orchestrates the moment it's God who orchestrates the time for Renewal if you know you have designated times just like we've done here in the church in different times uh in your home sometimes you give it a Fresh coat of paint or a new thing of carpet or or a new a new flooring or you get new chairs or new furniture you don't burn the whole house down you simply renew what is there and that's the same thing in our life is that this is why the prophet would take such time in the adoption series over and over you find it through every part and and and it's not just in the adoption series it's all the way through the message where the Prophet would talk about the fear the scare that's among the church he said oh that's what we're here to drive out and let me just tell you there is there's not a man that can drive that out but God himself coming present through this word and the Mystery of God just being ministered right there it will drive back fear and it ministers courage it ministers ability it's a vision that breaks over your life that's good and so these times of renewal they're very there there things that God would call us to and a renewal itself I want you just to think of this a renewal itself requires discernment it requires honesty and humility discernment honesty and humility I want to just read this here out of Deuteronomy 11 this was a place where God and I want you just to think of this in Deuteronomy 11: 18 and this is this is a promise that God has made it was even uh it was even that which would be uh very much present and reminded in this moment where Joshua is is is leading the children of Israel in a place of renewal they've just come through AI they've come through remember with AI they come through a great battle in Jericho then they come into Ai and when they come into AI there was sin that was in the camp right and because of one person that had gotten out of line in their walk it brought the entirety of the army out of line right right and so he wants you to understand that it just even goes to show that God's intention for Unity is that how that in our lives that where we would be so United with his spirit so United Ed with his word in every phase of our life in every part of our life because when this took place where aen went and in direct Disobedience listen achen achen did not have to go there and say well let me see you know this this garment looks pretty good and let me go pray over it and my this wedge of go you know I'm having a little bit of financial difficulty let me go no no he knew he knew there there was a word that was already that had given leadership in that battle right and if you look at it if you just if when you study that this is what's powerful in the Book of Joshua you'll find that God had told them in that moment that when you come into Jericho burn it all don't take silver don't take gold come on now and when they went to Ai and after the success God told them bring the silver and gold out you see it's waiting on God God has a timing for everything it you know it would just seem like well we're just going to rush through everything's going to be done the same no there's things that God has from every single battle but we never want to take things for granted in other words Our Lives as Believers as the scripture said if you be led by the spirit you're not under the law the sons of God are led by the spirit of God we don't want to take anything for granted mean we know that God God is a god of pattern and God will work by the patterns of his word but we want to be inclined to the spirit of God because God knows exactly what you and I have need of at that moment and his will his will for our lives how many you believe God's will is for your life you believe God has a perfect will then you let me just tell you something if God's perfect will for your life I want you to understand that's his word and his word cannot fail amen amen the prophet tells us he said God will make the conditions match what's required for the season God's responsible for that I say God help me just to just to lay aside everything so that I can be influenced to move into the right conditions a time of renewal they needed this moment of renewal you know when Israel had come into the land here and here was a direct Disobedience they did something that was done that knew better than to do you say well brother Samuel that would be willful well remember there were 16 men that was killed brother BR said there's times where there's traps that's laid for us then he said there's other times where there's things he said you'll do willfully he said but just so you understand whether it's a trap or whether it's willful he said everything that we sow we will reap I can't go there to this morning but I want you to understand God's not listen that whole thing is not God holding something over our head but listen we want to we want to reverence the leading of the Holy Spirit we want to reverence his leading because uh with within these things there was 16 men innocent the prophet called it innocent men that paid with their life listen these 16 men did not even have a speck of gold gold dust they did not even have a piece of a babyl Ian garment they perished because one person got out of line one person did not subject their own will to the word of God you see the the token it's applying the token this is why the token when we talk of applying the token it's not just something that well you know I've received the token well how do you know how do you know youve received the token well you say well my desires have changed but let's let's go let's move deeper is the desire fully to the things of God because you've got to it's got to go deeper than just sanctification it's got to come to a place of full relationship where the world itself has no longer a claim on your life there has come a full circumcision with the hands without hands but by the spirit amen because that's what brings us into the Covenant that's what brings us into Union Ruth could never have come in to where she came to and not boas one who was circumcised brought her in right is that right the daughters of ZF had had no there's no way for them to obtain their inheritance and you can read it in numbers you can read it in Joshua and they had no way to get their father's inheritance but they weren't going to let their father's inheritance just fall dormant there was something that Rose within them and said we must have our father's inheritance I want you to understand understand they they at that time they had no promise they had no promise to stand there before Moses to stand before the to stand there but you know what it was a it was a call of God that was burning in their hearts and God answered Moses and said the daughters of zad have spoke correctly they shall marry in their own tribe and in their own tribe then the inheritance of their father is retained it shows you and I that the only way that we come into our inheritance is we must have a complete New Birth a union with the man Christ Jesus with the Holy Ghost in our life to where he the love of our life you see we could love him out here in the spirit realm that's fing love that's as deep as as a as a man or woman can go but it takes the agape love Hallelujah which is God's Own love to come down to the inside on that Soul where you love God you love his word you love him of more than anything including flesh and blood and your own will am that's what the power of circumcision does it separates you from Egypt Egypt no longer has a tie on you but now here's this renewal a renewal a time that when Israel they had come into the into this place and man they come to a place in AI they come back to Victory well how did they get back to Victory we kind of we looked at it last week and how that God had them under the leadership of Joshua to make as though that they were retreating as they did the first time but you know what it actually was it was a people what AI thought was a whipped people once again but what it was it was a people that had surrendered their rights that's right and that whole display on the battlefield is what had taken place in their hearts already they had returned to the Lord from whom they had departed amen you see this is why it's it's so easy our hearts can depart our hearts can get away so brother Samuel I'm sealed with the spirit of God but the scripture says Ephesians 1 Ephesians 4 this is part of our Joshua grieve not the spirit of God whereby you're sealed you see it isn't your soul when that Soul has been sealed it it's never never the soul that that commits the act of grieving but it's when things get into the spirit that is so into the mind that's so good you no doubt every one of us you've had to stand and say forgive me for something I've said or something I've done and and you know there's something that has moved you that has pricked your heart that has brought you to that place to to to repent of that and if you've really been con sealed with the spirit of God when you recognize you've done wrong you're ready to repent because we're not an island to ourselves and well you know I just on my note we are a body we experience Victory as a body yes and we can also experience defeat as a body same thing as a home same thing as a family same thing as a church this is why the the prophet would tell us regarding this he said Canan in the adoption series he said did not speak that they're of of of a of a of a perfect as far as where there's no there's no battles there's no Wars he said but what it did testify of and what it did speak that it called for was a perfect walk and that perfect walk was lining up with God and lining up with one another you see we really can't be in line with God if we're out of line with our brother it don't work that way the Bible said how can you say that you love him whom you have not seen and you despise him who you do see you don't want that Spirit of Cain a hatred and a malice and a vengeful amen sometimes that Spirit of malice listen this is why the scripture said putting away all bitterness sometimes in offenses that have come in your life here and even sometimes when you were a child let me just say this to you and I want to just say it very graciously you have to deal with that absolutely you have if you don't deal with it it will dominate your life it'll dominate your relationship between you and God you say I've got the Holy Ghost but remember our lives are a channel this is why when the prophet preaches greatest battle ever fought not only is he bringing us to a place of the new birth but he spends a great deal in that message where the application works day in and day out in our lives of how Satan will come to batter against us and I say that because I understand as I'm standing here as a pastor and as a minister of the Gospel there's great needs Among Us there's needs sometimes that when I can look at sometimes it's that if there's one thing that God has taught me over the years is things that you see being expressed outwardly are not always so black and white that's right that's good you say where do you draw that from very simply the prophet when he talked about in his meetings he said remember you had you had Oral Roberts and all the rest of them going through prayer lines laying hands praying for him just praying for him and brother BR says I in my meetings I catch what falls off of Ora Roberts that's and those men there's no doubt those individuals felt a temporary relief are you hearing me now but the prophet said what God has given this ministry for is to catch what is hindering that from fully coming to pass in other words we don't want to have where it's you know where God it's built up to a certain place in our lives and all of a sudden my it's building building all of a sudden we you hit you hit like a you hit a roadblock or you you hit a blockage and and here we are back into the same position but to realize God give me the grace even if I don't know where it's at to deal with where the hindrance is at in my life remember I told you it's not us calling for a time of renewal it's God who calls renewals amen very good because many times bitterness malice Envy all of these are matters of the heart yes sir yes sir when Paul writes them they're not a matter of the Soul they're a matter of the heart and you know what this is the thing is that every one of those things that we of their malice bitterness Envy all of that that all has to do with a heart that's offended it's what it has to do with whether it's from earli in our life whether it's from now let me just let me just say what the word has said offenses will come I'm going to be very very clear you can either choose to live without offense in your life that's your choice yes sir you can either choose to live with it and you say how do I know what it is whatever it is that you continues to come back and dominate your thoughts and some things that even if it's if it's feelings you have towards somebody else or somebody's done your wrong I don't care who they are yes that must be cleaned amen from your spirit now that isn't I'm just saying this from my heart that is not something remember a time of renewal is not man calling it it's God calling it and when God calls a meeting God's got a purpose there's things that God wants to deal with because he wants to be expressed through our lives requires discernment honesty and humility now I want you to think of this within this within our within the spirit because it's I tell you how serious it is it's a serious enough of missing the Rapture you can allow things listen listen Brother Brad when he preaches lamb and the dove you find where the enemy at different times has got in on people's lives that they were in journey and Satan sees them in Journey to receive and and becoming one with God and he comes into in a moment in a subtleness and he comes in such a way and sometimes it isn't something that's brand new if we can be honest this is something that has affected me or bothered me and now the same action comes back out again and he Grieves away the spirit of God this is why within our lives even after coming across when we have listen you say brother Samuel missing the Rapture when we've come into the new birth well when you've been born again and under the token you won't miss the Rapture but the prophet tells us in the adoption series for things that you've let go unconfessed you'll give an account for it when you stand before the Judgment seat of Christ not the white Throne not the white Throne judgment seat the Bible says in the book of Corinthians we must give an account for the Deeds Done in this body well Lord I could have been if you know if everything would have been said no we we give an account for the Deeds Done in this body nobody else will give an account for us we give an account I want to make my calling an election sure this moment of renewal here in Deuteronomy 11 where God is calling them to God's calling them back to that place of the word and he's tell him I don't have time to read all of this but he has told them what he what he wanted them to do with the word let it be frontlets on your eyes let it be on the doorpost Let It Be and let it be all around you in other words surround your life with the word in other words don't make a step without the word being there anything that you're looking at don't look at it without looking at it through the word brother Samuel that was the Old Testament that was a type that was a type of where you and I are called to live in this hour and this renewal God calls them to I want you to notice the certainty uh Brianna give me Deuteronomy 11 uh verse 22 let me just skip to there notice what God is speaking concerning his word for if ye shall diligent ently ly keep all these Commandments which I command you to do them to love the Lord your God to walk in all his ways and to cleave unto him then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you and you shall possess greater Nations mightier than yourself every place where on the souls of your feet shall tread shall be yours from the Wilderness and Lebanon from the river the river Euphrates even to the uttermost Sea shall be your Coast there shall be no man able to stand before you for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that you shall tread Upon A has said unto you let me ask you does when you open your eyes on your bed at morning does Hell tremble does the enemy tremble and say oh dear God they've made it through the night you say Brother s how does that happen that we got to be loud and boisterous no no it's a simple humble daily walk with God letting the word be the guide of your life and when you let the word be the guide of your life that's what makes Satan nervous are you hearing me this is why Satan when the new church the here the church was born on the day of Pentecost this is why that Satan himself even before Pentecost he notice Judas was the son of predition he had a knowledge of the Mysteries Second To None can I just say it plainly he was the best preacher out of all of them I'm quoting a dire [Applause] word okay he was Second To None even to where that Satan would see okay now now I see what's happening there's a group and there's a gathering of people then the Bible said he had transformed his angels into angels of light oh I have something enlightening for you you you think there wasn't a presence that didn't that doesn't accompany an angel Hey listen demons are Fallen Angels but there are elect Angels those that did not fall and just as the angels of God are in this building this morning moving Upon Our Hearts and you say brother Samuel I I want to invite him even more I'll tell you what the prophet said in demonology series he said when we are in our hearts set for a moment of renewal in the Holy Ghost the angels of God have taken their POS position and they are moving all around through the aisles why because that that that's here they are they they're gathered here the angels of God are gathered it's just man this is this is welcoming this is a welcoming moment when you've got hearts that are willing to welcome the word of God the prophet preaches in a message and he he spoke and I can't remember the name the name of the message now I having another another outline but he speaks of how he says here I was I'm in this place he said and I see people he said just sitting he he said the word's going forth and and and they know they're saying things in their life and things that's wrong but he said you're just sitting he said remember he says I was here he said some time ago and preach the unpardonable sin and he's dealing with the people we've got to have a care in this time and let me just say it to you like this you want to talk about God's grace and God's mercy when the prophet preaches in 1963 he cares do you care he said why don't you ask God create in me a careall create in me a care I don't want that I don't care attitude create in me a care because this is an hour it's necessary amen it's necessary to be diligent with my walk with God Amen we wonder this moment of renewal because there's times when needing renewal sometimes our lives can get stale the Bible tells us in Psalms 103 that who satisfieth my mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed Like an Eagle that's Psalms 103:5 he ties together renewal is a call by God it's a call of his word it's God feeding his children and the feeding of his children on his unfailing word is what brings renewal there's no other way right I'm not against anything that helps but I'm just going to tell you this friends we're talking about the promised land you know to need something more than psychology I I'm just being very Frank you need something more yes well you know this I I don't even know why sometimes we we don't even know why certain things are are are coming about and why is it that we gravitate maybe in a certain way why is that or we need more than a psychologist we need the spirit of God now I want you to I want to understand listen to me now very carefully I'm just I'm just following him here you you see when I talked about that before I believe in prayer lines I believe in praying for the sick I believe in all that but the prophet he takes the message if you have not listened to he cares do you care in 63 I would advise you to listen to that that's a key message that that message has been a source of influence now for five years because here's the problem brother Bram says we know the Cure but we've got to find the the cause and they'll say that over and over you see this is why this is why this the message itself it's looking deeper than just you know I'm going to pray this off and so many times so many times you say why is it that this is coming back through the prayer line for the same thing I'm going to give you the words of the prophet he stood in New York Bellington and he says people came through that were blind and they saw when they got across the platform but he said within a few days they came back and they were as blind as they ever were deaf and everything else and yet they that was relief from their life and the prophet begins he looks to God and he says God what's going on are you with me amen this is why brother Brandon when you hear him Minister this and that and say that that's from an earlier part in the message but notice how God has brought an understanding this is why the prophet would say in the adoption series part three he says I've learned long ago he says I'm not going to get and he calls out a sister's name sister do you believe Oh Sister you really ought to believe sister you know you really need to believe Oh Sister you know God's word is true sister you know you really got to believe he said I've learned long ago that doesn't work right are you hearing me he said I learned that's a son that is maturing yes hallelujah it's learning and this is what he's pointing to it's the sovereignty of God that creates faith in the hearts of the people listen let's be real we're here for real honest needs in our life the Rapture is everything to us Divine favor with God I don't have time to play around but Lord deal in my life create Lord in my heart the faith that's needed amen hallelujah back to that prayer line the prophet said here's what was happening he said those people were walking in and in the presence of the Angel of the Lord it took the condition off their life but because they weren't sincere at the bottom of it oh my a sincere confession it came back you see this is you see when there's a sincere confession it's a separating it's a separating from sin it's a separating whatever it is Lord I Forgive Me Lord from my wrong it's going down to the depths of it Lord to realize cuz sometimes it takes sickness sometimes it takes hardship sometimes it takes things God will work in such a way to get us to a place to where we finally begin to stop looking at others and looking around and say God let me look inwardly Hallelujah amen and Lord when I look inwardly in my life I want you to hold my hand because there's places in my life Hallelujah that are scars that are so deep in my spirit that Lord things Lord from my life hold my hand Lord God I'm willing to go there Lord but you take me there Lord huah take me there I don't want to go on my own if you don't go up if you don't go up don't Carry Me fither Lord I want to go with you Lord guide me Lord in those areas of my life that there can be a renewal think about this Israel this place that we're reading about they put this altar it was a place that God had told Moses and told Moses when they came into the land when you would read it you would almost wonder why didn't they go immediately over to this place because it was a place Mount ebal where the cursings would be read Mount gersam where the blessings would be read you've read Deuteronomy chapter 28 and not things like that and God talks about the blessings and the cursings right brother BR says You' got he said you've got some people he said they they don't they don't believe in preaching on things like that and talking about cursings he said well there he says you know what he saidyou better get away from a person like that I don't trust him because God's word is true but I want you to understand right here what you seen on Mount eal where the cursings are read that's where the altar is made the altar was not made on Mount gersam where the blessings are there has to be a sacrifice to take the curse there has to be a sacrifice that'll take the cursings and Israel has just experienced this cursing sure there's they come they won the Battle of AI but it shows you and I a very important Point God is showing us something here that it's true how that judgment broke upon the camp of Israel when judgment broke then came repentance after repentance came obedience after obedience came Victory and after Victory came blessings that is so good before any departure from the word it was obedience Victory and blessings but because somewhere along the line where Israel had gone off course it was a time for a renewal now this when you read of this account and look at it within the commentators historians and so forth you realize that this was not next door to AI this journey was 20 to 25 miles that they would have to make it would not be an easy Journey but it was a journey that was necessary sometimes the journeys that you and I are called to make to go into the heart and to go into the depth are not easy Journeys they're not something that just is just right beside us but it's places we've got to journey by the spirit of God in our lives that is so good meaning that sometimes it's not things where we look at it and say I just want rid of this right now but it's good that we've come to a place to say I'm not going to live with this malice any longer I'm not going to live with this bitterness any longer I'm not going to live with this any longer I have a right but as a sheep I forfeit my rights because I value his presence more than my personal rights because my own value my personal rights that's me that self that Grieves the spirit of God away from my life sometimes that journey is so great that we have to go on listen to me just because it's 20 or 25 miles does not mean there's nothing taking place God will lead you sometimes he'll lead us he'll lead us sometimes one service yeah that'll lead us to another service and if we really Trace right back and figure out when was it that God began to lead me in this renewal it might have been months ago that's right that's good it might have been months ago you see that's why when God begins to lead you through those places that let me tell you their places that for you and I to walk on our own they would be fearful this is why God reminds Joshua multiple times in chapter one don't be afraid yeah don't be dismayed that's good don't fear right all of those words describe fear and the effects of it on your life and even when they would come to certain places in the land God would remind them again I believe it's in Joshua chapter 20 he would speak to Joshua be not afraid of them you see why God sees God sees this is why God's not looking down and saying oh you're afraid his presence is here to accompany us and as Sons and Daughters of God we want to be Led Led Led Led it's not God saying here go do this on your own no but he said I will be in you right I will be your father you shall be my sons and daughters I will walk in you you're not approaching this alone these things that have happened in your life the scars things that that you look at and say God I want to closer walk with you and God is saying and I want to be closer to you I want more of my life to be expressed through you let's deal with this part in The Inheritance Hallelujah let's go with this in your life that's right Hallelujah that's so good and it isn't that God will altogether strip it out of our life it's that he just brings you to a place to where you can recognize greater is he that is in you that's right than he that's in the world that's right and where you recognize the real the Redeeming Grace of God and the effects of it even in that area of your life you know what that does I'll tell you what that does that creates and causes a yielded vessel and that's what it's all about is US yielding to the Lord God called him to this sometimes in our Spirits when a Spirits gone astray we can get stale we can become complacent the prophet would say it like this in one place on renewal just listen to what he says he says how many he says in here would like to have an experience that you once had a renewing in the Holy Ghost I do I don't just want one I need one I need one I want one brother Ram says would you just say this God take me back I don't care what it cost I don't care what the cost is I I don't want no more to flirt with the world I want to be real if the church would only go on as God as it should go there won't be any cripples and afflictions among us we've got to confess our sins he said you say brother samel or brother brandham our sins I don't have nothing to confess I ain't done nothing wrong I don't drink out he said it's not that it's neglection sometimes it's not moving up with God it's not doing things in the holy spirit it's not watering what God has given you and you're grieving it away brother BR said there was a woman who come to me brother Bram I'm so sick I have no more power with prayer the life of prayer is gone from me I'm getting older and I don't want to go like this brother Ram said see don't grieve the spirit of God away from you invite him back you said Brother s how do I invite him back brother B said he's only flown up there on that little branch in other words he didn't fly away and say forget you even though he would have a right for what how did we what we've entertained but he just because you know why when you've been sealed with the spirit of God and I'm trying to bring this to for for each one in here and even lives that are in Journey and in process to understand he's not gone very far you say what must I do the prophet said become a lamb again become a lamb again you see where does that start it starts first in your mind where the and meet you go back in your mind to what you were amen and if you go back in your mind and repent the prophet said the spirit of God will take you back to where you were a renewal incredible because we when we look at this of renewal I've I've pondered this I just I Ponder these things I say God what are you what are you what are you showing us on this because the battle in AI they had removed Sin from the camp right they went in according to God's program and they defeated AI right now if we're not careful sometimes we just go on and we judgment comes and and we repent and then we go forward but there should be a moment in our lives to where we reflect and say okay that Fellowship has been restored now in Fellowship what caused me to get off track right you see that's as a son and daughter of God I don't think any one of us in here want to make the same mistakes this year we made last year I thank God for for forgiveness but I don't I think we want to say Lord I want to see growth in my life I want to see growth in my life for things maybe if if if you're someone or one or one something that we grudges and offenses it's got to come to a point when you see listen let me just tell you it's God when things begin to stand out to you and you begin to see it as God is showing you you know you can't see it unless God helps you see it you can't you can't you can't at all it takes God to show that that's why even many times as a pastor I let you in on the Insight there's many times where I can watch and I'll see things and I just keep praying because I realize it's got to come to a place of a showdown to where that part is broken cuz if not it's veiled and it can't be received and it only creates attention yes it does that's why why it takes God this is why that's why you understand that and this is maybe this is a little bit more than what you need to know but you understand that with pastoring itself it's not evangelizing right that's good it's laboring with the flock a pastor is not a prophet God does not require a pastor to be a prophet to see into your life and to see this there's ways that God has to deal with me that's true God deals with me in a way that he might he might not deal with anybody else but God has the way that he deals with me in certain ways but the point is the laboring but see if we're not careful see here we are under a prophetic message and many times we want the results we see right there on deep call to the Deep we we want we want an Evangelistic service and so that becomes what we're I've got to have that yeah let me tell you what's necessary that's good you've got to have the word to sustain Victory amen the word builds you remember what the prophet tells us in in adoption series evangelism catches the cner teaching positions them is that true all of the parts are needed but God laboring with our lives and our hearts because in these areas in our life David in his own life he had a situation that arose in his life it goes out a walk on a balcony and there she is baath Sheba up there taking a bath at that time and it caught his eye David in a weakened moment you know what the prophet told us he said if David as God spoke through Nathan if you would have only asked ask what you have need of are you hearing me now the prophet said David in message of Grace David he said he had everything else with the other wives he said he could have satisfied his passion yeah that way but in a weakened moment she forgot to pull the shades and so forth and so on but where the where the story comes to is David is going to keep on going but because David is a man after God's Own Heart God comes to deal with David's life so good let me just tell you something when David finally look where David's at David's in a place man when that when that story is told by Nathan David is ready to take the head off of that guy you see what happened God come in and he stirred up that gate of reasoning which is the Gate of judgment it's not the Judgment of the soul but it's the Judgment gate and God gets him into that place like Jesus did many times with the over gets him into that place and finally he gets in that place and he said that man shall die he does not know but the text of the service the quotes in the service everything has been ordained for that moment of the Gate of judgment that is so good why that we can be honest before God yes sir listen don't be dismissive and say well I don't have that in my life I don't have that's I'm not exclusively speaking of that act that David committed I'm speaking of things that even in our spirit when you've got angry when you've said things that you shouldn't have said that's in your spirit things that has been allowed to sometimes get bottled up in our spirit listen let me tell you something you've got to be very careful we we speak this we preach this because this is the scripture there ought to be the pass of the Holy Ghost Inside of us and our lives walking in such a place with that pass that we're able to give others a pass but let me just let me let me warn you let me warn you let me let me just express it to you when you're giving others a pass that comes from you having the strength from being in his presence if not it becomes things that you're ignoring and it's bottling up in you and it's only a moment and a time where the pressure is going to be let off in the wrong situation there is a place to let off the pressure where is this place in our Promised Land Cities of Refuge that's so places where we can let off the pressure in Christ right I think every one of us feel pressure feel we feel pressure now more than we we ever have it a't got less it's even more and then and then and I'm not just talking sometimes about the outward things God is working in our lives in our hearts because once the Holy Ghost has come by the seal it's time now for overcoming it's time to over come it's time to press forward in the battle it's time to move into areas in our life say God I want to follow you Lord I want to follow you I hope you understand this this is not I think I told you this last week or this I think this came out last week I don't want I don't want a man trying to figure me out right because a man can't figure me out listen I want you to understand that's not that's not negating sitting down in counsel With A god-given god- Gifted Man because that's not that man that gift is there for God to work through right that's right and sometimes once again sometimes in this hour we can say I'm not but sometimes this is where we're at in our lives and this is why sometimes we can remain in the same places where we are is because we're wanting a prophet and the prophet of the hour is the Holy Ghost but you got to remember these times of renewal it's a journey and the only way listen if the prophet of God was still needed God wouldn't have took him off the scene right you say brother Samuel I'm still here let me tell you the angel of the Lord whose message it is accompanies his message still he he's still here to see us all the way through he's still here to confirm his word and to bring us under the place that he's prepared for us but Samuel are you saying that this areas and parts and things in my life that it's going to be completely cut out and it'll never bother me anymore what I'm saying to you is that you come to a place of where you're reigning over it by recognizing your Redemption through the blood of the Lamb this renewal a moment of renewal why why wasn't it just going back through and just well hey praise God I've you know repentance has come and here's the victory but no I want to see where where where where where am I I going off at listen friends listen listen you're going to have a time of reflection you either have a time of reflection now or you'll have a time of reflection in the tribulation period that's so good you can this is not an hour to be passive am I I I don't say this to be harsh I say it because it's truth as it comes from my heart if there's a passiveness in your life ask God first of all Lord do I really have a real experience with you is the word of God everything or is this world what I can get from the world what I can obtain let me tell you when my body is changed Rome can have my house that's right they can have my cars there you go the pope can ride in my heated seats you'll probably need the air conditioned ones where he's going Hallelujah I'm just saying it's a time of reflection and listen we want to live this is why it's a moment and a times of renewal God I I don't want to miss it for anything in the world Amen I don't want to miss what your desire is to do in my life because there will not be any excuse efficient none well brother so and so sister so and so if this one hadn't did this if this one there will be no excuses it's between us and God Amen so many times the reason people make excuses well this one did this and this one said this let me tell you what that always boils down to you're not willing to die to yourself oh I'm not going to go down there to that church it's a bunch of Hypocrites the prophet said you're a bigger hypocrite than everyone down there that's right that's right yes sir many times this these are the things you've got to come to a place where it's between death and life Lord want you more than anything Amen Let me just tell you God's able to break all of those parts and veils let me share this with you here how many of you thankful for the prophit of God in this hour yes sir yes sir I'm thankful very thankful for this message that God has sent to me amen this message has given me life because this message is Christ amen as I heard a brother say here just the other day matter of fact just the other night I was I was up we hours of the morning and so even in last night and so I heard him R over and oh brother Andrew is preaching in Africa Glover and he made a statement on there I thought man it's powerful and he made a statement so that they would understand regarding the message he said when you call an Uber driver taxi yeah whatever we call it right you you don't call them and say let me check your tire pressure let me check the oil in there let me check the gasoline that's so good you've called for it you get in it and it takes you to your destination Hallelujah the message is the Uber the message is the taxi I'm not here checking the tires checking the oil I'm resting it will bring me to my destination it was sent by God just as Solomon sent the guards to get the shulamite The Song of Solomon God has sent this message hallelujah it's a message of himself a message of his grace to pick you and I up my statement on that I know it's nothing new here but just another angle I really enjoyed on it because I think that's foolishness trying to inspect the tires that's a trap let me inspect the windshield n no I called it I get in it right and when you get in you can see what it produces in arrest it's arrest isn't it it's arrest he he will bring me to that prepared Place amen but here's the prophet I appreciate how that he would take this in what was the whole Holy Ghost given for and he would speak about how that in his own life he says before they had come to that time where brother Bram preaches the Holy Ghost series and if you a student of the message and you go through you realize that brother brandham even coming back into the December of 1959 they've already called among the congregation at the Tabernacle a time of consecration and it was a time just just settling everything get everything out from between you between other people get get get your heart get everything right because there's a need for the holy ghost in the lives of the people and brother Brown just some powerful messages that are preached not only the Holy Ghost series but he goes into this place and for his own self he says here I am with my wife in our living room the other day our DIN and we joined Hands Across the DU folder like a hassk where you sit on it you know prop your feet up they joined hands and they said they made a commitment to God a rededicating of their lives and brother BR says I've been neglectful I've neglected calls I've neglected doing certain things he said I I could have went more and I didn't go more I appreciate that Honesty that to me is a man I can follow and brother BR I want you to watch where the neglect has come from see neglect itself is only an expression of something else that's going on he says oh he says I want to stand like Moses I want to stand like Joshua I want to stand there and he says I took my wife by the hand and I crossed this Bible in her little Bible and I said honey I've been too negative the Holy Spirit condemns me within me being negative has called neglect what was brother Bram negative about he's talking about a things that he was seeing listen we are surrounded beginning right here with negative we run face to face day in and day out with negative but it just goes to show us when God calls for a time of renewal God will direct us right to the place of what's going on and he'll speak into the depths of Our Lives that we might be able to confess what is there that is so good do do you see that it wasn't that it just we're going to have a new consecration but as he was consecrating himself notice this come from just consecrating brother Brian he just was days brother Brian was consecrating himself praying he said I was praying for hours and just just seeking the Lord and finally it come to a place where God showed him you've been too negative and it's caused neglect see how can negative negative of just looking all around can cause neglect between husband and wife life can cause neglect in a body can cause neglect and is not even maybe negative with that person but sometimes just the encompassing of negative you say how do I stop that well there's times of renewal but through times of renewal remember the renewal is by the word yes to the word and it's every part of our life being reconciled to God because if my soul has been sealed my soul is already reconciled to God but it's my spirit my heart if there's something that's unconfessed it may not be unconfessed sin it might be just something that we've not come to the point and the depth of right now to be able to put our finger on it but let me just say this would you be willing to say Lord I put my hand in your hand Lead Me Lord Jesus guide me Lord God work in my life help me Lord I pray in every channel I want a renewing that is by the spirit of God one that moves to repair my spirit and my life amen everybody okay there was a division in the Kingdom of Israel sometimes divisions come when Saul when they wanted a king remember there was some there that said who is this guy isn't it amazing how when there was wickedness God would call wickedness sometimes that which was a thought against his character or his word he would call it belile belile and yet it would be sons of Israel right but he's calling their action be yeah remember when David went out to battle to reclaim what was in Zig remember that and there were individuals that were too faint to go up to zigg they were weary they were overcome in their spirit and David said wait right here by the by the Brook bore the rest of us will go and they went and according to what God said they took everything all they recovered and brought it back and those that was with David and with him in that Victory spoke up and said we shall not give spoils to those who waited by the Brook because they were faint and David said hold your tongue right thou of be they were sons of Israel yes but their behavior was not the behavior of the character that God had chosen for him that's that's good you see how it's things sometimes were Even in our feelings and the way that we're walking and we you know Satan can get in there and want to bring division why aren the rest doing this and why aren't this doing this and Satan trying to bring a division where at in your spirit because if there's one division in the ranks will not stand Victorious That Should Be Our intention my intention is not to line up you or you or you or you but to preach away that lines us up it's up to us as individuals to take that word and line our lives with that word and apply it amen and not say well I'm on my own little island I'm going to do my own little thing you are a part of a body amen and I just encourage you if you have forgot that right there begin on that right there what has caused me to be removed in that area that I'm part of a body because I will dare say you'll find you have done the same thing in your natural families wow you've done it in work relationships come on friends don't don't try to we've got to be honest right now we've got to be honest what is it that's going on in there that's causing this but I know sometimes sometimes what our flesh wants we want instant potatoes right one this is going on oh Lord oh my brother Trevor's coming praise God when's brother codre going to get here oh if they would only have brother Ron Spencer oh if they would only have somebody exactly he's here the one that we need is here and it wouldn't matter if you had 100 run Spencers lined up if there's no sincerity in the bottom of it it'll come back am it's not the man that has the power and the authority Hallelujah you understand now you stop looking at men as idols and recognize you have the authority has a son and daughter of God he said in Deuteronomy 11 if you will put the word first stay with thus sayith the Lord not a man shall be able to stand before you amen you know it brings it down individual level where we're not looking to some man putting some man as some hero and putting up there oh if I only had this man to lay hands on me if I only had this man but it's recognizing who it is that's in our midst and who is in you if that's one thing that the message of the hour did it broke that Pentecostalism where it was chasing after men and it's breaking it yet still and to recognize recognize you know why because without that being recognized we're still dependent upon flesh and the Bible tells us in the book of his Isaiah cease ye from man whose breath is in his nostrils it isn't that we don't need the preaching God uses men but he uses men to preach through he'll use men to minister to you he'll come down as a mighty counselor and counsel through he'll come down through hands that are being laid on but it's all God yes amen that's why we need a renewal God have I got so fixed to where I'm fixed on personalities instead of recognizing you I'm ready to go welcome a personality instead of washing your feet chasing after this and but I need a renewal back to the word of God see this is where it gets real friends this is where it gets real this is where it gets down to a place and many times this is a place when it starts getting down face to face in people's lives it's where sometimes they've got a choice on what they're going to do you're either going to go on with God and face the issue or you start pulling back start pulling back if you're not careful you'll chase the next move you don't want your spirit fed the Holy Ghost does not feed on emotion come on you know where I'm at false anointed ones at the end time the Holy Ghost does not feed on emotion it feeds on the word of God the word of God and his presence it can bring emotion but emotion never produces Victory never it never produces lasting Victory that's why you'll never hear it said from this preacher you got to get your shout back you don't got to get your shout back you need to get back to God then you get your shout back there you go that's right there's a right order right order to everything my goodness where is time going here's Israel some of you are looking at your watch wow I didn't even realize others of you have been having me on a timer the whole time you need a renewal you need a renewal come you can sit and watch garbage on a TV for hours on end you can sit and look at your phone for how long and then can't set in the house of God [Music] hallelujah you need a renewal hallelujah look at look at Instagram and Facebook and everything else all the time you need a renewal Facebook Instagram or SnapChat Tik Tok whatever it is it'll never bring you renewal amen but it's the word of God and there's a way back it's a way back it's called repentance when Israel had that great separation of Camp as I said yes Saul was crowned King yes but after the victory the first Victory Was Won Samuel was led by God call the people to gilgal to repair the kingdom I think it's 1st Samuel 21 call him back to repair means renew come back where's gigal gilo is where circumcision took place call them back to the place where the tie of Egypt was broken amen but they but they made a decision for Saul I'm trying to close here on this but they've already made that decision but just because Israel made a wrong decision and a fleshly decision God didn't abandon them as a matter of fact Samuel said I will pray for you God forbid that I stop praying for you and sin against God hallelujah yes so good but how much are we willing to Journey amen are we willing to take those Journeys are we willing to say Lord search me what is it that's I know you forgiven me but what's what caused me to get off path help me Lord I I don't even know how to describe certain ways the way that I am remember brother Bram said he had certain ways the way he was but he also learned how to subdue those things it didn't mean that they didn't come up David said create in me a clean heart and renew a right spirit in me and do what restore unto me the joy of thy salvation David never lost his salvation he lost the joy joy that accompanied it what was it that stopped it is when sin entered his Spirit went astray his eye caught it from the eye it suggested into the reasoning went through the imaginations searched back to the memories it keeps on going keeps on going see David that renewal he knew exactly what to do when the word was leading him to that place create in me a clean hearten renew a right Spirit In Me Lord wherever I've went off Lead Me Lord show me you know what that would be like that would be like let's say whether it's a brother a sister whatever something some area that you would struggle in maybe it's a besetting sin and you look at and say finally Lord show me teach me where is what is it there where's the weakness at because there's no weakness in you the weakness is in me show me Lord show me where it's at that's what as Sons and Daughters of God that's what we're called to friends in this hour you're Lov him let me close on this quote remember it's God who calls for a renewal not us it's God and to have that discernment that's needed honesty and the humility brother says in recognizing your day and its message God create in me a Revival notice how David wrote that create in me he knew Lord I I cannot of my own self do this but create in me what's needed how many of you ever read Psalms 51 before okay about five of you four but Psalms 51 what's very important is after David writes this is some of the very last scriptures he says build thou up the walls of Jerusalem oh Lord that are torn down there was no walls torn down in the natural Jerusalem it was this Jerusalem the walls have been compromised God build up the walls amen build up the walls of my life Lord where if there's something that's come into your life something that's entered in listen don't don't just get it to where it's just a certain area anything that is hindering you and where the joy of the Lord is not permeating in your life like it ought to be if your joy and your Delight is other things of the world if you look forward more to that than you do coming to the house House of God getting in his presence in prayer you need a renewal friends I'm not upset with you I'm here to encourage you this is a moment of renewal right a moment a time that God would call us to and you know what he'll continue until the Rapture at different times calling us to times of renewal God create in me a Revival let me be the Revival Let each of us be the Revival the Revival in me make me Lord to hunger make me to thirst how many could say yes Lord I'll be honest enough right there Lord make me to hunger more make me to thirst more Lord create in me Lord that what is needed in me let me from this hour on be thine more consecrated service a better servant more blessed of you more able more humbler more Kinder more willing to work more looking to the things that are positive and forgetting the things that are in the past and the negatives let me press towards the mar Mark of the High Calling of Christ no one ever cared for me like Jesus that is so good no one no one there's not a doctor there's not a psychologist and I believe like the prophet tells us with doctors he said they're God's agents so I'm not I'm not I'm not Downing doctors you you'll not find that from me you'll not even find me dashing psychologist or psychist I I don't do that because the prophet said anything that helps right direct quote anything that helps but sometimes we we have this place I don't believe in their outcomes I don't believe in their outcomes but a lot of times there's certain things sometimes there's certain principles that can be worked by that are Godly principles but there is is a direct outcome that we know that the only thing that can take place is a renewing of the Holy Spirit true to where that God can go down into a life that maybe has been rejected all their life they have been rejected they have felt rejected maybe from a a parent maybe from a grandparent maybe they were looked at as the Oddball within that family maybe because certain features were different complexities and everything else and yet maybe sometimes it wasn't even things that was said in a certain way you say brother Samuel you mean to tell me that things like that can still exist the Holy Ghost is the Seal of your soul man once the seal has come to your soul then God will give you the strength to let you know you're not rejected you might have been rejected by family you might have been rejected by them but through his grace ministering healing in that area of our life not only will we be able to forgive them and the bitterness cleaned out of our life that's right because we can't have one Speck of bitterness even if we're justified in having it bitterness will run him away from you said brother Samuel that that's that's humanly impossible I know it I know it I know it but With God all things are possible how many Believers here this morning amen the prophet would turn that same scripture back around and he says if you're a Believer then all things are possible with you that is so good see it's recognizing what you've got in your hand yeah it's recognizing that you don't need some big super duper it's faith faith faith faith faith faith simple faith I think what a fitting statement brother brand would make this brother Bram how can a Christian get deeper in the love of God how many of you want to get deeper in the love of God simple statement read the word and pray see how do I know if I'm getting deeper because I could be reading the word and I could be praying it's true but when you open the Bible I've got to read this right here brother Sam you told me you was down you were done before Oh if you listen to this it will help you come on now it'll help you a brother said brother brandham oh I want to see a vision would you pray that God will let me see a vision listen brother Bram says my beloved brother every time you open the Bible you see a vision God revealing himself here is God's Vision go hallah hallu now watch what he says just open it up and say so you see how intentional it is of a morning maybe it's after you get in from work whenever you open it and say God God open my eyes that I can see you because you are the word open my eyes that I can see you Hallelujah you realize this is Your Love Letter am this is our love letter this is where our identity has come from our identity has not come from church amen come on Friends your identity is not with a Doctrine or a movement your identity is in Christ the word hallelujah that's right Lord thank you Jesus read the word amen and pray and as we open in that way and that just that just in that simple way is even as we're continuing to give our lives to the Lord being faithful in the house of God you know you don't know what you're going to miss like brother Timothy was here last night or last night Thursday night what if Zacharias hadn't went to church that day yeah there you go right it wouldn't have been the same stream at home right what about the wise men whether they owned those camels or rented them it still was a costly Journey yes sir they they journeyed that many years for one service Hallelujah one service that's right Hallelujah one service how do you know how do you know that the journey that God has started us on stay faithful stay faithful it might be 20 to 25 miles to ebal and mount gersam but oh oh it's worth the journey yes it is because when you get there you'll see where the curse has already been dealt with that's so good and in the midst of that time as they would describe it it was like a natural Amphitheater that was there where the sound could be heard you'll hear the blessings of God moving upon your life don't you loving the tell me how do I know the effect watch watch watch watch watch what the word does if we're lining up with the word in the right way really the only way there is it'll cause us to line up with one another you see that's why unity and Harmony is not trying to line people up right it's get us lined up with the word when we get lined up with the word then that right there it has that effect it's like brother Bram says they inject it kidney cell into the body he said how does that kidney cell know to go to the kidneys that's right the church age book he said how does it know where to go it say the same way to every son and daughter of God when you've come into the body of Christ The Same Spirit of God knows how to direct you if you're a kidney if you're part of the heart if you're part of this part of the promised land that knows exactly where to direct us where we need to be my let's pray I wonder how many even here this morning as we just approach the Lord in prayer and I think about as I know we've already started a new year and brother Brown would have many times many things to say in regards to a new year but we know we're not people of just turning Pages or turning leaves but we're people lives that God has changed transformed by his presence and if you have an experience to that depth this morning he he wants to do that for you maybe maybe he has done that for you and you can you know that there's that rest that's there but yet now the spirit of God would begin to help us to see there's certain things you need to take and tear down out of your [Music] life the Lord would tell them in Deuteronomy giving them instructions before they would enter in the land he told them to remove the pictures that was representative of the land get rid of their Groves get rid of their Idols get rid of all those things pictures and everything lest it become a snare unto you don't look at something and say well that don't bother me no more remember remember the little sister named Nelly that the prophet talks about in great greatest battle ever fought she was on the other side of the street of the dance hall and begin to she heard that music and she thought well that don't bother me no more brother brm says oh that's just what you think she began to then entertain thoughts reminiscing of how that her and a man named Lee won so many dancing competitions and just from stopping to listen she finds herself in the arms of a man on that dance floor now the prophet of God when he would teach that he would teach that and bring that out in greatest battle ever fought we don't want to look at things in a manner to where oh this doesn't bother me I'm I'm okay with this really let the Holy Spirit just evaluat your heart and your life right now and be honest remember a time of renewal is going to require discernment it's going to require honesty and it will require humility can you really be honest with God most importantly honest with yourself cuz if you can't be honest with yourself you'll never be honest to God he already knows he already [Music] knows I wonder here this morning say [Music] Lord as you look back over your life I'm not the same person I was a year ago two years ago however maybe it's just a few months ago I don't know but right here in his presence oh what an opportunity what a privilege hallelujah what a privilege what a tender moment to say Lord I want to renew yes I want to renew renew my life Lord renew a real fresh consecration show me Lord where my spirit went off course what is it that I allowed to come into my spirit that would hinder me in that way I want to pull down that stronghold I want to do is Paul would speak to the Ephesian Believers in that time give no place to the devil lord Jesus help us Lord the prophet himself he would have never recognized what was going on in his own Spirit when that complex had formed he never would have caught [Music] it but you made him aware of it Lord it wasn't gone as soon as he recognized it but I want you to think of this the prophet stands before a group of graduates and come follow me before he makes his track back to Jeffersonville in June of 1963 he doesn't go into the whole story that he speaks of in standing in the Gap but he tells them I was headed down a wrong road but he stopped [Music] me and he could stand there among them graduates and say but I'm on a different road [Music] now Lord [Music] Jesus we need your grace [Music] Lord I wonder how he would say Lord I want to renew oh Lord want to put my hand in your hand Lord these are areas Lord I've not wanted to go into but I'm not going alone it's not a dark Cavern there's a man there's a man here who can turn on the [Music] light there's a man that knows what wir to Touch where in order to make it run [Music] right God bless you God bless you Lord search me out Lord search every area of my life Lord I believe in my heart dear God my soul has been sealed but search my spirit Lord search My Heart
