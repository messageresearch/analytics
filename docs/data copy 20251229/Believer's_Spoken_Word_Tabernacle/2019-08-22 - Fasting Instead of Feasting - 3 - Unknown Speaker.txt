wasn't friendly now I know why that text I got yesterday but I just certainly I really do count them as friends and brothers it's so good to have friends and just many many things brother Brian had mentioned in 92 days that I think they're gonna be coming tonight when I walked in back there he asked me he said you know brother Jonathan I said yeah I know brother Jonathan I said we were in some trenches together and that byc and and places and ministering and the Lord as well as brother Andrew we were there and so we're just so thankful to see what God is doing and I just so appreciate you

for that amen so we just brother Andrew but just you know I appreciate our brother and his travels and just traveling not just here in the States but although all over the the world and you know he's

welcome back my heart's so good just to see you out there on that front step and I wasn't the only one the whole car lit up when I pulled in and the boys started you know talking right away and so they could hardly they could hardly get out of the car fast enough to get up there to shake your hand but we love you just appreciate you so much you might want to remind you of the graduation party of our son Paul and Saturday there at the Heritage Presbyterian Church Hall Lord willing be having that it's at one o'clock right one o'clock I didn't have a reminder pop-up on that one that sounds terrible but I also want to say it's just been um good to have sister Lily here from Texas here with this and so he goes back on Saturday right sister Lily god bless you amen and just pray for safe travels amen for her well First Samuel chapter 14 and we'll just ask the help of the Lord to try to bring it together verse 24 and the men of Israel were distressed that day for Saul had adjourned the people saying cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening that I may be avenged on my enemies so none of the people tasted any food and all they of the land came to a wood and there was honey upon the ground and when the people were come into the wood behold the honey dropped but no man put his hand to his mouth for the people feared the old but Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the old wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in a honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth and his eyes were enlightened then answered one of the people and said thy father straitly charged the people with an old saying cursed be the man that eateth any food this day and the people were faint what a condition then said Jonathan my father hath troubled the land see I pray you how mine eyes have been enlightened because I tasted a little of this honey amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I just wanted to just just drop right back into the channel where we were at here last Thursday and we've been dealing with this thought for me fasting instead of feasting and we know that there is a blessing in fasting but this that we're looking at is where they were withheld or withholding from eating what was in season and also a time when there was a war going on and to know that God when you think of how God has so prepared for us what we have need of and sometimes we say this and we don't always I'll just say I don't believe we always take it into heart to recognize all the preparations that God has for us brother Branham would tell us even how God would know the type of landscape that you like the type of colors of flowers and all those things and God would actually make sure that those things were here for us and then to see how that God within every one of the feasts that God gave Israel God gave it and ensured that what was needed to be brought to that feast that it would be ready it would be in season it would be in harvest everything would be right on time and God knew exactly when Israel was coming into this time here of war God knew exactly what they would have need of this was a season where the honey was dropping it was a time where there was as sustenance that for the people of God within that time but I want you to I want to draw your attention here to a place within the scriptures the very opening Scripture we read here and the whole the whole part where it says of this fast was called not to eat what they should have been eating and we see the case that people were distressed the people were faint they weren't able to fight like they should have been fighting and the whole thing that it came down to you know there's sometimes a word that may not seem as big but yet it can be a very big word and where it comes down to is that saul had adjourned the people in verse 24 cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening that I may be avenged on mine enemies so the whole purpose of this fast was not about the rest of the Israel this whole purpose of this fast was about soul and you find over and over under Saul's leadership and that this is a reflection of where the heart of the people were in that Saul himself was a choice of the people where they wanted a king like the other kings like other nations they got their eyes off of the Living God and they got their eyes on other nations and so then from that it all comes forth that their choice was a choice based on their own desires and it was based on selfishness so when we look at this and just to bring it down into the practical measure one of the things that we always and always must deal with and ever be mindful of is always bringing self in line with the Word of God and this is why there is a need it's not just an option but there must be a new birth our life must be born again of the Spirit of God because then there's a change of nature that sets forth there is a quickening power there is that authority then to bring into subjection the other outer to realm of the body and that at that of Christ might be reflected through our lives it gives us as the scripture says power and that's exactly what the Holy Ghost does and so when we recognize this that even within that as believers we need to feed upon the Word of God all the way through the scriptures Jesus would say man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and here were the Pharisees within a time they they had the scriptures they had the Psalms they had the writing of the prophets they had all of that and here Jesus brings them back to a place that Moses had of God now we know the bread of God is nothing different from the Word of God but the bread of God is the very Living Word of God that is promised in this hour and there's no way that we can actually be sustained being overcomer without the Living bread of life and that what God has promised then God supplies that Living bread for you and I for this hour and so when we look at this I want to just go into the scriptures here in to Matthew chapter 16 verse 18 and this is a familiar scripture where the Lord Jesus is he expresses here the term of the church and he says I say unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it now if we recognize the very the very premise and foundation of the Church of the Living God is that it is it is founded and it is built by the Lord Himself and it cannot be without him providing what is needed in order to bring forth that church now to think of this God has already provided when the scripture says if from the Book of Psalms and then Paul picks it up in Hebrews a body hast thou prepared for me it was not just speaking of better the corporal body of the Jesus Christ but it was speaking of the body the mystical body of believers the attributes of God that were in God sons and daughters of God I believe I'm talking to you tonight that we're in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and God's desire was to dwell within his body which is his wife which is his church which is that which is from his mind his choosing which he took from his own side so here the Lord Jesus is here giving this term and you know I just say it like this I know sometimes it's been a term that sometimes has seemingly been looked down upon but this is a scriptural term there's a lot of churches but there's one Church of the Living God amen there's one Church of the Living God and this is exactly what the Lord Jesus is speaking of and there's only one way into this church you can't join it you've got to be born into this church there's nobody that shakes our hand to get into it but it is Christ Himself the chief Shepherd who baptizes us into this body by his own spirit so now to look at this just the word and the term church here it is notice how it's broke down into the parts here it's a gathering of citizens called out from their homes into some public place and assembly the second part of it and assembly of the people convened at the public place of the council for the purpose of deliberating now I'm not gonna deal on it tonight but there is a reason we have come here and that's for deliberating this we're not here by accident we are here tonight intentionally it isn't just something we came here tonight and said well you know I'll just stagger in here tonight and you know I don't got no place else better to go there it is intentional now you might maybe you're a person that maybe there's something that struck your heart maybe it's your first time you've ever been here but I'll tell you right now not here by chance tonight there is nothing here by chance and as believers listen now has believers when that grips our heart the purpose of God then our lives are no longer to live in a manner of haphazard we're looking for the will of God and the things that we do are intentional it is deliberate we are deliberate about coming to the house of God we're deliberate about reading the word we are deliberate about praying we are delivered this is not accidental we are intentional in what we're doing [Applause] to deliberate to reflect to see ourselves in the word and to take a reckoning to take an account of our lives we're not here by chance in a Christian sense it says it's an assembly of Christians gathered for worship in a religious meeting it's accompanied the next part a company of Christians or of those who hoping for eternal salvation through Jesus Christ observe their own religious rites and hold their own religious meetings and manage their own affairs according to regulations prescribed for the body for orders sake those and once you just look at this one those who anywhere in a city a village constitute such a company and are united into one body the whole body of Christians scattered throughout the earth and the Assembly of faithful Christians already dead and received into heaven so to recognize that here tonight we are gathered together in this village of Sheffield tonight or this city we have gathered here as as a body of believers we are not gathering here in vain we have not come here with the purpose of just to be seen or to see one another it's just in that but we have come here tonight we our desire is to hear from God we are here to worship Him this is not a self-centered affair we are not here tonight just to see I'm going to see what God will give me tonight it might be your time and opportunity to give back to God a man after all we are priests unto our God kings and priests so to think of it here we are gathered together as a little body and many other little bodies brother Jonathan their last night as they were gathered together and others that are gathered together little assemblies little outposts like it was in the time of Egypt you know no matter what church or outpost City you went to in Egypt when you receive the grain you are not receiving it from another man you are receiving it from Joseph it was it was totally identified that you are receiving it from Joseph and our Joseph is the Lord Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost that is given as the leadership of the church of the living god he is the tzafenat paneah the revealer of the secret things it is him that holds the stewardship and the counselor life he is the milk ascetic that is in our myth and he is revealing himself and revealing the secrets of our lives so we're not here just for a gathering we have gathered here to meet with our Lord Jesus that's what church is to us now notice how that David you know would take this I I loved reading you know how David's held what David's expressions were in Psalms 23 verse 6 surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever now I understand that many of these scriptures that we can read we do understand that it was speaking in a type of the house of God's building that was coming his body where we would be baptized in by one spirit but remember here it does not do away with the gathering in the house of the Lord as a matter of fact all the way through and even in the admonition in the coming of the Lord we are admonished to come to the house of God it is the house of correction whew so here's what David said I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever Oh Psalms 26 verse 8 Lord I have loved the habitation of the house and the place where thy non ur dwelleth verse 12 my foot standeth in an even place in the congregation's will I bless the Lord I don't know about you but this don't seem like anybody who's coming to see and wonder who's wearing water anything else David said I've got one purpose I want to dwell in the house of God and when I come in the congregation of God I am going to bless the Lord I'm gonna raise my hands I'm going to enter into worship oh my Psalm 65 verse 4 blessed is the man whom thou chooses and calls it to approach unto thee that he may dwell in that courts aren't you glad that he shows you aren't you glad he's drawn you and I to this place he's done that my foot no look at this we shall be satisfied with the goodness of the house even of the holy temple now I want you to look at this here in psalm 66 verse 13 I will go into the house with burnt offerings I will pay thee my vows which my lips have added and my mouth has spoken when I was in trouble you know many times were asking and we're looking to God we come upon situations but you know David is declaring I'm going to go to the house of God and I'm not just going to wait then to offer a praise but when I get into the house of God I am going to worship Tim because he has been with me when I was outside of the house of God glowing about my daily business I am coming here and I'm gonna declare Lord you are faithful Lord thank you for helping me Lord thank you for encouraging me Lord thank you for dropping food my way thank you for giving me strength the Lord never knew you I will offer unto the burnt sacrifices of fatlings with the incense of rams I will offer bullets with goats salem so this this right here this man come into church by the name of David was not one who was a leech this was not one who come that just wanted to see what can they give me I wonder what they can give me I wonder what brother Samuel study well if you were in prayer and your walking with God you realize your walk with God and your prayers it has an effect and deter and actually causes what is studied and brought within this service it's about a relationship outside of these walls Amen it's that Lord I got a need I want to hear from you tonight and I'm gonna bring a sacrifice of praise sometimes it's a sacrifice because you don't feel like it come on somebody but you know it's a time to come and to offer now y'all know what I'm talking about it's our time that we've all got apart when we come to the house of God right here we all got apart now how might as well go ahead and preach right now because I know sometimes our old stinking flash gets in the way and says well you know brother Brian and them you know they I mean they'll really be able to sing and you know the musicians they'll get up there I know my brother and sister you know they're always right there at the door you know I know that they're just really gonna they're gonna be the ones that's going to bring an effect with the service but you see when you realize that you have a part in the service and you might say but you don't know how I feel tonight but when you think about how Paul and Silas felt when they had to and that moment begin to just think upon the goodness of God they begin to sing the songs of the Lord and the presence of God come down brother it brought liberation that night if anybody would have not felt like worshiping they didn't but they didn't worship because they felt like it they worshiped because the Living God is worthy of their worship that's why they were worshiping it would be to God well my David said Psalms 84 verse 10 for a day in night courts is better than a thousand Omaha I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my god than to dwell in the tents of wickedness and brother brandon picks that scripture up and brother brandon works it from doorkeeper to door mat now you know what a doormat is a good doormat is something so people can lock their feet on it now I've had doormats in my house they ended up in the garbage because they followed me through the house when I'm going to go wipe my feet they clung to my feet and they followed me all through the house but I want something that's grounded when I go to get my shoes off I can rub them on that ground I can pull them off its rounded and possession its able to handle that rubbing and those shoes can be deposited oh my I tell you blessed God the how our hearts are to be so established and position that one's this comes or that comes or this is said or this idea we are so positioned in Christ that we can say I would rather be a doorkeeper at door in the house of God to dwell in the tents of wickedness the Bible is true it says offenses shall come home I'll you know David thinking like this and David was not he did not see what you and I see and half tonight David was rejoicing on the law thou shalt not thou shalt not David said I'd rather be there now you want look how important this is brother Branham he goes into this in an uncertain sound I know this is simple but look how the Prophet would relate to this you believe there's places that there's atmospheres believe I'm talking about here we are in Ohio again he said I think tomorrow night we're going to have some auditorium or something but I was glad to get to come to the church I like the church I think that brother Sullivan in the event of travel as I found that the best meetings as always in churches I hope I'm not superstitious if I am I don't know it but then when you go into these places where they have amusements and gambling and dances and it just looks to me like there's just little devils sitting around everywhere you know they just kind of a habitation for they just stay there and then you've got to go in and take about five nights to preach all them out you know before you can get the meeting started but in the church house I believe the angels of God encamped around because of saints gathering there the angels of God just don't go up and down their own and say oh there's a church let's go there know the angels of God are here tonight because of you because of saints of God that are gathered here rather this ground I don't know what it was know that it probably was a swamp being in Sheffield I don't know what it was and this church and how you know it was used there by the UPC for all those years but brother when God in has led us to this place and the light that God has sent to us in this hour this message this revelation of Jesus Christ whether this place has become like Bethel was to Jacob a place where we meet face to face with the Living God and lives are changed it's a place where they access into the throne of God and the angels of God are ascending and descending on the ladder of God it is a place that God had sanctified by his presence and his presence is in you the angels of God are here tonight I always think oh brother branham when he told the story about all those Usher's and how he walked down to the platform of Houston brother Brandon gives the numbers sister methi said there wasn't that many Esther's in the meeting she said what it was he was looking in that unseen realm and the angels of God lined it right down there that the Prophet could walk onto the platform this is a promise of glory this is a promise of God you realize that when Elijah was standing there with the hazeh and even remember Gaza was all destruct about what was going on and Elijah told him he said Lord open this man's eyes that he can see the aims of that the heelside Ruben said the hillside was filled with angels you know brother bran told us he'll I should didn't see the Angels but Elijah knew the word and he confidence here what God had said in the word that the angels and TAS around about those who have had that serious name he didn't tell him but he had confidence in the word because he knew the god of the word the angels of God are here tonight because saints are gathered here it's a noted place for God where he comes and meets with his people well he says that's always seemed kind of good to me to be in a church she said I liked it better it seems like a home you know he said it's where we just fellowship together and have things in common now the scriptures here and Hebrews chapter 10 verse 23 I want you to notice these words let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promise and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works no doubt every one of us we'd like to be able to we want to provoke insight on to love and good words there's a lot of other provocation that goes on that not not be but this is the kind of provoking that we want to do but you know in order to do that it requires self to be put in the background sometimes when you maybe don't oh you know I don't feel like you know singing tonight or I don't feel like going tonight or I don't feel like this tonight right and you go ahead and you push through that you don't know that you're very you're very being here can be an actual encouragement to somebody else examples brother brands standing here and the devil has been telling him nobody loves you nobody cares for you but the brand says I get gloomy I got to fight them temptations he said but then he says I look out here and I see people that come to the house of God they stayed over to hear the word and he says so I put that right back in the devil's face and say yes there are people who love me and they love this word you see it wasn't just about they love brother Branham but brother Branham was looking at and I believe this is where you and I in our hearts is is that it's a seeing that people that the Lord I want people to love the Lord it's not me it's the Lord and we love the Lord in the right way then we'll love one another the right way amen so let us provoke one another unto love and good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more than much the more as you see the Day approaching this word forsaking it means to forsake to leave to abandon to desert to leave in streets helpless totally abandoned utterly forsaken it you know what that is I'm not caring for when you forsake something it doesn't matter whatever happens to it happens to see there's no burden now I just felt like this this admonition is given by Paul the first church age messenger there are things that Paul was seen as the rest of them were seeing that even as that Antichrist spirit was creeping in among the churches they were seeing this and Paul was identifying this that this was something that believers who need to be admonished on that I know that we might look at that and say well if they're believers they they shouldn't have to be admonished on it huh I will agree in the sense that it ought to be something within our heart that we desire to be in the house of God I believe that and I also believe that there's times that as we walk here in this life that we can get distracted with other things but the Holy Ghost he will not lose one he will see to it that every blessing that he has determined for our lives that we don't miss it he might have to whip us correctness and whatever more but he will get us where we need to be oh my so Paul was already witnessing these things where there were those who were not assembling they had begin to break away you know and you know when we look at this brother round takes this up here in Christ the mystery we're familiar with this I want you to think of this for a moment because I just don't look at the things that are spoken I look at the placement of it here it is Christ the mystery with brother Branham would identify as the seventh seal message which Idiot's Christ in you and me it that is the coming of the Lord in our life that makes us ready for the corporal coming this was the promise when the body has come to completion that cry steps in to be fully manifest I don't think there's one of us here tonight that would say well I don't want him to be fully manifested in me but on the contrary we would desire and say Lord I want you to have the preeminence in my life show me Lord if there's any hindrances so here the Prophet picks this up and you know he says now you've got tapes on it tapes on what we believe you got tapes on discipline in the church and how we be say behave ourselves in the Church of God how we got to come here together and sit together in heavenly places don't stay home here is the key if God is in your heart that's the key right there if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers if you don't don't feel that way then I tell you it's time you've got to breathe so you mean if I am NOT wanting to come to the house of God and fellowship with brothers and sisters you mean that how to get the prayer yeah you need to get to brand and say God give me a real experience let the love of God comes down in my heart and if I've got cold sing then revive me send the revival fire and break every hold Lord all the distractions of the enemy I know the devil has told a lie but it's not important for us to go to church but I'm telling you believers go to church I read to you last week God goes to church Jesus goes to church the Bible said in the Book of Luke he was in the synagogue as was his custom you want to know where Jesus was when it was church that church that's where Jesus was Jesus didn't all of a sudden say well I got the scrolls and I'm the word made flesh we don't got to go to the synagogue little Morton or he would have been up breaking that word but now it's coming to the fulfillment of it that you are a dwelling place and the dwelling places of God still come together and to worship and deliberate amen we come to identify what side that were wrong we come to hear from God we come to receive from God we come that the Holy Ghost might move among us and that the gifts are present that there's healing of the sick that deliverance and opening of eyes of the blind we come here with the real purpose don't stay home have jobs in your heart oh my cuz we're in the last days where the Bible exhorted us see this is now the scripture was always an exhortation down through the ages but in this age we see the Day approaching we're not looking a far-off brother we've arrived this place is in a mess it's Ana chaos we have received our day and it's message it's time to get out of here much more as we see that day approaching to do what what's up brother BAM place is here to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places and Christ Jesus and love one another this will all men know you are my disciples when you have loved one for the other stay right together so coming to the house of God maybe I'm just simple so coming to the house of God to be with the other saints of God and the Fellowship around the word is a display of divine love I love you but this Holy Ghost said through John don't let us just love in word but in deed oh my faith is not wavering but your faith must be displayed by your works if your wife's don't declare that faith that you are looking and expecting his coming then something's wrong do we have differences yeah you mean we don't all think alike well then how in the world can we all come to the same church because of him because our focus is not on one another I don't have a glass of water up here but brother bill shared this one with me nothing I mean almost a year ago or so I don't know maybe it's longer than that but here was a woman getting ready to leave church pastor there are nothing but a bunch of hypocrites there's this and this and this and this and this so the pastor said Oh before you leave I want you to take this glass of water and you have to use your imagination I want you to take this glass of water and that glass of water was filled to the brim so why won't you to do I want you to walk all the way around this church and I don't want you to spill one drop of water so here she goes she's careful she makes it all the way back I didn't I didn't drop her drop the pastor said that's right now why was that because I was focusing on this that's it that's it what are we here to focus on come on somebody you see it's what we're here to focus on that woman she was focused on the right thing but you see as far as in the water but that's how it is to be when we come to the house of God it's to be focused on the Lord the Bremen goes into that council there within within everything you know but and he deals with you know you think a brother's a little wrong do you think the sister is wrong you say Lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness springing up cause it will affect him see who's it about not you him it'll take the Christ right out of my life that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you Christ in you the hope of glory it will run him from the tabernacle here it'll kill the Spirit of God drive it away from here it'll hurt your pastor it'll do everything don't you do that you just lacks that much closer together take the buckle as the brother testified a minister here the other night how about having a buckle seeing it in a vision that buckles on the whole armor of God just pull around tighten up move right up close to one another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and then God will bless you [Music] [Applause] it's easy to say nice things about nice people it's easy to say nice things when everybody agrees with you but when it comes time for this right here you see it's not what I figure the Devils on sums up no no no the real reality is now it's time for an expression out of our lives no we want a whole order I want to walk on the water Lord I want to heal the sick lord I want to do this and what I want to do this but remember Jesus also exhibited the forgiveness of God come on somebody he had Judas was right there with him and he never treated Judas different it wasn't anything you could say oh yeah I think I know the guy now yeah I know the guy I can tell I got Jesus looked at him nope nope they questioned themselves but you see what what this is that this is not out of order brother random by the Spirit of God is bringing this these are things that could cause people to want to separate from assembling together someone so did this so and so did that who's that about that's about you it's about you the Bible says love covers a multitude of sins now watch how brother branham deals with this do you know reasoning oh I'll tell you with it this outside realm we deal with reasoning and you have to battle with reasoning now reasoning comes in all sorts of shapes and sizes reasoning can come you know in a matter of well you know what I'll tell you what it's just not gonna be convenient for me to be in the house of God on Thursday nights I'll tell you what I do I'll make sure I catch brother so-and-so service on Wednesday and that way I fulfilled my duty that ain't your church home this is your church home if that's what God's declared in your life come on somebody if God has declared that in your life is to recognize that hey you've got a duty I've got a part to be here reasoning oh man we could deal with this a lot reasoning and just deliberating on things well you know I think we need to do this you know we don't want anything to affect you know the children we want to give the children we do it and want to make them not love the Lord Jesus we how about the interesting just say Lord I want the love of God to so flow through me that they are so captivated with you that it's not a worry about oh I can't the problem of this and I can't take this from them and I can't do this and I can't do that why would you let the devil put fear in your heart the Bible says that good you they and their offspring shall be there with them and the promise is through the book of songs it's important in this hour let's not let's cast down reasoning I'll tell you this right here when it come down than my boys you know we looked at the one time we were going to let him play t-ball or a baseball or I don't know what it was a little league ball I'm not against that but you know what happened we got to looking at it you know what it was he's on Thursday nights so guess what you went prayed about it nope I don't have to pray about it didn't need to pray about it well you're the pastor you could change the day of service that would be selfish and in changing for myself this is where God has set on this day that we would have service on Thursday I can guarantee you if we moved it on Wednesday to accommodate lives or Tuesday the devil would see to it that the activities were planned on that day you've got to make a decision as for me and my house we will serve the Lord I'm going to make a decision for the Lord I tell you God will bless you for it [Music] what's wrong with the RAM says in first thing for life he says this wolf and the deer come up this wolf if he can catch a little deer out to itself that's the one they work on he said there's a lesson if he can catch a deer away from the herd then he that's what the devil wants to do talks about you know young ladies what what counsel its simplicity what counsel you young ladies he wants you to go out with a boy that's not a Christian to you young men he wants you to go out with some little painted Jezebel that's not a Christian there he wants to break you up that's what he wants to suck his teeth into you the death was only using them much a puppet as he used the serpent in the garden once he did what he did he let her go come on somebody it was only a puppet and then Satan's the biggest trick that Satan has is to get somebody isolated off to themselves now understand this you can be in a big crowd of people and you still be isolated have walked down malls and places and shopping places and there are people that I'm having excused and I'm bumping elbows with and yet I feel so all alone you know why there's nobody there there's nothing there that I can fellowship with but I love to be around believers then I can fellowship with it we've got things in common brother we've got a message that God has sent to you and I Oh now the real genuine Holy Ghost in this hour we can fellowship around this word it's changing us oh my this little deer what's how brother man goes on to put this this little deer will get out to itself away from the herd that's the one the wolf works and to you old man or woman when you separate yourself from believers notice when you separate yourself from believers people say I can stay at home and be just a good a Christian as I can at church you can't nor the RAM quotes the scripture you forsake to assemble yours no don't forgive forsake to assemble ourselves together and that much more as you see the time to come in if you're a Christian here it is again if you're a Christian you love to stream maybe my maybe it's the Apple device I don't know many if you're a Christian you long to go where other Christians are and fellowship with other Christians [Music] if you're a Christian so you cannot stay away from church and live the same life you can't do it he said because it's like I'm hungry but I'll never go to the table I'll never eat I ain't going to do it you've got to go and feed on the word of God and fellowship with one another two parts feed and fellowship personal differences we have them some people like maybe this they like this song this people like we've got personal differences but in order for unity in order for unity it's going to require setting aside personal differences I'll tell you where personal differences become damnable is when personal differences become Dogma you say how do you know when it becomes doubler a self-righteous critical spirit enters and it becomes dogma that's where it begins to break and the very thing that a person say I want this and I want that and they don't recognize the very spirit that is motivating their life is the very thing that they're not wanting and yet here they are being formed into that same thing that's deception deception personal differences so in order for unity it requires us to be able to lay aside differences for a common vision and that common vision we come we come together for and that's for the edifying of the body of Jesus Christ what's our brother branham words this he says we need one another more now than we did need each other than we ever did meet each other is now brother Samuel I don't need you well I need you I need you I'm not talking about I need you so I've got somebody to preach you that's what I'm talking I need you I need your prayers your fellowship when you look at this statement when you get yourself singled out from the rest of them making yourself a list a little different you don't want to associate with them because they believe this and don't want to associate with that you're getting on dangerous ground right then keeping away from church so what's what's going on here is this somebody doing it no it's it's them the person making themselves different they're the ones putting up walls now it can be wall wear it so on so offended me this one offended me this offended me and this are this friends listen offenses are real but you've got to have discernment to recognize it is the devil's objective to try to cause you to forsake to assemble together let me just tell you something right now you see patterns many times that can follow within people's lives families and whatever more it becomes a pattern they can come to church for a year and then they're in another church then they're at this church then they're districts it's a pattern the problem isn't churches the problem is the people you know why that is it's the enemy getting in there and it starts to form themselves and make themselves a little different it's not God listen God's not an isolationist he's a separation Asst and the kind of separation that God has is here Jesus was in the world yet not of the world he walked among sinners yet he did not put take of their sin it was a separated life Jesus didn't say I can't go against you no you want members and you this and you guys are filthy once you all get all sanctified and cleaned up and you know you really get a good experience then I can begin to associate with you that ain't how Jesus approached it brother he came to give life and to give life more abundantly the Pharisees had a lot of religion but nobody was attracted to their self-righteous religion there ought to be an attraction in our life an attraction isn't holding up a message book it's that that same message is living of Jesus Christ it's living in our lives he's the attraction in this hour watch this find the one of your choice I know this is simple find the one of your choice you mean every church is not a cookie cutter you mean every one of them don't look like Brandon Tabernacle you mean they don't in me God's not a cookie cutter God well he said find the one of your choice saint jesus same holy ghost same gospel but gods are got a variety and so God would even say you know what there'll be one that you like there'll be certain things about that it'll just it'll fit right there then it's not just about what fits you it's about coming into that vision it's about recognizing God speaking personally to me right here the stewardship of my life is being unfolded amen now look at this here let me just I'm trying trying to get down here look at this look can I have just a few more moments brother BAM goes on again here he is he's talking about you know the different churches he's out in the middle of having meetings and he says here the second paragraph you visitors here now that's out of town that's been here there's some mighty fine churches around town here he's got a mighty nice church up here and these other two ministers here I suppose cooperating I've never met back here and there's some mighty fine churches and we want you to attend one of those Church some of those churches in the morning and the Church of your choice Oh variety and if you're a member of some church why you stand at your post of duty tomorrow yes and I want to appreciate brother Glen for making this meeting on Sunday afternoon too close because it shows a real fellowship and a real Brotherhood among men and we want every person to stand at their post of duty at their church where that's your place that's your duty to be there if you help pool I'll get through a quicker but I don't think we're quite finished with the subject I've always tried to make it a custom to close on Sunday afternoon with my service on Sunday afternoon and after we get the gospel tent we'll do the same thing be closed up on Sunday afternoon after the Sunday afternoon service and have no morning service so that people can attend their own church sounds to me like the Prophet was interested in people being in their home church amen he was interested in that that he would make sure there was no conflict so they could get in their own church why that's their post it's like if you're supposed to man the artillery well you know there somebody else will get in there you know they'll get somebody else no you're the man they artillery it might be you're pulling within this service right here that it brings the presence of God down in this service oh brother Samuel what about if I want to go on vacation what no these we're not talking about not going on vacation we're not talking about that it's against visiting other churches that's not what that's not what's being said here what's being said is be at your post of duty it let it be something in your heart that you recognize I have got to be there this is service times and I service in the morning I'm gonna be there in the house of God not just because we're coming to a church but we're coming to meet with God we feel that every person is duty-bound to attend some church and belong to some church as a Christian where do you go to church oh we just visit Oh floater there's a quote floater ramblin rolling stone moving from pillar to post come on friends there there up to be a place notice you find a church of your choice and you belong to that church you had pinned that church you get in that vision of that assembly you know it's just like this of a person comes my lord a person comes and they say you know what I'm gonna make this right here you know what I'm gonna make this my own church brother Simon I think there's some things you need to do this and I think you need to do this and I think you need to do this and I'm gonna tell you I think you need to go on past us because this this church black brother Jonathan's church is led by the Holy Ghost it's the same God a sovereign God and remember this now when brother Branham member when he walked out of a Baptist Church many people look at that and say he wasn't going to ordain women ministers that is true but brother Graham said the reason I gave up my card is because the Baptist Church where I was going gave up their local sovereignty to where it became a control how fair but to recognize it's not a control out there but the Living God that's directing and leading the Church of the Living God the pillar fire the angel of the Lord is right here to direct the Church of the Living clock all the way into the rapture if I go by the way of the grave God's got another vessel that the same age of the Lord will use a little keep marching many people say well I stay home and read my Bible I'm just as well-off wonder if they got Hebrews 10 in there I mean wonder I'm just a list of the message what if they had what did what did they do with the part well everybody ought to have a pastor I know I know how things get reasoned out but notice he said no the Bible said we shouldn't forsake to assemble ourselves together we've got to do that we've got to stand together and all the churches I'm trying not to be brother Andrew a favorite preacher tonight I am closer tray tables are up Sitra up everything's ready for landing it's evens 1:3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ program would take that scripture and he talks about he says I'm prayed up you're prayed up he said here we are as Saints baptized in the Holy Ghost he said when we come together and all he said we sat in heavenly places he said what a meeting we have he said how many ever been in a meeting like that I've been there he said you don't want to hardly leave why it's there in heavenly places brother bran picks that up right up there Scripture imposition of a believer in Christ now the fellow said how can be a Christian and stay home just as well no you can't no you've got to meet together with the rest of the body we're by the sample you know you've got streaming you might want to be careful if you can be in the house of God and you're set in home streaming instead of being here I'm going to tell you the marriage supper of the lamb you won't be streaming that Oh God knows my heart he sure does know your heart and if your heart desires to be in the house of God there's going to be a way made for you and there will be sacrifices that are made for us to be here oh my oh my he has blessed us you've got to meet together with the rest of the body he has blessed us together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus let me just read just to just a couple of things here dicey time closing here fine thing was of this fine thing that I ever have to happen to me is when I can come to the house of the Lord I can be so tired and wore out and upset that probably covers all of us here tonight and only can bite us in the back here beside me I can be tired wore out and upset but just let me get to the house of the Lord where all the saints are gathered and pray then I go to feeling better right away there's something soothing about it and it's not frankincense in a diffuser it's the Holy Ghost and that's being diffused from Locke the real it's since your oil it's just moving through it has a way to bring peace it has a way to soothe you walk into that door back there brother Carlos standing right there you might have to look down the scene but he stands right there to say God bless you at that big old smile welcome to the house of God brother bill standing there brother Gomez standing there welcome to the house of God what is that that's doorkeepers Omaha that's a different message then I'd go to feeling better right away there's something soothing about it something all he says don't you just think so rather something that just soothes and seems to iron out all the wrinkles and you're just satisfied in the presence of the Lord that same presence that we have been invited into that same presence that goes with us he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you that same God who made a way that he can come and dwell within our lives every day as a prophet told us we are the Temple of the Living God he said God goes to church God lives in you God warships every day how does it God worship in our lives by us letting him have the right away and he expresses his life through us it's worship it's adoration back to the Living God circumstances like that of where we read here with Saul things can come we can feel tired we can feel wore out we can feel upset you can get cold but you can also say Lord I'm gonna tighten up the bottle and that tightening up of the buckle is ask him say Lord I need a fresh refilling of the Holy Ghost you know what I mean a fresh refilling David asked the Lord he never asked the Lord for salvation he said restore to me the joy of thy salvation if there's cares and things of life and there are there is such a compounding of demonic oppression upon this age this is an erotic age Satan every one of his guns is upon you as the believer but let me just tell you no weapon formed against you if God be for us and he is then who can be against us God just comes down when you say Lord fan the flame in me fan the flame in my life and then you recognize you see this yes I've been there I've been tired I've been upset I've been warned but all what it means to come into the house of God and in his presence I'm renewed I'm refreshed I get a fresh outlook the problems don't go away brother William but I get a fresh outlook I get strength to face those problems amen you love him tonight a man who's my whole and all hallelujah hallelujah amen we have come into this house gathered in his name to worship here we have come into his house and gathered in his name to worship here we have come into his house and gathered in his name to worship Christ i lo Oh shall be Jesus Christ i lo let us forget forget about ourselves and concentrate on him and worship Me just forget about yourself concentrate on him and worship Me just forget about yourself concentrate on and worship rights the law [Music] oh let us lift the magnifier and [Music] magnify his name and word [Music] magnify his name [Music] [Applause] Jesus cries oh we have come we have taught me to smile together [Music] all areas in the midst of us we [Music] for we have coming out together Oh [Music] leaves us proud how lord repay me to be a section tried and true [Music] Lansky ah [Music] we say for you once again law prepare me [Music] to be upset too yes my lord and true [Music] whoa I trust tonight before we bow our heads in prayer you recognize the great responsibility that placed within our hearts our lives to find that of a home church I believe I'm looking at here tonight you've found a place that God has identified to you but I want you to understand and know that what God has identified to you and how he speaks to you personally I want you to understand he values your worship he values you being here as a believer priest not just to be here in the in these pews but it is being here it's showing yourself sacrificing and I know there's times situations arise but friends listen we all know that really in our heart and I'm just I'll encourage you tonight as your pastor and those who are streaming don't let that take the place if you can be in the house of God be in the house of God you what you don't know is sometimes the extra effort and the sacrifice that you make god bless the sacrifice you might be going through the biggest trial or might be going coming into one of the trials of your life and I'll tell you one of the wonderful promises that God spoke to us through the Prophet in this hour he said you show me a man or woman that'll put God first and everything he said I'll show you a man or woman that'll come out on top despite whatever the devil can put on it God made that known to you and I through the messenger in this hour amen I don't really believe that to be true I've proved that but I've got to keep on you got to keep on it isn't just one enough we check it off and say what did that know it's constant but you know what he's just falling in love with him the more you fall in love with him then the things that he asked of us and it's a delight to be in the house of God and as I said tonight if you find in your heart you find a little coldness that's growing in there just let God remedy that if you find that you're missing that fire of God all together and it's just something it just comes and goes it comes and goals you know after a period of time here you are you're out here you're out there I'm telling you there's a real experience for you there's a real experience inside of that hidden place with Christ where God takes the throne room in your heart that's what his desire is to do is to manifest his glory his victory in our lives but if you've grown cold' if there's something things have grown up maybe maybe you've got distracted with cares of life things that have come up you found like my just seem like there's so much that's going around so much that's going on but you can say Lord I lift up mine eyes Lord I'm all of this right here it's just a distraction you are my strength lord I can't solve these problems I can't make this go away I can't get it I can't do this Lord I need you you're first you watch God knows that situation you could just say that tonight Lord restore to me the joy let let the warming rays of the sunlight just move into your life let him drive it back let's just pray tonight as believers Lord we've come here

Father as I stand here Lord God anointed with your spirit under the shed blood Lord we bind every evil spirit Lord God and Satan will chair you in name of Jesus Christ take your hands off every spirit
