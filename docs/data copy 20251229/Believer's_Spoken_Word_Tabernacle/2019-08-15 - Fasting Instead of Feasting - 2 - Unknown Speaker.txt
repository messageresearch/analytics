your word oh Lord God and heal your people tonight we pray Lord granted Lord in the name of Jesus Christ a man a man you love him tonight Amen god bless you we want to go right to the word I want to go right back to First Samuel chapter 14 and just want to say is this good to be back home I don't know how you were last week but my week was just kind of off a man with Tuesday night service but you know sometimes I I told my wife later on that night I said sometimes I said I think it's good for us to get thrown off sometimes we can get so locked into routine and that's what we become but it's so good sometimes to wear how God will just come by our way you know provided that we could be able to come together and just want to say it certainly appreciated your prayers for the services just had just just a real operand of the Holy Ghost and just in in the services and just to witness what God amen was doing there among the young people in the services that we had there brother Mike walls the young people I think there was about a hundred 40 young people they were there now brother Mike Walsh has a lot of young people so we there was just a few visitors that were there and then on Sunday morning there with the church there in Washington DC or right outside of it at whether Mike walls we just ministered there as well just seeing God just come on the scene amen and just ministering to lives and hearts and God just bringing change to life so I want you to know that even though all the details I can't go through that but just to know that your prayers amen God heard your prayers amen and so we just think God for that you may not ever know on this side but when you get to the other side my he's not he won't forget you're working labor of love amen for everything that we have done for the Lord is surely not in vain amen so let's read here in the word in first samuel 14 verse 24 and we're just going to look at these scriptures and then we'll let you be seated in verse 24 and the men of israel were distressed that day and for saul had adjourned the people saying cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening that I may be avenged on mine enemies so none of the people tasted any food and all they of the land came to a wood and there was honey upon the ground and when the people were come into the wood behold the honey dropped but no man put his hand to his mouth for the people feared the old but Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in a honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth and his eyes were enlightened then answered one of the people and said thy father straitly charged the people with an old saying cursed be the man that eateth any food this day and the people were faint then said Jonathan my father hath troubled the land see I pray you how mine eyes have been enlightened because I tasted a little of this Honey verse 30 how much more it happily the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found for have there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines and they smote the Philistines that day from McMaster Agilent and the people were very faint and the people flew up on the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slew them on the ground and the people did eat them with the blood then they told Saul saying behold the people sinned against the Lord in that they eat with the blood and he said you have transgressed roll a great stone unto me this day may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated just want to draw your attention on down in the scripture where Saul has spoken that whoever has interrupted or whatever has interrupted the plan of God or is standing before them in going up before the Philistines that their life shall be taken we find in the scripture that the law in in later in verses here that the lot fell into Jonathan but Jonathan was not preventing them from going up against the Philistines to further at Venge saul of the philistines but on the contrary the people when they went in verse 45 the bible says that when the people when saul had spoke that surely jonathan should die the people says they said thus all shall Jonathan die who have brought this great salvation in Israel god forbid as the Lord liveth there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground for he hath wrought with God this day so the people rescued Jonathan that he died not then Saul went up from following the Philistines and the Philistines went to their own place when we were looking at this and I want to just continue that thought on fasting instead of feasting this is a lot of it to where I just am just looking at this and there really the burden of my heart is more to teach this and to lay in the those things which we would know should know and if we don't know that God it would it would just be ministered to our hearts and even those things that we do know that our pure mind would be stirred up by way of remembrance because sometimes the simplest of things we can allow to become common to us and we can allow things to slip slip so easily but we need the help of the Lord and seeing the value of those things that God has desired for our life we find that Saul he has called a famine here in the mourn of Hammond but a fasting when the people of Israel should have been feasting on the things of God this was the Bible declares this was a time that the honey was dropping the honeycomb was there it all have been a time that the people were eating that which was in season and in that time but instead saw he called for a fast or withholding from eating and we see the results of this we see to where that the people themselves when it came time to move in after Jonathan and his armor-bearer had overthrown that garrison there with with that with the direction of the Holy Spirit the Lord that when they pursued after the Philistines they could only go to a certain distance because they didn't have the strength to pursue the Philistines all the way what Saul is asking here let's go up and can let's go after the Philistines let's pursue them more that wouldn't have not even been a question had the people been feeding and feasting instead of fasting if they had been feast there would have been no letting up on the pursuit after the Philistines and I believe it speaks very clearly in our life that there are many things that we can experience victory in our life but it's not enough just to see victory as it would come as it were here but victory is something that is to be a continual pursuit when the enemy is put in flight let's be up and going not just to let him go and then to gain ground again but we want to pursue to remove him from the holds that he would have so many times when victory is had within within Church or within a life and victory comes many times we can get to where we're resting in that victory instead of remembering that victory itself was a gaining of ground and we're going to have to fight to keep that ground you don't just get ground and then when relaxers they've got to be a fighting of ground and then we see the the people here they were in a state they were distressed they were faint there are conditions that were about their life they were weak and then when they moved in upon the spoil they were eating the spoil but they were eating it in the wrong way they weren't eating it in the right way and all of this is a result of where here saw calls for a a fasting in them time of war and I'll tell you God has clearly declared within his word that there was coming a time of war such as the world and never seen we're living in that hour Daniel 12 is a type of that warfare that's going on right now among and the attack upon the bride of Jesus Christ Psalms 27 speaks about even of how that we are a compass round about and how the enemy is is coming at us and in the Book of Revelations chapter 9 it speaks of the release of every demon spirit has been released here upon this earth that which was bound now is released and to think of this that what we're in in this time it is a battle that we are that we are engaged in but God does not allow the battle to come without making proper preparations for you and I to be able to enter into this battle and be ready for it God has made a way even as he would direct the prophet in this hour that he would would express that there was a need to lay up food or brother branham would use the word supplies in the storehouse now you need supplies in order to make food is that right you're gonna need with you no matter what dish it is you make you're gonna need supplies and me just say it to you like this the message that God has sent to us without the Holy Ghost it would be nothing but supplies but the Holy Ghost takes supplies and makes food out of the supplies it is that which then strengthens and is a nourishment and you and I are able to feed and be nourished on the things of God saw being a type we know how that the Prophet you know under the direction of the Holy Spirit would lay this down how Paul being or Saul rather being a type of like that of a denominational man or an organizational lead one who is not really under the leadership of the Holy Spirit and to see how Saul is holding them back from what they really need I'll tell you right now that's something I never want to be guilty of I won't have been one the other thing what I want to be is what God Himself as desired and what you and I have need of in this hour he knows every time that we're coming together he knows the very intense and desires of the heart he knows and he has supplied his word for this hour and the season I tell you like this it never ceases to amaze me it never becomes common to me to watch how that God will come on the scene and he will take you word and minister right to a question that's on somebody's heart you know I was even just kind of looking at it there even on Sunday morning when I was ministering on a little just to top that God had just dropped on my heart and said just go preach this thought and I looked at off of my you know how we gonna go with this you know but if the God moving down and how the Holy Spirit begin to take the word and here to find out then I'm receiving texts that are coming in from other people within that time that says you don't know it but you know my child was there in that service there on Sunday morning and word for word what they had spoke to another one of their friends word for word came out in that service they got their answer for what they had need of now who in the world could do that but God it takes God to come on the scene and to do that and you see God he operates by his word you know the Bible says is this day there would come a famine for the hearing of the word of God now in reality there's no shortage of Bibles there's no shortage of Bibles matter of fact if I if if I understand it correctly it's still one of the top sellers around the world or even in the nation so there's no lack for that of that of the Bibles but remember brother Branham would tell us he said that the Bible itself is not all together the gospel he said the gospel itself is the word that is preached in power and demonstration you see when we look at it we we just don't either famine that is going on it's not because people don't have access to the scriptures it is not because there's not individuals or people or ministers that are preaching or because that people are not reading but a famine that it's taking place remember the famine is linked to the hearing there will be a famine in the land for the hearing of the word of God and let me just say like this the Word of God is not a doctrine it's not a theory it's not an idea the Word of God is the person of Jesus Christ the whole ego is the lifeline of the church you cannot separate the word and the Holy Ghost it is the same self person Amen so that's why we need the Ministry of the word delivered by the unction of the Holy Ghost and this is exactly what Paul you know was mentioning even when Paul would write and he would admonish even those of Timothy and different ones to nourish up myself in the word and how do you know that that Timothy was to give himself and I I don't want to deal with that tonight but I want to just say it like this when we're looking at the some of the simple simple parts about our life I think of how David said it like this when David in Psalms 100 he said make a joyful noise unto the Lord all ye lands serve the Lord with gladness come before his presence was singing know ye that the Lord he is God it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his pasture there's a whole lot to be said within there but I think how how David is clearly giving it to you and I that we recognize that it is not us but it is God and here is very important we are the Sheep of his pasture amen enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto Him and bless his name for the Lord is good his mercy is everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations now in the scripture here we find in in the book of Matthew chapter 16 where Jesus is speaking to the disciples within this time and he's asking them who do men say that I am and here you know they begin to answer but then Peter he speaks up and says thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and Jesus answering to him and said blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven now I want you to think of this here in the scripture here the Lord Jesus he introduces that indeed he is going to have a church and this church will he will call this church his home this church will be his church it will be a church that is made up of his substance just like it was when God took the bride right from the side of Adam and placed in that part and dividing masculine and feminine spirit and part of that our same original spirit was placed right there within that which we know to be woman or later called Eve and when it was brought before Adam he said this is bone in my bone flesh and my flesh and she eats was taken out of me she shall be called woman and he identifies who she is that she has come from him that is exactly how that God builds his church he builds his church with his own substance now I want you to think of this there's a lot when we take think of the word out of churches there's a lot of churches but there is one Church of the Living God there are many churches many out pulls but there's one true Church of the Living God as a matter of fact brother Branham would say like this he says there's one church where there's not one hypocrite and that is the Church of the Living God that we're not joined you can't join this church you are born into it by the Holy Ghost by one spirit we are baptized into one body so it is the very mystical body of Jesus Christ that body ascended to the throne but now the Holy Ghost it begins to assemble that body upon the earth the attributes those thoughts of Gambas sons and daughters of God then it would reflect God's life and his desire through that one true church brother Brent says there's only one real church and you don't join it you're born in it if you're born in it the Living God works his self through you and making himself known that's where God dwells in his church now I want you to listen this God goes to church every day he just lives in church he lives in you you're his church you are his church you are the tabernacle that God dwells in you are the Church of the Living God yourself and if the Living God lives in his living being then your action is of God if it isn't then God isn't in there he wouldn't make you act like that when he says in the word here his blueprint don't do it and you go do it that's wrong when you deny it then the life then that shows the life isn't even in you so here when we recognize that this as as what we just read here is speaking of the Church of the Living God the mystical body of Jesus Christ this this in itself as it is speaking is those who are born of his spirit and because that that make up the true Church of the Living God and to think of this of how you know brother branham puts it like that God goes to church every day amen so if God goes to church what do you go to church you go to church to be lifted up you go to church to worship David said I will enter his gates with Thanksgiving no ma I will enter his courts with praise as as David said another place I was glad when they said unto me let us go under the house of the Lord so to think of a privilege here of what was a type in the Old Testament of the house of God that was set up within three courts which is a type of our life of body spirit and soul where God would dwell in the innermost part of our being in that of our soul through him by the Holy Ghost dwelling on the inside of there by the new birth now God reflects his life through us there is a warship that goes forth every day from our lives now I want you to think of this here because you understand that you know even where Paul would tell Timothy and first Timothy 4 he would talk to Timothy about that there are doctrines of devils that are coming there's gonna be men that will be speaking lies in hypocrisy that means falsehoods there's gonna be doctrines of devils there's gonna be all kinds of seducing spirits but he's letting Timothy know that this is an onslaught that's coming on then from that there's going to be those you know forbidding to marry and all of these things commanding to eat meats things that would try to come to even upset the minds of the people but Paul tells Timothy that you need to give yourself to the Word of God and put the Brethren in remembrance of these things and thou shalt be a good minister nourished out in the things of God because you see God's desire in our lives he knows he knows that there is a desire that lays within our heart to be right there's a desire we want to please him when God has touched your heart in life you have a desire to please him and there is something about it that we find that as our desire to please him then God's favor is further unfolded where God will let you and I No how did we might please him how did we might serve him and to think of this but within this time of how God would want us to be established and to be at rest and with this of the word of the Living God dwelling in you and I because when we look at this quote getting back to this point now when we look at this quote you know this is one of the things a person could say well if I miss Church you know I am the Church of the Living God high in the house of God then why do I need to go to church but you see this is where you will realize that the word it remains true and faithful the spirit of truth will not deviate from the word the spirit of truth the Holy Ghost the person of Christ the word will always say amen to the word amen he will always stand behind that word and lift up the banner of the word so when we look at it and we see the example here of the Lord Jesus himself here was the very word made flesh in the tabernacle the body the tent that the Lord pitched and here he was the Bible declares him going to church in Luke 4:14 Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee and there went out of Fame of him throughout all the region round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for the reading you say what are you saying Jesus goes to church that's what I'm saying when the word was made flesh of the tights that was laying in the scripture but you see here is the display where the Lord Jesus himself as his custom you know what a custom is a custom is something you can count on it when it's the Sabbath day there's no question where Jesus is going to be no with me now we're talking about fans not fasting we don't want to fast when we ought to be feasting very simple principles of the word but it's things that the enemy wants to try to attack and erode a standard that is not a standard that the Prophet established this is a standard that God established and a true prophet will take that standard that's been trampled over and said this is steel dust saith the Lord that's what a true prophet of God does he's surrendered to the Holy Ghost and is able to hold that standard up now remember brother Branham went to collect a bill one day he was the line man that would collect a bill and he went you know collecting the utility bills and he goes and here he comes into a place and here's a woman you know she he comes to the door knocks and you know here she is going about listening to this music that's on the radio and you know here comes the announcer and he says something you know I be down there at this dance it set in such sets on Saturday night brother Graham said when she he said she was just going across that room he said she danced over there she picked up that bill she danced over there and she got her money and she danced around brother man says she looked back when that man made the decision or made the announcement on the radio she blew him a kiss I'll see you there on Saturday night honey and she came back and gave the bill you know why she didn't care that brother Randall was standing there she did not care she was so wrapped up in that music her heart was so in tune and so in love with that brother branham was saying like this he said I believe he said she pawned what clothes she had on to get there because brother man says you know he said she got the radio throat a kiss in the radio she said goodbye dearie I'll see you at the old briar patch everyone it was that night do you think mr. Michael Mitchell will ever have to make her sign a card to come over there talking about signing the card to come to church she'd pawn what clothes she had on to get there right for in her heart she couldn't live without it and I said you get that bunch of lukewarm church members down to the altar and let them pray through till the Holy Ghost since their soul afire they'll be no signing cards God's in their heart God goes to church he loves to us and I'm not going to update this quote and say God loves to stream I refuse to update that quote God loves to go to church god no live streaming you say now everybody's here tonight but if they're streaming they'll get it after all I've got to preach to those who come even on midweek come on somebody because many times what's happening the coldness and the lukewarmness among people midweek service is optional I'm gonna preach from the hell you can say out show me keep reaching it it is not option we are not a bunch of Roman Catholics that just gotta show up to some service and say when can I go to service this week brother we're coming here to worship we're coming here here from Almighty God and a fat woman would upon what she had on to get there you know I you know I should do that cuz it was in her heart you say it's in my heart then let your heart put your feet in action if what's in your heart don't come out in your life it ain't in your heart amen you tell me you got faith and I can't see your works I doubt you got faith now there is let me tell you something there's some genuine people that can't be here tonight all brother Sam you're putting lots on people they know who they are it's just like people through every surface know who they are full glory you see friends excuses are not going to add up people want God to do God things but they don't want to give themselves fully to God but you see we want to let this be a custom in our life now I don't want it to be just a tradition you understand what I'm saying I wanted to be a custom to wear that somebody knows hey it's Thursday I wonder what brother Sam you'll be at you think brother send me at the Mexican restaurant I know he likes Mexican food he like there ain't no question in your mind you say that's because you were pastor before I was a pastor or a minister of the gospel it was no question where I was going to be there's no question about it you say what do you saying I'm telling you that when you're able to be in the house of God you need to be in the house of God David said it like this in Psalms 116 and let me just he says in verse 12 what shall i render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me how we'll take the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the Lord I will pay my thousand to the Lord now in the presence of all his people precious in the of the Lord is the death of his Saints Oh Lord truly I am thy servant I am thy servant and the son of thine handmaid thou has loosed my bonds how often to thee the sacrifice of Thanksgiving and will call upon the name of the Lord I will pay my vows under the Lord now in the presence of all his people in the courts of the Lord's house in the midst of the O Jerusalem praise ye the Lord amen once again I'm not against streaming but my fear is that streaming has taken over people's desire to come to the house of God where it becomes optional on whether I can come tonight amen that's for everybody here and for all the streamers glory be to God my mouth just stay with me now tonight amen you see we're looking at the word to find things that the enemy would try to withhold or try to take away from us if there's a real need or a situation arises not something that's because of slothfulness not something because of well pray for my my doggie my dog he's got a to faith that you know of this and that and this and the other brother I'm telling you when the church doors are open we need to be in the house of God David said I will pay my vows you know what David's talking about he's talking about when I was in trouble when affliction and trials rose again means from psalm 66 when all these things came against me he says now he said I will be sure to go to the house of God and to pay the vows that I have made when I was in the midst of the test when I was in the midst of the trial where I my worship I said Lord just to deliver me lord give me strength to get through this test give me strength to get through this trial then I'll come to the house of God and say thank you Lord for strength thank you Lord you know it ain't easy when you're going through a test or trial even to come there's a lot of things that can set against you no doubt there's some setting here tonight that you've got all sorts of opposition that's against you you might have got things in the mail today or news that was delivered your way that would be news that you could have set it home you could have went in a corner you could have shut yourself away and the devil would have kept on pounding and beaten on you more but there's something about it I know as I look across this room right here that there's people in the midst of battle in the midst of war but you said I'm gonna go to the house of God I'm gonna offer a praise and sacrifice of face giving because he is worthy I'm gonna get my rod in the honeycomb I'm gonna put my rod in the honey and I'm gonna let my eyes be enlightened now look at this in 1st Thessalonians 2:13 for this calls also think we God without ceasing because when you receive the Word of God which you heard of us you received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the Word of God which effectually workers also in you that Billy there's a big difference how we received the word verse 14 for ye brethren became followers of the Churches of God which is in Judea are in Christ Jesus well I'm not going to follow no church you're gonna follow something I'm not gonna follow the church I'm following Jesus oh you sound like those little boys that Paul ran into that said how much Cephas I am of Paul I am Apollo's and some of them said I'm of Christ you know those that said I'm of Christ were the most dangerous ones out of all of them we are you're gonna be following something but notice you became followers of the Churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus those identified by his presence come on somebody walking in the light of the hour amen the power of God present lives being delivered the Holy Ghost coming in among them and revealing his word and victory in the hearts and lives of the people yes sir notice you know look around what you know a familiar quote to us brother Branham wouldn't would admonish us everybody ought to have a home church [Music] you ought to have a place he said that you just don't float from pillar to post and that right amen and I'm saying like this with people whose been in cycles they need to let the cycle breaker come and break cycles in their lives we're living in an hour friends where it's not just floating here and there and going from here and there God ain't confused you understand what I'm saying God ain't confused daddy changing his mind a man you've got to know where you belong [Applause] come on now oh my I'm not gonna preach on that but this is a real present reality and Radames talking about getting into that vision of that local assembly that God has there he picks this up in blind bartimaeus here let me just move on in the fall he said every person that saved ought to have a church home they ought to be in church and there every time that church has a service let me just pick up streaming once again I have had the stream sometimes guess what I don't like it I've had to go back and listen to him archive service guess what I don't like it it's not the same as being here hey man thank God for the privilege but it ought not being UPS and whether you're gonna sit in this pew or set in la-z-boy come on somebody and of course you sent your lazy boy you have your drink besides you gave me come on now amen where is the ruggedness with among the believers they men where those who stand out that in the midst of times when it's not bowing their way when everything is not up and up hey man where is the people who stand there and say well I'll tell you what you know what I don't know I don't have much gas but what gasps I've got in the car I'm going to the house of God come on friends the devil is such an actor and a schemer he'll have you driving everywhere all over the world you'll drop from here to there just for some item of fashion or whatever more I've gotta get this I've gotta get that you need to have that kind of a determination in your heart to be in the presence of God to be in the house of God there's honey in there are [Applause] and be there every time the church has service every time you pass it go in open the doors go in and pray or do something love the Lord another Bible says you know if you have no church of choice we welcome you here to Branham tabernac we're brother Norman Neville a godly man he pushes play nope and then say that that teaches nothing but the truth out of the Bible amen you're welcome to our fellowship we're just not a denomination we're just a church here of fellowship he says we are Christians who love you and we pray if you can't come here get a good church home somewhere where they really preach the gospel so that you can be fed by the Spirit of God amen even balm in Gilead brother em says now he said you know I wish this above all things that you here tonight that who believes in your heart that you love the Lord and something has happened to you promise me that you'll find a good gospel church somewhere a church that teaches the full gospel the power of God his resurrection join up with those people and make yourself a church home don't just stray around loose on the streets go get a good church somewhere of your choice where the gospel and the power of God is made known and the signs of eternal life is in there the signs that was in Christ hey man there's no there's no reason for fasting you know sometimes that defeating and the eating itself is also what we do what we do you know I said this about a year ago and I had my boys out with me and we just had a time that we have together and I told him I said there's things coming up in your life decisions I didn't know well I didn't know what this year held for him that they're getting ready to embark into but I told them I said what your desire is is to be in the house of God so I said there's some things you need I have to take pretty seriously and not be slack concerning it you're going to have to make sure ask God to reveal to you what he has for your life I said there might be some times where something comes up and you may not you know be able to be in the house of God oh my that that like to kill them but I said you know there might be some of that I said but I'll tell you I said God put me in jobs that has a witness those jobs you should not have had off times to go to church I worked in retail you don't have Sundays off for retail but in order for me to be here on Sundays y'all listening to me now in order for me to be here on Sundays I had to work some undesirable times a man I've got a mother-in-law and father-in-law I'm not here to give roses out to people tonight but we might as well give them a man they have worked they have labored within even in working third shift and taken their days off of work the days they have elected to take off work our days of church time they could have a longer weekend if they just work Thursday night they'd be off Friday Saturday and then they could go back on Sunday and they'd have a longer weekend but they want to be in the house of God now I know they're not the only one there's many that make sacrifices here but I let my boys know I said you know you've got it you're gonna mentor make decisions and ask God to guide you because the desire in your heart is to be in the house of God say God I don't want to get into something that would withhold me from being there every time the doors are open sometimes it's gonna be hard it's not gonna be easy it's been listen this whole flesh come on now this guy right here he never is gonna tell you that's right get up get ready get ready for church I can't wait to go this guy will never say that this guy will give you every excuse in the world your throat's a little Scratchy tonight you know you certainly wouldn't want to give that to nobody else you know sister so-and-so and brother sewing sewing this and that come on somebody you see listen if the devil works that hard to keep us out of church what's he afraid of what takes place here that he would be afraid of whether he knows that Devils are cast out he knows that hearts are discerning he knows that lives are changed he knows that faith rises he knows deliverance comes he knows the word comes and strengthens hearts that's what the devil knows and that's why he fights it Amen he'll get every excuse in the world huh look what look what Paul said here and Hebrews 10:23 let us hold fast our profession of faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works look what look what look what this considering of one another is how many of you think it's a wonderful thing to be thoughtful you know when you've come to the house of God you're being thoughtful you're considering one another is that right if you've got the Holy Ghost you got a liquefier Amen you get a liquefies join with another liquify join with another liquify brother it creates a bank I'll take em so to even look at this I know it's heading right looking right across you all tonight to me it is a ministry back to me if brother Branham could stand there and say in the message he said mama what it is to see people who would want to stay for service and to come and to be in the service of the Lord because knowing we're all going through tests and trials it would have been easier for for some not to come here some to do this or that I think of brother Dave jr. even he leaves right out of here right after Thursday night service I'm able to get back and drop off this is daddy and mommy and then he then then brother brother Davis sister Shirley and then has to go right to work y'all with me now you observe brothers I mean you're putting people on the pedestals I'm just letting you know the kind of sacrifice that goes in here there's sometimes the sacrifice isn't where you've got to punch something in it's just something that you just have to say this will be here at the house when I get back if Donn didn't get the spaghetti noodles off the plate for you came to church soak it when you get home scrub it in if it don't come out then put some oxy in there with it and let it come off come on somebody you see sometimes the enemy just gives little things here and there and sometimes we've allowed him to gain ground when we ought to be here eaten honey provoke one another unto love and good works seen when different ones coming and sitting in the house of God and coming here even when they don't feel good such a sure the Kressel probably wearing me out after this but that's okay it's worth it she stood right here a couple weeks ago and I pray for her right here of the condition that she was dealing with within her body she didn't have even the strength to be able to stand she was weak within her body and in their head and and in her back her back was hurting her but you know what she said she said I wasn't gonna stay home I wanted to be in the house of God I'm telling you I don't know sister Shirley's maiden name but that ain't crest stalk brother that is DNA and stop from the Tree of Life of which I'm looking across this room that others that are DNA and stalk of the Tree of Life but there is something that is able to rise up with innocence say if I'm gonna be down anywhere let me be down in the house of God because I know when I'm in the house of God he will come and he will if Mia he will minister to my needs you say what are you doing you are going and taking up honey and you're pulling that honey in your mouth Oh Oh Lord that's just what I needed tonight Lord you know what I needed and you're pulling that and your eyes are being enlightened not forsaken the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is see this is not something that's new this was even it started in look this even started in as her only church kept going you read the first accounts of the early church the Bible tells us in the end of Luke also in Acts chapter two that they continued steadfastly daily in the temple breaking bread from house to house so eventually over time it was a roading away to where people begin not to see the value of coming to the house of God let me tell you something you know how your family sees the value that you place on come into the house of God be in the house of God when church is going on oh brother Samuel I'm gonna be a lot how can you be a lot when you're out there with them on Sunday instead of being in here in the house of God gonna get tacked tonight better let's get it out of get tired I'd rather be roasted tonight than in those flames later on come on friends brother man told us he said how do you win loved ones by you being loyal to what you believe let me tell you what was around our house we had family coming in though just where we hadn't seen them we didn't see him for both once a year you know things weren't easy to get money to travel up and bring gas to come from West Virginia up to Ohio a matter of fact they would buy a big old roll of baloney get it out on the car and just slice out to make sandwiches so they could eat it on the way up here but you know what mom and daddy did we had to drive clear to a church 45 minutes away in fact the thing was a little longer neck goes in country roads but you're not they did they left the key under the mat and they said when y'all get in we're going to be in church tonight but we'll see you after church hello everybody on the internet hello coming through a computer monitor near you glory not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is my mouth that is some place that I don't want to be identified in the scripture I do not want to be known as one who forsakes to assemble himself together hallelujah but exhorting one another oh oh put a prairie question for me brother Samuel I got a better idea why don't you come and put the prayer request in yourself hello somebody whoa Gloria Mazda getting tied in here tonight Oh it'll get loose for sinners a moment but exhorting one another and so much more as you see the Day approaching think of this brother branham you know talking about how a person inside of Christ walking the position of a believer in Christ he says and your heart and mind becomes single on Christ Jesus that shows you have died to yourself and born again then just as surest church time comes around you just can't keep from coming to church you're just going to go if you have to hobble oh oh ha oh brother Samuel these pews oh these pews hurt so bad then why don't you tell the local steakhouse to get you a comfortable chair because they don't have comfortable chairs either come on somebody if you need a pinup bring a pillow hello somebody hey men Oh will this and end this and this and then can't you just see it's the enemy trying to get you're all bogged down with a lot of things to distract you from what the real thing yes I don't see anybody saying oh I'm gonna be able to eating breadsticks and salad and zip it this Cana all these chairs these chairs they just don't fit my legs right nobody complains about the seating you see what it is because it's the food they're there for when you come from the reason this isn't a furniture gallery we're not here to try to make your body comfortable we're here to get this body change get the soul safe and get out of here you know brother man told us he said about he said these churches nowadays he said you know he had there been all these gyms being built and everything like that brother BAM said you know it used to be people when they went to the house of God they didn't have to exercise because they got enough exercise inside a church whoo but I'm saying they got exercise to put p90x and all the other things to shame they got exercise they let go and letting God have his way you're just gonna go if you have to hobble that's all you're going to church because the spirit itself bears record of gathering together in Christ Jesus I'd better let you hold job better just let off because y'all won't be back here on Sunday then I'll have to wait and start back in on you the next year that means I ain't coming back you're just showing your colors you're just showing your colors come on somebody bill the banner would say like this you're talking about this commitment and promise every Easter and I'll be there in Christmas and I'll do this and do that and brother Branham says now here's what he made this statement in I will restore because Bestor the reason for that is because they're just church members and not born again that's the reason a man that's born of the Spirit of God that's the key loves to go to church better than he loves to eat his dinner when he's hungry now from the looks of us and I know pretty much of you all really good and y'all like he come on now but a man who's born of the Spirit of God loves to go to church better than he loves to eat his dinner when he's hungry the spiritual man on the inside has got to be fed if that man isn't fed he will die the outward man isn't fed he'll die the inward man he's got to be fed and he said Jesus told Satan in the debate it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God that's how man lives not by his bread alone but by the Word of God man lives his outward man lives by bread his inward man lives by the bread of God amen you know how they tell you just stop eating when you're fool when you're fool just stop but you know if you can just even before you reach that place he's little by little you eat a little bit then you eat a little bit of course you got to psych yourself out and tell you got for other stuff eventually what happens your stomach shrinks this is that big old plate used to be able to eat now you can't eat it no more you start having doggy bags and 2 gold boxes and everything else but if you put it on the opposite side you eat everything there and then you just keep on eating more by the time you get home you're like wow the Chips Ahoy look good then from the Chips Ahoy you think can't leave this also don't want them to get offended got to eat some chips and salsa I'm gonna do this got to eat some bread with jelly because I wouldn't want mom and they get offended after making that preserves then after a while eating and eating and eating like that you all know this it it don't take rocket science your stomach stretches you're able to handle more food oh anything that don't eat very much its stomach shrinks but the more that you eat the more it expands the Bible promised us in Malachi 4 that we were to be fat as calves in the store because there's one sure thing coming wins and everything else and tests and trials are going to come our way but there were two farmers and when they both had calves but one of those farmers you know he just let that cat feed any little thing and this and that but here was another one many kept throwing in that I've alpha he kept throwing in that straw he kept putting in that grain he was so focused on what was taking place and what was being fed when they turned those calves out in the spring after they had grown here come the winds that was blowing through those barn yards and that one then Italy literally been starved to death it was getting blown everywhere but the other one that had been cared for it had become one with what it was eating it begins to strengthen it and when the winds came you just kicked its heels up hey man why because it had become one and it gained it had grown from the word that was being fed on and that's the same way that God's desire for you and I in coming to the house of God he provides for you and I what we have need of we're not just coming here just together together like a social event this is not a lodge this is a place where God it's reserved that God comes down and meets with his people place where God comes and feeds his children that's how he leads you and I we don't want to forsake to assemble ourselves together let's just stop there tonight all sorts of things will come reasons pressures things can come but remember them to be something like this if I just leave you with a word tonight let coming to the house of God be a non-negotiable it's not negotiable whether we're going to the house of God tonight is that right you see and I'll say it like this for those of us who are parents and have children the emphasis that you place is what the children will take up and do so we don't just want to tell them sure let the importance and the value be placed on coming together and hearing from God don't you let the devil tell you that well if you're not there you won't be missed let me tell you something if you cannot be here and you and you're not here and you're not missed something's wrong with you out to me Jesus help me something's wrong with you it ought to be in the house of God we're all of a sudden somebody says hey souls are one here why because you are such a vital part of what's going on in every service I don't play nothing that's not what I'm talking about I think on Sunday you see how him how precious it is to have musicians it's a wonderful thing sometimes we we we can take it for granted but tonight let me just let's just let me just stop here let's not let that standard go down let's let that standard be raised if you've dropped it here and look there's there's all sorts of things it'll come it'll test that but this is what I want you to see see the value of it you know the value of it and you can also see the way Satan fight you and fights it Satan knows the value and that's why he would want to do everything he can to try to block you from that sister there's there's end if there's people I know I know you would too there's people that would give their teeth to be in these services that are not able to be here there's some that are homebound they're homebound they can't be here they they used to sit right here right among us faithfully and they can't be here anymore because their home back I see I want to let it be known whose side I'm on Jesus said this is where the scripture forsake not to assemble yourselves together that Scripture is directly collected where Jesus said he that will confess me before men I will confess him before my father you stand for me he said I stand for you amen oh my let us draw let us draw straight from the Lord amen amen God is safe a litany I'm not going to ask you if you love me I ask you that on Sunday but you know what when it gets in the heat in the battle amen we are we when it all comes down to it you know that God's desire my heart's desire is for us as an assembly if you feel something slipping a little bit say God help me a little order just reach down brother brems says me when you sense that but the Rebbe says you reach a hold and you get a hold of the buckle the belt that tightens all the armor together he said you reach and you get a hold of that buckle and tighten up the armor that brings it all together and the Hebrew series brother brems says when you feel things getting a little slack in your armor he said reach down and get a hold of that and say Lord give me a refilling of the Holy Ghost amen God is mindful of father you're Jesus Lord you know our needs Lord this thought Lord you just Lord this placing Lord in the heart drawing this from this battle of Lord where Jonathan his armor bearer Lord they want a great victory but how much greater it could have been they won that victory because they were they were eating they were feeding hard Oh God Lord we would come here to feed on the Word of God Lord it's staying in tune and in step with you you minister to our needs you minister to our lives and Lord not just here in this building but Lord as it were it's like where our lives gets anything gets out of line it gets lined back up so that nor does we're hearing you here we can hear you through the week we can hear you Lord is worth reading in your word we hear you lord is in prayer we hear you O God as we're listening Lord this message the God that you have sent to us our message for our day Oh God may we take the responsibility of it Lord god I pray that Lord that let it be Lord to the hearts I know God and there's some here law or not they are really not able to be here tonight there's a sickness job lord I pray that I know that the Holy Spirit you never miss your mark and I pray that God if there's one that can see that the love of God is for their soul then they would be born again of the Spirit of God that they would see the reality not just about coming Lord to a church building but they would see the value father I pray tonight that you would feel that soul that the Holy Ghost I pray God that that love of God that they know they need and it's lacking in their life I pray that God you fill them whether they're sitting here or whether they're at home or whether they will archive or they're streaming this service I pray God let it not be a non-negotiable let it not be an option Oh God we don't want to be weak we want to be strong in you rugged Lord Oh God not a show but Lord ah this is our life it'd be easy God for every one of us it'd be easy Lord just to just to sit down just to not do anything god there's a fire that burns in our hearts Lord there's a land beyond the river Lord we're aiming the desire in our heart we're looking for you Lord we're living daily for your coming I pray Heavenly Father I ask God that for the hearts I know there's some that Lord this has been a prayer request on Tuesday and I know others the Lord that would have this request as well that God that you'd provide for them that they could be here work out the schedules Lord that they could be here Oh God bringing her lick of fire gathering together Lord was saints of God or like precious thing where David could say and so say I I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord granite lord I pray O God may Lord every every little scarecrow and every little excuse Lord may the enemy be so exposed God Lord tonight father Lord for how Lord God that he has sought to try to hinder because he is fearful [Music] Satan is afraid will God he's afraid of what the working of the word does in the lives of the people he knows it can expose his scheme he knows things that he has tried to bring and ensnarement but he knows that the eyes of the Lord I'm walking to and fro throughout the earth he knows he will Express the scheme will be exposed oh god strengthen Lord your children your Lord continue to expose schemes of the enemy Lord his lies Lord to try to hinder Oh God I prayed tonight that you would cry and Lord for the hearts of each and everyone Lord their desire to be in the house of God as David said this one thing have I desired and that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord forever oh dear God granite tonight Lord have your way forgive us Lord when we should have been here and we weren't forgive us lord I pray O God may you Lord through your word as we take it into our lives that it be a discerner giving us discernment that everything that is center done let it all be done in the name of Jesus Christ if we can't do this in the name of Jesus Christ we're not doing it
