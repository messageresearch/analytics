And we could certainly never never give him enough praise, amen, for what he's done for us. But I'm thankful that our praise is not confined to what would just come out of our lips &gt;&gt; or even how our hands would be raised. But what a blessing it is that from our soul. &gt;&gt; That's real. That's real worship right there. &gt;&gt; Where we can live as sons and daughters of God with a real true liberty in our lives. That's real worship. &gt;&gt; Each and every day of our lives is living. Amen. Living for him. And you know, it's not a chore. It's a privilege. &gt;&gt; When God has touched your heart and so changed your life, it's the greatest privilege and greatest honor that we could ever have to be able to serve him. You know, I think of it here this morning. You know, you think about coming to the house of God and it's not something we have to do. We have the privilege. &gt;&gt; What a privilege it is to be able to come here this morning. Privilege to be able to gather in his presence. Amen. To just see what the Lord would say and speak to our hearts here this morning. Amen. He's done so much for us. How could we thank him? &gt;&gt; I mean, he did. He He did for me what no one else could do. &gt;&gt; A church couldn't do it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But God, rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Changed &gt;&gt; changed my life. &gt;&gt; Changed my nature. &gt;&gt; It wasn't what I stopped doing. It's the Holy Spirit came. God working with our life little by little by little. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. cleaning our lives up, the blood being applied, and then the spirit of God coming and moving right in there. What a what a privilege, friends. What a reality. What a what a certainty it brings in our hearts. We certainly are just so grateful to be here uh this morning and so thankful to have brother Ivonne and Sister Linda here with us. And uh Amen. Well, it's just always like family. Amen. So, we we sure love you all so much. And and uh it's just good to be gathered together. Amen. And his presence and um so we want to if we could let's just go to him in a word of prayer. I think I'm so thankful for the musicians and brother Brian, thank you for this the songs of Zion. Amen. And your worship, the atmosphere that's been created. Amen. And let's just go before him in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, as we are standing in absolute need of your mercies here this morning. What can we do without you, Lord? We can do nothing. Father, we are totally totally helpless without you, Father. That's right. &gt;&gt; But Lord Jesus, how we're we're trusting you, Lord, here this morning one more time that Lord, that you would come, Lord, for there's no speaker that we want to hear but the spirit of truth. Lord, we want to hear from you this morning, Lord. We desire, oh God, that you would come and speak to our lives, Lord, in such a special way. Lord, help us and give us grace, Lord, not only myself, but this congregation, Lord, to be able to step aside for a few moments and to enter in, oh God, into places, Lord God, in heavenly places. And may, Lord, you come and make known, Lord, our where we are, Lord, even in our lives. And Lord, the things that Lord in our lives that oh God that might be hindrances, Lord, but Father, you're here to minister to our lives, Lord, for there's a desire within our lives that you've placed there. We want to be a free channel, Lord God. A channel that's available, Lord God, to you that you're able to just move through and flow through and manifest your life through, Lord. So I pray Lord here this morning. Oh God, may you just move and flow through our lives this morning. Lord, speak to our hearts, Lord. Oh God, if you don't speak to us, Lord, oh God, how could we know where we're standing, Lord God? But Father, our desire as we've come as sons and daughters of God, Lord Jesus, is that our lives would be examined, Lord, by you and in your presence. We ask that you would come in a special way here this morning. Help us, Lord God. Minister to those that are sick among us, Lord. Those that are not able to be here, Father, this morning, Lord. I pray that God, may you minister to their lives, Lord. Oh, God. May you come this morning. May, Lord, the great, Lord, conviction of the Holy Spirit strike, Lord, into hearts and lives, Lord. And may we see only Jesus. May we see you high and lifted up, Lord God, above every need, above every situation, above every, Lord God, every bit of unbelief. May we see Jesus, Lord. I pray, God, may you come to be exalted, Lord. If there's one life that you've not, Lord, taken that place in, Lord. May you be exalted this morning. May the spirit of God move, Lord. The blood be applied and the spirit of God follow. Lord, we pray. Lord God, we give ourselves to you now, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's go to um Ephesians chapter 3. And I want to read just um a few verses of scripture here from Ephesians 3 and verse verse eight. If we could begin there. And unto me am less than the least of all saints is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the uncarchable riches of Christ. and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the eternal purpose purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith &gt;&gt; of him. Amen. May God bless you as you're being seated. And Amen. If we I want to continue to look at that. And I told Brother Brian, I've I actually have all my slides and stuff that's created, but I really just even as I stood here just kind of feeling pulled in a couple directions. So, when we're looking at it um here this morning as you just I think my mom they put the request in for her and um I got a call from her this morning her basement and with water and I didn't know what I was walking into and um but it was the water heater and some of y'all know what that's like and um so um God gave us grace and we were able to get that cleaned up and and uh able to get our tie on and get here. It's kind of hard to say I'm not coming cuz I cleaned up a basement. I'm the pastor. &gt;&gt; But uh uh but God was so merciful and I'm thankful to the Lord that he um just, you know, watched over everything and and and made a way. But I want to just um to speak on this and I ask you to just to pray for me. I know you do. And uh ask the Lord will just give me uh strength here in my body. I want to um just speak a little bit on this thought on the fellowship of of the mystery and recognizing that the mystery itself is dealing with actually our our part in the body of Jesus Christ where that this mystery is actually the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the life of of a believer. And so we understand there's a there's a great difference from being um just around where it's at, which that's very important. You've got to be around where it's at. Got to hear the actual the truth of the hour that God has given. But within where he's at, that must come to where now he moves on the inside. And so this is all through, we understand, right, through a process. And God will always deal with and work with this according to the word. So God's God's desire is is that we would have our place within the body of Jesus Christ. And we know that that was given to us before the foundation of the world. Our inheritance, our part um that the through and by the sacrificial offering of the Lord Jesus Christ, he has become our way into that um our place of inheritance that we would have in the very economy of Almighty God. and to see I want to just go right into the scriptures here how that Paul would then uh or Peter would take up in second Peter and he would make known to us in second Peter chapter 1 regarding that we've not followed cunningly devised fables and then he would say in verse 19 we have a more sure word of prophecy where unto you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your heart. So as as Peter is is writing this that that taking heed to the light of God's word that has come to illuminate our pathway, you can think about this that when you've ever been in a dark place, it is through a light that is shining that allows you to see your way around. And when the light of God has come through and by his word, it not only shows you where you are, it shows you where you need to be and it shows you how to get there. So we we understand that we just don't want to have just a focus just upon the light, but what is the light leading us to do? And actually the light is leading us to a place to where that that light might tabernacle on the inside of us. So when we see this, it says it's good that we would take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your heart. So we don't want to ever take anything for granted. We stay with the word until we and the word have become one. Until the nature has been changed, your life has been changed. Not just your thinking, not just even wantto's have left, but where your very desire and nature has been changed by the Holy Spirit. And then that's where the day star has rose in your life. So notice he says this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. Now, we know we're living in a day, it's a day of confusion. &gt;&gt; If if there's ever been a day of confusion, this is the day we're talking about where it's a day where, like the Bible says in the book of Isaiah, where you have evil is called good and good is called evil. It's a day where absolutes are despised. It It is a day where such confusion where men don't know if they're men or women or whatever. And that's spirits that's upon the people. Now, I'm going to tell you how those spirits got in there. Those spirits got in there because of the teaching of that church. because her religion because remember what she is. She has become a cage of every uh unclean and hateful bird. &gt;&gt; And this is why that for the church of the living God, we believe that God loves the sinner, but he hates the sin. &gt;&gt; You come as you are, but the real reality is you're not going to be able to stay as you are. I if you try to hold on to that old life, the spirit of God will call that out. He will rebuke that and then eventually GOD'S GOING TO MOVE ON BECAUSE YOU ARE GIVEN ONLY so many opportunities and so many chances. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? BECAUSE THE RAPTURE IS NOT GOING TO BE A STRIPPING AWAY OF UNBELIEF. RIGHT NOW IS THE TIME for God's grace to come and deal with unbelief. Let me just tell you something. GOD HAS COME with the right measure and the right medicine with the right antidote to minister to the sin question in this hour. You see what I'm saying is is that in this hour NO MATTER WHAT IT IS that we have been through where we come through all the things from THE PAST THE HOLY SPIRIT IS WHAT equalizes and what takes care of the sin QUESTION IN A LIFE. YOU KNOW, THIS IS WHAT'S SO BEAUTIFUL, FRIENDS, IS HOW JESUS CHRIST HAS BEEN SO EXALTED THROUGH THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IN THIS TIME. NOT THROUGH the lens of a man, but the message of the HOUR IS THE EXALTING OF JESUS CHRIST. IT'S MOVING BACK THE VEILS THAT MAN HAS PUT UPON. IT IS MOVING BACK ALL OF THE EXCUSES AND IT'S SHOWING CHRIST TO BE THE MIGHTY conqueror right here in our midst. That's what I love about it. &gt;&gt; So now when we're looking in an hour, in a day of confusion where people hardly know what to do, you know, the Bible promised in Zechariah 14, this would be that day where it is a day of dismal. It's a a grayish day. And Lord knows we live here uh you know in in northeast Ohio. We know what gray days are. And so within that, it's where it's, you know, neither white nor black. It's where things are not exactly clear and cut and where's the standard but God promised in the end time in the evening time there shall be light &gt;&gt; AND THE PURPOSE OF THAT LIGHT is to bring a people into their position IN JESUS CHRIST THAT THEIR LIVES WOULD BECOME FILLED WITH HIS SPIRIT BECAUSE ALL THE WAY DOWN THROUGH THE SEVEN AGES GOD HAS BEEN CALLING OUT A PEOPLE for his name's sake. And there have been THOSE THAT UNDER THEIR MESSAGE THEY HAVE they have been united WITH CHRIST THE WORD THAT HAS come in their generation. God had seven stars. The Bible tells us in his right hand power and authority. They came with that word revelation. And that word revelation actually brings out the elect from the world and into a full union with Jesus Christ. So notice IT REDEMPTION IS TWO PARTS. It's out of and into. It's a wonderful, WONDERFUL thing uh for a life to experience salvation to where I I I'm rejoice in that, you know, many that have been led into salvation to accept the Lord Jesus as their savior. But there's MORE THAT GOD WANTS TO DO THAN JUST TO be your savior. He wants to be the Lord of your life. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? HE WANTS TO TABERNACLE INSIDE of your life. Because listen, a life can accept him as savior and the things that made them DO THE THAT WHICH THEY HAD repented of all their sins is still there in their life. It's like we've all been in a place where, you know, I I've thought even out here, I walk around my house, but even when I'll take a break and come out here in the landscaping and I'll weed this around out here. And you know what? I You want to make sure you're getting the root. &gt;&gt; I can snap off that weed that's out here. And if I don't get the root, I know I got to come back to that area because there's going to be new growth. WHY? THE ROOT IS STILL THERE. AND THAT'S WHAT THE HOLY SPIRIT HE COMES TO DEAL WITH. BUT HE CALLS US IN STAGES OF REDEMPTION. THIS IS WHY, LISTEN TO ME, FRIENDS, THIS IS WHY GOD DOES NOT GIVE THE HOLY GHOST IN AN UNCLEAN VESSEL. &gt;&gt; Come on now. THIS IS RIGHT BIBLE. NOW, GOD DOES NOT GIVE, THE PROPHET SAID IT JUST LIKE THIS. GOD DOES NOT GIVE THE HOLY GHOST TO A SINNER, BUT GOD FIRST BRINGS THE INDIVIDUAL OUT OF THE WORLD. I MEAN, IF A MAN IS DROWNING, YOU GOT TO GET HIM OUT OF THE WATER BEFORE YOU EVER GET THE WATER OUT OF HIM. &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT? TO GETTING HIM OUT OF THE WATER IS JUSTIFICATION. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? AND THEN WHEN YOU GET HIM OUT OF THE WATER, THEN THERE'S GOT TO COME SANCTIFICATION. THERE'S GOT TO COME A CLEANSING FROM EVERY ONE OF THOSE DESIRES. AND THE PROPHET CALLED IT LIKE THIS. HABITS ARE SPIRITS. &gt;&gt; WELL, BROTHER SAMUEL, I'VE ALWAYS HAD THIS ON MY LIFE. YOU'VE GOT A CHOICE. EITHER MAKE AN EXCUSE AND LIVE WITH IT OR ALLOW THE BLOOD TO BE APPLIED. BECAUSE WHEN THE BLOOD'S APPLIED, THE BLOOD WILL TAKE CARE AND SANCTIFY THAT THEN THE SPIRIT CAN MOVE BEHIND the blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? &gt;&gt; SO NOW THIS IS WHY IT'S SO IT'S SO KEY and so important, you know, and and many times like when I've worked with uh young people and other times and and others too sometimes when we're, you know, they're coming and they're asking for things and sometimes they'll say, you know, brother Samuel, I need a refilling of the Holy Ghost. Sometimes I need more time with that because I need to know where are you at. And when we're talking of this, ARE WE JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT WHERE YOU IN YOUR MIND IS JUST SOMETHING THAT you need upon your spirit? Because if that's all the DEEPER THAT IT'S GOING, I GOT TO TALK WITH YOU. SAY, "BROTHER SAMUEL, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO TALK WITH THEM?" BECAUSE I I DO NOT WANT THE DEVIL TO HAVE A PLAYGROUND IN PEOPLE'S MIND. THERE NEEDS TO BE A CLEAR TARGET THAT'S SET BEFORE THEM. &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL REVELS IN CONFUSION. THAT'S WHY IN THIS AGE, THIS IS WHY THE ENEMY WANTS TO BRING SUCH CONFUSION WHERE HE'S EVEN TOLD PEOPLE, WELL, YOU JUST BELIEVE THE MESSAGE, BUT BELIEVING IT IS FIRST. &gt;&gt; COME ON, FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; PAUL SAID AFTER YOU BELIEVE, YOU WERE SEALED WITH THE SPIRIT OF PROMISE. I BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART, YES, GOD CAN DO EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE. BUT I AM ALSO SAYING THAT WHATEVER WHEN WE LOOK IN OUR LIFE, THERE HAS GOT TO COME AN ABSOLUTE CHANGE IN OUR LIFE, WE FOLLOW THE DAY STAR, THE LIGHT until the day star arises in our hearts. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Because I want TO KNOW IS THE SPIRIT IS IT JUST SOMETHING THAT'S UPON the spirit? Because let me tell you something friends in this hour the Holy Spirit. THIS IS WHY when the mystery of of of uh false anointed ones and Hebrews 6, Matthew 24 ALL OF THAT COMING ABOUT in and then even in Revelations 3 AND KNOWETH IT NOT IS BECAUSE A PERSON listen to me NOW THE PROPHET SAID ELVIS PRESLEY HAD THE BAPTISM of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY HOW COULD THAT BE? HE HAD IT ON HIS SPIRIT. A PERSON CAN HAVE IT ON THEIR SPIRIT AND IT DON'T CHANGE THEIR NATURE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOT TO BE A DEATH TO THAT MAN. &gt;&gt; But see, if a person walks by signs, they walk by evidences of experiences. Well, you know, I did this and I seen this AND AND ALL OF THAT IS THE SUPERNATURAL. BUT WHAT IF THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID, YOU SAY YOU'VE SEEN A LIGHT? HE SAID, "BUT HOW'S HOW YOU KNOW IS HOW HAS YOUR LIFE BEEN SINCE you've seen that light?" &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF NOT, THIS IS WHY THE PROPHET HAD SAID, HE SAID, "AWAY WITH EXPERIENCES." HE WASN'T GETTING RID OF EXPERIENCE, BUT HE'S DEALING WITH HOW THAT PEOPLE HAVE RESTED UPON SENSATIONS. THEY'VE RESTED UPON EXPERIENCES. THEY'VE RESTED ON SUPERNATURAL THINGS INSTEAD OF THE WORD OF GOD. AND HOW DOES THEIR LIFE COMPARE WITH the word? &gt;&gt; WE'RE WE'RE INTERESTED ABOUT GETTING OUT OF HERE FOR RAPTURE. And you know, so when we're looking AT THIS, WE KNOW THAT THERE is a certainty that God will bring us through his word, God will absolutely clean that life up. Listen friends, this is why many times where you see lives that are up and lives that are down, lives that are in, lives that are out. OH, BROTHER SAMUEL, ARE YOU SAYING THAT SOMEBODY CAN'T BACKSLIDE? THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID. BUT SOMETIMES I'M WONDERING IF WHAT WE'RE CALLING BACKSLIDING IS ACTUALLY a lack of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; WE'RE LIVING IN A SERIOUS HOUR, FRIENDS. WE'RE LIVING IN AN HOUR WHERE THE HOLY GHOST IS NOT TO BE MINIMIZED, BUT JESUS CHRIST HAS TO BE EXALTED IN THE HEART AND LIFE OF EVERY SINGLE BELIEVER. THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU A BELIEVER. NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE AROUND THIS MESSAGE OR SAY IT'S THE TRUTH, BUT YOUR LIFE PUNCTUATES IT WITH AN AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's what MAKES IT DIFFERENT. YOU'RE NOT A BELIEVER BECAUSE YOU SAY THE BIBLE IS TRUE. YOU'RE A BELIEVER BECAUSE CHRIST HIMSELF LIVES ON THE INSIDE OF YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "BROTHER SAMUEL, I WANT SCRIPTURE." THE DEVIL BELIEVES JESUS CHRIST IS THE SON OF GOD, AND HE TREMBLES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE WERE MANY WHO WALKED WITH JESUS AND THEY BELIEVED on him. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE WALKING WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN IT CAME TIME TO MOVE IN, &gt;&gt; that's where it showed up. &gt;&gt; The word got to a spot to where, oh no, we're not going that route. That's what happened to the Pentecostals. God never did away with gifts and all those things like that. BUT AS SOON AS THAT STARTED TO BE TOUCHED AND PUT IN ORDER, brother Ram said that Pentecostal cat flared up. &gt;&gt; IT'S INCREDIBLE WHEN YOU START TOUCHING things of the supernatural AND YOU JUST WATCH. WATCH PEOPLE WATCH THEIR LIVES AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT THEY'RE TIED TO WHETHER THEY'RE TIED TO SUPERNATURAL THINGS IN THAT MATTER. YOU SAY, "BROTHER SAMUEL, WE BELIEVE IN THE SUPERNATURAL." THE NEW BIRTH IS A SUPERNATURAL. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE SUPERNATURAL YOU NEED. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE LET ME JUST TELL YOU SOMETHING. THE DEVIL, THE PROPHET SAID IN HARVEST TIME 1964, CAN HAND OUT THESE SUPERNATURAL GIFTS by the handfuls. &gt;&gt; HE'LL MAKE OFFER AFTER OFFER AFTER OFFER. YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO? THE PROPHET SAID WHEN HE DOES THAT, it's because he's seen somebody that's going to stay with the word. So now he's trying to always deviate them &gt;&gt; from the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's the truth, friends. &gt;&gt; Do we we believe in the supernatural? Because how could you not believe in the supernatural and not be born again? &gt;&gt; It takes the supernatural to bring the new birth within A PERSON'S LIFE. &gt;&gt; IT TAKES THE HOLY Spirit to do that. AND NOTICE THAT WITHIN IT, THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET COULD SAY THAT WITH speaking in tongues, all of those things, he said it is evidence that it is the Holy Spirit they're doing it, but it is not the evidence that a person is spiritfilled. &gt;&gt; You see, this is the word of prophecy that was spoken before and God coming and unfolding these things within our midst. Now I want to just I want to just move here just a little bit because with Paul in this declaration God even had set Paul to be a light to the Gentiles and the the purpose within Paul's ministry even as Paul would would would be given this by God was to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness ess of sins and inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith that is in me. So God has taken his word and he leads us to himself. He doesn't lead us, you know, God's not leading us to a man, but he's leading us to himself. This is why that when the real revelation that strikes about the message of the hour and the and the messenger, this is why that the clarity that's opened up and what we are to see is Jesus Christ and God opening opening our eyes to be united with Jesus Christ. GOD GOD NEVER sent the message for us to fall in love with the messenger. Rebecca never married Eleazar. &gt;&gt; BUT REBECCA, NOTICE THE UNDERSTANDING, THERE WAS A CHARACTER THAT WAS THERE THAT SUBMITTED ITSELF TO THE MESSAGE FROM ISAAC THAT ELEAZAR HAD. AND SHE BEGAN TO UH WALK INTO THE VERY PRAYER that Abraham had prayed. AND ELEAZAR WAS RIGHT WITH THAT PRAYER. AND SHE WALKS right into it AS ONE WITH A character that is now in a place to stand still and be dressed and made ready. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So, you know, she had to uh when Rebecca, think of how that in her decision that was made, she waters the camels and then she gets on the camel and she they make their journey. Now, IT'S HARD TO TELL HOW MANY MEN that they saw along the way, but there was something as she WAS FEEDING ON THE MESSAGE of Isaac. See, IT HAD BECOME FOOD TO HER. AS THE MORE THAT SHE FED ON THAT, THE MORE THAT THE CHARACTER of her bridegroom who she was GOING TO MEET WAS ACTUALLY now resonating IN HER HEART TO WHERE WHEN THEY CAME BY THE WELL OF HIM THAT LIVETH AND SEETH, SHE LOOKS OVER AND SHE SAYS, "WHO IS THIS MAN?" NOTICE THEY HAVE NO DOUBT PASSED MANY MEN. BUT THIS RIGHT NOW BECOMES SOMETHING TO HER THAT SHE SAYS, "WHO IS THIS MAN?" AND HE SAID, "IT is my master's son." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SEE, FEEDING ON THE WORD HAD BROUGHT HER INTO THE PLACE OF RECOGNIZING the very character OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHY THAT WITHIN IT, AS WE'RE FEEDING ON THE WORD, IT BRINGS US IN THE RELATIONSHIP WITHIN OUR LIFE, THERE'S A FELLOWSHIPPING with this mystery. But I want you to see that God himself, he's led us to himself to tabernacle in our lives through three stages of grace. And God will do the same thing to the world after it's gone through three different stages of purification. And how does GOD DO THIS? HE does it by his unchanging way. He does it by his word. &gt;&gt; Now, that's very key, friends. He does it by his word. God does not God does not do it. We believe in good music. I believe in good worship. But that's not how God DOES IT. GOD DOES IT BY HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; And so WHEN WE NOTICE THAT THE WORD ITSELF, THIS IS WHY THAT it is is so imperative within that word because the conditions, remember we referred to this last week, when if God ever saved a man, he'll do the same thing when the same conditions are met again. IF GOD EVER HEALED A MAN, he'll heal a man when the same conditions are met again. So who is responsible for creating THE SAME CONDITIONS? YOU OR I CANNOT create those conditions, BUT IT IS GOD BY HIS WORD AND OUR LIVES COMING UNDER AND YIELDING TO THAT WORD. AND IT IS GOD WHO IS CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR HIS WORD TO COME TO PASS IN OUR LIFE. It's like I told you LAST WEEK, DO YOU REALIZE WHY THE DEVIL WILL TRY TO BATTLE YOU ABOUT COMING TO THE HOUSE OF GOD? &gt;&gt; Come on now. OH, BROTHER SAMUEL, I CAN STREAM. TRY TO WATCH A FOOD CHANNEL and taste WHAT THEY'RE COOKING. &gt;&gt; TRY TO DO IT. &gt;&gt; THAT ARGUMENT DON'T WORK. &gt;&gt; THEY CAN MAKE THE BEST GUACAMOLE IN THE HOUSE, BUT IT DON'T MATTER. YOU CAN'T SMELL IT. YOU'RE NOT A PART OF IT. YOU'RE JUST A SPECTATOR. COME ON, FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; WE'RE LIVING IN AN HOUR WE'VE GOT TO PRESS LIKE NEVER BEFORE. &gt;&gt; THE RAPTURE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S JUST AN EASY THING. YOU'VE GOT TO PRESS. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THE HOLY GHOST IS NOT JUST SOMETHING YOU WALK INTO. YOU'VE GOT TO PRESS. AND YOU'VE GOT TO PRESS BEYOND YOUR OWN WILL. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO PRESS BEYOND YOUR OWN DOGMAS. THE OWN CREEDS THAT HAVE BEEN SET IN YOUR LIFE, WHETHER IT'S FROM A PREACHER OR YOU'VE JUST THROUGH YOUR INTERPRETATIONS WEAVED IN AN HOUR. IT'S AN HOUR OF RAPTURE TIME. IT'S AN HOUR TO PRESS LIKE NEVER BEFORE. &gt;&gt; OH, brother Samuel, it's not of works lest we should boast. Let me just tell you something. God said he would take care of the robins. He would take care of the sparrows, but he don't drop the worms in their nest. Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Oh, GOD JUST DO. WE'VE MADE GOD TO BE JUST LIKE A GOD'S JUST LIKE A socialist or something. He just dropping things. HE JUST DROPPING FREEBIES. JUST DROP IT. I DON'T HAVE NOTHING to do. I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING. NO. THE BIBLE SAID THAT THE KINGDOM OF GOD SUFFERETH VIOLENCE AND THE VIOLENT TAKE IT BY FORCE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE BIBLE SAID THAT SINCE THAT TIME AND EVERY MAN PRESSES INTO IT, YOU GOT TO PRESS BEYOND YOUR FRIENDS. YOU GOT TO PRESS BEYOND EVERYTHING THAT'S HOLDING YOU BACK. &gt;&gt; PRESS BEYOND EXCUSES. PRESS BEYOND SOMETIMES IT'S PRESSING BEYOND YOUR OWN LOVE OF MONEY. &gt;&gt; PRESSING BEYOND THINGS OF JOB. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOU'RE TALKING TO A MAN WHO PRAYED AND WHEN I HAD TO WORK IN RETAIL, I GOD MADE A WAY THAT I COULD BE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. I AIN'T CONDEMNING NOBODY. I'M JUST TRYING TO TELL YOU, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE UNDER THE YOU CAN SAY, "GOD, I WANT TO BE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD BECAUSE YOUR WORD, THERE'S AN ATMOSPHERE. WHEN THE WORD IS COMING FORTH, IT CREATES A CONDITION FOR LIFE. WE'RE LIVING IN AN AGE WHERE DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY AND ALL THESE THINGS ARE MOUNTED UP. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT JESUS CHRIST IS MORE THAN A match for every one of those things &gt;&gt; when the same conditions are met. So God is obligated to his word. Listen, when God when God God gave this message to this generation, that's God obligating himself. Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; There's things there's things that God is calling you and I to listen. There's lives right here. You need to be filled with the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Come on. We shouldn't get quiet on that. &gt;&gt; We should all be pulling for that. I don't care if you've been sitting here for 30 years. &gt;&gt; I don't matter if you've been sitting HERE FOR 50 YEARS. I DON'T EXEMPT ANYBODY from that. But what I DO SAY IS THIS. CUZ YOU KNOW WHAT? LISTEN. THE HOLY GHOST will never take AWAY FROM YOU WHAT HE HAS ALREADY DONE IN YOUR LIFE. BUT WHAT HE WILL DO IS ADD TO IT. &gt;&gt; CUZ GOD AIN'T GOING TO RAPTURE SPIRITUAL DORS. &gt;&gt; Are you HEARING ME NOW? GOD AIN'T GOING TO RAPTURE MIDGETS. THERE'S GOING TO BE GROWING UP INTO HIM IN ALL THINGS. SO, WE'VE HAD AN EXPERIENCE. KEEP LOOKING FOR MORE EXPERIENCES IN THE HOLY GHOST. LORD, I NEED MORE OF YOU. THIS IS NOT THE HOUR TO GET COMPLACENT. WELL, IF I'M PREDESTINATED, I'LL BE THERE. WHERE DO YOU GET THAT FROM? THERE'S NOT A QUOTE IN THE MESSAGE THAT YOU CAN GIVE me that that'll fit that into some kind of lifestyle that way. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. This is different than how I thought. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE HOW THE DEVIL WANTS TO SO SKEW THAT AND WHAT DOES IT DO? IT results in a complacent lacadasical life. &gt;&gt; Our lives are to be vigilant. Diligent as the scripture that's a scriptural terms diligent &gt;&gt; lest we let those things slip. &gt;&gt; Some of you probably thinking right now, why couldn't a whole basement have flooded? &gt;&gt; How about let's have a flood here this morning. &gt;&gt; Let's have a real flood of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You see, because here we know that GOD DOES IT BY HIS WORD. THIS IS WHY he said, "Let every man's word be a lie and mine BE THE TRUTH." GOD CREATES the conditions by HIS UNCHANGING WORD. THAT'S WHAT HE DID BACK IN GENESIS 1. It was the darkness. It was void. But God spoke and said, "LET THERE BE LIGHT." AND THE DARKNESS HAD TO GIVE WAY. AND WHAT WAS ALREADY THERE WAS THE SEED that was already planted there. All it needed was the light to shine upon it. YEAH. &gt;&gt; NOW, THIS IS WHY THAT JESUS would say that we are not to live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. Cuz you know, everything can be fine in the natural. But you know, through a real to a real spiritual believer, you were made, your satisfaction is not in the things of this earth. Let me just tell you something. If you can be satisfied in the things of this earth, you need a real trip to Calvary. YES, &gt;&gt; YOU'VE NOT WENT DEEP enough in your WALK WITH GOD. YOU SAY, "BROTHER SAMUEL, YOU MEAN WE CAN'T ENJOY HUNTING? WE CAN'T ENJOY THAT." I DIDN'T SAY WE CAN'T ENJOY IT. BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO SAY, IF JESUS CHRIST IS NOT THE NUMBER ONE SATISFACTION IN YOUR LIFE, &gt;&gt; then then WHAT YOU NEED IS A REAL DOSE OF THE HOLY GHOST. YOU NEED TO SAY, "GOD, BURN EVERYTHING OUT OF ME THAT'S UNLIKE YOU." BECAUSE WHAT MATTERS MORE THAN ANYTHING IS THIS RAPTURE. LORD, I WANT TO BE ONE WITH YOU, LORD GOD. &gt;&gt; I don't think anybody wants to live a miserable life. &gt;&gt; I don't think anybody does. No one wants to live in a place where we're just, you know, experiencing blessings that come from behind the veil. But yet within the life, you know, sometimes the life can be in and out. Well, sometimes, you know, it isn't always where somebody's out of church and and and then they're back into church. There's that, too. But then you have people that can even be in church and yet they're here physically, but they're out. &gt;&gt; That's good preaching. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; They're out. You know, YOU DON'T DO SOMETHING THEY LIKE, they're out on you. &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE THAT? THAT'S WHY WE NEED THE HOLY SPIRIT TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE THINGS IN OUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; WE NEED THE HOLY GHOST TO TAKE CARE OF THAT. THE HOLY SPIRIT IS ONE THAT WILL ACTUALLY NOT GLORIFY OFFENSES. HE WILL GIVE YOU DELIVERANCE AND HEALING FROM OFFENSES. &gt;&gt; IF YOU ALLOW HIM TO, HE'LL REMOVE EVERY EXCUSE THE DEVIL'S TRIED TO GIVE YOU FOR NOT REALLY SURRENDERING AND SUBMITTING YOUR LIFE TO GOD. JESUS CHRIST WILL DISMANTLE THAT LYING DEVIL THAT HAS WANTED TO BRING TORMENT OVER YOUR LIFE. THE SPIRIT OF GOD WILL DISMANTLE HIM AND CALL POINT OUT WHAT IS TRUTH AND WHAT IS FICTION. &gt;&gt; This is why Paul would tell Timothy preach the word. &gt;&gt; He wasn't just saying just going around preaching. It's the same thing Peter said, let him speak as the oracles of God. Let it be by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Oh my. I know sometimes our flesh would like to control certain inspiration. &gt;&gt; But you see, I want I want you to look at this just for a moment because you see the word as it's being preached, it'll change the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; It will change the atmosphere. And let me just tell you something right now. The Holy Spirit is not what you achieve. Let me just drop this to you. As I was here last night praying, this the Holy Spirit brought back that quote to me of how Brother Brown said, "God's God's uh God's warrior, David," he said, "you're not a Christian by your desire. You're a Christian by God's desire." &gt;&gt; AND GOD HAS MADE A WAY TO BRING YOU TO HIMSELF. NOT JUST TO A CHURCH, BUT ALL THE WAY IN HIM. YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHERE YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT TO STAND AND SAY, "THE HOLY GHOST IS MY PROMISE." &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT A BEGGAR. YOU'RE NOT A STRANGER, BUT A SON OF GOD. AND GOD IS MAKING KNOWN THE RIGHTS AND THE PRIVILEGES YOU GOT. I DON'T CARE WHO'S WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND YOU. IT DON'T EVEN MATTER WHO'S SITTING BESIDE YOU. IT'S WHO IS THE LORD SPEAKING TO. AND WHEN HE'S MINISTERING TO YOUR HEART, TODAY IS YOUR DAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So good. So good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Acts 19. Here was a group of believers. Apollos. Apollos was their pastor. And Apollos man, I mean, he had really proved by the scriptures that Jesus, he was the Messiah. He had laid the Apollos had so laid that out. And here they were gathered unto the repentance. They had been baptized unto repentance. This group of 12 believers there in Ephesus in Acts 19, they had been baptized unto repentance. The sacrifice had already been offered up. The Holy Ghost had already come and they didn't know nothing about it. And when Paul came among them, Paul just started listening to him. And Paul said, he started noticing their their speech. He said, "Uh, how are you baptized?" See what he did? He didn't even ask him, "Did you receive the HOLY GHOST?" HE KNEW YOU GOT TO FOLLOW THE FORMULA. &gt;&gt; SEE, PAUL KNEW YOU GOT TO FOLLOW THE FORMULA. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE THE HOLY SPIRIT FOLLOWS AFTER FULL REPENTANCE. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. This might seem strong. Buckle it up. But it but it's good. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "If you say that you've repented and you've not received the Holy Ghost, then you make God a liar." &gt;&gt; Come on. BECAUSE IF YOU FULLY REPENTED, YOU SEE, THIS ISN'T ABOUT, LISTEN, THIS ISN'T ABOUT PUTTING ANYBODY OUT, PUTTING ANYBODY DOWN, BUT IT'S IT BRINGS TO BLIGHT CERTAIN THINGS THAT SEEMS TO BE SO OBSCURE. WHY IS THIS? WHY IS THAT? BUT YOU CAN TRACE RIGHT BACK DOWN. AND THE PROPHET WOULD BE LED BY GOD WHEN HE PREACHES IN IN UH IN IN JULY OF 1963. HE CARES. Do you care? AND HE DEALS WITH THAT WHOLE SERVICE, THE WHOLE TRUE problem among people wondering, am I a part of it or am I not? I I don't know. It was repentance. You see, we if we're not careful, we've gone off and left him back at the feast of Pentecost. And Jesus ain't going to come to where we are. We got to go back to him in the word. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me, friends? You can't you can't say, "WELL, JESUS, COME ON NOW. COME ON. We've already made two days journey." No, you got to come back to where you left him. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO COME BACK TO WHERE YOU LEFT HIM. BECAUSE FOR PENTECOST, LISTEN, PENTECOST IS IS NOT JUST A FEAST, BUT PENTECOST IS AN ACTUAL EXPERIENCE OF GOD COMING INTO YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And there's and it's AN EXPERIENCE OF WHEN GOD STEPS DOWN INTO THE VERY HEART OF MAN. This is why friends listen to me now. Listen, listen, listen. This is why sometimes that after years and years all of a sudden you wonder and say, "My goodness, this one 30, 40, 50 years. My lord, if I thought anybody had it, but you know what it is? They went off and left him." &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me now? &gt;&gt; I know this ain't comfortable, but it's truth. &gt;&gt; One day we get we get stand we stand there on the other side. You'll be thanking me before it when you've received it. &gt;&gt; Because you see the MESSAGE ITSELF, THE MESSAGE DIDN'T COME TO PUT ANYBODY DOWN. THE MESSAGE HAS COME TO CALL YOU OUT. YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? WHAT THE REAL MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS? IT'S THE GRACE OF GOD TO THE DIRT AROUND YOUR LIFE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE SEED IT AIN'T ABOUT THIS DIRT. THIS DIRT GETS OFFENDED THIS DIRT AND THERE AND EVERYTHING. BUT IT AIN'T ABOUT THE DIRT BECAUSE THERE'S MANY, MANY, MANY WHERE THE LIGHT SHINES AND IT HAS NO IMPACT UPON THEIR LIFE. You know why? because there's no seed. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE LISTEN, IF YOU DON'T PLANT ANYTHING OUT HERE, YOU CAN'T EXPECT NOTHING TO COME UP. YOU CAN YOU CAN BAPTIZE, YOU CAN WATER THIS GROUND, YOU CAN LIGHT IT, YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING ELSE. THERE'S NO SEED GOING TO COME UP IF YOU DIDN'T PUT NO SEED OUT THERE. IT'S LIKE BROTHER Willie and Brother Richie when they spread all that dirt, put down that seed. Brother Willie put down enough to sew the whole field across the street. BUT IF THERE HADN'T BEEN NOTHING DOWN THERE, &gt;&gt; IT WOULDN'T BEEN NOTHING COMING UP, RIGHT? THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LOT OF unwanted weeds. &gt;&gt; We've all been that in sewing lawn. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? SURE, THERE'LL BE SOME WEEDS COME UP, BUT WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THEM WEEDS AS THEY COME UP. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THOSE WEEDS. WE'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THEM. IT'S GETTING THE SEED DOWN. AND THAT'S THE SAME WAY WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT, WHEN JESUS CHRIST IS BEING MINISTERED, I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT. WELL, BROTHER SAMUEL, IT MIGHT FALL HERE. IT MIGHT FALL THERE, BUT IT IS GOING TO FIND EVERY SEED OF GOD. THE WORD WILL FIND ITS TARGET. &gt;&gt; THE WORD HAS FOUND YOU. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; They had to be rebaptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Paul had to bring them up to the correct season. This is why when Paul told Timothy, "Be in season and out of season with all longsuffering and doctrine." Reproof with all longsuffering, reprove and doctrine. This is why the privilege of the word you this is why when the spirit of God I mean think about it when brother Brandham would stand there how many times brother Ram said, "Oh man, it got to a place they heard brother Ram was coming. Start pinning your hair up, pinning it up, pin it up, pinning it up, pin it up. Cuz you know what? If you if if he's down here and and he sees cut hair, HE'S GOING TO BLAST IT. IT AIN'T BROTHER BRANDHAM BLASTING IT. &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU, HOLINESS IS NOT A MESSAGE DOCTRINE. HOLINESS IS THE SCRIPTURES. &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE RESTORED US BACK TO BIBLE FAITH. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. THIS IS WHY YOU SEE LIVES AS SOON AS THEY WALK AWAY FROM THE TRUTH, PUT ON THEIR SHORT BRITCHES, GO OUT AND CUT THEIR HAIR AND DO EVERYTHING ELSE. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT WAS ALWAYS IN THEIR HEART ALL ALONG. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, FRIENDS, I'm not saying that somebody that's went astray that they won't COME BACK TO GOD. IF YOU'VE GOT A LOVE GOING ON OUT THERE, YOU HOLD ON TO GOD AND YOU HOLD ON TO THE PROMISE AND YOU KEEP THAT PROMISE. YOU KEEP standing steadfast with that. THEN THEN THEY I AM CLAIMING THEM. LORD, I'M STANDING UPON THAT WORD. LORD, JUST LIKE YOU CHANGED MY LIFE. IT WAS SUPERNATURAL. I DIDN'T STUDY MYSELF INTO SOMETHING. IT WASN'T A MAN THAT STRONG ARMED ME. BUT LORD, YOU MOVED DOWN AND YOU BEGIN TO DEAL WITH MY LIFE. YOU BEGIN TO CAUSE ME TO LOOK INTO THESE THINGS. &gt;&gt; Cuz let me tell you something. There's many hearts that have also walked away that it isn't that they walked away from the message. Sometimes there's things where they've been hurt. They've been bruised. Sometimes even images they've had in front of them have disappointed them. &gt;&gt; Truth Don't tell me friends, I know. &gt;&gt; What is truth? How do I How do I know what's true? And and you know that it is so shaken there. But you know what? IT DOESN'T MATTER. WHAT? WHATEVER is down there, whatever's down there is going to come to life. &gt;&gt; I got to go to a quote right now. &gt;&gt; Everybody all right? &gt;&gt; She said, "Bring it on." Yeah. Come on. There you go. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said it like this. He said, "I want to drop something in here. I believe the Holy Spirit told me to do it." You might be sitting there. Some of you are. I know you are. You're disagreeing with me right now. I can call your name if you want me to. I know it. But I also can see farther THAN THAT YOU'RE GOING TO believe it one OF THESE DAYS. &gt;&gt; WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PROPHET. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE AROUND, REMEMBER WE WERE DARK AND VOID, BUT THERE WAS A SEA DOWN ON THE INSIDE. &gt;&gt; AND THE WORD HAS COME TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THAT PART OF THE WORD INSIDE OF YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; REMEMBER, IT IS THAT WHICH IS MAGNETIZED TO THE PROMISE IN THIS HOUR. That's why that even this message, it has an effect on your life. That's so good. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; He wants to draw you all the way into full relationship. &gt;&gt; He don't want to just be your girlfriend. &gt;&gt; Jesus don't want to just be your boyfriend. &gt;&gt; He don't want to just be a romantic encounter, somebody you can text. And you know that that's not what he wants. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet called a flirter. &gt;&gt; You know, a flirter is one who really don't have clear intentions. They just kind of like the emotions. They like playing with emotions. &gt;&gt; They like all that. Come on. These Am I not preaching message terms here? &gt;&gt; Flurters. &gt;&gt; But you see, within all of that, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. GOD'S GRACE IS SUFFICIENT WHERE IT CAN ACTUALLY TAKE A life that might HAVE BEEN FLIRTING AND IT COMES TO A PLACE OF SERIOUSNESS THAT SAYS, "GOD, I no longer want to be a flirt. I want to be fully united. I want to be one with you, Lord God. I WANT TO HOW DO I DO THAT? START TAKING THE WORD AND APPLYING IT TO YOUR LIFE. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORD IS? THE WORD BEING PREACHED IS THE BLOOD BEING SPRINKLED. AND AS YOU START APPLYING THE BLOOD, THE SPIRIT WILL FOLLOW THE BLOOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE SPIRIT WON'T COME WITHOUT THE BLOOD. &gt;&gt; THE BLOOD'S GOT TO BE APPLIED. THEN THE SPIRIT WILL COME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Is that right? I've been preaching this out of Leviticus 8. That's right where we're at. And the spirit will follow the blood. Now, let me finish this quote. It's just it's too good to pause. I can see farther than that. You're going to believe it one of these days. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "SO, I'M GOING TO PUT this in so you'll understand so I can give you a little spot of grace right here." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When it ain't going to be too long till you're going to change your mind. Some of you and then some of you won't. But he said when remember when Sarah first heard the man. How when remember when Sarah first heard the man Sarah she laughed up her sleeve. That means inside. &gt;&gt; Some of these Kuckians got that. But that means inside. &gt;&gt; That's what that mean. It meant inside. They're chuckling inside. Oh, you know WATCH THIS. AND GOD WOULD HAVE SMELT HER. &gt;&gt; BUT SHE WAS UNITED WITH ABRAHAM AND ABRAHAM WAS HOLDING THE PROMISE. NOW LET ME PREACH. NOW, DON'T YOU SEE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR A HUSBAND? LISTEN, HUSBAND, YOUR WIFE SHOULD NOT BE THE head of the home. &gt;&gt; Well, we're going to preach now. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE TO BE THE SPIRITUAL LEADER, THE SPIRITUAL PRIESTHOOD. &gt;&gt; WELL, SHE'S MORE SPIRITUAL. AH, you're to be THE SPIRITUAL ONE. SPIRITUAL MEANS SPIRITFILLED. &gt;&gt; Come on, FRIENDS. YOU SEE, GOD HAS DELIVERED A MESSAGE TO DELIVER ANY OF THIS STUFF OF being a &gt;&gt; Yeah. Woo. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THIS IS A MESSAGE. LOOK AT LOOK AT HOW BROTHER BRANDHAM EVEN WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM IS UP. LISTEN, THAT'S WHAT that's what even the culture hates today. They hate man. &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you what that is. Because there is the man Christ Jesus that has come. &gt;&gt; And the man Christ Jesus the word THEY SAID WE WILL NOT HAVE THIS man to rule over us. &gt;&gt; They do NOT WANT ANY AUTHORITY OVER THEM. THEY DON'T WANT NO ABSOLUTE. THEY DON'T WANT TO BE THEY DON'T want a man being a man. LISTEN, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A MAN BEING IMMORAL. I'M TALKING ABOUT A MAN WHO'S ONE. HE CAN STAND FOR HIS CONVICTION. IT'S NOT A WISHY-WASHY. I'M TALKING TO YOU SAY, "IS THAT IS THAT POSSIBLE?" NOT IN YOUR DNA. BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT IS HERE TO MAKE A MAN A MAN AND A WOMAN A WOMAN. &gt;&gt; AND HE'LL PUT YOU IN YOUR PLACE. HE'LL LEAD YOU TO RIGHT WHERE YOU NEED TO BE. &gt;&gt; COME ON, FRIENDS. Where we're no longer LED BY OUR FEELINGS. WELL, YOU KNOW MY WIFE THIS. I BELIEVE WE OUGHT TO TALK WITH OUR WIVES. WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO CONVERSE. WE OUGHT TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER. BUT FRIENDS, LET ME JUST TELL YOU SOMETHING. IN THIS HOUR, WE ARE LIVING IN A TIME, IN AN HOUR WHERE YOUR HOME, YOUR FAMILY, YOUR CHILDREN. THEY NEED TO SEE JESUS CHRIST LIVING INSIDE OF YOU. THEY DON'T NEED TO HEAR THE MESSAGE TALKED ABOUT. THEY NEED TO SEE IT LIVED. &gt;&gt; AND THE ONE THAT'LL DO THAT IS THE HOLY GHOST. THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID, "LET THEM SEE THE TOKEN ON THE INSIDE OF YOU." LISTEN, IT AIN'T HARD TO GET THERE. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS APPLY THE WORD AND RECEIVE THE WORD AND SAY, "AMEN TO THE WORD OF GOD." LORD, CLEAN MY LIFE UP, LORD GOD. FILL MY LIFE UP. &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Some of you might be despising this and you might be the very one that needs it. Don't miss your day of visitation. &gt;&gt; I'm no prophet. I don't claim to be no prophet. But I am saying this right here that the Holy Spirit is speaking very clearly and very plainly. We are listen. We see prophecies coming to pass. We see prophecies where the prophet spoke clear back there. Acts of the Holy Spirit what 1954 about how there would be a pope come out of America. Right. And there IT IS. &gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THIS HOUR? YOU RECOGNIZE AND YOU SEE IT HADN'T STIRRED MANY PEOPLE AT ALL. &gt;&gt; LIVES JUST KEEP ON GOING THE SAME WAY. KEEP ON. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? THAT'S ALSO IN EFFECT HOW IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF NOAH. THEY WERE SO OCCUPIED WITH THEIR LIFE. &gt;&gt; They ate, they drank, they slept, they build it. They were married. given in marriage. &gt;&gt; They were occupied with self. &gt;&gt; Oh, sometimes it isn't, you know, alto together maybe eating, drinking, and everything else. But maybe you're just drinking your own poison. &gt;&gt; That's called bitterness. &gt;&gt; And expecting somebody else to fall over. Maybe it's drinking up your own. Oh, I've been offended and I've been offended and I've been offended. Listen, who hasn't been offended? AND I DON'T MEAN I'M NOT TRYING TO BE CRASS, BUT I'M JUST SAYING LIKE THIS. I'VE BEEN OFFENDED. &gt;&gt; I mean, SO DO WE HAVE JUST A PITY PARTY OF OFFENSES? &gt;&gt; OH, I know that sounds rough, BUT YOU SEE, FRIENDS, WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO? HOW CAN I'M ASKING YOU A QUESTION. HOW CAN WE STAND AND SAY, BELOVED, OH NOW, WHAT MANNER OF LOVE HAD GOD BESTOWED ON US THAT WE SHOULD BE CALLED THE SONS OF GOD? HOW CAN WE QUOTE THAT SCRIPTURE AND NOT LIVE UP TO IT EVEN IN THE VALLEY OR WHEN THE CHIPS ARE DOWN OR WHEN WE'RE OFFENDED IF WE CAN'T DO IT? IT'S BECAUSE WE LACK THE POWER &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL MAKE you and lead you into that. &gt;&gt; Is that true? &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HE'LL DO. BUT YOU SEE IN THIS HOUR THE HOLY GHOST HAD BEEN WATERED DOWN TO A GOOD THOUGHT, GOOD FEELING. OH, WELL, you know, you're still going TO BATTLE THE FLESH. THAT'S TRUE. BUT I'M NOT HERE TO MAKE AN EXCUSE FOR THE FLESH. WE'RE NOT HERE TO GIVE A PLACE TO THE DEVIL. WE'RE NOT HERE TO GIVE STRONGHOLDS TO THE DEVIL. WE ARE HERE WITH A WORD THAT HAS COME TO ACTUALLY GO TOE-TO-TOE WITH SATAN'S KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A WORD RIGHT HERE THIS MORNING THAT CAN BREAK the hold over your life. &gt;&gt; It can break generation. Oh, brother Samuel, you know, uh, all I've ever known about the message is dos and don'ts. Then come experience grace. &gt;&gt; Cuz the message ain't dos and don'ts. &gt;&gt; You're missing it. &gt;&gt; You're missing it. The message is not dos and don'ts. The message is NOT LEGALISM. MAYBE THAT'S HOW SOMETHING WAS PRESENTED TO YOU. BUT let me just TELL YOU SOMETHING. DON'T STAY BACK THERE AND allow the DEVIL TO KEEP PUTTING WOOD ON THAT FIRE AND MAKING THAT EXCUSE. SAY, "I'M GOING TO BE ON THIS SCARECROW, AND I'M GOING TO RECEIVE THE GRACE OF GOD TO MY LIFE WHERE MY HEART CAN BE CHANGED TO BE A LEVER OF THE WORD OF GOD." &gt;&gt; My my my. This is what the spirit of God has come to do within our lives. This is why, let me just let me just try to bring this down here. Mama trying to go through all this hay. Let me just kind of capitalize it right here. The Bible tells us that there are three that are one. The Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. They're one. And there are three that agree in one. Water, blood, and spirit. These are the three stages that God leads a life through in order to come and tabernacle in that life. When the Holy Spirit comes, it's the word that begins to get your attention. It's the word that is really dealing with your life. Now, I know some some lives you might have been touched when you were sitting in a different place and you accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior, but you couldn't have accepted the Holy Ghost outside of coming under the word for your hour because that's the promise of a of a real word birth. This is why the if a person said, "Well, I got the Holy Ghost back in a charismatic church." You had a baptism, but not a word birth. The word birth comes under the word for your hour. &gt;&gt; You You've got to be born by the word for your hour. See that that that's a confusion sometimes that many may. It's experiences that's been had. This is why the prophet said it like this. Being an elect seed of God, he said it's always the elect seed that have seen the word in their hour. It is the inspiration of the Holy Spirit that is being poured out in that hour upon that seed. They saw it in Noah's time. They saw it in Moses' time. It was always the seed that responded to that inspiration because there were others that when that inspiration was poured out, they could walk with it for so long. But then when it got down to certain places, it was just exactly as it was when with Jack, brother Jack Moore and all the rest of them. You've seen many of them, they departed. You've seen many that just completely pulled away. Even those who made like TL Osborne made some in tremendous statements that if you read that and did not know and see where TL Osborne went off and you but it wasn't it wasn't revealed to TL Osborne what this was all about. &gt;&gt; It wasn't yet he there was some very good statements he made you can read in the memorial service where he was really dividing the dividing things out very very very good but it wasn't revealed to him. See, when the when the revelation when this message is revealed to you, what you see is Jesus Christ, WHEN THE MESSAGE IS REVEALED, what you see is a full fresh view of Calvary. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THIS MESSAGE come to do. IT COME TO BREAK AWAY MAN-MADE VEILS and bring JESUS CHRIST in view OF THE BELIEVER TO WHERE HE IS YOUR MEDIATOR. AND THERE'S NO MEDIATOR BETWEEN GOD AND MAN EXCEPT THE MAN CHRIST JESUS. AND SO GOD'S DESIRE, THIS IS WHY THE PROPHET speaking about that inspiration. He said, and and and many of believers, this is kind of a a terminology that you would you hear. He said, "This is why if I taught you a Methodist message, it would not take an effect upon you." Now, does that mean that you could not have had your start in a Methodist? You might have had your start there. You might have had your start in a Catholic church &gt;&gt; where YOU HEARD ABOUT JESUS CHRIST BEING YOUR SAVIOR, BUT YOU COULDN'T STAY THERE. AND YOU KNOW WHY YOU COULDN'T? IS BECAUSE YOU WERE PART OF THE MYSTERY OF GOD. YOU WERE ORDAINED TO TO BE A PART OF THIS WORD. YOU WERE ORDAINED TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD. THAT MESSAGE WAS FOR A SEASON. &gt;&gt; REMEMBER, preach the word, BE IN SEASON, OUT OF SEASON. &gt;&gt; THEN THE SEASON OF THE WORD. THAT'S WHY JUST TEACHING LUTHER'S MESSAGE WOULD NOT TAKE AN EFFECT. IT WOULD NOT BRING ABOUT THAT OF THE fullness and that OF THE FULL NEW BIRTH. IT WOULDN'T DO THAT. THIS IS WHY THIS MESSAGE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE FULLNESS OF THE WORD OF GOD. THE HOLY SPIRIT COMING TO BRING A FULL word birth. &gt;&gt; This is why the bride is not in the feet. She's not in the legs. You brothers have gotten married. You didn't go out and marry a little girl. &gt;&gt; Could make a comment about something or I won't stay. You didn't you didn't go out and do that. &gt;&gt; You you waited and it was in the time THE SEASON OF LOVE. IT WAS A MATURITY, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; And and YOU MARRIED HER. THAT'S THE SAME THING IN THIS HOUR. LISTEN TO ME. SOME OF YOU EVEN knew and maybe many of YOU THAT'S SAT HERE FOR YEARS WHEN YOU'RE HEARING THIS OF THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. IT'S A TIME OF THE MARRIAGE OF THE LAMB TO WHERE GOD HAS BEEN BUILDING A BRIDE. HOW HAS HE BUILT HIS BRIDE? HE'S BUILT IT BY HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE'S BUILT IT RIGHT BY HIS WORD. SHE WAS TAKEN OUT OF HIS SIDE. AND NOW IS THE HOUR FOR THE MARRIAGE OF THE LAMB. GOD IS NOT MARRYING AN INFANT BRIDE. COME ON. HE'S NOT MARRYING A PENTECOSTAL ISUZA STREET BRIDE. WE THANK GOD FOR WHAT HE DID BACK THERE. BUT THAT LISTEN, THE LIFE PASSED ON THROUGH THERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OH YEAH, WE BELIEVE IN THE GIFTS, BUT MALACHI 4 CAME NOT TO DO AWAY WITH THE GIFTS. &gt;&gt; But the prophet said they've been placed on the mantle, not in storage. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know I've stood WE PREACH THAT NOT IN STORAGE but they've been put in position &gt;&gt; like MY WIFE AND I LISTEN OUR STOCKP IS NOT IN STORAGE. Our saucepan's NOT IN STORAGE. SISTER, THOSE OF YOU THAT MAKE RICE, IT'S NOT IN STORAGE. IT'S IN ITS POSITION. AND WHEN YOU NEED IT, YOU GO GET IT. AND THAT'S THE SAME WAY WITH THE GIFTS IN THE BODY. WE ARE NOT LIVING OUR LIVES BASED ON GIFTS OR SUPERNATURAL HAPPENINGS. BUT OUR LIFE HAS BEEN BORN OF THE SUPERNATURAL AND CHRIST HAS COME AND PUT THOSE THINGS IN POSITION. &gt;&gt; Come on friends, y'all know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; We've lived through the time to where we can have a service and if we don't have an altar call, oh, have we really had church? &gt;&gt; I believe in altter calls. Don't you? But it's like the prophet when he's laying that in about ball alter calls. He believed in them too. But he didn't believe in them where it's pulling, persuading, and working the people. &gt;&gt; That's where the prophet said, "We got it all muddled up." He said, "We get a lot more stuff." &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN? CONVICTION. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHY, let me tell you what a blessed THING IT IS. IF YOU CAN SIT RIGHT HERE WHILE THE WORD IS BEING PREACHED AND THERE'S CONVICTION, YOU CAN FEED ON THAT WORD. AND THAT WORD, LISTEN, RIGHT? EVEN WHILE THE WORD'S COMING FORTH, THERE'S THINGS WHERE WHERE SATAN IS BEING PUT TO FLIGHT. EVEN FROM MINDS, EVEN FROM LIVES, HEARTS ARE BEING CHANGED. THE BLOOD'S BEING APPLIED. IT'S MAKING WHAT IS IT? IT'S THE HOLY SPIRIT MAKING A WAY FOR HIMSELF TO COME AND TABERNACLE INSIDE OF YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; But I say it in like this. You don't want to just have been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. That's a first step. and repent. &gt;&gt; But you wanna Lord, that next step is take all the wants away. &gt;&gt; That's all that that's sanctification. &gt;&gt; That's where the Holy Spirit comes in to take away all the wants. But you see, this is why, listen to me now, this is why in this hour, see, it sets our mind in order, order of holiness. But this is why in this hour the prophet takes us in how can overcome and he said people can live above adultery, drinking, fornication, live above all these things and still not with it. &gt;&gt; He said this is the age of the literal life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; This is the this is how we overcome. and and you know you you look and say, "Well, brother Sam, no, how do I know that I've overcome?" Look at your life. Look at the desire of your life. Has your life been changed? &gt;&gt; Now, I believe in growing. I believe before THERE BE A GROWTH, THERE'S got to be a birth ON THE INSIDE. YOU'RE NOT BORN one day, all of a sudden you're born again in a fully matured son of God the next day. The prophet called that nonsense, &gt;&gt; right? He said they're teaching that nonsense out there on the West Coast. It's nonsense. We are LIVING IN THE HOUR IN THE FULLNESS OF ADOPTION WHERE THE SPIRIT OF ADOPTION HAS COME TO BRING SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD INTO FULL POSITION. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; SEE THIS IS THE HOUR. THIS IS WHY WITHIN OUR LIFE that the Holy Spirit WE WANT TO EXAMINE OUR LIFE and ensure that we have been filled with God's spirit. See, when God's spirit has come on the inside, &gt;&gt; it takes it changes your desires. &gt;&gt; This word, the word, the word of God becomes alive to your life. You You can't get enough of the word of God. You You MEAN IT'S LIFE. IT'S NOT JUST STUDYING because there's people that can be good students. That's not what I'm talking about. You You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; You know, but but I'm talking about where it's life. You can't get enough. It just there there's a feeding that that's taking place within your life. You're seeing you in your life. THERE'S A CHANGE THAT TAKES PLACE ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LIFE. EVEN AS THE SPIRIT OF GOD WOULD BRING CORRECTION TO YOUR LIFE, THERE'S A SUBMISSION, A SUBMISSIVE HEART TO THE SPIRIT of truth. &gt;&gt; That is so good. &gt;&gt; I tell you what he does, friends. He gives you grace to rule over that temper. &gt;&gt; That's right. He gives you grace in your life. And you know what? He makes a real real real Christian out of you. &gt;&gt; Are y'all with me? &gt;&gt; He makes a real And once one as he's come on the inside, oh my, you talking about there's there's a love affair that's taking place. This is why that you know when you look, we just we just simply just submit our lives and examine our lives and look at it because, you know, it's one thing for us to be able to say, well, I love God. But it's another thing to actually be able to look at our lives because this is the condition and I'm gonna close of this lady age. They don't even know the condition they're in. &gt;&gt; They don't know. &gt;&gt; They're blind. They're miserable. They're naked and wretched. And here's the worst part. Don't know it. They don't know it. They can look at it and let me just tell you how Satan would love to rock to sleep and just just try to just little by little, well, you know, you see the message and wow, you know, wow, do you believe the message, but friends, listen to me. It's not enough to be around where it's at. &gt;&gt; You've got to get in it. &gt;&gt; And what's what it is is it's got to get inside of you. And I'm talking about Jesus Christ inside of your life. If there's one sitting here today and you have not repented and been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, what an opportunity for today. &gt;&gt; If there's one here today that you have not you have not come to that place to really have been united with Jesus Christ, I wouldn't be ashamed of him because he said, "If you're ashamed of me and my words in this generation, I'll be ashamed of you." &gt;&gt; I'd say, "God, I I lay aside every bit of that fear. I want to be united with you, Lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; I I I want to be one with Jesus Christ. I want I want that settled in my life. I want that victory coming down in my life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh friends, you know, as we're talking about it, it doesn't mean that every day that and everything that my we're going to be walking on the clouds, but it means there's an anchor that holds you. There's a change that's come into your life. And you can say, I am not the person that I used to be. There is a change that has transformed and taken place in my life. What has done that? the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let me just say this to you. You take the word, &gt;&gt; the preaching of the word is the sprinkling of the blood. &gt;&gt; And you apply the blood to your life, and the spirit will follow the blood. &gt;&gt; And you watch, it won't be you having to quit things. It will be the desire fleeing you. &gt;&gt; I'm just encouraging you. We just don't want to sit around where it's at. &gt;&gt; We want to get fully into it. &gt;&gt; I know. &gt;&gt; I know there's many. I believe I am. I believe I'm all I believe I'm all the way in. But I want more of him. &gt;&gt; I want more of him. Something about it. I can't get enough of him. &gt;&gt; I want more of him. And I'm talking about, you know what? Even when he skins my hide, &gt;&gt; I'm grateful. You know why? I know he loves me. &gt;&gt; I know he cares about me. I'm so thankful for his mercy. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. It certainly isn't maybe the way that I looked at some things that was going to all together and how it was going to come come about. But God God knows how to piece things together where I feel like things are just but he knows how to put it together. But what's most important, listen friends, my brothers, my sisters, don't don't don't take this this day or this moment for granted. Maybe even some that are even be streaming this right now, but don't take this for granted. Brother Samuel, I I would be ashamed to say that I need the spirit of God in my life. Don't be ashamed, friends. Don't be ashamed. But know that it's God's mercy. That's what we're here for. This church, this building, it's not about a gathering of perfect people. It's not about just where we come in here and it's like a club or a click or a community. I'm afraid too many times that's what it's become. It's so easy to where things can become that way. It can become a routine. We don't want to be routine Christians. We want to be led by the spirit of God. That's the privilege as sons and daughters of God. And I just right here this morning, just within these few moments and broken up thoughts, I wonder is there hearts and lives right here this morning? maybe alive that hasn't come into that place that says, "I want I want to lay my life down." Maybe you've not repented. But repentance is not just something that a man necessarily would walk you through, but it's something that you're experiencing in your heart where your heart is being touched. Conviction, your heart is being pricricked and you realize, "Lord, I'm standing in need." It might be that very thing that God is leading you to. And the enemy may have just tried to bring confusion and you feel like I've I'm so far beyond that. But that that might be the very catalyst that will lead to the cleansing and to the filling of the spirit of God. Friends, that's what we want. We want to be fully filled Christians. &gt;&gt; Even to where that maybe there's things in your life you can say, brother Samuel, the wantto's have been taken away. The prophet said it like this in the message one. He said, I'm convinced that many of us have just received enough of the Holy Ghost where we don't want to drink, we don't want to smoke, we don't want to do this, we don't want to do that. And he says, "A matter of fact, we don't want to do nothing." But he goes on to say, "God wants to fill every fiber." I thank God. I thank God for every work that he does. Justification, that's an experience. That's a portion of the Holy Ghost right there. But it's not the seal. I thank God for the saint for sanctifying power. That's more of the Holy Spirit, but it's not the filling. But it gets the vessel set in order and ready to be filled. Maybe that's where you're at this morning and you just say, "Lord, I want to be ready cuz I want to be filled." So if there's something in me, Lord, that's hindering, every head bowed, please. Every eye closed. If there's something that's hindering the Lord God, show me. Cleanse me, Lord, because there is nothing, nothing that's worth missing, &gt;&gt; having you being the leader inside of my life. I want you to be the Lord of my life, go through every door. Lord, if there's a door in my life that I've not allowed you to come in, a room, show me, Lord, show me, Lord. If it's a room that I've overlooked, maybe it's pride, maybe it's selfishness. Lord God, search me. I want you to be the Lord. I don't want you to stand on the welcome mat as my savior. I want you to be the Lord of my temple. So Lord, I invite you. Maybe it's in your music. Maybe it's in your associations. Why don't you just invite the Lord right there? Brother Samuel, invite him there. He went to Matthew's house. Matthew was a tax collector. and he went there to get Matthew. Why don't you just invite him in and say, "Lord, I need deliverance. I need cleansing, Lord." Oh God, &gt;&gt; THERE IS CLEANSING POWER IN THE BLOOD of the lamb. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Oh, right here this morning, friends, let's reach out. Let's draw it in while he's passing by. Let's take our opportunity in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Maybe you're sitting right here this morning. Maybe lived above every one of those things. But here you say, "Brother Samuel, it's just not real to me. It's just not real. I hear you preach about the flesh struggling and sometimes the flesh wants to stay away and from church and things like that, but this is different, brother Samuel. I need this is more than just my flesh I'm battling. I need I need the real filling of the Holy Spirit. Maybe God maybe listen friends, God can even take that in your life and settle you right here, right now. If you've had a question about it in your life, the Holy Spirit can bring a settling in your life here right now. Cuz God don't want you wondering. Well, I know this kind of ministering and preaching, oh my, it causes to examine. It caused every one of us to examine our lives. And it should. It should because this is where we're at where I I want to be sure. I want the Holy Spirit to examine every part of my life. Lord God, if there's something you see in me that's not right, Lord, show me. Lord, show me. Lord, take it out of me. Maybe there's something that's crept back into your life, a habit, and the enemy has wanted to make you so ashamed. You say, "How do you say, Brother Samuel, it's not the Holy Spirit?" Because the enemy would want to make you ashamed to hide. And that devil wants to remain hidden. But the Holy Spirit is calling you and saying, "You're my daughter. You're my son. &gt;&gt; I'm here to break that spirit from off of your life. &gt;&gt; I'm here to restore you back into full fellowship. I'm here to move down in your life and to do for you. Not only to cleanse your life, not only remove that habit, but I'm here to bring a real filling into your life." Glory be to God. Oh friends, if he wasn't ashamed to come down into the pig pin where the prodical son was at, Jesus has never been ashamed to come where we're at. But the enemy wants to always try to bring fear, wants to try to hide. But I'll tell you right here this morning, as a son and daughter of God, why don't you just expose him? &gt;&gt; Why don't you just expose him? If there's an area that he's crept back in your life, maybe you've been on journey. Maybe the spirit of God here it was in your life through justification, sanctification, and here there's things that's returned right back into your life. But listen, you don't have to remain that way. You don't HAVE TO REMAIN THAT WAY. YOU WERE MEANT TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND THE JOY OF THE LORD TO BE A PART OF YOUR LIFE. YOU WERE meant to be a real real son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Satan, you're a liar. &gt;&gt; My Lord Jesus has already defeated you. You that has wanted to bring torment and try to hold things over people's lives would even like to run them while the ministering of the word is going on. But right here in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ, my Lord Jesus has already defeated you. And he's come to remove you from hearts, lives, spirits. Oh heavenly father, grant it Lord this morning. Grant it Lord. Grant it Lord God. May you give courage Lord to hearts. May you give courage to lives Lord God to step beyond hallelujah their own feelings. Step beyond fear. Grant Lord I pray. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, what a moment like this. I I wouldn't want to I would not want to walk out of this service and know that I had missed an opportunity. Well, you don't want to wait one more day. You don't want to wait another time. You don't want to try to go another service. You may not have another service. I'm not begging you, not persuading you. I'm not pulling you. I just say it like this. If there's a tug in your heart right now, why don't you respond to that tug? Why don't you respond to that? &gt;&gt; The altar is open place right here. I'll be glad to pray with you. But I want you to understand it isn't all together of my hands. Yet I believe that the spirit of God, it travels right through here. But your heart say, "Lord, make my heart a place for you to come, Lord." Maybe, as I said, maybe it's for things in your life that's hindered from the Holy Spirit coming, but right here today, you say, "Lord, that's what I want." Hallelujah. Glory be to God. Amen. We're going to we're going to we're going to just worship him. If you if it's on your heart, I'll be glad to pray with you. I know there might be many other needs beyond just what I have mentioned, but I want to say this. We want to go on with God wherever it might be. Maybe it's something that's hindered you. Maybe you've already been filled with the spirit of God, but something has hindered you. Maybe it's a lack of forgiving somebody, but the spirit of God is here to remove that. Hallelujah. Can we just worship him? Maybe you need to surrender your life to the Lord. Maybe this is that moment for you. Let's let's take this day of opportunity. Let's take this moment, this privilege. We've invited the Lord Jesus here this morning. Let's welcome him. Let's welcome him. Lord Jesus, you're welcome. Lord, &gt;&gt; you're welcome. Lord God, yes, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Granted, Lord God. Hallelujah. I'm crying save. Oh my s. Oh Lord, hear my humble. &gt;&gt; Hear my humble cry. Oh yes, Lord. And while while others thou are, &gt;&gt; oh Lord, thou art calling, oh to not pass me back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, pass me not. Oh, gentle say. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, please hear. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's calling friends. Yes, Lord Jesus. Oh, and while others thou are called, &gt;&gt; thou art what holy do not pass me by. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh saveior my precious. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord please hear my heart. Oh cry. Oh and while while others out are calling. Oh, to not pass me by. I just can't help but think, friends, I I just don't believe that God would lead me in this way. God would bring a word like this. And our hearts would not. I don't know to what degree the response, but I believe that God in his mercy has come down. As I told you, I'm not pulling. I'm not persuading. I don't believe in that. But I believe if there's conviction and there's things that where you can look at in your heart, don't walk out of here when you know &gt;&gt; that you need to really surrender your life to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And let me just tell you, years. It don't matter how many years. Brother Samuel, I've been in the message for years. It's not about how many years you've been in it. It's about has it got in you. &gt;&gt; That's what it's important, friends. God, the Holy Spirit don't take anything from us. But at the same time, if there's things in our life where God is dealing with your life, it might be one. It might just been one. But the Holy Spirit, God God don't make no mistakes. &gt;&gt; God is faithful to his word. &gt;&gt; He's faithful to minister to what we have need of. And you know what? All around this room right here, there's brothers and sisters that I'll tell you what. If there's anything that is pulling for a believer and pulling for a life, it's a brother and a sister. We're here because we want to make sure. Lord, I want it all to be settled. &gt;&gt; I want everything to be settled. I want to be ready to go. I want not just only to be ready to go, but I want to live a life of victory. I want to live a life in my life to where my life it actually is something I don't have to tell somebody I'm a Christian. the life. &gt;&gt; It's something that comes into my life when I walk into my home. There's a there's a noticeable witness and a change that has taken place in my life. &gt;&gt; You don't want to just be around it. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you how dangerous it is just to be around this message and not get in it. Is one of these days you'll show up here on a Sunday morning and these doors will be locked. I don't know. Maybe you've got a key to get in here. But that's how dangerous it is. Is you want to be in an hour to be sure that the blood has been applied, &gt;&gt; that I'm a part of it. It ain't something we just want to talk about and be around it. We don't want to just talk about the word. Not to know the word is life. To know him is life. &gt;&gt; It's to know him. &gt;&gt; It's to know him in the power of his resurrection. It's to know him that changes the very appetite and desire of the world &gt;&gt; out of your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what he does. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. We sing this again. If you want prayer this morning, I encourage you this morning. Amen. To come and let's pray. Let's seek the face of God. Hallelujah. Let's let's mean business with God. I know. I know. I know. I know you can touch God right there in your seat. I I understand that. I understand that. But I also know that this is a moment right now that friends I as a pastor when I see lives that are those are the kind of things that 3:00 in the morning, 2:00 in the morning and I see I see things are faltering. I see things where situations and where it's we can have excuses to go do this and go do that but we can't find time to come to the house of God. Something's wrong. Something's wrong. Something's wrong. We're excited to go do this. We wouldn't miss this. I wouldn't miss this. But missing coming to the house of God, there's something wrong. Let me tell you what that something is. It's called the Holy Ghost. The prophet said, "If you have the love of God in your heart, you can't wait for those church doors to open &gt;&gt; to get in here." Is that what he said? &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; It sings this an hour. Lord, I want to be full of you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to be full, Lord. &gt;&gt; Every fiber, every fiber of my being, while on others thou art call, &gt;&gt; if you'd like to stand in worship, let's do that.

A hopeless day, an empty place if not for grace or a hopeless case. An empty place if not for grace.
