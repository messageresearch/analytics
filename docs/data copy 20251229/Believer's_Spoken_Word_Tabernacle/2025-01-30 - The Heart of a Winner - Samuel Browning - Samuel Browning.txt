so good to be gathered with you amen and if you'll turn with me to Philippians chapter 3 so enjoyed the time of Fellowship there on Sunday and amen so thankful that and brother Aaron and sister Amanda thank you for all your labors with that we sure appreciate that and um they're just right on that with doing things throughout the times in the week and making sure everything is there and it's for us and we so appreciate that thank you so much such a such a blessing amen it just really always does my heart good amen and I just so love those times uh we want to read here this text and I don't want to keep you standing uh but verse seven and Paul said but what things were gained to me those I counted loss for Christ yeay doubtless and I count all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but d that I may win Christ now I want you to notice that word that last phrase that I may win Christ so part of the things that he suffered the loss of notice how that for him his approach to it is his thought is he's not even considering oh what could have been and what I missed here and what I had to give up but the Lord Jesus has done so much for Paul Paul's life the Redeeming Grace to where that Paul could look at in his own life and then see those other things and say no comparison there's no comparison I do count or think of them as but dumb for what purpose that I may win amen Christ isn't he already a Believer isn't Christ already dwelling in him he is but Paul also was one who would speak as the first church age messenger you're realizing that there is a necessity for us to continue to grow in Christ that I may win Christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness I want nothing to lean upon but him which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already attained either were already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind me praise God how many can say Amen to that God that's that's a key God the enemy will always try to remind you of your failures your mistakes but I want to remind you that as soon as they have been repented of from your heart then don't even entertain the devil can try to bring this up try to remind you of this but you have met the requirements of God's word and Satan will be there until the very change of these bodies to try to remind you of why you're not worthy but the strength to turn him down is because you have met the requirements of God's word I say thank you Lord by forgetting in other words that that's not going to be that's not going to be my focus and my I forget those things that are behind because of the blood of Jesus Christ and what he has done for me and continues to work in my life reaching forth so now that gives us the strength to reach forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus I just realized there something here right now now I read from this text in our youth meeting I had no idea it just drops in my heart right now and we spoke to the young people and we had Fellowship on the Press but I'm not going to speak on the Press tonight but just I press notice toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus you love him tonight amen amen may God bless you and bless the word as you're being seated so good once again to see each and every one of you out and sacrifices that are made and I know it's a little warmer almost feels like we got a nice little Heat Wave going and I can't remember what day of the week it was before finally I could drive down the middle part of this out here and not slide around but I kept on praying I said Lord let all that melt so I don't have to send out another text and say be careful walking across the middle of the parking lot but we're trying to do our our best to uh attend to that and but um I would like to speak to you tonight on this thought and um it's going to be no doubt in multiple parts and I'm taking it where we've been working with within job but it's just something the Lord has so burdened um upon my heart within this and I want to speak on this thought on the heart of a winner I'll go ahead and warn you it's probably not going to go the way that you think it's going to go tonight so I'll just go ahead and warn you that so you can you can try to predict which way it's going to go it probably is not going to go the way you're thinking it's going to go and then some of you like oh no what should I have done tonight maybe I should have just streamed tonight but no it's I believe the Lord will help us tonight we certainly now want his strength and his help I want to look at another scripture where Paul would take this tonight in 1 Corinthians 9 and verse 24 and Paul would write know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the pricee so run that ye may obtain and every man that striveth for the Mastery is temperent in all things not just not just some things but the temperent in all things and Paul would take this obviously from that of an athlete when Paul would be able to see this those games were going on at times in Paul's time and Paul God would allow Paul and Inspire him just like when he would write about the armor of God here he was you remember he was chained to a soldier so Paul was able to see and understand all that even from being a Roman citizen and knowing all those things and then God would also allow him to write and Inspire him on these things of how that a person would train and they would train to actually to win uh a medal or a Garland or whatever the it was in that time and remember how Paul would write even to Timothy that you know whosoever striveth let him striveth let him strive lawfully and then you would find within this of how that whoever strive for the Mastery is temperate in all things and there's certain things that you know I'm sure that when we look at it among athletes and things like that when I've you know had the privilege sometimes you just you know you sometimes you might watch a little documentary about a runner you know because sometimes have You' seen Runners that's been so fast and you you kind of look at it here they are winning gold medals and yeah they're athletic and I mean they wouldn't be where they're at if they didn't have some ability and they've been able to have ability where they've been able to be coached and so forth along the way but then you see so much of the regimen of their life and you can look at how the things that they sacrific things they let go things that they don't even partake of things that they don't even entertain and and so forth for what purpose they do it in order to obtain as Paul writes here a corruptible Crown now the think of of that if they would do that to obtain a corruptible a crown because in in truth be known you wait so many years unless someone's a fanatic you wait so many years and nobody will even know what in the world and who won this and when they won this and whatever more I mean unless you get people that sit around a coffee shop and never have left their 18-year-old days in high school and they're still living their 18y old days and you know then they live it through their children and then they you know then everything and but nobody else knows what they're talking about right you you know what I'm talking about but we realize that those things fade away and in the moment they they mean a lot in the moment because there's been a lot of work that's went into it but Paul is bringing it to another level of that which will never fade away that Incorruptible Crown is that of a new body it's that of that theophany that is waiting there on the other side it's that which of the draw that's upon our life and to recognize that something that is within it that moves within our our heart that realizing that a lot of the things that come around within this life we still we come to a place to realize what does this really in value have to do or what does it have in value compared with what waits for me and you know I believe with all my heart in this hour in this day we're living in I believe we can experience the peace of God to what God has called us to to the fullness don't you I believe that we can experience heaven right here on this side di in our souls I believe that we can experience that the prophet would talk about even to have heaven in our home I believe that we can experience that atmosphere because we are believers and that we are made as channels for that atmosphere to move through our lives and so Paul would go on to write in verse 26 I therefore so run not as uncertainty now I want you to understand Paul when he's writing this he's not saying I'm running out of fear or I'm not running in terms of maybe I won't make it but because of what God has done in his life Paul is running with that strength and that fortitude as a matter of fact brother bam tells us I believe in taking sides with Jesus he said when those he said when God raises those up he said that were there through the First Ages they believed they were part of the Rapture that's how they lived their lives for the second coming of the Lord see they had no idea it was going to be so many years later and brother Braham says they went into the grave running and he said so when the Resurrection comes they're going to come up running because they went in with that kind of an anticipation that he's coming in our generation and see that's the same thing that you know they've looked for but I think we can say and we're not it's not something that's far out it's a reality God has declared to you and I that we might be know the the hour that we're living in and and that our faith might be built within this hour that we are truly living in the coming of the Lord there is nobody else to pass the Baton to the Baton has been passed to us and to know that it's not about whether we are sufficient enough in ourselves it's it's our sufficiency is of him and to think that even in the the last part of it even if you think about when they came back from Babylon and they had you know rebuilt the the temple there after their return from Babylon and so much of that parallels where you and I have been called out of denominationalism and when all of the adversary all the accusations and we've ministering on that through time of man everything that they were being attacked with false accusations and things were being said after even the temple was erected and all the walls this is nothing but rubbish and a fox can jump through through this and after it was all said and done when they looked at the temple remember the elders those who had seen the the first temple they wept and they actually declared they their hearts were filled with joy because they could see God had restored his word but that Temple was in no comparison to Solomon's Temple but you see it was it was a greater glory to think of how that God had brought a people back back into that place I want you to think of this when here stood Emmanuel God With Us and here he was clothed in the Tabernacle of his Humanity it was nothing in comparison to Solomon's Temple herod's Temple it was in no comparison but yet that was the exact antitype of all of what the type spoke of yes sir and this is where the Lord Jesus could stand there in their midst and say there is one in the temple that is greater amen so there's a lot of times there's things that when we're looking at the time that we're in and I that those things I say that because sometimes we look at ourselves but I want you to remember God did not Choose You and I based on our abilities he'll use things about our life but the whole thing is the Paradox that out of an age that has come back and reached to Scientific achievements like it was in the days of Noah that God will have a people that will be completely dependent on the Divine intelligence of almighty God he'll have a people that are not led by AI but they are led by the mind of Christ hallelujah what an achievement in this hour in an hour where there's such intolerance and hatred and such strife and such division but in this hour Hallelujah Christ himself self moving in the hearts of his children and through his word will achieve a church that is full of the Divine love of almighty God that is the achievement of almighty God and God is here to bring all of that to pass so we look to him who has beckoned us and called us for what he has summoned us to do and Paul said this is very certain I I'm not I'm not fighting as one beating the air just you know swinging my arms I'm landing the punches but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a Castaway so Paul did not rely upon his abilities remember Paul could speak many languages Paul did not rely upon the gift in his life right remember 1 Corinthians 13 Paul did not rely upon that there's only one thing that he was relying on and that was the Lord Jesus Christ that's where he was fully resting and with that it was a burning within his heart because you see when when the reality of predestination strikes our heart you I want you understand this is this is where that if it's just Doctrine it's ceases there but this is not Doctrine it is the person of Jesus Christ it's about a love affair it's a love affair with him and this is why when when you know him then he will lead and guide you into all truth amen and it's something that you desire to know him more it's a desire to have more of him I just heard the prophet say it again I started back through statue of a perfect man and brother bam says he said you know he said it's come to a place like with my wife he said oh he says I told her honey he says I just would love to take you and just pull you inside of me he said so where we would really be even more than one and brother Bram says to think if we feel that way in the Mortal he said it's a million times higher to a believer that a Believer says I just want more of him I want more of him I want to be more one with him I want him to be more of the chief and the influence over my life sir yes so with that I want you just to just to think with me here just a moment and I'm not going to leave this here for very long but I want to just do this before I read a quote and I want you just to think that how that God calls each of us into this place that he builds us into a perfect man right everything starts with having obtained like Precious Faith coming into Christ Christ but then it's God who begins to build and work in our life that's so good I know we've I displayed this even back in May I think it was we're working but I want you to understand that these are not things that just it just it just happens but it's things that we give ourselves to and you know what how do we know what to even give ourselves to or how to even give ourselves to God unless we see our lack is that right the prophet tells us in in how can I overcome he said we don't come to to church to have our good places known we know those he said but we come that our weaknesses might be made known and that where we are that God's grace will catch us from where we are to where we need to be amen it's a growing in our life that then when we see our weaknesses when we see our lack Lord I want more of you amen Lord I need not just one I need I need I and I see my inability it's not I can't produce the virtue that's needed I can't produce the knowledge that's needed I need you Lord I need you Lord and you know what God so designs it this is where perfect strength and perfect weakness comes in God so designs the the complexities of life in his permiss in his in the way that he permits things to come to bring us to a place that we can see our weakness that's so good yes and it's always a crucial thing that we can do one of two things with that we can either make our weaknesses excuses or we can yield to the Lord and say God I Surrender where else can I go what else can I do and the prophet tells us that when we come to that place he said God made us that way for a purpose as he says in the message absolute he made me with these no accounts in me so he by his grace could dig it out of me think about that God knew he knew of all the Spectrum this much metal and this much metal it would be a certain Ting of the baell god knew of all the strains God knew of everything that would come down through time but his grace is sufficient the prophet said what he does is he'll pour himself in to that weakness and he uses himself to accomplish the job yes that is so good Hallelujah don't you love him yes sir think about this now this is we're all growing and I tell you what when we look at this and more and more and I tell you I told you over the past months I just just been taking little by little by little and and just throughout this this message and just chewing on it and meditating on it and and looking at it and and I want you just read this this statement because one thing that is I poured through this over the months and over the times you know you hear brother bradam will say it over and over I've got just separate uh quotes that I've just come through as as brother brandham over the time brother Bram is constantly referring to this growth and he says uh and for us and and that we might and and that I desire so he's putting himself into that place as well that his desire and knows there's a deeper walk for him amen let me read you one of the quotes to me is just absolute blessing at the end of statue of a perfect man brother BR says I pledge I pledge this morning to him with all my heart that by his help and by his grace I pray that I'll seek daily without ceasing until I feel every one of these requirements flowing in this little old stature of mine till I can be a manifestation of the living Christ he became watch this he became sin like me that I might become the righteousness of God like him he took my place Lord let me take his his now because that's the purpose he died for and he said how many will pledge that same thing by the grace of God good Hallelujah glory be to God so we look at this pressing towards the mark you know there's things that that happen and transpire in our lives and things that we see that happen around us sometimes in what I'm I'm referring to is sometimes there's situations that just seems like man it just seems like something just fell in place sometimes it just see you know you can have a a person or an individual and here it is it just maybe their first time they walk in in in in the church doors and we had that just there just a few mon few months ago and I want you to keep her in prayer sister Bernice she's really U you know she had an accident I had a time to be able to just speak with her on the phone here just just last week and she had an accident and has just been dealing with a real sickness in her body so let's just keep her in prayer would you she' just really been listening you know into the word and the message and just just such a such a hunger and some of you may not uh know her but she's been here throughout the services at different times uh but you know she said usually it will sit kind of right back there and but I want you just to keep her in prayer but I you know sometimes you look at a situation and here here She come in you know a service in in August and my just from that service in August I mean it was at that moment you know we were standing around and then in her heart she just she after many people started to leave she said would you mind if could I talk with you just a little bit and so my wife and I we took her and we begin to just speak to her and you know and just coming to a place to realize that you know she already been exposed and been around you know to to know of the message and and different things but in her heart she desired she said I I I need I need a deeper walk I I want I want that that anchor in my life and so you know coming to that place sometimes what I'm saying is there's sometimes where there's things that you know where lives and hearts and things can just happen and just take place and it just things things T things just happens and we we look at and and think my goodness my how did that happen and and we're we're we're so thankful to God because we know it all has to be the Lord God can work through many many many different channels uh we've seen it right here and we stand here in this congregation God has many diverse gifts in his body God has diverse even when it comes to singing playing and on just and diverse amongst his people and God had it that that way for a purpose you realize there's even certain things that you would even know about that sometimes you might think why did I even have that or read that at some time but you know Paul when he came to Mars Hill at that time maybe some things that he had read that he thought was why did I even read that before but when he came there he was able to quote their poet that's right now God didn't call everybody God didn't call Peter to know the poets but God used what was already there in Paul's [Applause] life and God had him in that place for a certain reason because those individuals they would probably not have even listened to Peter true but God used and God used that to him to pick up and be able to speak for what purpose to win them yeah Hallelujah that was the purpose it wasn't that Paul would be able to say I read this and I read that and I read it wasn't for that even for all the languages that he knew right amen Paul might have wondered sometimes why why am I learning this language why am I knowing this and he might have found like look he had come to a place he counted all things but dung and when it come to such a place God said I can use it God will use things and experiences in your life that you might look at and say why did I even pass through that why did I even have an understanding of that and God as we yield to him God can sweep right down and use that testimony use that experience for what purpose to win someone else that's right that's right that is so [Music] goodu so pressing towards the mark some sometimes as we're looking at it it sometimes as I said it falls right in place without any effort and those are things that I believe that we we can always see it's it's it's the Lord at work but it wants us just to understand and just to be mindful God works in many different ways I want to just read here a few quotes and there's will be a little bit more I'll refer to but I want to just think of this brother BR says we pray in prayer we pray that you'll come in your magnificent power and will lay thy Healing Wings across the building and may every sick person in here be filled with healing power Grant it Lord may as the prophet said the distilled du drops of Mercy bathe our souls until we see the purpose of Jesus our King to redeem us from sickness and sin and to set us free and to give us a happy life of service winning others for him amen now brother brah will go on in another message I'm just going to read it and you can listen he said another thing Lord knowing that the coming of the Lord is close at hand what type of people should we be how should we conduct ourselves that's what it says in second Peter how should we be waiting with great enthusiasm and in anticipations waiting for the coming of the Lord winning Every Soul to Christ that we can for the hour is getting darker and darker and as the storm CL clows of unbelief and skepticism moves over our beloved Nation so it's time to thrust in the sickle now and get what we can Amen brother Bram stands in the end of a blessing Prophet that message and he stands after speaking just a little bit of time and he's dealing with how the conditions that are among and what they see you know just even in the little city where they're at and and all around and and brother brandham is just you know he's he's talking to the Lord and he said you know he says I I I've missed he said so many opportunities I've missed because of petty things little old insufficient things that don't mean nothing I'm ashamed of myself as a gospel preacher before you I Repent before God and ask God to forgive me and the church to forgive me for being so dilatory about the work of God by the grace of God and by the help of God he said I I'm I'm trying to tell tell trying to tell you something to do he said they've got a program they've got something for you to do nonsense God's program is written in the Bible and he said I'm ashamed of myself as a minister of the Gospel 1 million Souls one but I ought to have 10 million Souls one I'm way behind and he said what about you how many Souls have you won since you've been to Christ right he said Christianity just just goes uh he says how many Souls have you once that you've been to Christ he says uh Christianity just goes from one to another how many Souls you won since you've been a Christian if you're not winning Souls you're guilty you're baren you've brought shame on the church and the gospel how many people he says do you get out for Wednesday night prayer meeting I want you to notice this isn't it isn't condemnation but it's calling us back to understanding the principle of winning I'm talking about the heart of a winner the heart heart's desire of a winner now to think because when we look at this let me just finish reading in here he says if you're not doing it you you ought to be ashamed of yourself you're guilty and your places at the altar and invite you to come with me for repentance brother Bram just when he invites the people the prayer that brother Bram prays after this I I I was going to play it for you but the audio is not that great but it's just powerful and he says will you bow your heads and just just while I feel my guilt because I'd like to repent amen cuz he's seeing that there's so much more and here's what it is as he said in the very the the the the the one before that uh he he talks about how that I've let too many other little things get in the way I've let I've let missed opportunities I've let things come my way I wonder if some of those things that the prophet let come his way that we also could Fellowship in and sometimes we've listened to our own thinking oh my and sometimes we've went by our own feelings instead of saying Lord you lead me then every opportunity no matter where we're standing you might be standing in a store might be standing in a deli I'm just trying to say that look the reason that we're here is because the last one hasn't come in yet Hallelujah and that's our brother that's our sister I don't know where they're at they might be on Skid Row somewhere you might say well they might be someone way down you know in Guatemala or El salador every place has a last one that's right every place has the last one and in the meantime it's God moving and molding I friends I I don't understand I I'm not even here to try to put all this together but to understand that God will bring every son and daughter of God into a full adoption before we leave this place do you see what I'm saying and I I'm just looking at look how the prophet talked about in invisible union he refer referred to the opening of the seals and he says my goodness the things are happening so fast rolling across that desert things are opening so quick the word that came and was brought to you and I and I'm looking at this right here and this time listen you think that there's not going to be lives and hearts that even right Among Us that the spirit of God taking a hold of their life and here they are filled with the spirit of God and there will be such growth moving in their life in such a rapid Pace why that is so good why because he's faithful amen he'll make sure every son and daughter of God comes to their position thank you Lord may God help us I look at how that brother Brandon would say oh he says I want to see when I stand there that day God he said has given the gift that he's placed here upon this Earth and he said that people might be without excuse on that day now God didn't send this ministry to condemn people John 3 John 3 right and then the he did not come into this world for God so loved the world that's it if you read John 3:16 you see the heart of a winner it was the heart of the winner because remember God and Christ are not two separate people it was God in Christ God's heart on display in a tabernacle of human flesh he was called he was ridiculed they said he had a black mark on his name he was ridiculed he went through Whispers he went through everything where he walked through his life blessed but he didn't let that stop him from winning [Music] you I'm talking about the heart of a winner not the mind not you know yeah we say we got to have the right mind and that's exactly right oh you know it takes the right mental attitude that's exactly right but you know when something's in your heart even when you don't feel like it yes it's in your heart that's why when God gives a burden a burden it's not a burden like oh I have to do this no it's a burden that even when you don't feel like itall you do it because it's the love of God that constrains you in your heart your whole life it's not about you any longer and God leads us to those places of self-sacrifice are you with me leads us the dove is still leading the dove is leading the Lambs he led the lamb and the dove that has been loosed in the evening time is leading the Lambs of God God said that that gift I think God would come down in such a way in this generation why God God would display himself remember for the purpose not just that people would follow after a gift right that's right not just that they would go after healing brother Brandon had just been pouring over one in a million over and over again brother Brown dealing with in there very familiar statement he said healing is the bait on the fishes Hood he said and what that Divine Healing does listen he said what that does among the people is when they can see something is done that no natural mortal can do he said then they recognize there is one that is greater and it's at that moment that at that time that that's what the hook is set for is to bring them into himself how many of you watching maybe deep call to deep or read your first book or came into your first service right first time God dealt with you you came with a paper bag with your clothes to be baptized is that right different ones of you when God met you and begin to deal with your life it was something you didn't even know exactly what it was you didn't even know what the message was but what it was it was Eagle wings God sent Eagle wings to get [Applause] you Hallelujah the conditions that we we were in the situations the things that we were believing but Eagle wings Hallelujah he sent to bring us unto himself on Eagle wings Hallelujah it was the heart of a winner oh I'm so glad aren't you brother Ram said like this he said oh he said may I be as faithful to his word and to the calling I believe someday I'll see him in peace and I want to to see standing with me literally millions of people that I had to be instrumental in winning them to Christ I want you to remember to be a winner you've got to be temperate in all things temperent and you know what God shows us where we need to be tempered in our lives we don't start out altto together that oh I've it's like many times in your heart of your life and my life sometimes you learn things as you get older not to eat certain things because it makes you stiffer some of you may not experience that or whatever more but I'm telling you I've experienced that seem like I can't hardly get out of a chair and then I realize oh stop eating this right here then I can get right up stiffness I know I'm only 49 I know look only 17 but I get it I get it but you know there's certain things that you can eat and you realize after you eat it you're like boy I wish I hadn't ate that or I wish I had to waited till after church and ate that right I mean you sat here and you almost put a mask on because you didn't well anyhow there's things that we learn to be temperate is that right that's the way that God deals with our life on certain things he's drawing from our lives Now watch how brother Ben goes on to say this in the message divine love he said we're not trying to make disciples out of anyone we're only trying to get you to fall deeply in love with the Lord Jesus and start winning souls for him brother B goes on to say this is the only time we're going to be mortal this is the only time that we're going to have the privilege of winning a soul let's do it this week if every person in here will try with all of your heart to win some soul to Christ this week there will be Joy bells of Heaven ringing let us remember that and do all we can and of course cares of Life busyness of life and sometimes what will try to come around and try to make us ashamed of what we believe and most of the time when a person starts out with serving the lord and they get they get the feeling like well I can't explain this and it's can't explain that you don't have to explain everything just tell him how your candle got lit tell him what he's did for you that he saved my soul well brother Samuel you know I'm I'm not certain exactly where I'm at right now testify according to what you know that God has done in your life the prophet said when you will confess what he has done watch it work righteousness in your life Hallelujah just hand the devil back his muzzle and say take this back I don't need this I'm going to testify for what I know he is I can't testify for what he's done for you I can't it's your experience it ain't mine but I can tell according to what he's done for me and you know what how what he's done for me there'll be somebody somewhere along the lines different ones that God has so aligned that to catch notice this in Romans 9:1 14- 16 I'm I'm just reading these scriptures with a purpose Paul said what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God God forbid for he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that willth nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth Mercy for by grace are ye saved through faith and not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them that is so good so truly these scriptures among so many others of the Canon of the Bible we can draw that same conclusion salvation is of the Lord and as we've been looking and the Lord would have us looking through those Services we looked at on a savior and how that God would work even through those attributes remember within it it's not our business our business itself is not to is not to save somebody our business is to just be an instrument that the word itself that has done a work in us that's in our hearts that that same word could be issued out to someone else it's casting bread upon human Troubled Waters so it's a privilege we're not called because we're not a divine Savior no I'm not a divine Savior I can't save anybody but I know that God and what he did for me and I know what he did for me it was miraculous he changed my life completely as a matter of fact when not only others wrote me off I didn't even realize this I had no idea but he changed my life glory be to God now notice this is then that purpose that we are called to listen brother BR would say it like this in what was the Holy Ghost given for the purpose of the Holy Ghost it's the father again God the Father dwelling in you working out his plans to finish his Plan of Redemption working through you making you a coworker with him giving you a place giving you a part for your Fallen lost brother or sister do you realize when God puts somebody like that on your heart maybe it's somebody you work with somebody you've met at the meat counter maybe it's somebody that's checked you out of the line at some place maybe it's a loved one but you realize when that is put on your heart do you realize that's how it was we were always on his heart Revelations 13:18 said that when the names our names were written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world our names were always there we were always identified with him and his desire was to have fellowship with his attribute Sons then the fall came in and when the fall came the prophet I love how he says it he said after the fall came he said he wasn't going to just let his creation lay there in Ruins but he begin to work begin to brood begin to to move we were as helpless as helpless could be but he be to brood he be to move upon our life for what purpose notice it was the heart of a winner even when here there was a Noah Noah at the end here of the part of it here he dies a drunk Ste a prophet of God but think about it when that came up it did not stop the heart of our winnerl he kept going he kept moving and here came an Abraham here came an Abraham then here came an Isaac then here came a Jacob then there came a Joseph that's the pedestal that the image is going to sit on Hallelujah my body that will be built by the prophets will be set on faith love Grace and Perfection that is so good I will build it back my self Hallelujah he didn't throw in the towel he didn't give up he kept working he kept working what was it it's the heart of a winner it was the very Heart Of God which is Christ it was Christ that inspired the prophets when they were ready to give up when like Elijah I'm the only one that's left they won't even hear me I'm no better than my prophets of my father's Lord take me away but it was God who came and ministered to him you've got more to do your time is not up I've sent you to anoint Elisha you're to anoint this anoint that and that had to come into Elisha men God allowed the humanity of men to be on display to where they were ready to say just take me on home why that the heart of a winner could be displayed oh God lord wonder how many times his heart has been on display for me for you for usall would it been in our our breaking point at the heart of a winner oh thank you Lord notice giving you a part for your fall and lost brother and sister giving you his spirit and his love oh it's not your spirit it's not your love it's his he given to you to go hunt the lost as he did in the Garden of Eden Adam Adam Where Art Thou that's what the Holy Spirit does to a man or woman when it strikes into their heart and takes its abod there's a thirst and a hungering for lost souls brother Bram says that's what's the matter with the meetings today there's not enough Spirit touch in it to go for the souls of the lost and dying it's more to make a name a church a building a denomination instead of a soul-winning program oh how pitiful we could stay on it much he said so we want to do something for him now you know God's not calling us the work of redemption in our life remember brother Rand would picked this up when he would preach invisible Union the bride of Christ and he would he would pick this up and deal with this Union that is to be between Christ and the bride he would admonish the people of God there he said we're trying to lead you to deeper thoughts and higher objectives than just coming to church and and just being here but he he's pointing it that there's a there's a deepness that God is calling for and and an invisible Union with God to think about it that God himself has so supplied the way to take care of our first nature so that we might be free and clear to be able to be United to him that is so good and you know you might look at your life and say well I you know in your memory in your memory well I did this and I did this and and this when I was in the world and I I was in the world remember the Lord Jesus himself being the great high priest must follow the principles of his own word that a priest must marry a virgin is that right so then this is where the mystery of the new birth comes in that mystery of where rever Romans 7 where that Christ himself comes to place to be able to deal a death blow not just divorcement to that old nature but absolutely where it is dead and that seed that part on the inside that was laid that he raises that soul that Soul into a newness of life to where it's like Rahab remember remember Rahab you cannot be married to salmone right come on but God showing the power of the blood that would come through the word of God to where he would be asked are there any that can withstand this Union between this man and woman are there any witnesses that say this shall not proceed any further you know what had happened there was no witnesses that could raise their tongue against RAB Hallelujah you know what happened the word of God the blood of Jesus Christ it didn't just silence the witnesses it did a way with them it did away with them and yet Satan would like to torment you in your mind and remember but I want you to remind him that was not me I have repented for allowing that old nature to rule over my life but that's not me my desire has been changed my life has been changed the only thing I desire is to please [Applause] him and like a husband and a wife that are united together we grow more and more and more in a union hallah Hallelujah Lord don't you love the Lord that is so good now this is let me get back to my point this is where brother Bram will take that invisible union he said the church in its present condition is in no position to finish up the Great Commission they were in no position it would take God coming down and leading his children back to a place of Jubilee amen back to to their inheritance back to a place to where you know God in a personal way amen and you've met the requirement it ain't a long list the Bible says repent be baptized in the name of of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you don't have to beg for it you're not a beggar you're not a popper you're not well I don't deserve it it ain't about what you and I deserve if we got what we deserve we'd get hell but it's a gift of God hallelujah there's been times for birthdays and Christmases I've got Gifts of when a lot of times it's coffee cards and things like that I I love them I take but I didn't do one thing I never told him buy me a coffee cart get me this much or do this it's a gift you know what I don't sit there and struggle with them I don't do I don't pull on fake humility I just say thank you it's going to help me on a trip it'll help me it might just be on the trip to the office one day but it's going to help me you just accept it don't wrestle with it don't wrestle with it you let it just say God I accept what you've done for me I accept it right here tonight on a Thursday night you are still the I am an almighty God that has dealt with our life over and over it's the heart of a winner he isn't quit on you he never quit on you he still calls to our life even when you and I were backslid and ran away from him but he never let us go Hall what is that the heart of a winner hall Hall [Music] thank you Jesus thank you Lord this is why doing something for him watch out brother Brown just puts this so simple do something for him brother Brown says see he's talking about that little woman who well let me go back here so you don't read it brother Bram talking about that remember I was remember I was preaching on that on Dwight Moody and I said I don't know how many people were in attendance I thought I had read a quote somewhere sometime well it's in the Lamb's Book of Life brother Bram tells us that little woman who cleaned out that horse doll picked up all that manure and everything else guess how many people were in attendance her and The Preacher Brother BR said her and the preacher and she had had rented that barn and she had the preacher come in and about has they got into that brother B you know he's pulling out there from history as you get into it he said here came a little shaggy-haired boy walking in that night Hallelujah God knew where the white Moody was at and then think about he took the white Moody now you remember the writing where you had different ones coming to watch DWI and Moody preach and they said I don't know who in the world would go hear him preach that guy his grammar and everything else is so terrible my Lord he's just terrible and and D white Moody said it like this he said look I'm winning Souls with my poor grammar what are you doing with your degree it was winning Souls it wasn't about I mean Dwight Moody was not a great it wasn't like he was a great order let me just tell you something Dwight Moody didn't even preach Divine Healing but he preached salvation and what he knew and the prophet said healings took place right in the meetings because he preached the word that he knew had had been commissioned to glory be to God in the highest Hallelujah you know what that says to you and I just do what God has entrusted you to do he'll take care of all the rest Hallelujah do something for him brother BR says he said sometime like that little woman you don't even know what you're doing but speak a little word for Jesus testify sing or pray and like bread upon the Water it'll return someday right just remember don't fail don't fail to win some Souls whatever you do win souls from that time the little things that we do look at this invite someone to the meeting right isn't that scriptural right isn't isn't that what what Philip went to Nathaniel hey hey come and see come and see well brother Samuel I'm afraid if they get here they won't like it but at least you've done your part right and they can make their own decision is so good and how do you know they might make a decision based on what they've been taught when they might come the first service or the second service and you think oh something goes through your mind they'll never be back I'm going to tell you if they belong to God that's right what they may they may not remember the words but they'll remember his presence yeah that's right that's why we want to make sure with every part in our life the heart of a winner we want to be temper and everything God I want to keep things CL leaned out of my life grudges and everything else the heart of a winner why that Souls might be saved that the Miracles might take place that lives would be changed that's the heart of a winner yes it is notice invite someone into the meeting speak a little word for Jesus testify sing or pray so it it don't matter wherever you fall at within there right that's that's the part of it the heart of a winner sometimes because brother BR deals with this he said sometimes we feel like that if we're not some big person that we can you know we're just insufficient he said I believe it's written in the scriptures it's not the big things we do it's the little things we leave undone but Jes Jesus knows every little thing yes he does that you do I told you before I'm looking forward to we get the other side we'll know who that little sister was we don't even know her name I I don't know her name but but but but she did what God called her to do bless God I want you let me just try to bring this to a certain place here tonight notice in the scriptures Proverbs 11:30 the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life just keeps moving wow and he that winth Souls is wise this is how it says it in the amplifi the fruit of the uncompromisingly righteous is a tree of life and he who is wives wise captures human lives for God as a fisher of men he gathers and receives them for eternity I want in something that the Lord Jesus came along and one of the things he told the disciples when he saw him out there fishing he said come follow me and I will make you Fishers of Men notice I will make you you might have been taught this trade how to fish and all those things out there but I will make you Fishers of Men amen and that would come when the life of God would come on the inside of them it moved down in their lives Now watch how this worked now they begin to cast their Nets remember they were working right there within Jerusalem and finally God had to allow a persecution to come about that would cause them to to disperse not Divide from one another not go away and say I tell you I don't I don't believe the way he was doing I no no no they they would they would have stayed together in a communal way if I can say it like this they might have been living in the same apartment building that's right they might have been living in the same Hotel complex they weren't but you understand what I'm saying but God God they were comfortable where they were but God knew this gospel has got to get dispersed how do you think when you read First Peter chapter 1 when Peter could write to the elect that are in capadia to the elect that are here and here and here how did it happen because it was spread and God took a trial a deep persecution and what Satan thought he was going to Stamp Out the only thing it did was caused it to spread that's the same thing that took place on Calvary when he thought he had him he thought I've got him now but then when he got down there he said I thought I had you when I got Abel I thought I had you when I got Isaiah I thought I had you when I got Ezekiel but I want to tell you after the Lord Jesus Christ went to the lowest part of hell and deposited our sins as the scapegoat he came moving right back up through hell as a Victorious Champion he went wrenched over and he took the keys off of Satan's side Satan don't even have a key to his own house if you can see that tonight he doesn't have any authority over your life Jesus said all power in Heaven and Earth is given into my hands and he sent back the Holy Ghost he placed that that victory in the hands of the believer hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah here that dispersing he that coming on up and the depositing of that life oh Satan thought he had it but here it spread oh Lord have mercy it got loose then on the day of Pentecost when that life came down brother Bram tells us when they were filled with the Holy Ghost beginning a beginning and ending of Gentile dispensation brother Bram says Satan didn't even get out of his bed that morning when they were filled with the Holy Ghost see we would think oh Lord have mercy Satan he no no brother B said he didn't get out his bed but when they came to the gate called Beautiful brother BR said that's where Satan got upset that's why the prophet said you watch any any any move of Divine Healing he said it'll bring out the Rogue hounds of hell oh yeah they got after him why you were they recognized here was a man that has sat here all these years and begged year after year after year after year after year but now by the faith of Jesus Christ this man that has been in this condition all of his life he was born this way but the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ moving through ignorant unlearned men that was sensitive enough to yield to God and to look at a situation and say Silver and Gold Have i n but such as I have glory be to God such as you have such as what God has deposited in your life I'm telling you it's more than enough little widow woman it's more than enough Lord when the little wiow woman in the time of Elisha they were come to credit her come to take her sons she didn't real realiz what she had in her house was going to be her Deliverance are you with me it took a prophet a need arose and a prophet came and pointed out you've already got the answer you just need to empty up Hallelujah go borrow empty vessels how many you say Lord I'm ready to empty every every channel of my life the answer that I need the answer for life's problems the answer for every situation that's why the prophet said healing is within [Applause] you they would cast The Net as Fishers of Men remember Jer Jesus said the kingdom of heaven was like a great net right when you're casting a net when Peter and them they understood that they had they they wanted fish but sometimes when they casted a net they may got a serpent in there they may got a spider in there they may got all kinds of things but you know what you don't you don't stop fishing because there's serpents are you hearing me the prophet said the net never changed one thing the net only brought in the fish that were already fish if it was a serpent it came in under the influence of the meeting but you give it time it'll crawl back out you don't got to run it out it'll crawl out right right now just go ahead and put the devil off your shoulder you say Brother Sam you know how many times I felt like giving up but you couldn't but you couldn't there's many times you got disappointed in yourself but you couldn't give up cuz you want to know why you can't stop something you didn't start put that right back in the devil's Noggin I didn't start this work this desire in my heart for almighty God hallelujah oh there's times we may entertain all kinds of doubt and different things but there is a heart of a winner let me just say this to you what was once in God's mind he has placed this in the heart of the believer Hallelujah and look how our heavenly father conducted himself amen through all sorts of obstacles being misunderstood ridiculed spit on mocked but what was it it was the heart of a winner you love him oh my oh glory be to God it's our it's his life moving in us it's his heart yeah it's the heart of winning let me leave you with this with this quote the heart of winning let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus yeah who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man as if that wasn't enough he humbled himself himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross imagine whatever would be shirt whatever dress whatever it is that you would have that would be the most maybe humiliating in terms of maybe it's something you you wouldn't even feel like that would be worthy to wear at a church or whatever more it might be something you'd work in around the house or whatever more but here you would would so Adorn yourself in that way and You' say I'm not going to wear that to church I won't tell you there's actually a quote where brother bam actually would have a certain night where they would call Humble night and he would tell them wear your work Clos to church tonight cuz I'm going to preach in my overhauls he said we're calling it humble night that's an actual quote you know so I I've got a quote for it but I don't mean I'm going to wear overhauls but you know I mean you you got to get what I'm saying my point was is this as if it wasn't enough that he took upon our Humanity that he became one of us but then even he went lower he became a footwash flunky but he went even lower he humbled himself to the death of the Cross right what was once a type where we hear this man this cry coming up the hill and it's Abel leading his sacrifice that's been revealed to him what was once a type now here's the anot type the perfect Lamb of God going up the hill right and there as he's on the cross Cries Out speaking in tongues think about this character let me leave this here with you when you think of that that scripture I want you to think brother BR says there was no beauty that we should desire him he was marred above every man that's Isaiah 52 he was probably a little skinny spiny looking fellow he didn't look like the king many times people will judge people by the way they dress or by their stature but man's not judged by how big he is and how strong his muscles but man's judged by character and character alone I've seen men that weighed 200 lb and didn't have an ounce of man in them man is judged by character what he is in his heart and Christ was not judged by physical strength but he was judged by character and never a man ever Liv like him or never a man could ever die like him never a man could Ascend up on high like him because he was God I am no man he made of himself no reputation he said did you ever think the man that made an artificial eye made a reputation the man that made false teeth made a reputation the man that made a wooden arm made a reputation for himself but the man who made the original eye the man who made the original arm made of himself no reputation but become a servant a bondsman unto men who were Sinners that he might win them back what wasn't it just a given that our names were on the Lamb's Book of Life our names were on the Lamb's Book of Life but the scripture tells us I have come the son of man has come to seek and save that which was lost the heart of a winner right aren't you thankful sure aren't you thankful for that life amen to think about how that God would have us to move and apply this in our own lives through so many different things there's so many things and so many points and places within life this is just one of them on winning others to the Lord we're not trying to like the prophet said in Christ The Mystery of God revealed when he said he said some people think that we convert people to Christianity by its laws we don't do that the way a full conversion is is by the new birth that's right and you know what I can't give that to nobody the life is here in the body right the life is in the body the life will travel through the body right but do you realize that's between God and the individual that's between and so it it really it brings it down to where we ended last week it's not our responsibility to open anybody's eyes you know what that should do it ought to just take the pressure off and just say Lord whatever you want me to drop you don't have to drop a whole cargo load at one time just drop a little bit so you don't have to go and drop a whole thing and hey I'm going to drop maybe God ain't having you drop something like that right now maybe God is just having you drop a song True a testimony maybe God's maybe God's having you to drop a prayer and say Hey you mind if I pray with you maybe they've got a need they're expressing right well brother Samuel they're sitting there in short hair I don't care if they're sitting there in short hair and got on short britches they are a human being that Christ died for you and I were in worse shape than many of them God help us not to get so up here and to realize we're missing the Mark if he would have stayed up there that would not have been the heart of a winner but the heart of a winner came right down to where I was and I am so glad I am so glad brother Aaron he comes right where I'm at right now tonight I'm glad the heart of a winner don't look over and say I've dealt with you on this before I've worked with you on how many times have I dealt with you on this I've sent Minister after Minister I've ran quote aren't you glad that a heart of a winner is temperate in all things so much so that he will not even entertain our passing of things oh that was just brother so and so oh that was just so and so who sent me that text or that aren't you glad that the heart of a winner amen is temperent hallelujah in all things cuz remember the prophet tells us God would not ask you and I to do something that he himself would not be willing to do and I'll tell you this right here for me I'll just speak for me he's temperate in a lot of things I couldn't even list him I couldn't even list him but you know what this is where the love of God comes in am it's so great don't you love him tonight amen don't you just appreciate his Mercy yeah oh my let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer I feel like brother Braham did in that the blushing Prophet I I just be honest with you church I sat back there tonight and I've had these things in front of me for H for weeks some of them for months and things and then how the Lord just kind of BR moves things together I always wait for him to for the final touches however he wants to put it together but I'll tell you I just sat back there and all I could do is weep say Goden be merciful help me Lord forgive me Lord for my failures help me Lord help me let's just go to him in prayer father Lord Jesus Remember Me Lord amen anybody else want to be remembered in prayer Lord God we love you father Lord how that you so sweetly have come by your presence through your word [Music] tonight Lord sometimes we don't mean to sometimes Lord with certain things we can get complacent sometimes we can get weary sometimes Lord we can feel insufficient sometimes Lord we can get caught up and looking at failures and mistakes and we get to entertaining doubt and other things but I'm Lord I just want to say this I'm so glad I'm part of the body of Jesus Christ oh God I'm so thankful Lord that as we come here there's been times Lord where I've been down but but Lord God as your presence has moved there's been others that came as priests and they begin to worship Lord God is even in my heart I would be pressing pressing Beyond but Lord they would begin to worship worshiping the beauty of your Holiness songs of Zion would begin to Be Sung and then Lord things would begin to just start breaking there would be a strength that would just move in Lord father I've witnessed it Lord just while I've been ministering the word it's not a one-way current no it's true that the pillar of fire it flows right here Lord from the front but Lord God it moves through the body your Prophet told us like this when he spoke to that congregation he said I I can see it as the words going forth I begin to see the glow come across your life and he said as that glow comes across your life as you're receiving that word he said then it comes back to me he said and I begin to feed and I begin to take from that oh God you come Lord to minister to all of our needs yeah Lord my heart has been challenged our hearts have been challenged Lord yes sir when we can look and see the heart of a winner Hallelujah to know like your Prophet told us in Christ the mystery what was once in God's mind that great secret he has now placed it in the heart of the believer oh lord it's the secret the secret that moves in our life that reality that it keeps moving Lord even as you're unfolding in to us in our lives through us we recognize ourselves Sons and Daughters of God Lord I Thank here the other day as I was talking just fellowshipping with brother Homer Lord he called me on the phone and we're fellowshipping there L Lord the other night here and begin to talk about that quote of how that a son of God's like an eagle that can go a long time before it wreck recognizes it's a Son of God we begin to Fellowship upon that and I said you realize those are things like that that even after the New Birth has come that that realization is what really begins to move in our life and it only becomes deeper Lord we don't start out as perfect people like we're looking at this stature of a perfect man we grow we grow up as the Bible says into you in all things now Lord like your Prophet I read at the beginning where he said he had his hands up and said Lord I pledge with this congregation not to cease until I see these virtues flowing in my life as they should that I can be a living manifestation of Christ Lord when I look at that here is standing and 1962 think of the display but it just goes to show us Lord father the bait that was on the hook with Divine Healing your Prophet would tell us there in one in a million in many places there was a message that was to follow Lord here we stand as the Bride of Jesus Christ and when the seals are open your Prophet told us it's a loosening of a Ministry I read realize Lord many times it's only read down Revelations 10 and it stops at Revelations 10:7 but that's not where you [Music] stopped right after verse 7 it's verse 8 that thou go unto the angel whose foot is on the land and the Sea go and take the little book that is open in his hand and eat it it will be sweet in your mouth oh how wonderful how precious but in your belly when it comes time to digest it to live it it'll be bitter there'll be all kinds of turning because it will not agree with what our character has been but Lord the word is Victorious and I pray father God as we lord just continue to take in of that word and Lord work in my life Lord dear God as that word gets down in my life and oh that that bitter that oh that churning that's in there it's the word that is working to cast out all unbelief it's the word that is working to dismantle every hold every hindrance every complex every bruise glory be to God the word is working Lord Jesus it's a power of transformation for thou must prophesy again before many kings peoples Nations and tongues God help [Music] us I realize Lord that you didn't call us all to be preachers but we are what you have ordained for us to be there's no big eyes and little use sometimes Lord we can think of who's on the platform or who's singing the special or or who song leading or whatever more but really Lord God those are only Parts every part is just as vital help us Lord to see that help us to really see it Lord Lord the god there's there's men of God that I I look at Lord Jesus my Lord God how they can Minister and preach I'm so thankful to be a part of the body I'm so glad to be Associated Lord God men that Lord You've used and used in such a wonderful way I'm just glad to be a part I'm just glad to be a part Lord I'm so thankful Lord for what you've done help us Lord help us for your Prophet takes us in Revelations 4 and says out of that Throne preceded thunders of lightnings he said oh how we need thousands of voices in Jeffersonville to thunder out Purity holiness undefiled this separated to the word he said that's Thunder against the devil help us [Music] Lord help us Lord to win souls for [Music] you Lord there's always a part within it there's a cost we've got to see a little bit of that starting into it tonight Lord there was a cost it cost you your only begotten son but I think of it as your Prophet would say it over and over again he would say to think if I had a little vial filled with just a few drops of the literal blood of the Lord Jesus he said to think how precious that would be I would hold it up to my bosom but he said to realize I have something greater in front of me tonight night than his blood because he was willing to shed his blood for you for me oh Lord Jesus I pray tonight Lord help us help us to be sensitive Lord when we walk in the grocery store right help us to be sensitive when we're standing at the meat counter or wherever we go Lord God help us to be sensitive I'm asking you at help help us to be sensitive even Lord among one another as We Gather here Lord God together as a body help us to be sensitive to the leading of the Holy Spirit Lord when you lay upon our heart to call this one or text this one may we not put it off Lord may we not just say well that was my mind maybe this is my thought maybe that's my impression no I don't believe there's anything like that Lord God that'll go to waste I don't believe anything like that Lord God that it's just me I believe Lord when you drop that on our hearts same way Lord when you've dropped loved ones on our hearts different ones Lord God I pray father help us may the heart of the great winner himself that has brought that Victory into our life and Lord I pray tonight if there's one that's not received that I pray that God even while the word has gone forth that they've received it may they Lord God just that that part where it's just settled tonight where Lord God the Holy Spirit has moved into that depth of their life Lord and Lord God when they would walk glory be to God when they would walk out of here tonight Lord God they would begin to witness even the desires of the world fleeing from their life things that once they held
