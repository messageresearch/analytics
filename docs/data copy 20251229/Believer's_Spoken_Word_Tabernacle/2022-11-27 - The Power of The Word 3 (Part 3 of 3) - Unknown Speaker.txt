========================================

things he fell down to worship the Angel and the angel said see thou do not for I am of thy fellow servants the prophets you know what he was saying do not miss your visitation for the message is not about me the message is about him it's about him tabernacling inside of you that's the Revelation given to John signified sentence signified by the hand of the end the angel is the messenger are you with me that angel messenger who would give John a tour of the Book of Revelation what is that that's in time ministry are you with me that's the end time ministry it's the time in the hour the seals have been taken off the book it is Christ revealing himself what is he doing just as he walked on the road to Emmaus showing himself in every shadow and type it's the same almighty God walking in the midst of his church he is showing himself in every type showing you and me I am Esther I am Rebecca I am Ruth I am sir all of these things amen right oh my in their record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and all the things that he saw so you realize that Revelation is the need of the hour not just knowledge not theology we need divine revelation because we realize brother Brown would emphasize this in the in the closing messages in 1965 he would talk about Abraham he said out the hell that Abraham did not even have a bible to read from he said he he only had it by Revelation and that's the real thing and I have heard but now I see he says now job being a prophet had access to God's grace he didn't have a Bible because the Bible wasn't wrote them we know it was in the heavens right but but he had access to God by Revelation and by vision and the message of rapture he says Cain and Abel didn't have a bible to read but it was revealed to Abel by faith which is a revelation so you know what that puts it down to you and I it is not how good of a reader that you are it's not our ability to read and pronounce words it is the ability to receive from almighty God it's divine revelation that's dropping down you know what Revelation is brother Brandon said one of the words being preached he said something will start to drop out of another realm and it begins he said to come down come down and he said where you were sitting maybe with a frown or or discourage he said that Revelation falls into your heart he said now your muscles seemed to tighten he said in your frown goes through a smile he said what's happening it is a revelation that's coming down from an unseen realm and it's trapping into your life what is it you are being influenced just as Isaiah was in the temple and he said I saw the Lord lifted up and his train filled the temple don't you realize that's why we need him to come in every service we need to step back and though my problems my needs it seems so great but let me see the Lord high and lifted up [Applause] and his train filling the temple drone guards that are watching over the word [Applause] oh glory be to God in the highest that's why revelation Revelation brother Brown would say it like this Revelation carries us Beyond in the beginning because as he goes on to say so theologians can take the word here and the word here in the beginning he said and they can work with the word but Revelation takes us back into the thoughts and if you get back into the thought oh help me preacher now you're back into the person the Mind who spoke it and if you're back into mind and receiving the thought of him that spoketh then he that spoke it will bring forth what he said and whatever he brings forth will declare the source that it come from oh Hallelujah so now notice so this is why brother Graham could say it like this every word in the Bible is God's thoughts laying in seed form if received into the human being and spoke by the same thought that materialize the Bible it'll bring the thing to pass you realize this is why even why you don't even wait for the end of the service when the word is coming right here the Bible brother man tells us when the Holy Spirit is here to inspire you confess what he is saying and God will bring your body into subjection right you're under that inspiration Hallelujah because what's happening you are receiving it from the same Source by that spoke but that same thought and it's materialize the Bible so what are you saying how many times you heard what brother Brown's saying you know what he said I'm going to pray a prayer and I want you to repeat the words after me I haven't heard that multiple times you know that it's powerful you know what it is God here was it would be the words that would be coming across and you might say well not everybody's going to believe that I am going to stand here and say that everybody that is ordained to believe it is going to believe it stop focusing on the negative and focus on the positive are you hearing me now there are lives that no doubt that took that and it was more than reciting words you know what it was it was those who could not help themselves but God rich in Mercy was coming by their way and God was giving them the words to say that he indeed is the high priest of that confession and they acted upon that don't you understand that's what's happening in these Services it is God speaking to you and I that we might say the same thing that he is saying amen granted Lord Jesus brother Sammy I don't want to be a repeater I do I do I'm not looking for new thoughts I just want to speak his thoughts his thoughts when they're spoke that same inspiration has defeated Devils down through time his thoughts have changed lives down through time are you hearing me it was his thoughts being unfolded about the woman at the well remember she had been oh I love how brother Wayne was led by the spirit of God it just comes to me right now when he made that statement man I felt like running around this parking lot and around this whole thing around my dear thing I just felt like going when he spoke about that woman at the well she had never received another kid never received a thought any higher than being a prostitute but here came the Lord Jesus and what was he doing he was bringing a thought of who she really was you're not a prostitute you're not a daughter of sin but you're a daughter of Abraham what was the word doing giving her a higher thought oh brother Samuel you just really need to pee preach where the people at are you a referee or something maybe I need to ask you what to preach [Music] but you see this is why the word comes what do what did he say to John in Revelations 4 come up hither are you in miss me it takes the word to raise you and I in position it's not interested coming down here let me get you fixed up I want to take you up there but let me get you fixed up no no God says I bring you up here and the whole process is a transformation the problem is we're trying to change people down here you can't change them down here they've got to be affected by another Realm that's what the message is it's not Reformation it's in the fact of the revelation of Jesus Christ that comes from another Realm that's it this is why Jesus could say in a little while the light is with you walk in the light while you've got it walk in it lest Darkness come on you now I'm just going to say this is why when lies begin to drift away start getting cold on God and you drift away I'm not here putting anybody down I'm here to I mean I want to dispel that Darkness you know Darkness itself I I can sit out there setting my living room and down there in the darkness and you know that light starts coming up little by little by little same way in the evening time that Darkness starts coming on little by little before you know you're like wow it's dark when we're Delight go right it just comes on just like that but that's why why is light come that we would walk in it the word walk Enoch walked with God he walked with God to walk means let the word have preeminence let it regulate and direct every facet of our life now notice this lest Darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness North and on whether he goes see this is what light does light it comes to let you know the pathway that you're on that's what the light as you're walking in the light what does it do your feet become more established it becomes more sure and as the things are becoming more sure what is it it's Sons and Daughters of God manifesting under the rest of God Who You Are see the light comes to bring rest that's what the preaching of the word does it comes to relieve your struggle and bring rest oh Jesus while you have light believe in the light why you've got to believe in it remember they rejoiced in John's light but they didn't walk in it believe in the light that ye may be Children of the life so you told me to walk in it we're to believe it that we might be Children of the light so the light has come to bring forth children then what would the children be they would be light right if we're Children of the light then our life is like what is light light is the word interpreted are you with me now oh my thing you have notice how Peter would write of this you're being seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth of the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently notice the scripture being born again not of corruptable seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever let me just read this out of the Amplified you have been regenerated which is born again not from a mortal origin but from one that is Immortal by the ever-living and Lasting word of God so we're not our origin is not of this Earth that our new birth is not of an Earthly origin let us make a tabernacle to Moses let us make a thing no our our birth is of a Heavenly origin Jesus said I'm calm in my father's name right he came to bear witness of that life so the life was made manifest which identified the name of the father is that right the Lord Jesus Christ it was God come down in Redemption because what does the son do a son Bears the life of his father right all that the father has all the inheritance all of that the son has that and he came to redeem you and I that now that same life could come back up on you and I now we are joint heirs [Applause] all that God is he poured into Christ all that Christ was he hath poured into the church changing the form but the same God now notice with Moses here can I have just a few more moments I know I ask you for that a lot but God revealed to Moses what to do remember when Moses was down in Egypt and he did not know what to do God had met him at the burning bush he went with that Authority but he didn't know what to do but God already let him know I'm going to execute judgment against all the gods of Egypt and so we understand every plague that was coming around the things that was was spoken in that hour God thought it Moses spoke it and it happened is that right now remember everything in order to execute judgment against every God it was going to take a higher thought are you with me to bring down them gods and to execute judgment against it it would take a greater thought than that of man's thinking because those gods were the products of man's thinking their imagination right that's what they were the product of that but here God's thoughts coming down and coming into a man and that vessel being surrendered what was what was Moses speaking not his own thoughts he was speaking God's thoughts and when he spoke God's thoughts it happened let me just try to bring this down I realize I there's just too much here before me he spoke it and it happened so this is where brother Branham is coming into this place right here and he's talking about how the word brings such joy and it stimulates us he said we get over flooded this out of the forest seal and brother Bram will say now he says you know he goes on to things but I he said I know there's a lot of fanaticism in people carrying on and all those things like that but watch how brother Brown goes through all this brother Brian when I watch how brother Brown goes through all this brother Brown don't just take and just go off on a tangent on things sure there's going to be fanaticism there's fanaticism on either side but I'm not here to preach on fanaticism you know why God will sort it all out are you hearing me you want your brother's birthday what are you saying I'm saying we got too many refs in the house of God got too many refs in the hot you know what trade your referee sued in for a suit and tie and put away the black and white stripes In the Flesh in the spirit just put your wrath away let's say now how can you say that I'll tell you how I can say it because the prophet would preach the message respects then he comes around to question and answers in 59 and he says I've seen people in the flesh but I won't say nothing against it are you hearing me that's why that's why it's dangerous well I'm not glad I said I'm not gonna let God sort it all out I can only be to God I just love that just let God do it let's just let go and let you know we talk about let go and let God have a way I mean it let go and let God have his way remember the Samuel somebody might be in the flesh might be but there's some that ain't glory be to God sorry if that's what you thought you'd come to church for wrong thinking we don't need rest we need participators we don't need head coaches and assistants coaches we just need some participators winning lives to get into the spirit of almighty God now hear me now you may not jump you may not shout you may not run I don't think any less than that I preached in congregations that my I mean they're not you know maybe as loud or whatever more or you know or are expressive in their worship but I felt the pool just the same are you hearing me they ain't no more spiritual they ain't no less spiritual right but Sammy what are you saying I'm saying a mount Transfiguration experience is not a highlighting of our ideas and people if they're going to worship they're going to come according to my idea nope we just want to see Jesus if we really get together oh don't you love him oh brother bam said he's now watch right after this statement on that if an answer and he said now you watch you start bringing the word now that's the thing that actually brings life is the word and that brings the joy of stimulation of new wine and that's what it was on Pentecost when the word was Vindicated now notice it wasn't just if they had they had a sensation there's no doubt about it they maybe they did have a sensation maybe they did feel I I don't know maybe maybe they did but here's what it was that was going on the word was Vindicated to them now the resurrected word had already come and gathered them right the resurrected word had already gathered them and brought them into a little room and began to breathe upon them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost showing that they would be born by the Breath of God and God was identifying this is what's going to come I am going to come and vindicate my word oh my oh and he Vindicated Joel 2 28 he Vindicated act Isaiah 28 19. now notice he says the first thing you know he says what happened they were up there and you know maybe he said somebody said well I believe we waited long enough let's just accept it by Faith remember always go through that right I mean I believe we let's just accept it by faith brother Graham said that's good Baptist Doctrine but it won't it didn't work with them brothers the new God's a god of reality let me just finish this so the first thing you know it had to become a reality they waited on their Ministry for the word to be Vindicated and when you come to seek the Holy Spirit you do the same yes now I want you to pay close attention here on this I know I'm at the end of a message and asking you that but this is really important you you can accept it by faith you can ex you have to accept Christ by faith that's exactly right and you accept the Holy Spirit by faith but then let the Holy Spirit come and give the circumcision as a witness that he has accepted your faith now notice what he said you accept it by faith well you say how do I accept it by faith and then and waiting on the circumcision in other words God to come and vindicate it because by faith it's revealed to you this is my promise the promise of the Holy Ghost belongs to me this is god making known his word to my heart in other words it is by faith that you are accepting it in that you are not someone who is unworthy but he hath made me Worthy so when you're coming to accept the Holy Ghost are you hearing me now you're not coming to accept it as a defeated person you'll never get anywhere you're not accepting it with well I don't know maybe he will give it to you you're not that's not that's God will not come and circumcise on that but when he comes and circumcised is the holy spirit when it's been accepted by faith it directs you into the promise that you say this is my promise and I am coming upon the righteousness of Jesus Christ I'm not coming upon my own merits I'm coming upon his merits I know that I have repented I have been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he's dealt with my heart in that way and I believe that the Holy Ghost is for me that's the difference I have to stand here and say this part as it comes that's the difference when brother Branham says and he'll deal with people that's on the prayer line he'll say now and one time he was dealing with just a person they weren't there but around the audience he said no you've been confessing you have the Holy Ghost but he goes into talking what he's dealing within is that they're confessing of it is that it's just as confessing I have the Holy Ghost and they're still living some other life and they're okay with that that's not the same as the word being revealed and you confessing the promise because you are confessing that which you are being drawn to yes sir are you hearing me now that's a big difference right there because there's somebody confessing and see what the word was coming to do was to let them know your confession is not matching up with your testimony right you got to get this fixed right so we're letting them know they got to get the confession right right don't you love the Lord oh how we love you Lord so notice but the ramen says it like this he says and it's a it's a witness he said now God gave Abraham Abraham believed God right but then God gave him a circle a sign of circumcision he said that's the same thing that we must do we must wait on the Holy Spirit till it's done something not necessarily because we spoke in tongues we've danced or got emotional shouted but until we were changed until something actually happened and he makes this statement I don't care what form it comes in just so it happens that's the main thing but then goes on to talk about in that same quote he said I've seen pins stand up and write things among witches that was exactly the truth things being called out that was exactly the truth he said but yet it was all false because all of that this is where Paul could say though I have faith to move all mountains though I understand all Mysteries thank you if I have not charity which is the love of God which is the Holy Ghost and nothing but a tingling symbol your life was not meant to be a life fool of absurd noises it's to have a clear certain distinct sound not a clinging together nautical but a certain sound that comes out of our life a certain sound Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I am his child his life something he's changed me completely watch this I am closing here I am let me just finish this thought here where the Brahman expresses that so he says he's speaking of all those things I just referred to he said so those things doesn't mean that you have the Holy Spirit but when he the person The Immortal Spirit of Christ becomes your personal savior and changes you and throws your views right straight into Calvary and to this word something has happened see it changes you and throws your view right straight into Calvary to this word something has happened see it changes you and it it and it throws your views so your views are right through Calvary your life is lived through Calvary your life is directed into the word amen the word comes and deals with your life being unto me Lord according to Thy word the word is changing us from Glory unto Glory what is it doing throwing our views into Calvary our ideas about things our thoughts that doesn't fade away just like that well I've been born again and all that Fades away as far as my ideas about certain things you know and I know there are things that the Holy Spirit has dismantled our views through Calvary there's things that we once used to think that if I don't do this or if I do this and we lived Victorious based on whether we did this or we didn't do that and what we want and what does it do the views by channeling everything into Calvary brings us back into the Simplicity of Jesus Christ what does it do it lets you and I realize that the real victory is a life that's in Jesus Christ our lives have been changed I didn't change myself you didn't change you he changed us and our views are in Calvary those are the decisions that we make Even in our life the decisions that we make remember when it says by faith Moses by faith Enoch by faith Noah what was it their views when the Revelation came it changed their views views yeah everything on Earth then they seen how does this fit or how does this place because the view of the Ark is more important than anything here and if I focus on this everything here will fall right in line right this is where Moses if I focus on that everything else will fall right in line see how the enemy wants to try to trick and trap and everything else and act as though that we need to get everything down here on this realm and I need to get this level all straightened out and I've got to no no seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things will be added unto you showing what you are a temple of the Holy Ghost that God would reveal his thoughts in and through your life and that's here this morning if that's not happened in your life don't just settle with I know the message I agree with the message I believe the message remember believing is not the seal is that right at least I'm preaching scripture Acts 19 this is the heart of the message you see God didn't send a message to bring condemnation he sent it to uncover Satan's traps Satan doesn't care how religious you are as long as you miss that life and I want you to understand you could know every doctrine of a message you could know all types you could know all things you could be gifted as gift it can be but if you miss that life you've missed what the message is all about because the message is get under the blood incredible search just type it in on your app that's the message hi that's the message and watch how brother Brandon takes that all the way through because that is that's the real message well brother Samuel I've received the message that has God confirmed in your life your faith why do I know he's confirm because you've been changed the Bible says sin will not have dominion over you well brother Sammy add just a little bit of this no no no no no no no let's say what the word says he will lead us into all truth let's let's say what the word says let's take a full Deliverance God's word in this hour and you understand that his presence right here right now you understand that he's not come he didn't come even to Peter he didn't even come to argue with Peter when Peter said let us build three times no no even he didn't wasted his he didn't waste any breaths with that he just overshadowed what was it out of that cloud came a voice and that voice said hear you him out of that cloud came The Voice give back to the word get back to the promised land get back into our land of promise that's what the Holy Spirit has come to do and it's the power of the word of God at work in our lives and it thinks our view into Calvary I I just say it in this manner oh God let let every part even though my views I I know that I know what God has done not only changed my nature but he's my he's everything to me he's everything he's the reason of things I can't say every decision that I've ever made no more than you can that every decision has been right on but I know one thing about it if there's decisions that I've made that's led me away from his presence I'm not comfortable and that's where I make I draw the line and there's things that God brings out in our life as we grow what is it it's our view it's on Calvary the Lord I want you I want more of you I want my views to be changed if there's things that I'm doing in a certain way I want them to be changed let me just tell you how important that is because it's God coming down changing your view about you yes it's God doing that and you're realizing that ain't me this way that I've directed this way or thought this way you realize hey wait a minute that's not who I am I'm of another tree I'm of that tree of life what are you doing right then you're letting the word come in preeminence and the word is having power and your life it's healing from the inside oh don't you love me I just say just encouraged every heart even here in this service and I say this even to you I had these things on my heart not knowing Lord do I go this direction do I go this way or do I go into another thought do I but early this morning he came and confirmed that [Applause] there's needs there's needs Reach Out and touch him Reach Out And Touch him let God confirm his word in our lives whatever the need physical healing spiritual healing let God come confirm his word but we want more we need more friends we need more than a letter we must have that life because when it's all said and done that's what's going in the Rapture is character and character is made by the life that's within us and that's what's most important is that it's God's thoughts that it dropped down become word and what has been spoken that we say this has happened we see it in our lives it's manifest what is it it's God it's God amen don't you love him amen oh God I I want I want I want him to be glorified I wanted to be glorified in my home I want him to be glorified and my life as a father as a husband as a pastor as a friend I want him to be glorified in my life not to draw attention to me I don't want that but the greatest privilege is that others might see him and they'll be influenced by him because I'm just I'm just a man you're just a man just a woman we realize that I don't want somebody to be influenced by me that if they start doing something like it ain't about that it's being influenced by him Let It Be influenced by him because that's something that's greater than a natural origin It's Supernatural Hallelujah asparagus Heavenly Father Lord you know Lord each of our needs and Lord even in moments Lord like this Lord I realize as we come to the end of a service God I pray that father for each need that's gathered here Lord Lord you have spoken Lord to our hearts there Lord It's Your Presence that comes Lord in our midst Lord to minister to our needs Lord my prayer is oh God for every need Lord that is gathered here Among Us Lord I pray that God that if there's one Lord that has not experienced that change Lord on the inside to where the things of this world have faded away have passed away and the views have become aligned with Calvary throwing our views straight into Calvary oh God granted Lord this morning I pray Heavenly Father May they not go one more moment without Lord submitting their life surrendering it Lord into your hands oh God lord it's more than knowing the word it's to know the author of the word seeing him move seeing him act in our midst it's declaring to us that he's still the same that he keeps every promise and that we ourselves can be a partaker of that same life in our lives Lord I asked this morning that God you would Grant a courage Lord grant o God of your mercies Lord as Lord we would present our bodies Our Lives surrendering into your hand sword that we would no longer be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of our mind Lord we're aware that conforming to this world we think back in the scriptures the Bible said Demas for soot Paul having loved this present world your Prophet would tell us Demas was a Spirit-filled man but it had never went down to the soul and your Prophet goes on to tell us he never went out to nightclubs and bars and things like that he just loved the world system the world way of going about things Lord the world the worldly system way is a way Lord of Deceit it's a way God did robs lies from the personal experience of Jesus Christ in the heart of the person Lord we don't want to be conformed to this world but we want to be transformed by the renewing of our mind Lord even throughout this building here this morning God we want our views if my view is not right I want my view to be changed Lord My Views Lord in in things Lord as it comes through your word I've watched you do it Lord and so I know that Lord what you've done and you've brought my attention to then I know Lord that this is my heart's desire let Lord My Views be under the influence of your views Let It Be Lord that it's that when your view or God comes and it exposes what is not your view then Lord I want to surrender to that Lord we want to surrender Lord to your views Lord I pray that God that you would help us Lord help us throughout this building throughout this local body here Lord help us God to reign over our own mortality Reign Over Our Own thoughts Lord help us the Lord I pray bringing every thought subject to the word Lord oh granted Lord not allowing sin Lord to reign in our mortal body not allowing thoughts and things to dwell but God to cast it out Lord I pray Heavenly Father Lord this is your word now we ask oh God as your children Lord that God you would come and fulfill your word Lord we know you will but we ask you Lord that you would fulfill your word vindicate Lord your promises we pray Grant it Lord I'm throughout this congregation Lord the listening those that are physically present those that are by way of Internet oh God may your Holy Spirit Lord may it come Lord in a very precious way Lord we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah if you'd like prayer this morning we'd be happy to pray with you Hallelujah but let's come if we come let's come believe in God we're not coming with a I hope it might happen but we come with a a faith that this is my promise he bore my shame no matter what what it is he's already paid the price by his stripes we are healed and I'm the Lord that healeth all thine diseases forgiveth all thine iniquities he's the same Lord Jesus walking right here Among Us and he wants to do for you what none other can do I'd say this morning Lord be glorified in your Tabernacle Lord be glorified Lord granted Lord let the word speak let the word have the final say let the word declare itself let him do it Hallelujah whatever the need is this morning God is greater as Isaiah said I saw the Lord high and lifted up and his train filled the temple moments ago when he dropped that as we were speaking let it be maybe you've come times and times before but let it be this moment the reason is I saw the Lord high and lifted up he's high above every sickness he's high above every sin he's above every demon of Oppression and depression he's the Lord of Glory and he cares about you he loves you and he wants to do for you Hallelujah let's just sing worship Him amen [Music] oh keep your mind stayed on me stayed on Me Faith
