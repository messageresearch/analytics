that god bless you tonight just appreciate your sacrifice come out on a midweek night I know how it is get off work and run over to church you know I did that myself tonight had to had to change in the back office there out of my work clothes by the way that reminds me thank you sister Hannah for letting me borrow the tie I forgot my tie tonight but somebody came through for me amen appreciated brother Brian hooking me up amen god bless you let's stand and turn in the word to the to the seventh chapter of the book of Matthew I hope you're all well tonight Matthew chapter 7 we'll just take the first five verses they're very familiar scripture reading and something about it just struck me a little while back in kind of an unusual way and got a little inspiration here so the Bible says judge not that you be not judged for with what judgment you judge you shall be judged and with what measure you mete it shall be measured to you again and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye but should consider us not the beam that is in thine own eye or how wilt thou say to thy brother let me pull out the mote out of thine eye and behold a beam is in I know and I thou hypocrite first cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye amen let's take Romans chapter 2 as well and the first four verses there Paul says therefore thou art inexcusable o man whosoever thou art that judges for wherein thou judgest another thou condemn açaí self for thou that judgest doest the same things but we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things and think us now this old man the judges then which do such things and do us the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of God or despises thou the riches of His goodness and forbearance and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of God lead at thee to repentance they make you say amen to the reading of the word tonight amen don't get nervous and then don't get nervous but I want to take something out of these out of this scripture reading that kind of struck my heart would just ask the Lord tonight for his leadership Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for another opportunity to come before this Living Word father and we ask that it would be a discerner tonight Lord of the thoughts and intents of our heart Lord and wherever we're at whatever we have nita father you know better than ourselves lord and so we want to commit ourselves to you Lord and and let nothing hinder tonight the preaching of your word father but may the speaker and the hearer like get out of the way father and yet aside from our humanity for a little while Lord and let the Holy Ghost just come on the scene I pray father take complete control Lord and speak to us the words of life that we have mean of Father and Lord if we're at fault I pray Lord that you would correct us Lord for your rear we are your children Lord if we need encouragement I pray you lift us up tonight Lord whatever it is Lord we commit ourselves to you asking Lord that you would come because you're seated tonight amen so we find this scripture here you know that and it's one that we all know I think everybody just about everybody in the world is familiar with this scripture it's one of the most quoted scriptures I think in the Bible judge not that you be not judged amen amen and it's something that's very fundamental to what we believe it's very simple you know that whatever judgment that we meet out to somebody else the Bible says that the same judgment should be pointed back on ourselves and and so and so I I want to read this not to bring you no real not trying to bring a real heavy hitting sermon tonight or some word of correction or something like that but but the thing about it that has inspired me and has caused me to to just look at my own heart the way that it the way that it hit me when I was studying the scripture and the Lord brought a little bit of our attention and their emphasis is on any other whole amen and this the faults or the sins of somebody else has no bearing on us amen but we are not to judge another but to take care of our own self amen amen and it's something that really just hits us right where the rubber meets the road right in our humanity amen right right and what it means to be a human being because we're always trying to cast to cast an eye somewhere else and we're always trying to look somewhere besides our own problems they man and and our own issues but the right approach to God is not relative to anybody else it's not in relation on the other human being and and it's not to think of ourselves more highly than we ought to think but we're to be as sober people amen and not to lift ourselves up against anybody else compare ourselves to anybody else amen find our security in our relation to somebody else or some church some pastor or some ministry or some family name but we're but the Bible says all have sinned amen and we've fallen short of the glory of God amen and so the Bible says judge not because we've all fallen short we are all sinful born in sin shaped in iniquity amen whether you were wherever you were born onto a barstool or into a church pew amen we're all before God even amen and and on a level playing field before God and so so what so this scripture is about the right approach it's about the right attitude before God amen amen but you know the thing about it is such a misuse scripture and I find and the way that I refer to it sometimes is is this is the sinners favorite scripture judge not that you be not judged that's that's the sinners favorite scripture isn't that right - somebody sent me a little funny something today a little humorous thing that they sent me and they didn't know that I had on my heart to preach this tonight so I kind of took it from the Lord but it it was it was if you put judge not into google translate the thing that people get out is you can't tell me nothing can't nobody tell me nothing amen can't nobody tell me different amen and that's the way that it's used but it's completely wrong brother sister it's completely opposite from what our Lord is telling us in a very simple scripture it's not this scripture is not shield my brother sister it's not something that we hide behind it's something that we use to deflect the blame and deflect God's attention it's not it's not at all something that we use as a defense hey you can't judge me judge not that you be not judged you can't tell me different but this scripture should be a sacrificial dagger amen not a shield but a dagger that every Christian would take hold of the Word of God and take it into our own humanity our own heart and say Lord if your word is going to cut me then cut me Lord and judge me and let me be judged by the word amen and washed by the water of the word so that I can be clean before God amen and we will never come to that place if we if we take the word of God and use it as a shield and begin to put our attention on somebody else in our emphasis on any other human being amen and so we can't look at anybody else but the Bible says we are to work out our own salvation with fear and with trembling amen before God and but you know that so many Christians are trying to hide behind this scripture or behind this this this this word of truth and and we hide behind a feeling of judgment from other people and I know this might be a little different tonight but I'm just following the way the Lord's inspired me tonight that you know we get to where we feel as Christians and just being human beings and honest with ourselves that we mean we sometimes we feel a little bit of judgment from somebody else or we feel that somebody's looking at us a little bit cross-eyed or a little bit different and you know it causes us to to gain all these complexes and all this this defensive nature and we begin to we begin to feel that way toward our brother toward our sister and what we do when we begin to let those complexes take control in our minds is is we cut off the ability for God to correct us a man or God because our because we're feeling that judgment for somebody else and using that as a shield or as a distraction amen until God can't speak to us sending to it amen and and and I know it's a little different tonight but I know that it's true amen I've seen it I've experienced that felt it brother sister as a human being that's the way that we are amen and and all of us you know it's a true statement that we all struggle with things and we all have our struggles and we all have our downfalls and so the correct way to be a Christian we know is not to worry about everybody else's problems but focus on our own problems you know but you know what begins to happen when you get a lot of people that are that are around each other and you get it you get a church and we get together on Sunday morning some people's struggles are a lot more visible than others as some people when they're struggling everybody knows amen and so it just causes those little social problems you know what I'm talking about those little that little bit of friction you know because this brother struggling with something but it's something real deep secret in his heart and nobody sees it but you know this sister struggling with a little bit of worldliness a little bit of immodesty or whatever it is or worldly fashion it begins to show on the outside and that's where we get the problem say man because this one you know because because then then what happens you know if you it when we struggle with those kind of things all of a sudden people start to just look at you a little different and and you start to pick up on a little reaction you know but but and and what the problem is the devil works on that he works on that to cause us to begin to to get all defensive even though we know that we're wrong amen even though we know that we're wrong and yet because somebody look at us a little bit different that we start to get our or get our dander up you know and and and we get all these little problems just because Christians are not mature enough ain't meant to take their attention off of somebody else and onto the Word of God and on to their own hearts Amen before God and and you know I believe that I really believe that Christian people and church-going people really believe this Bible and are really loving and gracious people amen but you know sometimes when you're struggle with something it's so visible you can't blame somebody for having a reaction now come on brother sister you know if I came up to this pulpit tonight and I was smoking a cigarette amen walking all the way up to the front of the church I believe you're Christian people you'd have grace for me you'd have mercy amen but but but you'd probably look at me a little bit different wouldn't you hey man hey man is that fair tonight Amen what I'm trying to what I'm trying to do is just it's just talk about where we're living as human beings and we begin to feel these feelings from one another we feel that little bit of judgment we feel that little bit of somebody somebody looking down on us a little bit and most of it's in our imagination a mint because most people are really loving and they want somebody to get help and they want somebody amen to have deliverance but you know we begin to take those sayings and we begin to use that as a shield and the devil will use that as a distraction amen and then a rebellious spirit will come on somebody that knows they're wrong and they will use somebody else's treatment of them as an excuse say man rather than get help from God rather sister we should not be so petty amen and we should not be so full of ourselves and self-importance to to let the devil deceive us that way amen and take things that we know to be wrong and then in Pride we'll hold on to them because of something that we imagine from somebody else amen amen and so but and it's it's just a lie of the devil and it's a poor excuse brother sister if even if somebody really is looking at you with judgment that is a poor excuse not to seek peace with God amen and not to come into rest with the word of God and amen and being a healthy and free amen and delivered state as a Christian amen it's a poor substitute a man sold so tonight I don't want you to let's not waste our time with a shooting match with somebody else and worried about what somebody else thinks about us they men let's work out our own salvation with fear and trembling before God and say God Here I am in church tonight on a Thursday night and Lord amen and here's the title of my sermon tonight Lord start with me start with me amen Lord not looking at anybody else anybody else's problems anybody else's what they think about me but Lord start with me I believe that's what this scripture Amen was given by our Lord to cause us amen to have the right attitude before God amen not of what somebody else thinks or somebody else's problems or what they're preaching over there or what that pastor said or this drama or that drama but Lord start right here Lord amen and if there's something that you have for me tonight Lord I want to receive it and don't let anybody get in my way don't let any insecurities or any complex or any lie of the devil or distraction come between me and my victory tonight amen because I want to be at peace with God I want to be free before the Lord amen absolutely oh my so many Christians are trying to hide behind that feeling of of judgment but you can't you're not supposed to use this scripture has a shield amen but we stand before God tonight as an individual every Christian every human being stands before God as an individual not as a church not as a family Amen not as not as a part of a movement that we call message believers but if you're standing in the presence of God tonight you stand there alone as a sole individual person amen brother bran said that God always works with an individual he said he doesn't save you because you're Methodists he doesn't save me because you're Baptist he doesn't save you because you're Pentecostal he doesn't say because he belonged to a mrs. Church Amen he doesn't fit and you are saved on that basis that you have accepted it amen so therefore for God to deal with you he doesn't deal with you in the order of the church but he deals with you as an individual amen so as long as we're messing around with church drama and church gossiping and a back and forth or feuding with this one or that one amen we will never meet God that way we will never enjoy the blessings of his present because he doesn't meet you on those grounds brother sister he does not accept you on the grounds because you dress like everybody else because you go to a good church because you come and sing the songs and pay your tithe but the weird God accepts you is under the grounds of an individual who has come to the altar of God alone Amen and put there and laid their life down at the altar amen it's a heart that says I don't care what anybody else does I don't care what anybody else says I don't care what anybody else thinks about me I want to meet God and I want a reality of a real experience with God amen he deals with you as an individual God doesn't accept you on the basis of association Amen so if you think that you're anything before God because of relativity to anybody else Amen because of how you compare yourself to any other human being you're an error brother sister he only sees you as an individual oh but see that's the kind of religion people want today Amen is a church religion where they can come on Sunday morning hello and let everybody else mind their own business and and they're not my pastor come down my way and and try to bring a word of correction he bet or not amen I want to be left alone I just want to be part of the group I don't want to be singled out I don't want to have to raise my hand I don't want to have to say Amen I just want to come to church and have somebody make me happy amen amen and that's the Laodicean spirit of today man oh I'm just as religious as everybody else I sing the songs I pay my ties I dress like the rest of them amen and better than so many men Amen well I hope my favorite preachers preaching tonight cuz he never gets loud and he never spits and slobbers and and he never steps on my toes but see that's the problem right there brother sister as we get to be such a great big somebody and then how could you know no wonder you get your toes stepped on you got those great big toes amen brother branham said that we're not supposed to be somebody but we're to be a nobody before God he said God doesn't use somebody's but he takes nobody's and he makes him as somebody's if they're able to make themselves nobody amen now if you're somebody tonight where the bram said God can use you amen but you've got to forget that you're somebody and become a nobody and then God can make that nobody is somebody hey man do you keep up with that that's a little bit of a tongue twister but but that's absolutely right brother is it's that self-important layout of seeing spirit what is that spirit brother man said it's people's rights you don't have a right to tell me different you don't have a right to correct me you don't have a right to preach on me amen oh my Amen that's the day that we're living in amen and it's simple tonight it's not some deep mystery but I think it's the reality of our human nature and the just the religious spirits that we're dealing with today and those are the worst ones amen all brother Brad said are you saying well let the preacher do it but he said this is an individual affair that's what people want let the preacher do it let the pastor do it Amen he didn't shake my hand last Sunday a man he didn't come he didn't come over when I was sick even though those the fourth time I've been sick this month Amen this is an individual affair brother Brad said it's with every one of us now the preacher might do it himself he might pray and get a soul blest amen but unless the congregation has stayed in the same way see unless the congregation see the preacher can study and pray and prepare his heart amen and meditate before God but brother have said unless the congregation has stayed the same way amen he said that that's what makes the difference but if the congregation is ready to meet the Holy Spirit amen did you come ready tonight amen if you come ready to meet the Holy Spirit then he said I'll tell you sinners will weep their way to cavalry he said if we could just take it as an individual you're just as responsible as any of these ministers God is going to hold you as an individual responsible amen when we get to that place brother sister we won't be able to pull we won't be able to point fingers at anybody we won't be able to we won't be able to blame it on that preacher that old that old pastor we used to we used to have that taught it wrong and taught us different or our daddy that didn't treat us right amen or that brother that hurt our feelings or that deacon that that stepped on our toes or whatever it is there will be no finger-pointing before God there will be no excuses amen amen but the only way to approach God is as on the basis of an individual amen that's absolutely right but the problem is we've got so many religious spirits in the world today amen it's a plague that's been sent on the churches of this day amen and we preached this before but but you know that that that pale horse rider of confusion and and people's rights and lukewarmness he's not riding against the Pentecostal would like nothing better than to get you and I amen come to Seoul completion till we come to church on Thursday night and sit there like a bump on a log Amen and we're too busy thinking about somebody else's problems or somebody else's attitude can we cannot receive something from God amen but I say start with me Lord amen don't look at anybody else but Lord start right here amen and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting absolutely Amen oh my people want a pastor or a priest or a prophet or anything to stand between them and God and do all the work and amen it's like a reverse Nicolaitans spirit people want somebody to take control and and and take all the all the power and do all the works and amen and do everything before God and we'll just show up amen but it was not so from the beginning Amen there and back in the Garden of Eden amen there was no pastors and priests and prophets and betweens and intercessors but what was it a men was a was God and man walking and talking lip to ear amen God and his children and today by a message we have been brought into an adoption time amen and the order of this day is not a church experience Amen it's not but it's not it's not putting a penser between you and God what it is you as an individual by the revelation of this word having a personal amen individual fellowship with God hallelujah what a privilege amen children to walk with Him and and a talk with him my wife just sent me a quote earlier today how brother branham said a man that will tote that will that will follow God and hold to God and walk with God God will walk with that man amen what a message that we've had what an opportunity today to press beyond a religious experience and press beyond a church association and walk in the presence of the Almighty as an individual as a son as a daughter amen that's what we must take advantage of amen that's what has offered us today amen to come into that holy place and speak lip to ear to our Lord hallelujah the order of this day is an Eden restoration where God speaks lip to ear lip to ear fellowship with his children amen for the tabernacle of God is with men and he shall be their God and they shall be his people Amen that's what we're coming to brother/sister is a reality Amen but see a church experience carries deception a religious affiliation carries deception it carries complacency and laziness say man because there's so many people around to look at so many people around to look at but brother this quickening power Amen has come to assure us in to the reality of the presence of Jesus Christ amen is so real brother sister what did brother Brown say about Philip when that quickening power came that rapturing power amen there's Philip in the middle of revival where crowds of people are being baptized and God's doing a great movement on the face of the earth but he experienced the quickening power it took Philip away from the revival away from the group out into the backside of the wilderness and that's where God could use him amen that's where God could speak to Philip he couldn't speak to him with the throngs of people with the crowds amen and he can't speak to you that way but he's got to he's got to catch you and quicken you buy that quickening power of the Holy Ghost and get you to a place where he can speak to you as an individual amen there's not enough there's not enough preachers in the fivefold ministry to do what the bride is called to do hey man hey man there's no prophet on the face of the earth to carry this word by himself but what we have is a many membered bride body who is called Amen to to stand as the Oracle of God and hear his voice in her ears and speak his word from her mouth amen absolutely I believe the brides ministry is not a collection of preachers but it's lived voices amen its church members that oppressed beyond the group and pressed into the presence of God amen with an individual reality of an experience amen you believe that tonight amen so the hour that we're living in is the hour of the manifestation of sons amen how many believe we're in an adoption time we're an adoption time at and that that that means that we're not to be full of judgment we're not to have this judgmental a spirit we're not to be the type of people who look down on somebody else have problems somebody else not at all amen for the Bible said love your enemies do good to them that hate you bless them that curse you and pray for them which use you and be there for merciful as your father is merciful do you catch that be there so there's there's adoption there's sonship being merciful as your father is merciful amen I tell you that's powerful to me amen so see mercy is an attribute of sonship mercy that merciful nature that net what was Christ like amen amen and and he was the firstborn among many brethren amen and if he was merciful then we are to be merciful that's why I believe the bride the message that we're carrying it's not a message of judgment it's not a message of no hope Amen I don't believe we should pray we should preach it in a way that cuts everybody down and and just wants to scorch the earth and blast everybody I believe in correction I believe in the truth of the word but I believe the end time evangelism is to build the bride and I believe that the bride has been given a message not of indictment but of Shalom Amen hallelujah amen brother Brown said that the bride's ministry is the same as his hey man that's absolutely right well what was his ministry they came to him and and they thought it was going to be like Elijah's preaching amen they thought he was going to be like when I dropped my spit cover here remind me that's there amen they thought they thought that when he came it would be like Elisha Amen because Elijah came and he what he laid the ex to the root of the tree and that's why a lot of people think you got to preach this message just like an indictment amen oh no but you see when the word came it was a judgment to the world but to us it was peace amen and the message that the bride of Jesus Christ is caring to this world is not a message of wrath but it is a message of whosoever will let him come let him that is thirsty come amen and so they thought that about our Lord and they said well why are you gonna are you gonna call down fire like Elijah did he said no I didn't come to the world to destroy it I came to save it amen hallelujah and that means something to me because I believe that there's a bride on the face of the earth now Amen that has the Ministry of reconciliation and she has a word by a message that is able to save men's souls and I believe there are recipients waiting here in this world lost see Dan even foolish virgin which are waiting for the bride of Jesus Christ by the message of the hour to loose them from their very sin amen hallelujah and the way that it takes brother-sister is not some it's not some crazy fanaticism or some Catholic idea of bless me Father for I have sinned but brother Branham said that in us is the power to remit sins and it's just the way that Peter had it when they said men and brethren what must we do to be saved and Peter said repent and be baptized amen in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost and that's what the bride of Jesus Christ has is a life on the inside when somebody comes and they say you know you've got something that I'm looking for and I feel something when I'm around you I don't feel anywhere else and I'm looking for truth and I believe you've got something for me then you don't point them to a church and you don't point into a group and you don't hand them a book or a tape but you've got something on the inside this is that just what Peter had this is that this is what you're looking for this is that experience the reality of the presence of God amen it doesn't take the form of judgment Amen buddies ministries a redemptive ministry amen I believe we're gonna get a little more into that on Sunday so we'll just we'll just carry on tonight's that but mercy is an attribute of sonship brother Bram said when you live your life to yourself you haven't got eternal life amen and there's the problem is we we live for ourselves we live for our own glory we live for our own pleasure and and we're selfish amen because we're human beings amen but when you live that way brother Bram said that's not eternal life but eternal life is living for others soul somebody said brother Branham how can you stand let somebody call you such bad names all the time and and undergo criticism he said you don't live for yourself you live for others you live for others watch us now that you might redeem that man oh that's powerful amen you live for others that you might redeem that man I believe in a power in the bride of Jesus Christ amen that if she'll look me on herself and not live herself and lay down her selfish motives and give God the preeminence amen then he will pour into her everything that was poured into Christ and she will fulfill the Ministry of Christ and live such a life that even the people that talk bad about you and try to misuse you you have the power in you even to redeem that sinful man or that woman amen brother Brandt said you become sons and the trouble is the church has forgot they were sons we forgot who we are amen forgot that we're sons forgot that that apostolic power is still alive amen to carry something real to this world more than churchianity more than religion but a real life you're a son and you are taking Christ's place amen I hope your hearing tonight amen and what a what what what's speaking to me here I hope it is meaning something to you we got something so much more than some watered-down what would Jesus do religion some kind of a some kind of a you know be nice and be kind and and be friendly no it's a power brother sister a power of redemption that is alive in the bride through the life of Jesus Christ and the same power that saved you is in you to save somebody else the same mercy that was poured into your vessel can be poured out amen if we surrender to the Holy Spirit but not if it's clogged up with all of you and your issues and your pride and your problems and your worldly desires amen what brother have said that we need is a stripping of ourselves say Lord just just strip away everything that's human everything that's me Lord let me get out of the way Lord and not worry about anybody else but start right here and break out all the clogs start with Annie Lord and take away the bitterness take away the selfishness because if you don't start with me then how can I help somebody else amen if you don't clear my eyes of my problems amen then how can I see clearly to help my brother help my sister and all the problems that we have in churches amen just about everything that we go through on this earth is because we make ourselves too big - important hey man oh my live for that man who hates you he said live for that person who would kill you if they could that's what they did to him they killed him and he died that he might save them and that's eternal life that's eternal life you know if you can overcome this distractions of other people and all their problems you can become the very redemptive power to set that person free amen if you're little enough that you can bear their abuse and and take the judgment and the mistreatment and whatever it is amen then you can be the very power to loose that person and that's exactly what the brides called to be that's why we must humble ourselves amen you believe this tonight what I'm preaching Alleluia see see we protest innate it unto adoption and I believe that before the foundation of the world he had predestinated us to this adoption the sonship and he ordained that there attributes of mercy would be poured into human vessels today that's why the Bible's called you a vessel of mercy not a vessel of Wrath but a vessel of mercy amen which mean all that God has in mind for you is mercy amen he has decided to fill you with mercy fill you with great he's not mad at you he's not angry at you but he has shown you mercy and he did it so that you could show it to somebody else amen but the problem is were mad at our brother were mad at ourselves were mad at God amen and so we're mad at everybody else hey man but we what we're not to be full of wrath but we're to be full of mercy vessels of Mercy and there's a power of redemption in this bride that can save our fellow man I just believe that brother sister is a great component of what we are lacking what we are missing amen and what we are not laying to hold of we've had a prophet that said that our attitude toward somebody else could determine their eternal destination amen so we ought to think about ourselves different we ought to think about that the long thing different because it's a different word we've turned a corner into something powerful something great amen you can't take your humanity with it but it's all Christ it's Christ having the preeminence Christ getting the glory that's what we're desiring tonight amen and it'll take divine love it'll take divine love human love we'll never do it and you know brother branham said that we try to use God's love the same way we do human love we try to use God's love like human love but it's two different love's altogether he said even the Greek words of different ones called filial love there's a filial love a human love he said that's like the love that you have for your wife right and then you have that filial love and it's real it's a power it's a powerful force of that human love but but he said then there's a gap a love and that's the love of God and he said the difference is a mana you're walking down the street and some man said something a little off color to your life figlio love that human love a man you'd attack that man but a cop a love would make you pray for his lost soul and so and so many times I think we've got the wrong understanding of what it means to have love because it's something so far beyond that humanity it's beyond our feelings it's beyond our beyond our instincts amen it's beyond our normal reaction when somebody mistreats you and then what do you do you react you you your instinct kicks in you want to strike back amen that's what human love will do but there's a power and divine love that bypasses the humanity altogether and that's what we've got to break into that's what's promised to this bride amen the problem with human love human love has fear it has fear that's why that's why we hurt the ones we love amen amen you ever hurt somebody you love amen because uh because a fear got in there a little bit of worry so you said something out of love you said it but it wasn't right and it hurts somebody and that's why we can have problems in our churches and a problem between this brother and this brother and they love each other but there's still a problem because we're trying to operate on human love amen but and human love has fear and human love has complexes and it has self-importance a man that's the problem with human love is it's that self-importance and and so we're afraid amen uh we're afraid of being humiliated we're afraid of being some bold we're afraid of being wrong amen and human love has all those things but see we're promised a divine love amen brother Bram talked about this divine love he said if I can't disagree with a man bitterly come on somebody if I can't disagree with a man bitterly amen and still think as much of him as Christ would then there's something wrong with my spirit I haven't got the Spirit of Christ the Spirit of Christ means you could bitterly disagree with somebody and you still think just as much of them as Christ does now that's powerful they meant that's so far beyond human it and you know but we put that so far out of reach but I believe this divine love is the rightful possession of the bride amen I believe his love for us has given us the the ability to have his love for somebody else Amen I just believed that word of what we're in the day of divine love and and it's available to us in such a way but it will take a laying down of our humanity because human love is not enough amen and many times you know God has to have grace on us just like you did brother branham and this is a comfort to me when I think I put that divine love seems so far out of reach amen it seems so impossible to love like that amen but you know bro Graham told the story himself when he was out of field in a bowl rushing me man and what did that human love do went for the gun amen and that's what happens sometime when somebody says something just caught a cyst so I'm a little funny to you and you just go right for the gun hey man you just go right for that reaction comes out that humanity comes out but just wait a little while just pause for a moment then what a bro Graham said son he said something came he said not from in me he didn't say it was from inside him out nothing that he had nothing that he could muster up but he said something projected from somewhere else amen and I believe a bride of Jesus Christ that will take the time before God to say god I'm laying down my humanity I don't want to operate on my human love I don't want to operate on my emotions in my fear and my complexes but I want your love amen that's what we need brother is to just have the patience with one another once in a while to let that divine love have a chance and project Amen it caused us to say things that our humanity wouldn't say and caused us to forgive one another when our humanity wouldn't do it amen to lay down our pride and lay down our dignity amen amen and and if you lay down your human dignity Amen man God can make you a vessel for the power of God the power of his love Rodin said all and we must have love for one another you know brotherly kindness will make a real good church but it'll take divine love to put a bride together for a rapture it'll take you the vine love to bring that headstone down and build that many membered body and produce manifested adopted sons and daughters of God only divine love can do that amen brotherly kindness won't do it friendliness won't do it human love won't do it amen that's what we've got to see kit brother sister we ought to pray for it in our church amen we ought to say Lord well pour out your love Lord and don't start anywhere else but start with me Lord let me love my brother love my sister and Lord let it let it come into this church and let it start right here and and Lord let me not have any humanity about me but I want to love my brother and love my sister in a way that goes beyond humanity and and human feelings amen we ought to love one another how many know that old quote word brother brand said if God's in your heart you can't wait for the church doors to open amen you ever read the rest of that quote what he said he said if you got God in your heart you can't wait for the church to open not to hear some good preaching that wasn't what he said not to hear good doctrine he said you can't hardly wait for those doors to open to get in here and fellowship with your brothers amen to have fellowship one with another we ought to love one another church amen and I you know I travel around a little bit and and you guys I appreciate this church here because you're friendly and you're loving with one another but seems like you go some places and and that they dismiss in prayer and the people just flee the building nobody wants to talk to anybody nobody wants to shake their hands and be friendly they just want to get out of there and get to McDonald's amen but there's something about the real Bride of Christ real Christian people that that we got a love for one another and if we don't there's something wrong amen if we're not feeling that if we're not if we're not if our hearts aren't burning the love one to another then there's something wrong because if there is if there's love anywhere in this world it ought to be around the bride of Jesus Christ it ought to be in churches where the message of the hour is preached absolutely oil brother Graham said if you don't feel that way toward your brother it's time you got to prayin if the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister what do you say said Lord don't never let the Hat root of bitterness spring up amen because it'll affect him and it'll take the Christ right out of my life you see what he said a real Christian amen the brothers of little gets a little wrong or the sister gets a little off not start with them say Lord start with me and don't ever let that little root of bitterness come in cuz that little root of bitterness that little bit of judgmental spirit will do more damage than what your brother's dealing with it'll do more damage than what your sisters dealing with What did he say would do he said it'll it he said it'll it'll take the Christ right out of your life that root of bitterness that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred it will take the Holy Spirit right away from you and it will run him from the Tabernacle here to kill the Spirit of God brother Branham said or do or drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything but don't you do that love one another anyhow a man that's what it that's where the hard part is is the anyhow love one another anyhow you know what a prophet said you know how a prophet instructed us this isn't this is you know this isn't from 1949 or some little some little scripture are some little closing something this is Christ the mystery of God revealed hey man this is one of the clearest places where the opening the seven seals ever been preached on the face of the earth one of the most powerful sermons ever preached and brother Branham took a little bit of an aside in there to tell you something he said love one another anyhow and talk nice about one another hey man we're going back to Sunday school tonight top nice about one another say nice things about one another amen it's not that hard but sometimes it's hard amen but but but I'll say nice things about one another they men find something nice to say about your brother nice about your sister say something nice about your pastor for the love of God amen say something nice to your pastor to the preachers to the Deacons to the to the musician say something nice and then brother Bram said and then God will bless you a man that ought to be the easiest blessing that we could receive let's just say something nice about somebody and God will bless you amen Alleluia oh my you see human love can't do it because human love carries fear it carries jealousy envy complexes self-importance and and the way that I believe that perfect love God's love casts out fear is because is because that most of our fear comes from self-importance and so it takes to laying aside of that self-important spirit to manifest the love of God because if you're too big how could God ever magnify himself in your life he can't do it but see wherever there's self-importance now there's different kinds of self-importance there's one that said oh I'm a somebody you know how could that brother say that to me don't they know who I am and how could the pastor not shake my hand doesn't he know who I am and then there's another one that says well you know well you know nobody cares about me and nobody thinks about you know and I got all these problems I'm never going to be an overcomer and I can never you know I can I'll never be anybody in a church nobody wants to hear me and then you see you know somebody somebody in the back corner and they're talking and laughing and you think yourself I know they're talking about me you didn't know that was selfishness did you but it is because it's self-centered its self-absorbed it's it's self facing Amen but we're not to be selfish at all we're to look to Jesus amen and amen and so we think that way but you know they haven't talked about you or thought about you and weeks but you're so self-important you thought you think everybody's talking bad about you and everybody's worried about you but you know the reality is most people are worried about their own problems too much to worry about you amen amen so look at yourself look at myself say Lord start with me start with me amen amens but see that it's that fear it's that self-importance that self-absorbed spirit that's what causes people to lash out so what causes a problem is because we're it's why we can't love one another cuz we're too important hey man but and and one of Satan's greatest weapons comes that way you know one of Satan's greatest tools is a what about spirit you're all familiar with a what about spirit that what about spirit that's one when the when the Lord comes your way he wants to start dealing with your life and right away you say but what about him and what about her what about the preacher and what about the deacon what about that church and what about what they're preaching and what about what I heard and amen and what about the Republicans and what about the Democrats and amen that what about what about what about but what about me amen what about you brother sister Amen a real Christian is it isn't thinking that way they're not the word has not instructed us to to approach God in that way but but we're to where to say the Lord what about me Amen Lord I see you're dealing with that one you're dealing with that one you're dealing in this situation but what about me Lord amen while on others that were calling do not pass me by but Lord Amen if you don't touch anybody else tonight on this Thursday night if you don't speak to anybody else Lord speak to me amen hallelujah who you trying to preach on brother Nathan me amen me and myself and I hey man it's me now my brother not my sister but it's me o lord standing in the need of prayer standing in the need of deliverance not anybody else amen amen and I'm not too important before God tonight to say Lord Amen I don't need you Lord he needs you she needs you what about that situation Lord I need you I need you more than anybody Lord more than anything else my desire tonight is Lord touch me Lord mold me amen you know what your problems are I know what my problems are what we need is the right spirit before God and say Lord speak to me deal with me touch me tonight Lord oh and be a nobody before God an individual in his presence let him be the great one for a change let him be the important one let his desire his will for you let that be what matters not your ambition that's your pride not what you're trying to build Amen not what you're trying to accomplish but Lord amen it's me Amen it's me standing in need this this evening Alleluia that what about spirit amen what about my spouse what about my family what about my past what about my prophet what about oh you know what about all these things what about me what about you amen hallelujah brother Branham said if we would quit talking about our neighbors and quit talking about the hypocrites in the church and it's quit talking about the faults of the preacher wish you would Amen talking about the faults of something else he said and just talk about Jesus Oh hallelujah amen quit talking about them this one and that one and and he said if she said and just talk about Jesus then we would have more appearing zuv Jesus what a powerful quote brother sister but from a prophet say saying if we would quit talking about everything else and looking at everything else and just look to Jesus we would have more appearance of Jesus and notice brother Graham said when he appears he don't begin to take sides with you hallelujah amen how many times have we come to church and say lord I wish you'd lead my pastor to preach it just right and prove that brother wrong prove that sister wrong and and vindicate my opinion amen but when he appears brother Brown said he doesn't start taking sides with anybody but every time that he appears he opens up the word he goes to the word brother sister and that's where you and I ought to go not to our little opinions and our little ideas and our little thoughts about the way that it should be but we ought to go to the word and let it change us let it wash us and let it have full preeminence in our life to tell us where we're wrong that's what separates a son from a sinner amen that's what separates a legitimate heir of God to an illegitimate and the Bible says he scourgeth every son that he receiveth and the only them that can bear correction are the sons of God that's absolutely right amen so see you don't wait for somebody else to fix all the problems around you don't wait for everybody else to change don't wait for the nation the change and the churches and it's never going to change brother sister but you as an individual before God you are the only revival your church has coming amen you're waiting for everything to change and waiting for that one to break loose and that one to get deliverance you are God's Avenue tonight amen he's not looking for anybody else he's not trying to fix all the problems in the world for you but he wants to fix you and heal you and deliver you and then he can use you to deliver somebody else amen so many people sit around say well I wish the Spirit would move in our church I wish we could have better worship I wish we could have more freedom and sit there like a bump on a log amen amen if God has put that on your heart he wants to start with you amen even looking at somebody else looking for a looking for a song leader to get you all fired up you want to come to church with the fire Amen nada not a fire of emotion but the fire of the Holy Spirit burning away in your heart hallelujah burning out the things of the world burning out the pride of humanity absolutely hallelujah oh my as soon as he appears he goes to the word Amen you know the devil will always get that will always give you something to point it it'll always give you somebody to look down on something to make you feel good about yourself amen you know you guys ever heard of Dave Ramsey when I was a kid I used to listen that guy in the radio he's some Christian financial guy and you know people call into his radio show Oh Dave you know I got $400,000 in mortgage debt and I got I got $50,000 in credit card debt and I got I got $100,000 in personal loans and you're sitting there listening to that like man I'm not doing too bad amen but you know you let that you let that carry away a little too the first thing you do you listen that man I'm not doing too bad I'm heading straight to Walmart amen and you start buying and he starts spinning he starts swiping that credit see what you ought to do is not worry about somebody else's problems if they got it worse if they got it better it doesn't matter amen and it's the same thing spiritually a man is me Lord I'm the one who needs help I'm the one who needs it hey man hey man but you know but we want somebody to point at to make ourselves feel better we and make ourselves feel like a somebody because we want attention well brother brown said it's only the sick that demand attention it's only the sick he said every church member that wants attention says oh I must somebody he said just remember that's a spiritual sick person that one that wants all the attention they want everybody's eyes on them that's somebody was spiritually sick they need the attention of the Spirit of God to give them something I'll take that attitude out of them and heal them from their selfishness and big ideas and big me and little you he said the Holy Ghost makes us all the same it's too much spiritual sickness anemic she said you know what Annie Mia is if somebody hasn't got any blood amen we need the blood of Jesus Christ to wash away our stain say Lord amen don't don't don't don't pour it on anybody else but Lord let the blood wash me tonight start with me start with me amen amen you know what it inspired me on this on this sermon and beginning to come down to a close tonight but I was just listening to it and I believe it's where where I was inspired with the title for tonight but I was listen to a story brother Branham tells I think he tells it a few times and and it's familiar to you no doubt but but the part that struck me is a little bit manat the part that usually we focus on with this story but brother Branham was having his healing campaigns you know when miracles were being done and and and he went into a place I can't remember if it was a section of at the meeting or if he'd gone to a hospital or what it was but came into a place where there was there was there was a bunch of mentally ill people would people with serious problems so he comes in this place and hears people in straightjackets and people screaming and and in epileptic fits and horrible cases severe cases and and all around all these all these things and and you know the story how how the brother branham comes in there and and he's looking around at all these all these hard cases and bad situations and there's a young lady sitting there brother BAM turns her he said she was a nice-looking young lady look real put together just was just a lovely-looking a lady in and he she said can I help you sir brother Graham said brother Graham said well I just I don't know where to start I don't know where to start there's so many bad cases so many thing I just I don't know where to start and here's a young lady and this is what this is what struck my heart said here here she on the outside she's looking all put together the way that we put in all we put in so much effort to come to church and look all put together and look like everything's ok and we're not we got no problems and there's nothing wrong in our lives and we go to such lengths to project that image but but see there was something in her heart a desperation she said brother branham i wish you'd start with me where the band i'm i'd like you to start with me and i hear as she begins to share her life and things in her past and brought on a nervous condition and here she's a backslidden state and she and her life's in shambles and and she looked so put together that he even surprised the profit but but but see she had the desperation she had the humility to say brother branham don't start over there don't start with that one or this one but start with me amen and i I wonder if there's somebody here tonight a man with enough humility in your heart say and say Lord I know that there's a there's serious things going on and serious problems and serious needs but lord if you're gonna start with anybody tonight please start with me lord please start with my problems start here in my heart and all God I it's me Lord standing in the need hallelujah Amen it takes that desperation takes that desperation takes that willingness to be a nobody to be not a not to be important not to look put together but the humility before God sometimes even go to an altar you know we don't always go to altars anymore we don't have altar calls anymore because because we're we're too dignified you know and we're too important oh that's some old you know that's the mold Methodist tradition or something like that but but sometimes it just takes that unction there not that humility that that that willingness say Lord I don't care what anybody else thinks lord I need to make a move before God and I need to get to that altar and pray or whatever it is I need to go apologize to my wife apologize to my pastor lord and just start with me start with my problem Olivia let's all stand a man god bless you've been gracious with me tonight I want to I want to close with this quote I may have read it here but in the past it's one of my favorite quotes from the Great Commission I think it's so powerful in any church to any human being brother Graham said if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing when a man has done you wrong and he absolutely justly I mean he has done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong he's done you evil don't mention that oh my prophet said don't mention that but you take him to prayer before God and don't take it in a selfish way and say well I'm supposed to do this but stand with your shoulder to his shoulder and stand in the presence of God our Father amen and say father here's my brother and he absolutely he justly deserves punishment because he's done me evil and I don't see why he did it watch it watch how a prophet deals it he said and then let God go talking to you let God go talking to you and and you'll see maybe what that man's been through and the devil's twisted him up somewhere and caused him to do that and though he's absolutely wrong before you leave the throne of God you'll be feeling sorry for that man you'll be sympathizing with that brother and when you get down to earth again you'll go over to that brother and shake his hand because you know what he's been through and you can't stand with a mortal in the presence of God and condemn anybody even if he's a rank sooner judge not that you be not judged amen brother Bram said we'll take him to the throne of God and stand there shoulder to shoulder with our brother knowing that he's immortal and maybe his destination rests on our attitude towards him when we come back from the throne of God will realize that where everyone guilty and we all need help one from the other and the best way to do it brother Bram said is to pray let's pray tonight amen maybe there'd be a lifted hand I could lift my hand tonight say Lord I want you to start with me Lord I've got problems I've got issues I've got fears Lord I've got complexes Lord I think too much myself and Lord I try so hard to hide from a hide my problems from everybody else but tonight Lord I'm letting down the wall I'm opening the curtain I'm opening the door to you and Lord just start here Lord and and touch me tonight o God I pray for every heart every hand that's raised Lord that your Holy Spirit would calm in a in a gentle and in a special way tonight father and speak to us Lord for we have needs we have problems Lord we have weaknesses we have issues we have besetting sins and Lord we're just asking for your help tonight Lord and if there's anyone here that's holding onto that root of bitterness Lord and Lord don't let that be a problem in the church but Lord uprooted tonight I say Lord strip for me all humanity all hurt all complexes all bitterness Lord and Oh let me be free from these things Lord and and let not me me as somebody but Lord let you have the preeminence in my life let you be the great one father and people look at me let them not see myself but let them see Jesus on display and Jesus be magnified let the Lord Jesus Christ have the preeminence in his heart an all-star with me Lord no I'm not looking at my brother any more not looking at my sister I'm not looking at what happened to me way back in my past Lord and I'm not looking at my excuses I'm not making excuses tonight but I'm asking you Lord standing in your presence and as an individual Lord if there was nobody else here Lord that got anything from God's night Lord let me receive from you what I have need of let me not go another moment of another day Lord without your touch for I'm a needy person Lord wherein needy people were in needed Church Lord bless this assembly bless these Saints father and let Lord a human love pass away and let the divine love of God bind us together Lord as a loving body Lord let us have more love one for than other let us have more unity Lord let us heart let our hearts burn for one another and let it be as the song says Lord when we asunder part it causes inward pain all but let us remain join and heart father until we meet again Lord Amen balint bind us together Lord with love into a many member body of sons and daughters and fill us with that divine love and that spirit of mercy father and use us in such a way Lord that we can help somebody else touch somebody else save somebody else Lord that's our desire Lord and we give ourselves away to you tonight in the name of Jesus Christ Alleluia amen all sir [Music] and [Music] today [Music] dry or say No I [Music] there [Music] some way [Music] [Applause] [Music] from
