um we just had such a wonderful time here on Sunday and amen in the presence of the Lord and in the communion of foot washing my just just a wonderful time and so we thank God for his mercies and um we um are so thankful to have brother Cadre here with us tonight and uh that it worked out that he would be able to be here with us um just um I know what we had been praying uh concerning with that hurricane Milton that came through and um I had contacted some of the brothers there uh today and just to see how things were with them um with brother Jack Duff there on West Palm Beach um you know they didn't have much uh that would have hit them there were a lot of the tornadoes that were just north of them just looking on the map I don't know if any of you looked on the map but I was really looking at that last night and as we were praying about it and so they only some of the people uh of their assembly only lost power there just for a little bit and the power was restored and then I just I just heard back here at 5:30 from brother Danny steeman and their phones had just come back on and so everything with brother Danny he said everything was good with the saint CU they were in Sarasota where it made landfall where the eye came in so uh everything is is good to go uh there you know some of the Saints are without power so we just thank God for his mercies and I know others uh like brother Stacy goodbrad up in Orlando and things like that but um we thank God for his mercies you know within it and I told the boys last night when we were in devotion I said you know think of it when we enter into that Millennium and then the future home there'll never ever be another hurricane never be another storm amen because it's Satan it's the prince of power of the air and we realize he can't do anything unless he gets permission from God but you know as we looked at that down there in in North Carolina and and Tennessee and I'll tell you it's a I continue to hear that from different ones uh from one of Zachary's teachers and different ones they say that even the videos and Zachary's got buddies that send him videos and things too and pictures he said just we send them but it can't even describe what it is and um you know as we've looked at that and I mentioned to you here before when those things took place what a devastating thing to happen but you know that's really only like a little scratch compared to what it'll be in the tribulation to that's why brother BR said cut me open fill me full of sulfur but God don't let me be found here during that tribulation period amen I'm grateful amen that right now this is a time to go and by oil this is the time amen for the holy spirit amen to receive that that real token that real Assurance in our life to be filled with the spirit of God Amen I'm telling you I'm thankful God's Made A Way aren't you a way that not just out of this world but a way that we can live with a real peace and an assurance and a victory right now amen well we just want to turn our hearts to the to the word of the Lord tonight and and just continue to keep each one in prayer those that's been affected I know some of you have different family members and I checked with Brother Bill earlier when he came in and different ones so let's just continue to hold one another up in prayer and then those that are in need there and we're looking forward to the word tonight amen and we just want to pull on the gift of God God has something for us God has not called a meeting for us just to come here and there just to be empty you know we plan a service but you know it's God who already knew the service would be he knew who the speaker would be God even knew how he would direct that to to take place so let's just pull on the gift of God tonight amen Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he passes and you'll find he's not too busy to hear your hearts C for he is pass sing by this moment your need to so Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he go let's Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he passes by you will find he's not too busy just to hear [Music] you he is passing by this [Music] morning Out and [Music] Touch amen praise the Lord you know I'm I'm um from the south you know I'm Carolina and we did get a a portion of the storm we had some really heavy rains some strong winds it you know it it it it lifted up some trees knocked some things over you know but one thing I I realized that if we go into prayer God hears our prayer you know so everything around us may be getting ripped up and tore up and but in the midst of all of it God will still give you peace so we we had some some lights out and things like that but nobody was hurt none of the houses were tore up anything like that one of the brothers in my church if you don't mind one of the brothers in my church he had a tree a huge tree in his backyard surrounded by other trees and it started leaning towards the house it was actually leaning and his wife called him and said he was driving to work and he was maneuvering around around all the other stuff on the road trying to get to work so he said he just started praying Lord be merciful be merciful church when the tree started falling it was already leaning when it started falling some kind of way it lifted back up and fell the other [Applause] direction and if it would have fell the way it was going it would have hit his shed his carp porch and all that and and he had had so many trees back there he wish he would had taken down but as this tree as it fell it was falling this way but then it started falling the other way and as it fell it took down all the other trees that he wanted to take down so our God is merciful isn't he you know what he is Messiah is the king of kings Messiah is the Lord of lords Messiah is the king of King Messiah is the Lord of Lord oh he is the king of kings and the Lord of lords Messiah is the king of kings everybody Messiah is the Lord of

all the saints of God the atmosphere that the Lord allowed us to create we certainly appreciate your pastor Brother Sam amen thank God for him and all of you let's just have a word of prayer and we'll get right into the word of God oh my Lord Jesus father truly you are the king of kings and the Lord of lords thank you and it's so sweet to know you as Messiah the anointed one Lord God and we just pray father that you would just have your way in the service tonight Lord that you'd move all flesh out of the way Lord that there would be a true divine inspiration for your people tonight Lord and that we'll pull Lord from every way possible Lord because we know that there are so many attributes at our disposal to tonight Lord you as a Healer you as a savior you as a deliverer you as a father and Lord God we just appreciate the unveiling of who you are and Lord God to know you deeper Lord and to have a greater relationship is our desire father Lord God we pray that you would just move by your spirit Lord God and we bind anything that's not like you that'll try to hinder the move of God in the name of Jesus Christ we pray church say amen amen amen praise the Lord oh my God is truly worthy of all of our Praises amen amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to uh Matthew chapter 13 Matthew 13 uh make the reading short let's just let's just start at um start at verse um 27 Matthew 13 and 27 the Bible says so the servant of the householder came and said unto him sir didst not thou sow good seed in thy Feld from whence then have it tears he said unto them an enemy ha done this the the servant said unto him will thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while ye gather up the tail he root up also the wheat with them let both grow together until the Harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers Gather ye together first the tears and bind them in bundles so burn to burn them but gather the wheat into my bonds amen let's go to um Job chapter 14 Job chapter 14 start at verse 7 for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it may Sprout again and that the tender Branch thereof will not cease though the root thereof wax old in the earth and the stock thereof die in the ground yet through the scent of water it will bud and bring forth bows like a plant amen may the Lord a bless reading of his word you can have your seats amen praise the Lord you know tonight by the by the grace of God I want to use for a subject the Harvest of mature seed the Harvest of mature seed and um church I know and and believe that we all know that we're in the end time we are um um we we should be believing that there's not much time down here on this Earth but for us to be in that place we should be looking for a harvest not not you know a lot of times when we think about the Harvest we think about you know uh trees and and branches and all these stuff but I'm speaking of a spiritual Harvest I'm talking about the Harvest of the bride of Christ The Harvest of Jesus Christ in the life of the believer because when you think about time one thing about a tree is it has to grow amen you can plant the seed and as long as you plant that seed y'all know I like talking about the seed you plant that seed in good ground uh it there's a there's a great great great chance that the life that was planted will come forth but it's not done as it starts growing amen you know the growth of a process is you know in time and time you know that seed it it comes at the ground and it goes through different seasons and all that things but there's a goal Hallelujah that that seed there's something there's a manifestation in that seed that has to be unveiled amen and you know right here in the in the book of joob what I love about this scripture look Church it says though the root thereof waxs old in the earth it's old it's dead oh my it's old it's dead and the stock thereof be in the ground it's in darkness oh my the seed is old it's it's dead it's in darkness but then it says yet through the scent of water it hasn't even been touched by the water but the scent of water Hallelujah the scent of water it will bu amen think about that church now we can go outside and a day we can smell the rain before it even starts to rain Hallelujah so let's look at the spiritual application of what it's talking about it said the sea could be dead old rotten in the ground but at the cent of water something in it starts to come forth now we know Hallelujah that Hallelujah water for you and I is a type of rain amen rain of what the anointing yeah Hallelujah and at the scent of rain it unlocked something in the seed amen so church when we worship When We Sing Hallelujah when we come together it shouldn't just be a regular service but it should unlock something because the rain is about to come Hallelujah and you know I love what the what the prophet of God he begin you know early in his church early in this journey you know uh there was a stain upon the Pentecost but then God told him if you want the Holy Ghost go in there that's right Hallelujah if you want it if you want me the anointing is in there the rain is in there and you know now that we've come through all that and people say that we're mature bride Hallelujah you know we're mature you know we we we we got the word and can't even produce what Pentecost how are we mature when we don't even have the same worship Services we don't even have the same prayer life we don't even have the same dynamics that they had in Pentecost Hallelujah when Pentecost is an experience amen now that experience is a part of the tree so we should have the same fruits in our life but we still supposed to be growing amen the anointing comes hallelujah hallelujah that the seed may continue to grow but let's look at a church complacency sets in and we come every every Thursday every Sunday and we experience the rain Hallelujah that's good we experience the rain the anointing Hallelujah the presence of God and he's watering our lives but are still [Applause] growing when we'll come and say I'm mature maturity is not you sitting down being a bump on a log maturity is not you sitting in the presence of God talking about I'm waiting on the word that's so yes at the scent of water I want you to look at your worship Services a little bit different tonight amen when we get together and we begin to worship and sing and sing songs what is it doing it's it's it's unlocking something that's already in the tree that's so good and the reason why we don't catch it because a lot of our trees are stubborn Hallelujah a lot of our trees don't want to give up what's inside so we'll stand there firm and sturdy and say I'm mature that's so good but it's harvest time and it's time to give God what he planted in the earth and if you're not giving God what he planted in the earth you're not mature right Hallelujah yes so good and I'll take it a step further Church Hallelujah we look at things in this season and we say well this got to happen in this proper season remember Jesus went and walked up to the fig tree out of season H you may not feel like worshipping hallah you might have troubles and problems in your life but when you come into the presence of God and God say I want [Applause] something I want something from you Hallelujah now the deci were looking at and they were saying Master it ain't time for us to give it up but this was the creator talking he knew what was in that tree and he asked for it and a treat it and give it [Applause] up I wonder how often we come to church and God is asking for what's inside of you and you won't give it up it's Harvest Time hallelujah amen and when they came back he said Jesus cursed the tree why because the tree didn't give it what it wanted Hall give him what he wanted and you know two often we come to church and we worship and we sing and we take these things for granted but the anointing comes to unlock something in our lives hallelujah amen look when Luther got anointed why did he get anointed because there were other seeds round laying in the earth that when they heard Hallelujah when they heard the just should live by Faith they came forth hallelujah oh my they heard the just to live by faith they were already laying there dorant but something had to happen that would unlock the mystery that was laying inside of those seats that were already on the earth Hallelujah yes sir what the Lord wanted for that age it wasn't to come it was already there right [Music] wow that's what I want you to understand what God wants for this age the manifestations for this hour is not to come it's already on the earth hallelujah it's already in the tree Hallelujah because the life is in the vine and the scripture says he says I'm the vine and ye my branches so we pull from the vine it has to be the same life same manifestation so we bring anything forth if anything is Harvest out of our life it should look just like Christ [Music] right I don't know about you but I'm not settling Hallelujah for anything else that doesn't look just like Christ that doesn't walk like Christ that doesn't sound like Christ that doesn't have the ability to speak like Christ hallelujah what happens is we let Age and and time come in and we say we're season that's so good oh my we're season that's so good you know they they did that in Pentecost uh they did that in Pentecost and you can't produce it you're supposed to be a step further than what Pentecost was that's in you that should be easy to come out of you it should flow out of you when you come in the presence of God cuz that's a part that you should have already moved past Hallelujah but we and you know it blows me away people are mistaking fundamentalism for the Holy Spirit Hallelujah when we don't just want to be fundamental Believers amen hallelujah we want the real life of Christ oozing out of our Lives hallelujah oh my but you know church I love this scripture in job it says that the tree was waxed it was old Hallelujah it was in darkness but at the sent of water yes sir do you get geared up to come here and meet God yes sir or is it just another religious meeting it's just another Wednesday night wow oh my I noticed uh uh tonight we didn't have any specials did we no no specials tonight cuz we holding them to Sunday when everybody here oh boy oh boy oh wow no doubt that song is probably on your heart right now but the people you want to be here is more alive so so and so can see you work I thought the worship was unto God right so Thursday has the same anointing that Sunday has amen it's the same rain it's the same people worshiping it's the same people playing so why doesn't oh my why doesn't Thursday get the same response that Sunday gets it's our attitudes Hallelujah every time we come together we should expect a manifestation of the Life of Christ on display in our church Hallelujah I don't know about you but when the Bible says when two or three of us gather God is also in the midst hallelujah amen amen but you know we got our own little way we do things and and we don't even realize Hallelujah that you're hindering your growth wow oh my church put this put put put the good tree up and I ain't going to be long by the grace of God I'm about to close but look look at that can you see it good look at that tree is it beautiful but what makes that tree beautiful fruit right what good is the tree without fruit right it's just an ordinary tree you can call it orange tree all you want but until you see fruit it's just another tree and nobody knows what it is it's still a m Hallelujah and until we see fruit in your life you're just a proclamation of a Christian Hallelujah because your life is supposed to Bear the fruits of the vine amen hallelujah and through the process of time that tree Hallelujah it grew and it grew and it grew and then it got to a place to where it couldn't contain Hallelujah the manifestation of what was inside of it anymore it got to a place to where what was inside of it it had to be released and nothing could stop it Hallelujah it got to a place to where it grew and it couldn't grow anymore without manifesting fruit and that's what I'm saying as a bride of Christ we should get to a place to where we're so hungry for God that God just pushes out of us [Applause] hallelujah praise the Lord but what's happened is we we we we've we've taken the turn I'm mature you know I'm waiting on the Lord you know all these things if I could say it like this Hallelujah he said he said what happened that these tears got here he said an enemy came and did that but understand this he said let me uh uh uh pluck them up he said no leave them alone let them grow together they're going to experience the same anointing sir the same touch from God we sing the same songs Maverick City and D City and Travis Green and everybody else we sing it all together Hallelujah and we worshiping and and the rain falls on the just and the unjust so what separates your tree from their tree when we're all getting the same rain oh my we're getting the same rain we're singing uh the same inspiration what separates there's two things that makes a tree grow Hallelujah one is water and the other other one is light Hallelujah and it's the light that you're receiving that pushes out the fruit from your life in a different manner amen because it's the same rain but we're under a different light Hallelujah because we had their light but we got their light and more so we should have more fruit a Greater Harvest a deeper manifestation Hallelujah but when we're complacency when complacency set in and we say well you know I've been around a long time uh here we go year after year wow when the season come around that tree pushes out fruit that's good yes sir at what age does a fruit tree stop pushing out fruit it don't right yes sir as long as they got a free flow of water right and a free flow of sunlight it'll continue to push out fruit that's it and you take this tree Hallelujah right now in Florida this tree is getting hammered with winds and rain right and and the and the tribulations of the elements is is is hallelujah almost working for his good Hallelujah your trials and tribulation is making your tree stronger amen cuz as those weeds for the hurricane it's pushing that tree is forcing that tree to go deeper as it leans and the winds may push it another way and it forces those roots on that side to go deeper as it leans so every trial forces that tree to give God a deeper and a more sincere walk with him [Applause] and that's what our trials are doing your trials shouldn't be taking you out of the presence of God but they should be making you go deeper your trials and tribulations really should make you stand your ground right because really when the winds and hurricanes and tornadoes and all that stuff come that tree doesn't just give up its life it fights for it doesn't give up its position it fights for it doesn't just get swept away now it goes deeper why because it wants to [Applause] live trials and tribulations comes but if there's an anointing in your life it should Hallelujah push you to live thank you Lord and go deeper in Christ am amen but what happens is people say well these things happen with old age uh here we go you know I've diagnosed with this because of old age I'm diagnosed with that because of old age I was just with some saints and one of the one of the sisters said she saw me squinting you know squinting my eyes and she said why don't you wear glasses I said because I don't have [Laughter] to she said well it's going to be bad on you because you're squinting I said sis I'm not just going to give up my eyesight I'm going to fight for it Hallelujah cuz it's mine right and one thing about me Hallelujah by God's grace when it comes to sickness and things of this body what I believe Hallelujah if anything happen let's just take acid reflux you've been settling with that you got a special pillow so you can that's that's good you got you a special pillar so you can live with that reflux you've adapted to carrying it you've even Googled your demon that's so good and we say we're mature mature I want to know what this thing I'm mature the Bible say it's a devil that's right Hallelujah and you know Church uh you take your assd reflux I can remember uh about seven8 years ago I was laying in the bed I was sleeping and all of a sudden woke up I like what in the world what was that and I start to think to myself I ain't never had no acid reflux so something is wrong I don't have to accept this Hallelujah you don't have to accept the conditions Hallelujah of life with God on your side he always has Hallelujah a way out come on now he can show you exactly what to do hallelujah or supernaturally bring a healing in your life so you know I said I say man I ain't never had no ref it must be something I'm doing so you know what I did I stopped eating real late and I got back in the gym and started exercising acid reflux goone Hallelujah but it's too often we bear with things and then it becomes a lifestyle oh my that sickness becomes a part of you and then you make excuse is forward well you know the doctor said when you reach a certain age expect these things to happen I wonder did the doctor tell Abraham you're not going to be able to have a child because you're 85 years old oh my God put him in a situation just to unlock the faith that was already inside of him and your sickness may be on you because God is trying to unlock the revelation of Jehovah RFI that's laying dormant inside of your [Applause] life hallelujah praise the Lord and y'all know I had uh I I begin to think about uh I wanted to use a subtitle uh called introduction you know church I started to think about my introduction to the Lord and my introduction to the Lord wasn't me seeking God come on right that's right sir you might think yeah I feel like oh man I went to church and you know what I cried and I prayed and God met me no it started way before that right it started way before that you probably don't even remember when God bumped into you bumped into you and then something started to happen where you start to crave a better life a better lifestyle you you start to lose the desire to drink the desire to smoke desire to live in the world you start to lose all see what happened Christ was introducing himself hallelujah hallelujah and for me the way God introduced himself Hallelujah he allowed me to have cancer in my brain that was the introduction Hallelujah it wasn't a good worship service it wasn't good preaching it was sickness Hallelujah because God knew that there was a revelation down inside of me that was waiting to fight that [Applause] sickness wow Hallelujah he knew the only thing for my life that could defeat cancer was the Revelation in me that was laying dormant on my tree so God allowed my tree to get shook up a little bit Hallelujah so it could begin to rise Shake It Up and Rise Shake It Up and Rise Church you're not supposed to die with the shaking but you're supposed to get [Applause] taller church when that tree is Shook and the roots go deeper the TR the tree is actually growing sir sir in my introduction cancer my brain and my mom she comes in and she says son you don't have to accept us and now she comes bless the Lord and she introduces me to her godess Lord but he's not my God yet but she's introducing me to her God hallelujah see that's when you're mature when you're mature you want somebody else to experience God like you know him Hallelujah you don't sit there be lazy and and and nonchalant and all these things and don't care but no you want somebody to know God just as good as you know God that's the truth hallelujah in church she comes and she says son my God my God Is A Healer Hallelujah my God has already healed you and then she showed me the scripture H now I'm talking about my introduction because if you ever get introduced to something that Hallelujah stays with you you have it forever on if the introduction is right you can't get it off your mind yes sir sisters you know how it is when you met your husband or husbands you know how it is when you met your wife there was something about that person that stayed on your mind even though you was at your house and she was at her house but it was the introduction Hallelujah maybe the way she she had her hair did or the clothes she wear the color her eyes or whatever it was maybe it was the broadness of his shoulders [Laughter] whatever it was it got your attention Hallelujah and that introduction had a last long defect on you Hallelujah and you couldn't forget about that person they became a part of your memory and when you met God Hallelujah on his terms to unlock something that was laying down inside of you it became a part of your memory Church God is a part of my history Hallelujah God is a part of my story God is a part of my life God is in every chapter of my book hallelujah hallelujah church God is the introduction God is the goser god is the definitions in the back Hallelujah God is every God Is the End next God is the little piece the ribbon that you put in there and say hold it I'm coming back to [Applause] that hallelujah it's time for us to bring forth the [Applause] life Hallelujah yes sir yes sir that's good see what's happen we've got mature and we hear truth and we don't even we don't even respond to God we're putting maturity out of place if you're really really mature you can't help but respond to God if you're really really mature you can't help but God come to church you can't wait to get here you got a song on your heart see Hallelujah the service doesn't start at 7:00 the service start when I get [Applause] up good good y'all think a true a true anointed Divine call song leader doesn't get his songs together right before church but it's a part of who he is that's right so when he gets up in the morning God starts to drop things on him Hallelujah songs of inspiration to be a blessing unto you Hallelujah see amen is if if he's in his channel if he's in his position the mystery of song leading has already been unlocked hallelujah it's unlocked so God has to Hallelujah with that gift God has to Hallelujah give him what he needs if you're in your position if you're in your duty Hallelujah you call God Duty Hallelujah God has to pay attention to you Hallelujah God deal with preachers for weeks in advance just to preach in an area that you might be in and weeks in advance he five to 10 steps ahead of Hallelujah you think H the hurricane and all that God's already ahead of us God say okay I'm going to let lights go out right here but they ain't going to go out over here that's I'm going let a tree blow down over here but I ain't going to let a tree blow down over here I'm going let rain fall down I'm going to let a flood come down this mountain but it ain't going to come down to that mountain why because I got a son praying here I got a daughter praying there I got a a here I got a daughter here I got a son here see God is directing every part of the tribulation God is directing the storm Hallelujah and you know church I sometimes I come to church Brother Sam and I look around and you see people in service and they ain't even happy here we go it's just something to do we just we supposed to come on Thursday night but what if you really had Joy hallelujah what have you really understood that the rain was falling on you oh my that you are in the presence of God would you just give God a a arm folding I'm mature thank you Lord wow wow is that all God means to you is that all his presence means to you Church in this hour where we are God is saying give me what I want give me back what I put inside of you come on come on Hallelujah praise the Lord so good remember you go and read your Bible there were there were there were three guys H and and and and they weren looking for this challenge but God knew what they were able to do he said hey I'm going to give you five talents I want you to bring me back five H see God already knew what they was capable of so God put them into action he put them in the action to give him back the same fruit he gave them sir now you ask yourself are you giving God back what he gave you or you just enjoying your time down here he gave him five he came back happily with five right he said well done my good and faithful servant he gave the other one two he came back with two but then it was one more see God didn't get a one who was only able to give two five right see he'll put no more on you than you can bear Hallelujah see God is not a Taskmaster whooping us with the conditions of life no he's only going to take you through what's going to perfect you right [Music] amen hallelujah don't you even realize it right now if your tree is shaking it's the hand of God perfecting you you going through trials you got ups and downs in your family or whatever it is it's God affecting you that you may bring forth fruit and then he says even if you bringing forth fruit I'm going Purge you that you bring forth more [Applause] fruit that's so good sir this is not the hour to be relaxing no but we should be in even a deeper a deeper consecrated desperation look all that the prophet was doing Vision after vision and healing lines and all these things and then he comes to the prophet and he says you got to be more sincere you got to be more sincere nothing to be able to stand before you you be more sincere amen if we examine our lives and ask ourselves as individuals not nobody else point the finger at each other but if you ask yourself right now what does it take to be more sincere Hallelujah examine your own life examine what gives you Joy and now examine what you're doing for God and I'm not talking about individual a accolades but I'm talking about a relationship that's right cuz I'm not trying to make you a preacher I'm not trying to make you go in the corner and preach or be a song leader but what is your relationship with God like because you know when a husband and wife get mature with each other they can almost tell what one another's thinking before they do it that's right that's so true the husband will say I ain't going to do that cuz she going to get mad if I do [Music] that he begins to know her knows her move knows what makes her happy Hallelujah he he he he knows what will make her sad Hallelujah as they grow together they mature together and then there's certain things he can get out of her that the job can't get out of her there some things she can get out of him Hallelujah that nobody else can get out of them why because they mature together they literally have become or becoming one amen hallelujah amen and that's what's happened with this tree it's become one with the vine that's why it's pushing out the same life that it was planted with hallelujah hallelujah and church if we ever realize who we are and what God put inside of us that we were created not to be separate from God but to be just like he is we push out the very exact same thing Hallelujah that's beautiful that's beautiful but the problem is we say we're mature but we can't even see ourself as replicas of Christ wow that's what Adam was Adam was in the very image and likeness of God hallelujah and I want you to understand well you say well Adam fell into sin and and and and he had to leave the God and sin overcame him no sin did not defeat Adam no that's good Adam like Christ laid his life down for his wife the devil didn't make him do anything Hallelujah the attributes of sin didn't make him do anything but the Bible said Adam willfully Hallelujah willfully went with his wife so sin had no control over Adam but J what are you saying I'm saying when you know who you are the situations of Life have no control over you you are the dominant one amen amen Lord thank you Lord and the whole spiritual real demon powers know who you are Satan knew who Adam was that's why he didn't approach Adam because he knew he couldn't control God [Applause] and when you realize who you are Satan will leave you alone praise the Lord see there's something and and and I'm not bragging I tell us to the glory of God and I was in South Africa about a month or two ago and we was having some meetings and youth meeting and demons start manifesting itself normally when demons in in atmospheres like that demons will jump out to bring forth fear sure so somebody will get distracted and not press in Hallelujah and through and through my growth process I've learned that I don't have to fight with every demon come on now come on I got Authority oh that's good you know what we're used to seeing is brothers getting up laying hands and calling on in the name of Jes you ain't never saw Jesus know his disciples do that in the Bible there you go that's right there you go and the Bible says if that spirit that raised up Christ from the dead dwells in you it shall also Quicken what kind of body body or what is it what kind of body your mortal body so you should have power over demons on this side in your mortal body the quickening power is in you right now if you got the Holy Ghost we're not waiting on a Rapture to take our lives back he said it'll Quicken you right now if the Holy Ghost is in you you got the same Life of Christ inside of you hallah hallelujah hallelujah yes sir so I pick and choose when I want to fight go ahead Hallelujah in this particular time he start screaming and holling and all that and carrying on terribly you know and everybody rushing over I said stop stop stop everybody stop stop stop I say stop and it's just because by experience right H and we're not boasting all glory to God but what I'm making this statement just to show that if the Holy Ghost is in you it's the same life that said to Legion what is your name make the devil identify himself goad call out the spirit that's troubling you and see right now God's trying to get somebody Deliverance cuz it then switched over to talking about demons oh my in church Hallelujah you notice Jesus they will walk up and they would say us and Jesus would say hush right hold your peace don't tell nobody who I am all right and they would say but God but this they would shut up hush and leave just like he said now if the Holy Ghost is in you that don't change it's still the same life it's whether or not you believe it he started screaming and holling and doing all the caring on terrible I and I realized it was a spirit of fear to try to get all the other young people not to enter in Hallelujah so I walked up to them by the grace of God and I said shut up and come out silently and stop scream put head on oh wow I say I said come out silently close his eyes I said look at me they know who you are [Music] [Applause] Hall remember Jesus walked the Earth in what not as a spirit but in a body of Flesh his Spirit was in that body Hallelujah he walked that he walked the shores of Galilee and all through the scriptures how in a body of Flesh to show us that if his Spirit dwells in our body it'll do the same thing hallelujah praise the Lord amen hallelujah church we prayed cast the spirit out and that was it young man got delivered in the next service you know what he was doing on the front row experiencing the rain worshiping god what the enemy does to people when they get Deliverance it brings a spirit of embarrassment and then they get in church and they like no you ought to be rejoicing because Satan has no more ho over your life Hallelujah [Applause] what are you saying I'm talking about H the Harvest the mature Harvest of God's life right so if we look Church we've been we've had this message Hallelujah for over 60 years the tree has grown the tree is mature the tree is pushing out fruit Hallelujah we should expect it amen amen I'm about to close don't get nervous give me the next one see that tree what's the difference it got fruit on it but it's dying at one point in his life it was vibrant right right I'm in the message of the hour God s the prophet oh Hallelujah vibrant couldn't wait to get to church couldn't wait to sing songs hallah it was pushing out fruit right but now that same tree is dying this is very touchy CU I want you to understand something the tree is not a hypocrite because it has fruit it's it's produced The Very life that's within it right that's right but it's come to a stage in his life where something has caused a drought my and Brother Sam sometimes people that say they're mature they stopped singing they stopped worshiping they stopped clapping they stopped coming to prayer they stopped you know doing the things that they once did when they were younger and say yeah you know I'm a little older now you're entering into a Dr out that's right and I'm not saying that you're not bride everything on here is seed Hallelujah but you must remember there were five wise and five foolish Hallelujah and the foolish did what they're going to go through the tribulation and it's only God that can have mercy on him they had oil but they just didn't have enough right amen we don't want to be in that condition how you going to say you mature and you stop growing the process has reversed it's no longer growing it's dying that's Hallelujah even though at one space in his life It produced fruit right right normally if a tree get in this condition there's a couple things that can happen that causes it to die either is not getting a free flow of water it comes to church and don't participate so good I'm just here and the bad part about it we have the words up on yeah we have the words up here and some people still won't open their mouth to worship God wow you're in a drought hallah either the tree is not experiencing the rain hallelujah or the light is not hitting it like it's supposed to and we find out in this time in this hour everybody all right sir now let me let's understand something this message tonight is not a rebuke it's an encouragement right Hallelujah because what I'm saying there's something in you that God wants to see there's something in you that God wants back because he put it in you Hallelujah don't let the devil bring a uncertain sound no I'm trying to encourage you to be what God made [Music] you I'm trying to encourage you to not Hallelujah sell yourself short amen see Church we're not a tree pesticides we are an organic tree Hallelujah yes sir Hallelujah I don't need entertainment Hallelujah to worship God I don't need a special meeting to be on be on time for church no My Worship is [Applause] organic hallu Hallelujah so good sir organic means that I don't need some created substance to make me grow come on all I need is the natural things that God provided because it will automatically connect with [Music] me Hallelujah but what I love about this this tree is dying either look at your own life either is not experiencing the rain and that's a lie because every time we come God is here amen hallelujah hallelujah I could have just came up and read a scripture Hallelujah and we would worship shout this place down as we just sang y'all feel like that I did I had to cut the song the song short because I was just I feel like I about to lift off up in here right see in my church Hallelujah where I go at sometimes I song Le and I stop a song and dance with it a little bit look at the musicians and say one two three and go right back into it and some people think that's just a little too much but what I say to that is you can't tell my story on so how you going to tell me what's too much for me to give to God how you going to tell me when it's time to quit worshiping how you going to tell me when it's time to quit shouting and dancing and giving God praise when you don't know my storyall that is so good yes sir sir I don't know about you guys but but God been good to me yes sir sir I say God been good to me I say God been good to me through it all through the sunshine and Rain God been good to me sometimes I was stuck in the mud but God has s by a spiritual 4x4 and drag me [Applause] out sometimes I've got cut in a spiritual blizzard and God comes with a Heavenly snowblower and make the way clear get all the ice praise the Lord Brother Jesus what are you saying church at this span of History the span of where we are as the bride of Christ we should be on fire so good there's another thing that'll make the life reverse in this tree if it's not sunlight if it's not the rain right it's a sickness right the tree gets a disease some kind of way maybe maybe a in some some kind of insect or something gets in it all right and it starts to eat the tree from the inside out wow that's good a tree that was once alive with fruit on it now that sickness Hallelujah begins to kill it Church let's be careful with our life and our lifestyles cuz that can be a sickness but before I close you take I got some qus and stuff but I'm going just leave it alone tonight I might read one so you can still say I'm in the message that's good church you take the same tree Hallelujah W Catch It you take the same tree storm comes blows it down on its side right now that tree is on its side and maybe some of the roots are dangling and hanging out but there's just one root come it's still connected they said the tree is laying down the tree is flat on its back oh my look like it's been devastated it look like life is over and it went down for the count but it still got one one root Hallelujah connected with the Earth so when the rain falls it feeds that root and The Sun Shines it feeds that tree and church while that tree is laying on its back and the sun is shining and the rain is touching it even while it's on his back it'll still push out a [Music] branch Hallelujah so don't think it's over if you get knocked down just stay connected if you go through some pains don't worry about it just stay connected you've been talked about now you're flat on your back don't worry about it if the sun is shining and you got just an inklet of God in your life you will live again H hall hallu hallelujah hallelujah one of my favorite poems Hallelujah Maya Angelo she said I shall rise I shall rise just like air I shall rise Church oh my no matter what we go through you could be laid on your back but you still stay connected just like air you shall [Music] rise Satan can't stop it so when we mature Luke Chapter 3:1 17 the Bible says with a fan in his hand right he's going to thoroughly Purge his floor that's called the winwing time yeah you know what that mean that scene it's the wiing time it means it's a process with a farmer he gathers the tears and the Wheats together right the winwing time he gathers the tears and the Wheats together but then he waits to his windy Hallelujah he waits to his windy and he walks out in an area where Hallelujah of harvest and he'll grab the wheat and the tears and he'll throw them in the air and the wind will catch them the wind will blow the tears away and the wheat will fall right back in position amen and that's why we are church he has a fan in his hand Hallelujah thoroughly purging his floor Hallelujah we ought to be on fire for God yes Church you say Brother D why why why you say that because we are standing in the midst of Prophecy good we we every every person in the bride of Christ got their day of History H I wasn't there for molini Hallelujah I I I'm catching it I'm here hallelujah with a prophet talked about a car be driving itself I've been in one they're all over the world they called testas right Hallelujah church we are in history we are that part of the vision Hallelujah is

the country and if that one ain't good enough for you I'll make it real easy for you when Joe had Co who you think was running the country right right right right true and if that would ain't good enough for remember he said just like it was in the days of s just like it was in the days of lot when Obama got into office you know what he did he gave the gays all the rights they need Hallelujah they said oh we want to marry Obama say I leave it to each state do whatever you want to do yes why so the prophecy and fulfillment Hallelujah of Luke 17:30 could take place that's right we should be mature seed because we're in a harvest amen I'm not stuck on the sixth Vision coming to pass right I'm making sure I won't be here for the seventh Hallelujah cuz the pope being had all the power oh yeah oh yeah so you so you can say it's KLA or the Catholic church is already happened right and if that was ain't good enough for you Hallelujah when joob came into office what did he did he had a Catholic mask right already showing I give it to you true don't be waiting no don't be waiting to get right amen this Vine is mature I Hallelujah we ain't been in church two hours [Music] [Laughter] yet listen this going to wrap up what I was saying this quote is in here ye him um 57 57 807 he says now how is it we are the branches can I get amen amen he is divine how many know John 15 teaches that Jesus said I am the vine ye are the branches now this what the prophet God say he says now the vine does not bear fruit you go the vine does not bear fruit does no sir the branches bear fruit the vine only energizes the branches church we should be energized when we experience the rain when we come in here hallelujah it should be like David when he worshiped and it drove out demons that was on Saul and Saul said I feel refreshed and the anointing that was on David was the same anointing that God on amen he said David was a man out of God's very own heart and David was so anointed that he could drive out a spirit that God put on somebody why it was the same life am hallu he said no so the branches bear fruit the vine only energizes the branches he says well now we're branches that's God's word now don't look and say brother Brandon this or John this or so and so Jesus is the one you're looking to he's the life of the vine he's the life of the branch and the same life that's in the vine will be in the branch that's right good if Jesus is divine and we are the branches the same life that's in Christ should be in us he said the same life that's in the vine will be in the branch and it'll produce the same life that's in the vine if it's truly a branch now if we're the branches Christ will appear hallu so as musicians come brother digs how do we get there how does that tree get get back to being a good tree it's very simple the prophet of God say that tree it grows and it grows and it grows but what I like he says when it's this High everything it stands in need of is in it right there in that moment every every bushel every limb every Branch every seed every piece of fruit that it'll ever prod is in it when it just High that's he said what does it do he said it drinks in and then it pushes out but this is the key right it doesn't just drink in it drinks in more than what it needs there you go so if you want to see Christ manifest out of your life you got to give him more time than just Wednesday and Sunday or Thursday and Sunday if the only time you pick up your Bible is is Thursday church and Sunday church you'll never be able to push out those fruit because you're not drinking in enough of him so you got to be so indued with him so overpowered with him till he can't help but just push out drink in and push out church that's what we were supposed to do amen a friend of mine in London UK I might have told y'all this she planted a pear tree she planted a pear tree and the tree grew and it grew and it grew then it was just a nice pretty tree and the seasons went out season came back in Seasons went out Seasons came back in and she would look at at and she was like I know it's supposed to produce p I know what I I know what I planted so it went by a year went by another year went by the trees the the the size of it is mature but it's not pushing out no fruit so she didn't Google it she didn't get a tree tester to come test the tree she walked up to the tree she walked up to the tree and she said I know you're a pear tree and if you don't give me no pears next season I'mma Cut You Down spring came around next year then the Harvest start the limbs got green and the next thing you know PS start coming from everywhere out of that tree oh yeah so many PS start coming out of the tree that the branches start to break wow so many parents was coming out the tree to see had to gather the prayers the PS and take them to church and give them out to the Saints hallu what happened it was Jesus speaking to that pant tree just like it spoke to that fig if that spirit that raised up Christ from the dead lives in you it will also Quicken your M body and I was just there in August and she told me brother digs is still giving me pants praise the Lord hallelujah more than I can [Music] eat thank you Lord maturity doesn't make us cold former and Powerless but maturity makes us produce maturity makes us bring forth of the life that's inside Hallelujah maturity doesn't calm us down to say oh we got the word we don't need all that we got the word it's because David saw the word word coming back then he started first even shouting right right yes amen it's because I almost preached I I almost preached tonight Hallelujah you got to be inspired Hallelujah because it's because Moses was inspired by God Hallelujah to not cry and speak Hallelujah Moses turned around he didn't speak to the sea but he said you Egyptians that you've seen you shall see them no more forever all right he spoke to the problem Hall stop putting it on everybody else and speak to the problem the Egyptians was the problem Hallelujah and creation heard God speak to Moses and the Red Sea would have heard [Music] Moses the Red Sea I'm going to do what I heard God say you just speak to the problem creation will obey Hallelujah speak to the problem your surroundings will take care of it hallelujah amen oh my church let's pray Lord Jesus father we thank you for your word Lord we pray what something said to help your people Lord we love you we appreciate you father and all that you do Lord if you don't do anything else you've already done enough Lord don't let complacency set over set in on our lives but Lord let there be a fire in our lives let us be burning to bring forth the Life of Christ to bring forth more of you Lord because if we're still here there's still more of you to get Lord there's still more of you to produce there's still more of you to push out so Lord we ask that you'd have your way in The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ let

about brother Brandon puts it in one in a million he says healing is in you already yes sir Deliverance is in you already praise the Lord he said but it's Satan's duty to keep you blinded from that fact he said but God brings somebody on the scene that can see what's there and then that somebody tells you what's there God sent in this hour someone and that same one that sent Malachi 4 is the same God right here Among Us amen letting us know what is already within us amen it's already there and there's no no leaf that has to be added from the outside no no fruit from the outside everything is from within it's just like what was spoken here tonight from the scent of water just letting go when you begin to sense even God just drawing and dealing and moving upon your heart just release it just release anything at all just release it if there's anything that that's holding you back anything that's come in any disease just release it just let it let it go say God forgive me Lord cleanse me Lord Jesus from the depths of our life it allows God to move on in our lives I certainly I believe tonight we like any other time we don't come to be entertained right right but we want to be we want to be participants right amen because we read that quote last Thursday it's the surrender we have receiving the word and then the word in the beding ground reacts back that's this is what makes you know what can make what really will make us makes us rejoice is because when you know God and then you can see already the victory over whatever the situation over whatever the need is hallelujah that's what really that's what brings a real worship that's why when the word is coming forth it's an open Vision that begins to break over our life and we can begin to see ourselves amen that it's it's finished it's finished and I'd say here tonight that before As we sing another song here if you would like prayer amen our brother's here to to pray with you amen I I wouldn't walk out of here with one one need if you have a need on your heart or something on your heart I believe God is here when he spoke all the way through this service God is so mindful of all of our needs aren't you glad of that I tell you I've I I've witnessed Services after services and I've W witnessed how things that God has taken down Avenues and directions and things like that you know I've never been disappointed when God has got me off of my notes I mean I might have felt like it was scrambled aches at the end of it but the thing of it is is I'll say it like this that no matter what the need is that God has spoken to God loves his children and he cares so deeply that he want want us to walk in that Liberty and that Victory yes he does every moment of our life he does and he made away from that man he's the god that is present that is able to lift whatever might be if there's anything in your life anything that's there he's the god who's present to LIF if you need healing in your body
