be with you than with other congregations the meeting but it's certainly good good to be here and good to be home I didn't get any amen on that song you might say oh my Thank You Matthew 27 let's read verse 50 Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent and the graves were open in many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many amen we want to look here at thought this morning the key stone the key stone may God bless you bless His Word as you're being seated I don't think that it came through the picture but you'll see it on the notes when they would send those out later but probably every one of you have you've seen an arch and meaning that of a an arch where you have the stones that are assembled and they come from the ground and it it comes together here in in the middle and that's what we're that's what we're looking at because the Keystone itself is the actual stone that sets in the very center that joins that together for the arch and to know that the very the Keystone when we are looking at all of this that the Keystone itself and every arch when an arch is made there's many different arches and one that out particularly referred to a few that have been constructed within the world and every one of those arches that have been constructed have depicted many great victories battles that have been won so they're not just for naught but there is purpose and there's a significance behind their construction it is a memorial it is something that is set forth that others can recognize and visit and and see the those things that have taken place and when we look at this in the the life of the Lord Jesus knowing that in all things that the Lord Jesus himself is the very keystone of all things we recognize that as we look back even and think of the in the beginning when there the fall had come in the beginning but yet God Himself reserved unto himself that I will make a way back he said I will give you a seed and his seed shall bruise the head is his head and his and his seed shall bruise his heel we see we see all of this that is spoken and prophetically and we recognize that as we've looked at this over the the course of months is that it for for God these things are not just things that the Lord is just thinking through and things are just coming up on the spot but all things the whole plan has already been laid out before there was Adam Stotler molecule and the prophet puts it like this and the Hebrew says he says before it was God he said God predestinated you the plan itself was set already so before or anything had come into existence and the whole plan the whole part is that he himself would be the theme and would be what is the central of all things that that it would be him that everything points to we look at this with the with the Keystone in itself and we find that here in D in the resurrection where here the scripture speaks in verse 52 that the graves were open and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the grace after here resurrection brother branham says it like this and the message at Kadesh Barnea he says all the Old Testament and all its characters and characteristics was only a foreshadow of the wedge or the Keystone the New Testament that joins law and this dispensation together so when we look at that that Keystone I want to just look at here just for some moments is to see that within that of the arch that there are the stones that are placed within that arch and then the very Keystone itself being the focus being that of the wedge and the the great stone that comes to reside and join that together and make that an indeed an arc of triumph we see that how that when we're looking down through the ages that it's all of those where the scripture says many of the saints which slept it didn't say all of them not all of the Old Testament Saints arose and his resurrection but there was a select few that arose when he arose they were they were privileged in their generation to recognize Christ and his visitation in their generation it wasn't their merits it wasn't that they were better than anybody else it was the sovereignty of Almighty God and we look at that even you think of even in Abraham's life Abraham would have continued doing what he was doing but it was the plan that God had for Abraham's life in interrupted Abraham's life of what he thought his life was going to go but God had other plans and they were plans that was before Abraham was ever walking upon this earth and God moved to speak to Abram and spoke to his heart and Abraham walked after the Lord he left where he was that and begin to walk after the Lord and we find that when we look at the that many of the saints which slept they arose we recognized and we see that if there were in in the in the Old Testament there were over comers because when we're looking at it that each one of those over comers when you think of how that Abraham himself he is led by God and inspired to by that cave of machpelah that that would be a place of burial remember they were going to give it to him but he would not take it it was a cost to it and you know there's a cost to serving the Lord there's a cost to everything you do nothing comes easy there's nothing that's given to us there's a cost for it there's a cost when you desire your healing there's a cost and deliverance there's a cost to walk as a Christian there is a cost and that cost is yes that cost is yielding that cost is surrendering it there's there's a price that must be paid and then we we find that how that all of them all of those prophets and those move down through the time that even how they were inspired by God to be buried there in Palestine it was revealed to them that that's the place of the resurrection that's the place where the Messiah was going to come and they were moved by God even in those times and you know friends Allah said they didn't have the Canon of Scripture that you and I have they didn't have that they there wasn't a scriptures that they could just go back on in a Canon of scriptures but now in this hour here the entire book of Redemption the HAI entire scriptures all of these things are laid out for you and I and the Spirit of God quickening that why because it's needful for you and I in this hour that the faith that is greater than all that's been down through this earth and that is a rapturing faith that will literally change your little bodies it's and there's a greater need and only that no only one who can supply that greater need is a greater one they're gathered to their people Jacob himself standing there and Egypt before solid and he said don't when you when God visits you don't leave my bones here but take her with you and bury me in the land of my father's they knew there was a promise that was there that promise was pulsating in their lives that's why the scripture could say in Hebrews 11 these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they matter that opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country then as a heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a city they all died in the faith this scripture this did what we're looking at even in Hebrews 11 we know that this is God's Hall of Fame there's many other we could look down in the Old Testament you'll find many wonderful men and women down to the scripture but there is an elect and let me say it like this there's many wonderful people in this world there's many wonderful people that that they walk according to all they know they're looking to the Lord Jesus as their Savior but they don't know him as Redeemer now I know a lot of times it's said that he is Redeemer and they but the way that they look at redemption as though that it's something I'm coming to instead of recognizing it's God that's bringing you to what you always were redemption is not merit able redemption is sovereignly given by God it was God Himself that determined before anything that he would bring you and I back to himself Redemption is not by self effort redemption is not my self merit not by whoops let's we should vote it is sovereignly by the grace of God it's caught dealing on your heart it's God drawing you to himself it's God reconciling you and I that's a true gathering that's a true reconciling and all of these having died in the faith they were waiting with anticipation they didn't see everything I know a lot of this is familiar territory but they did not see everything but what they did see is what God had made known to them and they walked faithful to what God had revealed let me just put this very clearly what God reveals is not something from the past God takes that which has been spoken and he reveals it and it's not something from the past but it is prescient when he revealed himself to Moses he said I am that I am is he reveals himself as the prescient God because you can't work toward a goal if the goals back there is all right Paul said I press toward the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus our Lord we're not looking back with we're looking forward they meant we're looking unto Jesus who's the author and the finisher of our faith they meant not looking back but we're looking we're walking just as faithful as Abraham walk just as faithful as Noah walk just as faithful as each one of them walked in the faith they didn't receive the promises but yet they themselves embraced what God had given to them look at Noah Noah here by God God reveals himself to Noah and he makes himself known to Noah and Noah's life becomes so occupied with what God's revealed you see when your life is not occupied by what God's revealed then there's a problem either he's not revealed it or there's distractions that's come there were all kinds of tests and trials and everything that tried to come between Noah and the message that God had given him there was frustrations we don't read it in the scripture but we recognize that this was not I can say it like this a superhero's comic book where everything goes right in place and if it isn't going my way I just speak it out of existence it don't work that way there by faith where they had none sometimes where Noah had to persevere beyond what he knew himself to be that's why the Prophet said he was an ordinary farmer oh my love how that's placed in this hour he was not he said he was not any type of an architect it wouldn't make sense to have an architect if you were going to call somebody to your house to do plumbing it would make sense that they at least knew something about it is that right don't call me no I do know some about plumbing but you understand but God does not call people who know something Paul said that minute you see said how the minute my hind wives are called that God causes the weak and the base things of this world why does he do that to prove his glory through because it's not something that you or I are able to do but God himself through a yielded life surrendered to him God performs his word here they were surrendered we know that how they came into this place here they arm died they died in the faith they died expecting and no we find that here here they are in the bosom of Abraham as the Scriptures speak to us they were in paradise there was a place that was being held it wasn't hell but it was a place that was being held and and reserved in waiting for the fullness of the atonement to come so here we find that how the Lord Jesus himself the Scriptures speak in the book of Hebrews chapter 2 that just as the children were partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage they walk they walked they walked free the Scriptures they declare that to us and we recognize that when God has done a work in our own life we walk not of this world that's what Jesus said is a dime in this world I'm not off this world you and me might look and say well you know our natural birth but the spiritual birth we are not of this world there has got to come a reality there there's got to come a call there must come a presence there must come one from that other land that makes contact with you that you can recognize there is a greater land they meant there's a greater life there's a greater wall there's a real substance there's a real reality that must come Melchizedek and pass by your way that you might know there is a land Amen that's why Paul could say the gospel of your salvation it takes a living word by the Living God setting down in that word and making that word live in a real and unless the people know they're not called to theology but they are called into the very presence of the Living God the life-changer the Redeemer hallelujah they made it takes the gospel of our salvation to break all things around us amen that's why it takes the Word of God if not it's a continuing on but if all you do is build a wall that's all you've got but God ain't building walls that's what man do God don't build walls God dwells in a house here's a water they were subject of their lifetime remember Jojo crying out what happens to a man if he dies I see what happens with the tree right now these things begin to look how God went in spot to where job was looking at the simplicity bringing these things up meditating on the deal don't you see friends God Himself if we'll give our lives just like what was preached here on Thursday night God will move by his word to cause you and I to dwell on that which his life and God will come right down through that word and make himself known to us hey man Joe was witnessing and seeing God that there is a resurrection and God from there inspires Joe to her Joe could say though the skin worms destroy this body my skin worms yet in my flesh shall I see God I know my Redeemer liveth here they were in paradise they were overcomers in their day you know when you look at this Arch of Triumph it's in Paris there is there's a couple different ones but the one that's the arc of triumph it's one of those that where it depicts upon it those who fought and died for friends in the French revolutionary and and the Napoleonic Wars with the names of all French victories and Generals inscribed on its inner and outer surfaces then you know it has the below it lies the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from World War one then we find that it goes on to tell us that the arc of track was designed and has in its design there were even where it depicted many of the French youths that were going against German warriors in another time and this is what it this is what they had said and what I was reading about it said it set the tone for public monuments with triumphant patriotic messages I want to read that again yeah they're talking about this arc of triumph it set the tone for public monuments with triumphant patriotic messages you're not find one message of defeat in the arc of triumph that's why in the arc of triumph Christ Jesus every word every promise is yay and amen there is no defeat in him there's been a lot of battles and you can look back and say well they've done some things that's been lost here and there you can look in Abraham's life look in Noah's life look at all that God allowed that humanity to be displaced but what you need to focus on is the end result is that in spite of all humanity that the very purpose and sovereignty of God prevailed in their life when they felt like giving up their strength from within that propelled them onward radar is he that is in you than he that's in the world when Abraham could not figure out how in the world is this child gonna come and he laughs right there in Genesis 17 but yet God Himself takes that look that laughter and he doesn't smite Abraham down but what does not do God provides strength we know God provides strength there is a transition that even happened between seventeen and eighteen because you don't find Abraham laughing but yet his wife is laughing but in the midst of that path after that visitation her laughter is dissolved also who did it Christ in Abraham's life he was the key stone in Sarah's life he was the key stone what seemed to be impossible and it was impossible with them but with God nothing shall be thought to be impossible hallelujah oh my the Bible says I look at this of how these over comers in their lifetime how that they lived if I can just read this here Justin referring to it it speaks in the book of Hebrews 11 verse 32 it says concerning the time would fail me to tell of gideon barak samson of and of jeff of david also and samuel of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions who through faith it was through faith that did that that faith that which god had revealed faith you realize faith we can't work ourselves up in faith when God prepared Daniel to go in the lion's den it was exactly that God prepared him to stand there when it came time for the Hebrew furnace God prepared them to stand you say what didn't they prepare all the time they were they were prepared to be prepared for that moment amen that's like God himself working in our life if the Bible said that the righteousness of God is revealed from faith unto faith is that right it's God sovereignly revealing himself and faith is not something we work ourselves up into but faith is sovereignly given by Almighty God hey man it's where we submit our lives to the Lord it's where we embrace the Lord it's where we embrace what God has made known to us it's where we walk faithful to him in all things oh my the Bible says he quenched they quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed Vallon and fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens and these are stones that are part of that arc these are stones that are part of the arch they meant guiding putting weak crumbly stones in there how could how could you put weak crumbly stones and then put a key stone up there he won't make it but better Samuel they one week I know they were weak but he was strong in them you can be strong and be weak then again you can be weak and he can be strong it just depends remember we can't have two waves at one time it's either his way or our way is that right but when we can get our stuff out of the way then God can have the right away women received their dead raised and life again huh I love how that's mentioned here let's say know that there were sisters of old who were faithful to stand upon God's Word amen there was widows in the day a day of Elijah right first the son the boy had passed but where did she take him she took him in the prophets chamber come on somebody took him into a place of life then we found in the time of Elijah here was another Widow and and and her son that had been given to her here he passes away in the heat of the day but what does she do she puts him in the prophet's chamber she doesn't know what to do but she knows I'm gonna let him rest there you know what the prophets chamber is it's called the Upper Room because it was a room that was raised up are you with me it's placing that right there and saying god I don't know how this situation is going to come out but I'm gonna place it in your hands Lord I'm gonna place it in the bed of your presence you with me rod already told in the Book of Revelations that I'm gonna cast all their children in her bed the bed of that unclean woman is all right she's got a bed but God has a bed God has a place of rest a place where you and I rest and that arrest is in him is that right others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection they were living beyond what this life could offer them others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yeah moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted and tormented if I asked right now how many want to be destitute afflicted or tormented you say want to be been there i RM there but you see it wasn't something of a comfortable walk it wasn't a comfortable life it wasn't where everything is just coming the way that we want it you know brother-sister we're we're honest we don't want suffering we don't want suffering sometimes I even wonder when we're asking God for healing are we asking him for healing because we don't want suffering come on friends I'm talking about the humanity we all desire when we're sick and we're buying our body we want to be healed I don't look forward to going to the doctor do you I don't look forward if there has to be surgery or I don't look forward to that but even in our prayers what we recognize is we are submitting our hearts and our lives to the Lord recognize that god when our hearts are in tune with him God will have his way the Lord let all my motives be aligned with what your desire is Lord of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth all these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect one thing that we see that within their lives it was cries moving in their lives he was the keystone of their life he it's him that when you look in each of their lives of how that there were God calling them God dealing with them and then bringing them to that we can say it like this the very apex of their walk with God to where God Himself was had such a preeminence within their lives that when we look back either even through the scriptures to think of how think of how that the Prophet tells us in Christ as the mystery he says when we back through the word we see that he was in the profits he was in the Psalms he was he was in everything it was Christ in it all in each of their lives of Christ and David Christ in Moses it was that Keystone it was all of Christ Himself assembling together the stones of the arc of triumph gathering it all together oh my look at how in the scriptures it in this assembling of the of the stones think about it you know in the mass of of humanity the mass of that that was here even upon the earth and is here upon the earth but yet God he knows where each and every one of his children are God knows and it's God that does the assembling together sometimes in you know you can look at a person but you don't know God is able to look beyond what you are I see because remember the stone is not the outside of appearance Jesus told the Pharisees that their judgment was not a righteous judgment it was judgment based solely upon what they could see there under their knowledge their understanding but how that God here is the Prophet when he reads those portions of Scripture that I read in Hebrews 11 the Prophet takes out of the message perfect strength and perfect weakness he said when we stand there on that day we will stand in the presence of many people that have been weak yet when we look at their lives what we see is the greatness of Christ how did God and in the scriptures where it says in Hebrews 1 that God who in sundry times and in divers manners spake in times past unto the father's by the prophets it was God through the prophets assembling these stones oh and look at this huh the prophets having the word of the Lord God revealing himself to his prophets look at how that even God would bring this out even in the book of Hosea now I love how it's how its alluded to here in the scriptures of how that God said in verse 5 of house Isaiah 6 therefore have I hid them by the prophets I have slain them by the words of my mouth and that judgments are as the light that goeth forth to think of how that the people just you know it's like one big conglomeration even upon this earth friends there's only one thing that could bring a separation and bring God's people unto himself and that would be him and he is the word a man who's not assembling to a church but he assembles unto himself and then worth as it goes out is the you know the Prophet would pick this up and recognising your day in its message and he says of how that that word going out that God he said it agree said let's use a different word instead of hewed let's use the word chopped out it was God chopping out his people when you chop something out it isn't necessarily something that is easy but God by his word he used his people out he separates you from Woodrum the generation and the rest of the world and the people that you're walking with it's his word that brings a separation if it was not for his word going forth listen it is not us that we would figure it out it must be God himself move on our hearts on our lives or we would be just like the rest the Prophet tells us that Noah before God ever spoke to Noah that Noah's seen the conditions of the day he was praying about the conditions of the day he said Noah was praying with his family about the conditions of the day you know what is causing NOAA to do that because he was of God and the presence of God was ready to give a message and Noah was tied to that message that's why the Prophet said that when God gets ready to send a where there's a people on earth that are desiring to line up with truth yes there's just like what we see in the coming months they're big geese that me even there'll be all sorts of life that is going to do what make its annual migration who tells them to go migrate is it a scientific book is it something good on and all of a sudden on the billboard it's a instinct given by God they know it's time and they move they start uniting together they start getting together what's telling them it's something bad that's breaking forward with the conditions and nature and God that's put it in them that they're able to pick up the change and because they're able to pick it up they start uniting together I believe with all my heart that just as God would let that be a testimony in the nature and animal life I believe that there is a greater witness inside of the elect of Almighty God that it resonates in our heart there is a change that's coming it resonated in Moses in Noah's life there's a change that's coming and what did it invited the presence of God to reveal to know what was needed to save him in his household glory be to God hallelujah he rallied Noah you know how the Bible says in the book of Timothy it says in a great house there's many different types of vessels wooden silver gold and it says whosoever will purge himself of these shall be a vessel that's meat sanctified unto the Masters use and unto every good work how can we purge ourselves there must be strength there must be a cleansing source that is able to move our lives where we walk and surrender to Him and begin to apply that in our life what is it it's him calling us into his service it's him calling us into position God is chopping his people out a word that's bringing separation it wasn't easy for Abraham to leave where he was at I'll tell your friends listen serving God inconvenient I hope that don't stumble you but it ain't convenient anyone meant to be easy anything about what's easy that ain't Christianity when you've been born in the Spirit of God it's easy to live for him but there's all kinds of obstacles there's all kinds of hindrances there's tests there's trials there's everything that is placed away why would that be bet him he might declare himself as the great Keystone in your life God allows test he allows trials he permits all those things to come about that he might display himself to you personally because I can't go in on your testimony and you can't go in on mine you got to have your own testimony you have to have your own walk with God you can you need your experiences experiences are important in your walk with God it's God making known to you of the real faith that's been sewn on the inside that there is an acre that's there sometimes you feel like you're ready to break and and give over but there is an acre on the inside no wonder Peter could say the trying of your faith is more precious than gold why it shows that it's not a faith that's here it's a faith that's here something that holds you and you can't explain when you don't have a verbal explanation but the answer is as I'm gonna look to him the Hebrew children when they were standing there they told him and said we don't have an answer as far as a direct answer that God's gonna come and deliver us but we do know this one thing that we're not going to bow down amen you may not know and have everything laid out before you but you can say this I am NOT bowing down God was silent he wanted to hear them testify you know they couldn't even raise their hands at that time they were bound but though their hands were bound their souls had been liberated how because their soul had been liberated the trial could only liberate their hands growing pains of God's Amazing Grace the trying of our faith is more precious than gold what's God doing he's trying every little part that goes into that great arc of triumph he's testing it just like they did that bridge when they spanned that bridge across Australia when there was a man that said it can't be done many others but there was a man that says I can do it but what he did he went down to the rock until I had to have this bridge has got to get set on the rock you know when he went to he went to something that was below that of the surface of even what they could see he went down the rock and a fix those post on the rock then he began to test every boat all of those beans why is he testing them because he's got to make sure cuz that bridge is gonna bear his name hallelujah and the testing of our faith here is it's trying its testing it's not God looking to see are they gonna hold on or they're gonna remain steadfast God knows God allows all of those things to move upon our lives to what his glory might be shown chopping chopping out the people queuing them out by his word think of how that the Lord Jesus here he is he's standing here and I'm just referring to many of these places here that that you know of but all through the Scriptures and the Lord Jesus refers the Pharisees the people the religious people in that day he refers them back to what was spoken is now happening when he says in Matthew 21 42 did you never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes they had went along and remember even how that the Lord Jesus is referring back they had went along and building they looked at this stone and it was odd looking it was different looking but they didn't realize they didn't they didn't catch that this stone is very important this stone is not an optional stone it is important it's what brings the rest of the building together it's what gives meaning to the building it's a cornerstone you risk me hey man it's that's why when the scriptures were Paul could say I haven't laid the foundation where there no man can lay in that's Christ Jesus there's got to be a foundation that is laid it's gotta be a cornerstone in look friends and everyone of our life has got to be the cornerstone it's gotta be Christ amen by the new birth placing himself his life in us and then from that foundation grow up into him who is the head of all things is that right amen we don't grab overnight we grow we mature in his presence but that cornerstone must be laid in our life in every part all things in our life in our marriages in our homes in all things the cornerstone must be present amen he's the foundation stone amen so when we look at how that in the midst of it you know they were looking for him to come but the thing that they were not understanding is all of a sudden here comes a man on the scene by the name of John John begins to preach a message of repentance they don't know who John is they recognize there's something different about this man but they don't catch the significance and they don't know who he is so they ask him who are you now they weren't asking him as far as what's your name who they want to know who are you identify yourself by what by the word who are you that's why and then people don't want to know when they say who are you what church you go to what they're trying to figure out and you pray that it's a life that they see within you it's not another cause of a church that you belong to it's because when you have been baptized into Christ your life is different there's a change in your life it's a separated walk with God that causes others to be thirsty what is it about you what's what's different about you where do you go to church what do you all believe it listen and I hope this doesn't mean it isn't what I believe as far as doctrines the Spirit of Truth leads me to the true doctrine are you with me it bashed me into the truth because the doctrine is the bots on my tree are you is me the truth itself drawing that life that's down there that's hidden beneath draws that up here into the branches branches of righteousness branches of holiness you can know a lot of doctrine and it's all it is here it's a doctrine it's to know him are you with me it's a know him that's life I tell your friends doctrine just alone in itself is dangerous who brother salmon where you going Genesis chapter 6 the Bible said knowledge was increasing in the earth and the Bible said wickedness increased when it's just knowledge men will rely on their knowledge instead of a heart that beats for God we don't rely on our knowledge sure we want God to reveal we want to dwell in that holy knowledge is given by Almighty God but we want to walk with a heart and a life that beats out holiness unto the Lord amen I'll just I know this and I know that and I know this and I know that then they did that in the sardian age they heard the word that Luther was preaching but they heard it in a manner so that they might be able to dispute and argue but there were some who heard it for practical outworking they wanted that word to energize their lives they wanted him to become the be the very theme and be the very source of life pulsating through their lives amen look at how that God is making this known here in the ministry in Matthew 11 Jesus you know he's after John's disciples have departed it begins to ask them what what did you go out to see a reed that's shaken with the wind one that's closed in soft raiment but he says in verse nine of Matthew 11 yea I say unto you more than a prophet John was a prophet but yet he was more than a prophet he was speaking of the hour that had arrived where all the other prophets had testified of this hour that was coming it was Christ in them testifying of his own Advent glory be to God amen it's Christ moving within them and here more than a prophet and it goes on to say for this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee John had already testified to this and the world on the scene is also testifying for what John has said they matter so what what we find is a union we find this in the message and the Ministry of John where Christ Himself bring you even a further testimony this is the one that was spoken of it goes on to say among them that are born of women there have not risen a greater than John the Baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he there's not rose a greater one than John yet you have a Moses think of this there were signs and wonders miracles done in Moses ministry is that right that yet John's position puts it to be greater and the Scriptures tell us he did no miracles what was it that was greater it was the position of the hour had arrived for redemption there were some in that age who were sufficiently impressed with the word that Ministry of John it caught them there they walk into being baptized unto repentance what is that the word was calling them into a place of surrendered and positioned as vessels ready for God's own life to move in them that's what the call of the message it calls you it called me into what into a place to be used of God it calls you and I there is a blood that sanctifies us that the very purpose of God might move in our lives that's why it's just a call to the message is not enough I hope you with me now just to sanctifies not enough it's got to be united with him to where the scripture said Christ who is our life notice how this greater he's to introduce the Messiah look at how that when we see that John the Baptist the Prophet would put it like this and just let me refer to this in in in two places but the brown refer to it like this he says why was he more than a prophet I don't think I have it in there why is he more than it was it was he more than a prophet he was a messenger of the Covenant that bridged the way between law and grace he was the Keystone in there that had been spoke up so John was the Keystone because he had a keystone message the Keystone message is that right what was the Keystone message to introduce the Keystone are you with me it couldn't be John standing there come on friends couldn't be John but it was cries but John's ministry was needful because it was the ministry where the Keystone revelation would come through them to introduce what the Messiah the Keystone here is John's ministry here as as John goes forth then we find that here in the ministry of of of john where john calls out behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world this is he of whom I said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me John's ministry was announcing the Keystone the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world one who is the answer to sin question one who is the answer where all of them who died in good faith they were looking and they were walking by the Lamb walking by that offering uh think of this many of the Old Testament Saints many of them offered lambs are you with me the many of them offered the lamb many of them offered the sacrifice what separated them why was it that not all when all were offering up the land why was it not all because not all offered it in the gate where he chose to place his name God said after his habitation you shall seek after where God has chosen to place his name but not all seeing the significance of that many czars just the lamb all I have to do is offer the lamb it wasn't that they said that per se but that's how they lived but there were others that the that the pulsation of the lamb the prophecy was taken hold on their lives to where that actions were coming out of their life that they didn't know what was going on but God was prophesying through their actions where was it stones that are part of the arc of triumph then you find here that the Lord Jesus walking in his earthly ministry we know he's taken in judgment he submitted himself into the hands he didn't fight against it he he was a lamb the Bible said lamb a lamb that was led as dumb before her shears led to the slaughter he wasn't deceived to the slaughter he was led he wasn't pulled he was led willingly he went but this was not on a deception like what took place in the garden this was willingness brew obediently and it goes to count Calvary here shed the blood out of his body goes the water and the blood those very elements that he is going to take to make up his bride his body gather the rest of his stones that are part of the arc of triumph that come down through the Gentile ages assembling stones together the Bible says when he yielded up the gold that's powerful yielded his whole time was yielding in the very closing moment upon his earthly journey with a beauty the scriptures say if I may read that and Isaiah 53 you made his soul an offering for sin I know we've been through this months ago but he went for the lowest hell bearing our sins he had to he was he was the answer and then after however met him however long that he's there he begins to ascend up sin had no power on his life he begins to send up after his unloaded the sin of the world leaves it down there inhale on him who brought it in the first place he's not coming back laden with sin he is relieved of that how did he get relief he walked in obedience to the word of what the word required for him that's how sin is lifted from a life walking obedience to what God is asking his sins and here there's some that are held captive he knocks on the door and when he comes to that door each one of them as they recognized him in their generation they recognize him as he stands right there the same how did they recognize him because he is the same yesterday today and forever he's known by his characteristics you with me he's known by his characteristics of who he is Ezequiel that's that will in the middle of the wheel they're all excited what were they excited about he's that stoned and they say he's the one I saw hewn out of him out without ass what were they excited about they saw what the message and their day had called them to they were seeing him who is the fulfillment of it and the fulfillment of that was bringing deliverance to them they had already walked free of the world now came a Liberty that will loosen them from the very hold where they were in paradise and when there was a hold that says you can't ascend into the presence of God because the payment has not been made but Jesus said my blood has been shed for them I hope you understand he came there to paradise he let's say to know that my blood is still hot on the ground I've paid for their sin I overcame he's standing there in authority in the midst of darkness in the midst of hell he's standing with authority and Satan can't do nothing about it why because it was a life that was lived in obedience to the Word of God a life that was surrender he was the supreme sacrifice that would call the rest of the lambs that are in the Lamb's Book of Life were the graves they were held the Bible didn't say they were dead it said they slept they slept they were waiting but when he arose then they arose with him he died but then he rose they came out of the graves with him and as the opening scripture we read they appeared unto many here it was the first rapture of the New Testament how did that rapture happen there had to be a death first then there comes forth life out of death and here he stands as the keystone to it all the Bible said that he that ascended but that he first decent and he led captivity captive and he gave gifts unto men what was he doing he was giving of his life giving witnesses of his life you recognize the scripture said that here in the Book of Isaiah it says therefore we'll add divided verse 12 I will divide him a portion with the great who's the great God there is no one greater and he shall divide the spoil with the strong who that's wrong the children because he had poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors he divided the spoil what's the spoil the life that you were intended to have he made a way through the purchase that you and I could come back to our inheritance what did Jesus do his death his burial death and his resurrection brings me to my inheritance that was left me and through his life he has he rose from the grave where you had all of those Old Testament Saints who were worshipping under the blood of the Lamb those that had worshiped in Shiloh those that have worship therein Jerusalem those that had worshipped in those places given by God here they are they're a symbol and now the Keystone rises into its position and they walk out after him as he walks through the prophecy of the Scriptures it is the fulfillment of the word is that right Jesus never went to the grave and and and hollered for them to come out the prophecy being fulfilled in his life emanated a voice that's why and our lives is not just saying here our lives are to speak speak it was him coming up out of the great was spoken that word that voice went forth and the rest they rose with him here's the Keystone the Scriptures I love how it says in the scripture I'm closing it says in Colossians 2 verse 13 and you being dead in your sins in the uncircumcision of your flesh have to be quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses blotting out the handwriting of Ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to the cross and having spoiled principalities and powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it he arose the mammal of I says if brother Ram says they had glorified body they appeared back on earth for firstfruits of the proof of God's power and the resurrection there they was robbed and stripped principalities and took death and hell smothered it up and rolls up on Easter morning and entered into the kingdom with him they rose and here they were walking for forty day upon this earth and Satan couldn't do one thing about not one thing about it he it was a witnessing of prophecy that had come to pass they walk testifying of his victory forty days and the Lord Jesus has been looking at speaking to the disciples forty days showing infallible proof and giving them instruction and you know what that's a type of the Holy Ghost in you and in me when that seal has been put upon the soul Satan can't touch he can afflict your body he can try to flicked you in your spirit but he can't touch that soul because the soul is sealed unto the day of redemption what's it sealed by the gospel of your salvation what is the gospel of your salvation the one in the hour what is the one in the hour that which is prophesied but it's now fulfilled in you and you who are once dead in sin and trespasses house hearing and here you now walk in a newness of life well at one time in your life you were searching but then Christ begins to make himself known to you I'm the Keystone I am the piece that brings the picture together I am the necessary part of your life that brings all I am that life piece I am that masterpiece I am that Keystone that were all things in your life when you're walking through the rector all of the parts of that arc of triumph as I read to you before they have all of these battles that are law all these great battles that's been through time and I say to you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our soul were identified with Moses were identified with Noah if we'd have been indoors they would have been working on the off with north we lived in Moses day we crossed the Red Sea we have been applying the lambs blood in that day we're at dinner fight with Christ in this day we were identified with him back there hallelujah we're at dinner 5:00 with Jenna with Jenna had in his birth and the way that the birth was but nobody wanted anything to do with him but yet God knew there was a place and a part for fulfillment in Jenna's life Gideon's life what Gideon could not see he couldn't see what God was seeing in his life but what do I say hold on Gideon keep looking in the water keep living under the prints of God and let him who knows and what he has chosen or day he will reveal and make real in you what he knows is there thy mighty man of Valor he knows he who knows the potentials is the one that brings to light what is potential into reality here he stands the mighty Conqueror not a weak Christ but a mighty Conqueror he's the keystone in your life is a mighty Conqueror brings everything together all the tests all the trials they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony a little yeah faithful is he who called you either have begun the good work in you shall perform it until the day of Jesus Christ he's faithful he symbols all things to himself and let me just say this to you the arc of triumph over there it doesn't have road on it all the failures it doesn't have in the battles the mistakes that are made he miscalculated this he miscalculated that you don't have that wrote there on that arc of triumph is divine commentary Paulette has on there here's the victory that's been won hallelujah that's why the songs that we sing the trials of this world will seem nothing when I get to the end of the way hallelujah well said in Romans 8 these things that we are going through they not compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us what is it we're looking beyond not be encompassed about with just what we are seeing and all these thing the negatives we're looking to him look to him look to him and you'll find the bike we'll get to where he's at when you get to look at you how can I can I keep this don't look to him hey man it's him that laid the plumb line it's him that laid the board it's him that provided the vehicle it's him that provided at all it's him by grace that gave you the opportunity what do I have to do get on the bike and look to him hallelujah its grace that I provided it for you hallelujah amen and at the end of the way that which you have been riding on becomes so precious to you it becomes more precious you with me Rebecca that camel you're riding on and you watered it become so precious that baptism of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is more precious this morning in your life that's why you can sing this song something every day I see is helping me faithfully to overcome what your loving Lord in my life in this assembly let it be the Keystone that's the focused it's the Keystone that makes known the victory and that victory is lived you are alive don't you love you faithful is he that God is the Keystone if there's a problem there's a situation job and marriage family life home whatever is the key say Lord let everything be put in that place where you can move in position and he will move it gives you the strength it calls you to submit and be drawn to him but he can step in it's faithful to his work and you say man right here all of this we could has been a much more time all of the prophecy became according to his word you know what that shows I know it's simple but faith in his word what he has said brings him on the scene or your life and you know God makes this promise known before us that we might call upon him and draw what she's amongst Lord yer your people Lord each of our life nor do you see every need you see Jordan and Lord Jesus it's true Lord you are the Keystone the keystone of all things Lord you are the victory in the lives of believers you were the victory in the life of Abraham the victory in Noor father you this morning if there's one that doesn't know you that way I pray that God they would receive they would Lord give of their lives and of themselves Lord surrendering all things the Lord in their life you would be the Keystone all of the prophets those who live down through the time Lord they they were moved by you they sought after they were looking as pilgrims and strangers they sought a better country they were not mindful of that country they came out of the Lord you you caused them to seek there was a longing in them for that other country from which they had been touched Lord Jesus just as you moved to assemble those stones to Lord that moves upon lives and once you move in our life for God to draw us into yourself which you that moves Lord sanctify it's you that moves to feel it's you that moves on our life Lord Lord maturing us ripening us Father I pray God this morning Lord you see the needs Lord and we believe Lord God that as we are here Lord in your presence Lord God we stand Lord in need of you and we ask Oh God that father for each and every request every need Lord ones that are behind the hands Lord and the hearts Lord God that are open before you I pray Heavenly Father then you would just Lord God make yourself known to them according to the need the petition Lord the requests that they have Lord in you Lord God you are that Keystone Lord you're that part Lord God in our lives to think of it Lord without the Keystone here in this church but it's like your prophet said it is nothing but a bejeweled corpse without the leading of the Holy Ghost without the Keystone Oh God same in any life Lord any heart Lord we we recognize the Lord that is you showed us here in your word you're you're very careful to make known to us James would pick it up in the midst of talking about a fervent man at the prayer the fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth lunch a righteous man and with him that passage law he would make known that Elijah was a man subject to like passions such as well that wasn't taking away Lord the Lord shows that in all of that you you allow the humanity to be shown their Lord that's not our focus but we can look at that Lord and we can see Lord God that father that you are faithful Lord you're faithful to your word it's you that gives directions strength and leadership Lord father I pray God this morning but in even northern it just it's filling their heart Lord I need another touch from you go I need a touch from you lord I need a I need a fresh touch Lord from you North afraid that you would just just sweep over their life Lord your God is they Lord in their heart in their mind they're throwing mine to you Lord as you said I'll draw nigh

your great sovereignty permit to come our way Lord your faithful your merciful Lord Lord Jesus I just commit Lord every life and reformable unto you Lord strengthen Lord each of your children Lord we pray in the name of Jesus Christ you love him are you witnesses at Keystone [Music] Keystone many times of the Prophet went through so many different situations he talked about in his own ministry lives situations where God took what was seemed like it was destined in a certain way but yet the Lord Jesus came on the scene the Keystone you know you think about all of them all of the prophets those who were worshipping under the lamb they were praying for what God had revealed to them they were praying for that that's what their life was about if we could say like this when they sit down for breakfast and dinner and different that's what their life was about that's how they made their decisions in their life it was about what God had revealed to them they prayed for what God revealed that it would become real in their lives that's the same thing to see that what God makes known in the things that the Lord has spoken when we seek after it when we give ourselves and say Lord feel that place there's a place that is voice and Lord feel that place more fill that area if there's a door that he hasn't went into yet wouldn't you let him in that let him move into that area let him make himself known and what you thought to be impossible but let me let him make himself known that I am the mighty Conqueror that I am over at all [Music] I love the Scriptures where it says ye have highly exalted him and given to him a name which is above every other name amen the name of Jesus Christ he is our Redeemer our savior our deliverer he's everything to us and that's what he wants to

sacrifice and the only source of [Music] yes [Music] bless you all this morning it's a privilege that Ethan here has made a stand for the Lord and he's asked the Lord to come into his heart he's repented of his sins and it's so a wonderful thing as a as a parent you know it's you know as a parent you have you know you like your kids to do certain things right usually it's the stuff you like to do so you know that's all right that's all just kind of a parents love but I think what goes beyond that you know is your desire to see them serve the Lord and it goes beyond just your human fatherly and motherly desires it's the it's God and in our hearts and that's our our deepest desires our children would follow follow the Lord and Ethan over the years definitely has the Lord's moved in his life and in the past couple weeks especially he's felt real like he's really made a commitment to the Lord and he'd liked to take the next step as we talked about the stones and may this be a stone in his life that he can nail that down and you know it's it's a thing just thinking the other day there was an instance came up with with him that I guess it had happened several months ago but he was still in school but there were some things that happened at school that that he didn't know what he had done was bad but yet he had done them and then when he recognized that what he had done was wrong he really you know it really touched his heart and for me just to see a real true repentance like that you know it's it really touches your heart and you can really understand that you know there may be a lot of things people do or whatever that may look big but really the repentant heart like that will move God it's just you know so we appreciate that anythin that real repentance and as we will baptize him and you know even even this morning just of course remember him in prayer going forward is even this morning he kind of the devil was kind of playing with his mind a little bit right but you know we understand that's just the enemy and you know that's what he said I promise God I'm gonna do it so I'm gonna do it so I believe you keep your promise to God and he'll keep his promise to you too to give you his Holy Spirit so that's that's our that's our desire so pray dear dear God we are we are thankful Lord as as a as a parent and as a family of believers here Oh God that that you have moved again Lord Jesus and pricked a little one's heart and Oh God that the little ones would come to you Lord and how that touched your hearts so many years ago Lord and we just
