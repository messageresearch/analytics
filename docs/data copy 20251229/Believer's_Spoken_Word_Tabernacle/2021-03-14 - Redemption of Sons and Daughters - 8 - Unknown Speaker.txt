one of you but without that we'd be no more than just a lodge or any other meeting to be nothing without him so we we just want to invite him to have his way you know if i was coming to your house or you were coming to mind you know the thing that you want to be able to do i would trust that people would feel that way at my house that they would feel comfortable if they needed something they just asked for it i'm one i'm one that i like to see people eat and enjoy themselves you know and so and uh be comfortable you're setting in the recliner put your feet up it's all right that's what it's there for i believe that's that's what's in our hearts we want to invite the lord jesus we want to make him feel so welcome we want to make him feel so welcome to where that when he after this services is over with he could say i'm going to visit there again as a matter of fact i'm going to walk with that brother i'm going to walk with that sister i'm going to walk they make me feel so at home they just let me be me that's what we desire don't amen well we just we're just thankful to be in the house of the lord this morning so glad to see different ones different visitors here and among us may god bless you i know we're all looking forward to the time we can get rid of these masks i know it's a great great shout on that right there but you just let's just keep praying keep looking to the lord because he's the one that we've been trusting in anyhow i i don't you know how it is i i look at things and i'm just grateful that we have he is our high priest he's the one that we are are looking to this is where our rest is complete is in him so we just want to just also welcome different ones here and her brother see brother juan and sister rachel so good to have you here with us this morning and i think it's carlos wife god bless you good to see you this is this is really tricky with these mass times you know but also i want you to remember brother ray hernandez in prayer my brother he had the surgery as we mentioned on wednesday we were praying for him on thursday even before the service and late last night i got a call and we just had prayer together on the phone where they went in into three different places you know how they put the three holes and it just it's just he's been in a lot of pain a lot of pain hard to lay down hard any way you place it but i believe god's still god god is still god the scripture one of the greatest titles of all the titles that all descriptive of him but he said he's the lily of the valley and you know what that means to be the lily of the valley there's no opium like jesus there's no one that can take away the sting of sin there's no one that can take away pain like he can amen and we are witnesses of that so we just we want to lift our brother in prayer and you continue to remember him in prayer and i know mr shirley cress as well just continuing to keep her in prayer you know she's in a process of recovery and you know if you don't see sister shirley here in church because she's set here time and time again in pain and you don't see her in church then you know that there's it's something that's kind of really beyond within the pain and things but you just lift our sister up in prayer and i'll tell you just how i've been praying she had that hip replacement and i've just asked god i said god let there be a fusing and a united if you took bread and you created lord then you can take this right here god and bring a fusing and a creation to where that just becomes one with her body say brother samuel you don't believe i believe that with all my heart i believe that god can supply a hip where there's no heal amen we are living in the moment in the time that he is still the same yesterday today and forever amen where there was no eyes he created eyes amen he's the same god is he not where death was in our life he came and he went from death to life went from darkness to life he's still the same god [Music] would you stand with me and let's just offer a word of prayer before we turn into the scriptures this morning amen yes a very fitting song only believe let's just approach him in prayer you have a need on your heart just put it before god this morning heavenly father we love you lord jesus oh we just appreciate you lord you're everything to us lord you're our life oh god for every need for every situation oh god you're the ever-present god lord we just asked this morning there's been prayer requests and i know that lord even now there's needs upon parts maybe even needs that can't even be articulated or put into words you know what that need is lord we just asked this morning that god brother ray sister surely lord sister irma you've got different ones lord that you'll just move in a very supernatural way we believe that the angel of the lord still passes through the neighborhoods of god to confirm your word oh god in the lives of believers lord so we just invite you o god that you would come lord god move for these needs in a special way and for every lord need behind that hand that heart lord that's there would you just move in a very special way god

people to get out of the way that you can come just have the right away lord in our lives lord we want to invite you lord we welcome you holy spirit lord we give ourselves to you now ask that if there's anything that we've said or done lord knowing that god that we fail many times but we lord plead the blood of jesus christ and we ask god that father there would be nothing lord that would hinder lord but we just invite your presence more would you just continue to move in upon us we pray minister to every life to every need god for those that don't know you may they be so drawn to you lord lives lord that god are lord in need of the holy ghost may they god just lord receive your god what you have for them lord may there be such a hunger that rises o god in their hearts lord may lord those that are sick lord receive their touch lord from you because we believe lord your present here lord god we give you the praise honor glory in jesus name let's turn in our bibles to first john chapter four say thank the musicians john chapter 4 and we're just going to read a few verses of scripture here beginning at verse 7. beloved let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth god now we realize that when we're reading the scripture we don't read it like a newspaper but there must the author himself there's an inspiration the holy spirit must come upon that word and so we recognize this for god is love for love is of god now there's a lot that can be said or many can say well i love or i love or i love but this is speaking of god himself this is not a love that where we love those who love us and don't love those who don't love us it goes even deeper than that this is a love that reaches to such depth that they love god and he is the word notice this he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love in this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him so this is what this love is to do is to give us life now i'm looking around and every one of us you're standing here this morning you're a lie you you have you have life here this morning natural life he's not speaking of natural life he's speaking of spiritual life he's speaking of that which is true life hearing is love not that we love god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins beloved if god so loved us we ought also to love one another no man hath seen god at any time if we love one another god dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us i want you to think of this phrase here and his love is perfected in us hereby know we that we dwell in him and he and us because he hath given us of his spirit his spirit is his life is his love oh my may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i want to just continue to dealing with this thought on the redemption of sons and daughters of god as we've been looking at it and i want to just begin here this morning in looking to record as we look in the scriptures we started into this a little last week but seeing that the love of god that has come to us in order to set us free because the real walk of a believer is a walk of a love affair between them and god it's it's not a law if it if it's no more than just a law the heart is not really right even though a person within can do everything seemingly all the t's are crossed and the eyes are dotted but if it's not from the heart it's not even accepted it's got to be from the heart and this is what god comes to work on because as the scripture says here not that we loved god but god loved us you see god's love was so great to where where the scriptures could say in first uh on colossians it would say when we were we were enemies in our minds not speaking of this this is not what he's speaking of in our souls we were enemies unto god romans would would paul would write that in romans as well when we were enemies but yet god himself commended his love to us that he died for us so then we come to the place to recognize there's there's a whole purpose it's a whole reason there's a reason and a purpose of this of the whole sacrificial death burial and resurrection of the lord jesus christ as he come in order to loosen you and i that we might come to life and come back to serve the real purpose that he ordained for our life and so he come to break the hold of change you see many of these things when we look at this of god's love there's examples and i want to just look at this of how brother brown would take us through this in this message and i'm going to refer to this this quote here and and just read through some things within this quote because it's very pertaining to the time even that we're living in right now and brother bannon would he would speak of how and he's dealing with the part of where when god brought israel out of egypt by a promise god sent his word and remember he sent his word by his prophet when it came time for israel to be delivered god god called his ordained man to the side and god revealed himself to moses now listen to me moses knew the promise but just knowing it did not have power but once he met the god who made the promise it took a man who ran from things when it didn't go right it brought a courage in him because he knew now where he was standing the ground that he was now standing on was more sure than even the ground he was standing on are you with me because the bible said heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall never fail so god comes to position moses in the word reveals himself i am the word and moses goes forth to proclaim that word and then we find israel comes out under the authority of that word and they come to this place in the wilderness and we realize here now where there's a failure there's a fault there's a falling that takes place where they make another god here they are they begin to make a molten calf like what they've seen in in in in egypt and they are making it to say well moses isn't here well let's just go on back let's let's go on back you see in the midst of that time you as a bible reader you're aware of what took place god himself would have wiped israel out because listen let me listen to me very clearly israel it wasn't that they were ignorant of this god had said in a previous chapters make no other gods but god in his mercy in his mercy you see listen failure to obey the word results in judgment this god's a just god as much as he suggests god for any other promise of his word he listen that's what makes him a just god he will always come according to his word if a life doesn't come up to the word and they forsake the word judgment comes true is that right but here you find moses he steps in the way of the wrath of god that word is burning in his heart a word of a promise that i will bring you out and bring you into the land of promise into your inheritance into the place where it can be revealed of who you really are and so there must be a word that is present a revelation you see this is why revelation is so important revelation has prevailing power revelation holds the mercy of god revelation holds wisdom and let me be very clear as i always have revelation is not knowledge of this earth revelation is not something you find out or figure out by probing and countless hours of reading it takes a sovereign work of god revelation is sovereignly given by god matter of fact brother branham in questions and answers 54 he says this is what causes many mental breakups is people trying to press into things instead of yielding themselves to god he said they study themselves into breakups and it's not that we're not there's nothing we're not to read or study but it's to recognize it must be god who comes and reveals his word as we give ourselves to the word so now with this setting here moses said god you're going to have to step over me in order to get to them that was a type because all through the scriptures there are tights that speak of the lord jesus of the new birth it's all the way through the scripture it's it's one the the bible is one great uh book of redemption that speaks of the love of god unfolding for his children brother brown would say like this when god was going to take the life of the whole world and destroy it all were sinners condemned to die christ died for us all and god could not cross over christ being his own son and when jesus gave himself freely that he might pay the way and he says now he alludes to this place he said now moses couldn't do that because moses had no blood but human blood like we are his blood would not suffice so you say how did god not cross over moses because moses had the revelation by the spirit abiding in his life he was standing there as a representative of god in that hour it was that revelation that would break the chains of egypt upon the people's life and it would be that same revelation that would put him in the land so it was all a type of the prevailing revelation that would lay in the revealing of jesus christ that there was coming of blood that in that blood cell would be alive and when that revelation would begin to strike a heart it would pack a person from darkness into light it would pass from death unto life it would break the holds of sin and unbelief and the chains and the darkness of the world it would relieve a life of slavery and condemnation and bring them into divine love and service unto almighty god it was a type he said jesus being the blood of god himself the creative blood of god god just excused the entire human race then because it all laid upon him and he went to calvary and died out of the presence of god and suffered and was cast into hell you realize nobody has to go to hell if a person goes to house because they made a choice nobody has to go to hell as a matter of fact brother brown said you'll have to run roadblocks to get there gotta put up a roadblock go right on through it another roadblock go right on through it you see he he was cast into hell because he was sin our sins was upon him there being our burden bearer he took our sins to calvary and from calvary to hell and god raised him up on the third day for a perpetuation for our sins and today he is the only mediator between god and man him alone now who is he he's the word amen is that right he's the living god he is our high priest no other man is a mediator if anybody else is a mediator between you and god you're still in your sins are you with me this is why there's a there's a while the the church that it's religion spread all over the world they've got they've gotten what they thought it's mediators and a man who speaks upon earth and he can forgive sins but you see there's only one that can forgive sins and that's god and if the word isn't there there is no forgiveness of sins forgiveness of sins it's more than just a good feeling we're talking about a work that goes down and deals with the very root of the problem of why the sin is there it's got to be a word that's able to address that a word in authority that's able to back the devil up a word that's able to dismantle his hold of unbelief on that life a word that can say let my son go that he might serve me hallelujah a word that comes with authority glory be to god he's the only mediator between god and man and we're freely pardoned and forgiven god don't even know we ever sin our sins were put in the sea of forgetfulness never to be remembered no more listen we cannot do that ourself we are finite he's infinite and our finite we can still remember because we're not big enough you see we're not able to put our sins there so it takes the work of an infinite god and when an infinite god doesn't work inside of a finite one then you have an infinite god that has that has moved to an infinite work in a finite being so then that that life is no longer just a creature of time but now is a creature of eternity or as the scriptures could say a new creation in christ jesus this is a work by the infinite one he is so great that he ever forgets we ever did sin now see even after what god has done such a such a depth of work of the creation of the infinite one in our lives we still have the memories of everything that was done while we were there in sin we have memories but the nature is no longer there the nature's gone the very root of it the very problem in the first place that's why you stand justified in the presence of almighty god that's why in his presence you never ever did sin why god don't take the old man and clean him up he brings him to a place kills him and a new man steps here it's where the seed and the seed of his life unite together and bring forth a new man a new creation as he said behold i make all things anew is that right so when we when we when we see this this is why that that we see in the scripture he says we are sons and daughters in his presence and all things that he was we are he become my sin that i might become his righteousness he become your sin that you might become his righteousness god cannot see sin cannot see no sin in you as long as your confession is in christ jesus notice in christ jesus the anointed word as long as your life the confession is your life not just what's spoken here but what is spoken out of here as long as our confession is in him then god can see no sin in your eyes oh my now brother brown takes this up and he said now someone told me he said some time ago they said man if i ever believed a thing like that i'd really turn on the steam i'd paint the town red i'd go to every dance call i'd get so drunk abraham said why you're already secured in christ what difference does it make you see what it is when this person said man if i believe such a thing like that you mean i could just go do whatever i want to do well to a real believer i do what i want to do i could drink as many beers as i want to drink don't stop the internet now i don't want to drink that the desire has been taken away i'm not doing things because it's a law he took the desire out of my life we're not bound by a law or under fear this is divine love it really sets you free that's why when this person said well if i really believe that man i'd go paint the town red they're not where they need to be they might be looking at that this of what brother brown had said but if you ever really get it to where it needs to be down on the inside it doesn't matter they can put all the cigarette joints all the stripped off all the women and everything else there's a love affair on the inside an anchor that holds you by the power of the new birth [Applause] are you with me i'm talking about a living god who brings a living reality into that life oh my he says that shows you haven't got it if the love of god ever struck your heart in the tenderness of jesus christ notice in the tenderness of jesus christ you would be so in love with him the world would be dead as your sin that's how you know you have the holy spirit not because you could scream shout speak uh speaker tongues or whatever but when sin becomes dead and you're alive in jesus christ oh love of god how rich how pure lebron will give an example and this one he gives it here and gives it over in perfect faith as well but he talks about a man down in louisville and this man had you know really lived an awful life but one day he met the lord jesus and he became as brother branham would describe it a real staunch christian in other words he's true and there was a young lady here in that same church and you know she had been a real staunch christian but she had never you know been out in the world before she had to have her own experience but she had never went out and ran like he ran and all the scars and everything that he had experienced but they fell in love with one another and they got married and brother branham relates this in this way he says you know they after they had been married about two years and things like that she she told him she said dear she said i suppose it's kind of hard for you just a new christian she said i've been a christian since i was a little girl for you a young christian to stand all the whiles and temptations that goes with it after you've sinned so long you say well it does become a battle she said i want you to remember one thing if the enemy does upset you somewhere and you fall and you go back into sin don't stay away from home i want you to come on home you're going to find at home the same wife that you married i'll help you to pray back and pray through and get back to god again i don't want you to stay away look i married you upon the basis of not what you were but i married you because i loved you and she said no matter what you do i still love you i married you because i loved you boy if that revelation we could just preach on marriage right here if that revelation can stick you don't marry somebody on the pretence and hope of what they can become you marry them for who they really are hey listen when god sought you and i out he's looking beyond all the sin and the darkness in our life he's not making excuse for it but he knows down on the inside if i can get to that inside man that's where my my power my love is released to that inside man the darkness will flee from that life it won't have to say don't do this don't do that don't do this why because the lawgiver himself has moved on the inside think of this now that watch how brother bram goes with this he said now the man that day at work he was heard repeating it where he was working how could a man do anything wrong against something like that did you hear that how could a man do anything wrong against something like that when somebody loves you that way how could you do anything wrong hallelujah when a woman loves that man so much no matter what he did was willing to come back and take him again and try it again now you multiply that by a billion or maybe we could say beyond the national debt multiply that by a billion and then you have some idea of what the love of god is what had happened is that man in the story he did not take what she said and has a license for him to sin if he would have he wouldn't have really been really in love with her or ever received the same love that she had projected you see this is why the scripture says not that we love god for love is of god god is love we needed the love of god to come to you and i and be projected into our lives because in all of our efforts we could never project back in our own earthly love filial love the love that was being projected to us we needed god to come and project that love to you and i and there had to be a part on the inside just like there's a part in your cell phone there's a chip that's in there and that chip has the ability to receive a signal that's projected to it and channel that voice from an unseen rail there is a seed of god that lays in a heart that's made there to receive the projected love of god and project it back not with a weakened strength not with a weakened signal but reflected in the same power the same glory that it was sent in hallelujah it was a love affair with them not alone not a duty are you with me it wasn't a prenuptial agreement [Music] preach somebody when a man falls in love now watch out what's up this parallel when a man falls in love with jesus christ oh the things of the world he said when you think of what he did for you this is key in the light of the scripture in the light of the scripture not in the light of some emotion but in the light of facts what it is then there is something happens in you when the new birth comes then sin is as dead as midnight when as long as that light is in you how can darkness shine you say how could darkness shine it's a false light is that right false light false evidences darkness shine false light but it must be true light in john 1 true light now shining the bible promised in the end time there would be light in the evening time a time as the bible says in isaiah 16. gross darkness is upon the face of the earth but thy light has come and the glory of the lord has risen upon you so this light is his life his person notice that's what he says as long as the light's in you how can darkness shine it can't do it that's what god did to one man who throwed himself in the gap that could take the promise she brings it right back down into moses life at this time the scripture speaks to us in ephesians chapter 2 verse 4. but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us i want you to think of this god's mercy we did not deserve his mercy if we got what we deserve we get judgment but the mercy of god the richness of his mercy wherein his great love that he loved us now to think of this of how that god as he he paid the way he paid the price he became as we read in our scripture this morning our propitiation or it's the expiator or one who removes the sin not just distant forgiveness of it but who goes down and deals with the problem in our life he deals with what it is that you and i are no longer going to be twain where here is god and here we are but where now god and man become reconciled together in a union that's god's desire is that he would walk in us live in us talk through us he would project his very life through you and i this is the whole hold down through the scriptures of the union not where we're two separate people but where that our lives become the very reflection of jesus christ upon this earth and you and i could not make a way there's nothing that we could do to make this possible but he has made it possible he not only made it possible but god's determination and sending and coming to the gentiles which was hidden part in the word of god god himself would send his word to you and i but through him by a messenger in every age as a matter of fact that messenger would not bring his own light he will he is a star he is reflecting the light from god into that age into the church of the living god what light is he reflecting revelations 1 1 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto john you see that revelation of jesus christ is what is personal between you and god a man can't teach it into you a man can't school it into you your experience is predestinated in the hand of almighty god that's why when you hear the word it has a sound to it that resonates in your heart it's a sound of freedom it's a sound of liberty it's a sound you've been longing for why there's something on the inside to receive that love that's being projected [Applause] now listen revelations 1 16 and he had in his right hand his authority and power seven stars seven messengers and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword why is to cut away the unbelief are you with me you see the sword goes forth to circumcise cut away the stoniness cut away the world from our lives and his countenance that's his person his presence his countenance was as the sun shineth in its strength see in every generation i'm saying these things very purposely in every generation god would take a man those seven stars in his right hand whom god himself he would reflect god would in that light of god would be emitted and they that light would be shine into the church what did paul say in first corinthians 4 he would speak to you and i and say that same light that shined in the beginning god hath shined into our hearts he says we preach not ourselves we preach jesus christ is that right we preach him he's the he's the light is that right so they would project this vision of the love of god into the church in the light of the scripture what jesus christ did for us they would reveal who he is and the benefits that belong to us as his beneficiaries you know you've got benefits you've got rights as the son and daughter of god and there's got to be somebody tell you what your rights are if you don't know what your rights are you'll keep on living beneath your privileges but when somebody lets you know what your rights are let me tell you something when your rights are made known to you you've got a right to rise up that's god giving you authority to say i receive what belongs to me brother it's not a second-hand revelation it's the very one who wrote your name in the word where you were in the beginning that same god who came down and took upon flesh is now ministering the inheritance of the covenant hallelujah the evidence ain't out in the field somewhere he packs the evidence with him do pack the evidence with you too come on now i've got to stay out of that it's the benefits that belong to the beneficiaries of his let me say this that surrendered vessel one of those stars in his right hand they would herald the overcoming message in every age he that happened here to here notice god addresses the revelation relative to one person because why it's a trumpet what's a trumpet do when a trumpet sounds it denotes war and that trumpet sounding is declaring war on the devil where the devil has held god's children that trumpet sounds out it lets them know there's an atonement there's a blood there's a liberty that can set you free it has already done it you must receive it a trumpet sounds not with obscurity not with maybe it's a certain sound that rings out with a life that is surrendered in the right hand of god power and authority and glory that's why god sends his messengers they are from his right hand they are one god has not entrusted it to the church to emit this light amen i'm talking about in the light of the scripture they herald an overcoming message to that age and those who are ordained to overcome they hear it amen [Music] they receive it amen are you with me and the strength of god comes in their life to fully manifest overcoming power can i preach a little here when that overcoming power has come in let sickness come there's a power behind them let the devil say you'll never make it there's a power behind them there's a power that the devil said i'll set this trap or i'll set this but there's a power behind them that lifts them above the hole of the enemy they know in their heart something something's happened something's changed i'm no longer the same i'm not bound i'm not subservient to the devil i don't have to listen to your mind battles i don't have to receive of your lies i'll stand in that liberty when sickness comes when times of trouble comes there's a power in your life that moves you through it that navigates you through it when you feel like i'll never make it but there's one on the inside that can declare to you i've already made it there's a strength that's released in that moment that's what this message does when it comes first timothy 2 5 there's one god and one mediator between god and man the man christ jesus notice the man christ jesus the anointed word there's one man who's a mediator a go-between god and man and so that same god here he stands as the go-between that man sinful man and a holy god he's a media there's only one mediator between god and man and that's the man christ jesus who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time the payment's already been made but you see without that revelation in the light of the scripture shining it emits a light that doesn't show it being paid for you you say what do you mean to where everything's always trying to well i'm trying to live a better life and help me to be a let's just let we're going to try to be better people and we're gonna try to be real good and that ain't what christianity is psychology produces that stuff that ain't what i'm talking about that ain't what he went to calvary for and rose up on that easter morning [Applause] he didn't pay the price to become a psychologist he made a way that he might reveal himself i am your lord i'm your savior i'm the redeemer i'm your shepherd i'm your deliverer i'm your all in all [Applause] hallelujah so this is not just it's not a historical event alone to where we just look back to calvary but let me tell you something the same dove that led the lamb to calvary is the same one who has been revealed through the seven church age messengers that same life has been emitted into the church of the living god you say what are you saying i'm telling you that the one who paid the price the one who is the only mediator between god and man and he is the word and when that revelation of jesus christ in that age comes it is the mediator that has come on the scene in order to ratify the covenant with your heart so this vessel that god would choose but say you're laying an awful lot on that vessel you take away the seven stars and we have nothing but church darkness because it's not their light this message that god sent through his prophet brother branham this ain't another continuation like well that's dwight moody and that's all the rest one of them were great men but they were not the prophet of god god made a promise in his word before that great and dreadful day of the lord let me tell you we're here at the time of judgment being a good old boy ain't going to get you here you've got to be washed in the blood of the lamb you've got to be set free by the power of the holy ghost and god sent a word when god said lest i come and wipe out this earth and smite it with the curse but in this hour god has stepped on the scene to reveal himself as the mediator he came down with his mind on his covenant a rainbow was upon his head that's what the cloud was out there in sabino county it was god coming back with the authority of his word let a devil raise his head that devil's already been defeated there's the authority of the word the mediator is here the high priest is here let the devil stick his head up it'll get cut off boo devil [Applause] one that was yielded to god one that as god will continue to reveal himself what do you find in his life things that he might have just thought the brother aaron he couldn't think no more than that until god revealed it to him he's looking at the scripture but he can do no more until god reveals it to him that is the pattern of every prophet you check down through the old testament and not on a man who can go in and will his way and pry this in and out that's not a prophet a prophet doesn't say he went to the word it says the word of the lord comes to him and god will not do anything except he reveal himself to the prophet so anything god's doing in this hour it will be according to the word that he has sent or through his prophet of malachi 4 amen which is god's promised word now look at this surrendered vessel this surrendered vessel would be one that would be able to stand in gaps breaches remember when you read in the book of ezekiel where god would speak of israel here was israel you would look at them and say my goodness what a people what a people a promise well that's true there is a lot of promises that were made to them but when god would describe the spiritual condition he would look upon them when he would look upon the walls of jerusalem and god would display that as though there's no man to make up the gaps there's no man to fill the breaches meaning that which is separation in other words sin and unbelief had so separated the people of god from who god really was and who that god desired and intended for them to be you see you can't be who god really wants you to be without the gap or the breach being taken away in your life this is why god had to send the message in such simplicity of his life because there was a breach between you and i there was a chasm between us and god there was a gap that was there that old nature and god's own life but there had to be one that could come and reconcile be able to deal with that old nature and bring about a real birth in our life so who fills the gap not me not you but he himself who is the mediator the high priest the holy ghost himself comes in on the scene and he fills the gap he feels the breach and as a matter of fact there is no longer a chasm between you and god when you've been born of the spirit of god there is no longer a breach there is no longer a gap you are a fully manifested son and daughter of god hallelujah so then in your life my life that same love it moves forward now it reaches to a place where the love that now has been projected is now projecting back to him in the same strength that it has been shown here you see this is why the real true baptism of the holy ghost it's not just you living a good clean moral life well i don't smoke no more and i don't look at women no more and i don't go visit sites anymore and i don't do this anymore and i'm i'm good to my neighbor you know i give him every once around a baloney basket and i do all this no no this is not good moral living it will produce good morality but the real reality of the baptism of the holy ghost is where your life is fully in the word are you with me where it's lining up with the word because you see a lot of times there's people who can skip right by with a lot of those things even maybe everything right on the dot let me just tell you something the spirit of god does not make a difference between malice bitterness and all those other things if you still have that sort of an atmosphere about you that when somebody crosses you man they're gonna get it they've stepped on you if you still got that about that way in your heart you need to be born again you need a real baptism of the holy ghost where the love of god listen i'm not trying to put false evidences i'm telling you in your heart there ought to be something that's great i know it gets on the flesh and not one of us likes to have somebody say something wrong about us and sometimes it ain't even about that sometimes it's the way we perceive things hello sometimes it's the way we perceive things and well man they did this or they did that our flesh can get even when we have been born of the spirit of god our flesh can get irritated and rough but brother when the love of god is ray residing there on the inside if you go along that route you'll come out there in life you'll come out in joy you'll watch the spirit of god resolve issues but if you go the other way and you're a child of god you're going to get corrected all right because god won't let his children get by with one thing at all is that right you say what are you saying so if your if your reputation in the church has been a problem has been a problem maker and your reputation has been a big mouth your reputation has been one that causes problems rips people down and criticize them i'm telling you there's hope for you this morning by the love of god that you can actually be delivered over the same i know the message but i'm asking do you know the love of god have you ever received the divine love of god brother it operates and it works in your life listen if it worked that way for you and i where moses stood in the gap where jesus stood in the gap if we are witnesses of him after being endued with the power of the holy ghost it will operate the same way in our life let me tell you the power of that love is that even though in your emotions you can feel so grieved and so wounded but there's a power on the inside that'll say give way but salmon why do these things happen for god to prove to you what he's already done in your life i know we never sign up for that but god says you know what i'm gonna show you're not the same person my love has changed you now in the light of that fullness we see how it increases let me just have just a little bit more it increases the fullness of this light because we're talking about in the light of the scripture and has that light is being emitted and as that light is shining forth he comes back with that same strength because see in the hour that we're living here we're living in a time where it is promised that all of the light that was down through the ages is coming together amen as well as the darkness is congealing as well it's a promise god said i'll restore not that he was going to restore us to that ephesian age or the age of ephesus but he restores us back to that of the bride that was given at pentecost where there was no man-made leaven among them it was the pure reflected light of the scripture brother they walked in power and authority brother joy they tried to shut them up they did everything they could and these people they didn't even get on facebook and complain about it they didn't get on twitter and run everybody down you know what they did they did what any holy ghost field christian would do they got on their knees and said lord thou art the almighty god [Applause] they were so moved by the spirit of god that the spirit of god could direct them in the word to what was happened and it would take them right into psalms oh how the heathen rage how they imagine a vain faith they have rose up against the lord and his christ they themselves knew where they were standing and they knew the god that they had met the same god that had forgiven their sins the same god that had brought the pardoning power of the holy ghost into their life they knew where they were standing brother there wasn't condemnation on their life they could look at that devil and the devil said i'll kill you but stephen looked up and he said i see him standing the devil couldn't close him up hallelujah it was a power of the love of god i wonder how some people that won't come to church because they got to wear a mask how are you going to stand in front of them them christians hey peter hey how's everything going going good i'll tell you peter i would have been in church in the last days but they made us wear a mess really i left out of the city and i met him and he said i'm going back in the city to be crucified again and peter caught that vision no no lord he knew it was me i must give my life are you with me you see in this hour these are things that we're not just these are not just things that's flying by there's a lot of things i'm not talking about whether maths work or whatever more you don't don't even get me on that one you understand what i'm talking about i'm talking about things that just the least little bit of inconvenience really are we going to stand there before the hebrew children where they walked in the fire and stand there and tell him i would have come to church i would have served god if it was easier that'll never make it brother and sister let me tell you how close brother banham said it if the love of god's in your heart you can't wait for those church doors to open it wouldn't matter if i had to preach with a hefty bag on i'm going to be in the house of god [Applause] hallelujah his presence is too precious for me to allow some devil to get me vexed in my spirit lord have mercy that was free everybody listen hold on let me preach let me go we want to stand in this hour we want to stand with that real reflection of the love of god that love of god that comes right on on the battlefront and will stand right there brother aaron when they were tested the love of god pushed their faith onto the battlefront when situations arose in their life things came up the love of god pushed their faith onto the battlefront amen second thessalonians chapter 2 for the mystery of iniquity doth already worked only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way you see the mystery of iniquity is that working that comes in and it presents jesus christ but not in the light of the scripture it presents it as a doty fat grandpa that his children can do no wrong god just loves you so much he lets you he lets you stay in your sin that ain't love that ain't the love of god that sounds like the message of a sorcerer that's trying to seduce people and let's look at this you realize what that does it doesn't bind people to jesus christ it binds them to the church that's an evil spirit a false worker and a false light the real revelation of jesus christ don't bind you to a church it binds you to jesus christ it binds you to the word and it's not a binding it's a yoking you're losing from the hold of the enemy but you know what iniquity is lawlessness [Music] you know why we see the lawlessness to where it is right now it's because the gospel was neglected in the pulpits and allowed other demon spirits to get in and inspire people inspire them based on who they are come on i'm going to preach a strength it's a demon spirit that will inspire anybody apart from the revelation of jesus christ we're called in this hour the scriptures are clear that we are called to lay down any any link and anything at all and be united with jesus christ as paul said there is neither jew nor gentile but christ is all in all [Applause] we're not ignorant of satan's devices i'm going to put him on notice we ain't ignorant of your lies we bound down to your spirit we are the children of the living god and god said in this hour he'll call out a bride of many nations kindreds and towns boy i feel like preaching that's why when the real revelation of jesus christ comes you're not ashamed of him you're not ashamed of who you are i'm talking about on all levels now because i'm fearfully and wonderfully made content with such as i am i am dwelling in his presence only he who now let us we'll let who who's letting this go on remember jesus came on the scene judas was on the scene abel was on the scene cain was on the scene jacob was on the scene esau was on the scene i'm talking about twins i'm talking about twins lookalike but got different nature jacob on the inside loved the birthright it absolutely was impossible according to all these laws for him to obtain it he wasn't the firstborn but there was something on the inside of him are you hearing me there was something on the inside of him that was pressing it was pressing the whole time it kept moving him the whole time that they could tell him you can't have the birthright it don't even pertain to you but there was a there was a desire on the inside that god had sowed there why my it looked like that's so impossible let me tell you something there could have been many things that come your life maybe even at some point you wanted to take your life but you can't do it because god's got his hand on you you must be sealed away in the kingdom of almighty god there wasn't anything to touch you until that birthright has come and then even in that it can't come unless god permits it what is it it's god that's drawing on that seed it was god that was pulling on your life the mystery of iniquity doth already worked he who letteth will now let holy ghost was poured out in acts 2. here came the spirit of antichrist against christ oh he was talking about jesus but don't let him come in a meeting don't let him come in don't let him deal with my life that's antichrist antichrist spirit that wants to go uh it wants to go in opposition to the word is that right so you see the spirit of god listen friends he comes to break hardness you might be sitting here ever so hard this morning every one of us were there every one of us were there oh my but he comes he knows how to melt away the hardness in your life he knows how to melt away the indifference in your life my only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way you see the mystery of iniquities working the mystery of god is working as well the mystery of god is the baptism of the holy ghost it's god coming into his people those mysteries have always been at battle and war with one another but you see when you read this scripture here you realize satan can only go so far god says that's enough just like with job when job was being tested god said you can touch everything but don't you touch his life the devil can only go so far and anything that's being permitted it's because god is permitting it but god being permitting it not that he's going along with it but you see there must there must be an allowance of encroachment of darkness and what does it do it it causes the light to shine even that much more brighter are you with me let me come to this let me come to this point and i'm gonna close when that wicked one when when shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming you see what he's going to do to the enemy what he's going to do to satan what he's going to do to that that that beast and that pope what he's going to do he did the same thing in your life he destroyed it with the spirit of his mouth the spirit of his word he dismantled the hold of the enemy in your life amen amen he overthrew him with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and lies and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivalness over unrighteousness in them to perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saying now they've had truth as far as the bible the bible is all truth is that right but it takes the love of the truth and that love which is of god that is who god is in order to project the truth in the light of the scripture because truth truth is not a doctrine you know we can hear what somebody said and say man that's true but truth is the person of jesus christ he is the truth the life the way he is the spirit of truth that leads and guides us into all the word so they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saying talking about the holy ghost for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie you see you see what the the cost of rejecting light is life the love of god it's to receive strong delusion to believe a lie you know the bible says there's a way that seemeth right unto man but the end the end thereof is the way of death strong delusion to where they're overtaken they believe a lie that they might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness did you catch that the light of god the love of god has been emitted to their life they can see there's more light there's a deeper work of the love of god like we were reading in the beginning can't get to it but his love is perfected in us perfected means it comes to its completion in our life it starts on our life and things begin to flee away from our life little by little the love of god is we're taking it in brother drake it's just things are just fleeing from our life it ain't like somebody's coming in there going it's just but when the love of the truth is emitted that light has come because they resorted and they had pleasure in unrighteousness still want it to be accounted as well i serve god still want to be regarded as a christian but remember to be a christian is not to be one in name only because if it's just name only that's a blasphemous name a blasphemous name means to be that which is empty and vain god never intended for our lives to be empty and vain but that our lives would be filled full and reflective of his name can you imagine that a person would take religion would take knowledge maybe of scripture would take program when god would be offering them his divine love of grace mercy power an overcoming life a real liberty a real freedom you see to a person in their mind they can look and think how can i ever live above this condition i've tried to lay this down i've tried to stop this but you see that's the problem you're trying remember samuel am i supposed to try exposed to yield and to yield means to obey is to believe him who speaks to you to yield to him and say be it unto me lord that's my desire you see where he begins to come by and the pleasure of unrighteousness he flees it becomes something that's set before you say i want him more than anything tell you the truth it don't stop there it's addicting glory be to god i love it when he comes it's the greatest joy the greatest privilege you're gonna wake up in the morning right there he is you walk through the day right there he is oh it's it's a love affair that takes place in our life as i heard brother brian pray right here in the opening prayer oh god that you would come among us if there's anything holding us back if there's any holds or anything about our life lord come on the scene that's the real desire of a real believer listen friends if we would feel that way in the natural if i would feel that way about my life my wife that i want to express that love to her in such a way and care for her that there is not an even ounce of a question whether i love her or not if i would work to settle that doubt not that she has any but i don't pull back from it it just keeps going of little ways that i can show it little plate little tokens of appreciation maybe just taking her hand and letting her know i love you how much more the lord jesus brother he's not pulled back in this hour if you've got called the bible says draw nigh unto god and he'll draw nine to you hallelujah he ain't far away just welcome him back just welcome him back maybe you've got too busy in your life welcome him back maybe in your life here you come to the end maybe you've went and maybe you've sown oats and other things have taken place in your life and you realize just how empty it all is you've tried to find satisfaction in all sorts of pleasures of life let me tell you something you'll never find what you're looking for in the pleasures of life you'll never find it in anything of this world there's only one place where there's a satisfying portion and that's in jesus christ he's the one that's right here this morning he's the one that is the perfecter he's the one the love of the truth he's right here this morning he's the one that's bringing the word to you and i he's the one that's the overcomer he's the satisfier he is your portion this is his love to you and i need more what could what what what would be the greatest thing brother samuel that we could do is to receive the projection of his love is to receive that and say lord be it unto me lord jesus according to your word it'd be the greatest thing if you know you don't have that abiding presence in your life well maybe you love the lord you love him as far as you know you love him as your savior but you realize that there's still the whole of the world in your life but what must happen his love must be perfected in you what should i do well remember love is not a struggle love is not a strain love itself it comes from that yielding where you're receiving what he's projected and allow it to be fully projected because we can never reflect listen to me now we can never reflect the love of god back from our mind we can never reflect it back from our spirit the only true way that we can reflect the love of god is there's got to be that part of the word on the inside it moves down to that soul that nature that's changed it becomes illuminated by the presence of god and it projects back not a weak miserable christian it does not if it does not project back excuses well i would do better if if only you know i i'm trying to do better no no the sun's shining its strength when it moves to that level that depth in our life then the love of god is perfected in us when it shines back with the same strength from the source that it comes from when it signs back in that strength then what is seen the glory of god upon our life the perfection of god the perfection of his life his light in us that's my desire with all my heart lord i don't want no darkness about my life i don't want anything to get in the way this is our desire if that has not moved into your heart why don't you why don't you let him do that this morning let him just say lord and maybe in your heart you look at your life and you think my i've got you know things in my life right now maybe there's things listen to me now that you still love maybe there's things you still love doing don't crawl in a corner on me now because the one who is here right now that can address those things don't crawl back in the corner like well i'm so ashamed i understand in his presence you would be ashamed adam and eve they hid themselves as well but if you can recognize he's the one who's walking this morning in his garden in his bride he's walking and if you could even just be this honest and say lord loosen me from the love of the world maybe there's something you really you maybe it's just the love maybe there's something still holding on your life or maybe it's just look at full-blown in your life you say i still love the world but i don't want to be here i i want to be free then why don't you just reach out to him and say lord let your love be perfected in me i'm not ashamed to admit lord in your presence lord i need help change lord the direction of my love lord let the direction of my love not be to the things of the world but let it be to you lord jesus soften my heart lord soften my heart lord god turn my heart i challenge you you do that you watch the results when you really believe it but i want to be closer maybe you can look and maybe you find yourself getting a little bit weak let me tell you something there's a refilling station you can you can get another filling of the holy ghost maybe it's not even maybe it's not so much maybe that of a feeling we would say and yet it's connected in the same way you would say lord i want my lamp shrimp i want my lamp trimmed right now because i realize after the rapture of burning flax will he not quench i want to be trimmed right now i want to burn lord god burn how with that same reflection of that love of god being projected in our life to where others could look at us we may never have an opportunity to preach to them we may never have an opportunity maybe brother william to sit down and go through the scriptures but the love of god is so projected through our life it creates an atmosphere it creates an atmosphere brother shane their lives they begin to all of a sudden here they are they're drawing near they don't even know what's taking place they're drawing they're being drawn because what they're seeing is something that's genuine i may remember that man that went hunting with brother branham i'm closing i i just i'm way off here but i'm on with him amen remember that deer and brother brown hunting was named bert brother brown was hunting with and he went deer hunting burke got out there he took that doe bleat and i think he put a fun phone call on it and words when that call went out brother brian it was a call of a fun it was meant to mimic a fawn in distress and that distress call would awaken and alert an attribute of mother in a deer that call would activate her to come out of the thicket and she would come out of hiding and she would stand there but rem said she knew we were there but she overlooked the danger she overlooked the what if i fail she overlooked all of the danger and she looked she was looking for where that sound came from it was the sound that brought her out of there and that real gallon attribute of a mother stood there and you know the end of the story bert himself this gun began to shake and he put it down he said brother branham or billy and had enough lead me to that jesus because he's seen something that was real and genuine something that would stand in the face of the enemy something that knew the enemies here but there was a courage that would stand there in that hour you said lead me to that jesus that's your request this morning leave me to that jesus he's here he's the one oh he hasn't brought a distress call your heart's in this your soul's in distress but it's the comforter that's calling to you come unto me all you that are heavy laden and i will give you rest to your souls take my yoke upon you and learn of me it calls us out to be a real gallon soldier a real christian oh friends i'll say this morning if all this been is a knowledge of this message you need to go deeper if all it's been is well i know brother brown's a pro you need to go deeper thank god for that but if you believe him to be a prophet then then stand on the word that he has pointed us to stand upon that word and receive that token receive that life receive that assurance if you can look in your life praise god you can say my i'm living better than what i used to live i don't do the things i used to do that's wonderful that's great but also remember it's your life too in the word not just where it's better morally but where the very desires of the world have flown have gone away and where christ is alive i don't say that to scold you but at the same time we're speaking and we're addressing a hole that if the enemy has a hold he's got to let go god is faithful amen if you want to just stand with that in your heart i tell you i want to be a real gallon soldier to stand there in the face what we're facing even what we've been dealing with this past year it's a light thing compared to things that's coming up on this earth i don't plan on being here don't plan on being here i'm making preparations to leave are you with me glory be to god to receive that love of the truth let's pray you want to just be remembered in prayer this morning say lord remember me god bless you i'll bless your hands god bless your hands god bless you hallelujah maybe we could play that song make me more like thee make me more like thee as we prepare to pray if that if that love of god has never dropped into that place in your life listen don't give up keep walking in the light and you become the light keep walking in the love of god what when he speaks to your heart you just keep yielding to him and let the love of god let it let it let it come to perfection in your life let it just let it just move over into that place heavenly father lord how thankful we are for the love of god lord as it's projected to our hearts in the light of the scripture it's a certain sound that utters to our heart
