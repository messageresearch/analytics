to us hallelujah amen God bless you Saints so nice to be with you again amen home away from home and uh just appreciate the opportunity to be here trust the Lord to use brother Samuel where he's at and just happy we can be a help in the meantime amen let's go right to the word of God in Isaiah the 60th chapter was a little late getting to the house of God this morning excuse me for that kind of been one of those Sunday mornings I don't know if you've ever had those but uh you know we were on the way up here and and hit the first toll booth there on the turnpike rolled my window down to get the ticket the window never rolled back up so I had a lot of fresh air this morning and pulled over at the service plaza bought a hat came to church so if I got a little hat here this morning that's why and and uh but uh you know just one of those things of course then we got to the we got to the exit Booth here and realized somewhere in the jumble I lost my ticket so they charged me all the way back to the state line you know and so anyway my title this morning is look on the bright side so we'll read out of Isaiah chapter 60 take our texts amen my brother Andrew Glover was preaching at the home Church there Thursday said none of these things move me quote in the scripture amen that's that's uh that's where we're at amen come what may we know where we stand in him Isaiah chapter 60 verse 1. of course a very very familiar scripture to the bride of Christ he says arise shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth gross Darkness the people that that's heavy or you know weighty Darkness will cover the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee and the Gentiles shall come to thy light and to the brightness of thy Rising amen what precious words let's have a word of prayer Heavenly Father we thank you so much for your blessings on us Lord and for this identification Lord of Light in the scripture Lord and father we know that our light has come Lord we know this is a fulfilled scripture in our day and so it we're so happy father what do we have to complain about Lord when our eyes have been opened to your glorious light father oh God it means everything to us Lord and we want to give our whole lives to this father we ask Lord as we would just uh Endeavor to minister your word father we know as human beings we're insufficient but Lord if your spirit could come amongst us today Lord and have Liberty and Shalom is a very special message it comes at very the very end of brother Brandon's Ministry and uh and it's it's it's well after the denominational Realms and and his denominational connections have pulled away from him Shalom is not a message to the public it's not not a it's not a you know it's not a great uh uh uh you know it's not for the wasn't for the great Crusades and the great public Ministry Shalom is a message to the Bride of Jesus Christ it is a special it's a special little thing put in there just for the bride of Christ amen and and uh and so when we read in this scripture it's speaking of a light which is going to come to God's people now it speaks a lot about Darkness Darkness is in there amen but the darkness is a side note the darkness you know is the context amen that's giving meaning to the light that is coming amen and and that's something we should never forget as Believers you know we should always have our eyes on the right side of it we should look on the bright side you know so to speak because there's a lot of Darkness to look at in the world Amen everybody you know we're just very aware that the world is dark and it has become darker amen and and it's getting darker all the time and not only are the circumstances of the world dark but but more so there's a Darkness that's in the hearts of people amen which is a heavy it's a gross Darkness it's just an overpowering darkness that has come into the hearts of the people when we see the state of the nation when we see the state of the world the state of the environment all these things amen it is a dark time but the darkness and and it shouldn't surprise anybody because the darkness is prophesied in the scripture to come amen it's a the darkness itself is a fulfillment of Prophecy but the object of the prophecy the focus of the prophecy is not all this Darkness out here but the prophecy is speaking of a light which will come in a dark age amen and to those who are the recipients of the light it is Shalom it's a good morning it's Sunrise it's good news amen there is so much glory in this message to the elected people to the Bride of Jesus Christ amen we can spend every day of Our Lives looking at the light and never ever get to the darkness amen amen because it's just the framework amen which makes the light shine ever brighter to us amen the message Heralds the light and so your message is Shalom amen and that's a beautiful message amen it's a beautiful message of Shalom when you when you realize that you are identified with the light the light is your identity it's your identification it's your part of the scripture there's a people which are called to manifest darkness in this time amen but there is an elected bride amen who is to receive and show forth the light amen and light is your message light is your identity light is your is your uh identification amen your light has come and what a glorious thing that is to be under a message Shalom amen amen to realize that that that uh you know when God sends a message and you've heard me preach this before but when God sends a message with a messenger it's always twofold there's a message to the world and the mess is to the world is one of judgment amen it's judgment to the world it's a correction to the to the you know to the structures of of man but but to God's elect it's Grace it's always Grace there's no judgment on her amen amen see to the world this message carried indictment it was an indictment to this generation indictment to the churches indictment to the nation but not to the bride to the bride it is Shalom good morning your light has come good news amen of the Gospel of Jesus Christ Shalom amen and Shalom is the word spoken over you amen it's it it's a item said it's a good greeting it's a good morning it speaks of a sunrise There's Hope in this message there's glory in this message to you amen Shalom amen and what a great word you know we we battle sickness but it's a greater word than sickness amen it's not sickness spoken over you but Shalom is for talking over you amen we we go through hard times amen we have discouragements but there's a greater word spoken over you not discouragement not negativity but Shalom glorious Sunrise to the Bride of Jesus Christ our light has come brother sister amen and many times we're guilty of just uh of not reveling in this thought is the same Pillar of Fire here today interpreting the Bible amen how we thank him for that what a comfort what identification think of that what identification the pillar of fire that came on men of old to write the Bible that same Pillar of Fire amen came in Malachi 4 to interpret the Bible and that's your identification because the same pillar fire is in the many member body of Jesus Christ fulfilling the Bible amen that's our identity that's our headship that's our name it's the Lord Jesus Christ the angel of the Covenant has tabernacled his fire in the hearts amen of the Bride of Jesus Christ she's got the light amen you're not creatures of Darkness but you're you are light amen he said I'm so glad to be identified in that I don't know what to do I'd rather be identified in that than all the Baptist methodists Presbyterian Lutheran all the rest of them identified in that word where the Shekinah Glory and Revelation lay hallelujah amen amen now this message is a word about identification this message is not about what's happening around you but it's about who you are your identification is not in this Sodom I know the world is wicked I know it's falling apart brother Branham said it was falling apart amen he preached the message the world is now falling apart and now it's just it's a part amen it's it's a it's in a bad State amen but it's not our identification we don't belong to it we're not responsible for it amen our light has come and separated us out of a Sodom condition amen amen oh Hallelujah yeah you know sure we uh absolutely we sigh and cry for the Abominations amen we it certainly if it doesn't move our hearts to see the wickedness that is in the world Amen brother Brandon one time made that you know part of the evidence of the Holy Ghost was sighing and crying for the Abominations of the city that's that's true you know we don't like to see the world coming to where it's at we don't like to see all those things but yet it's not our identification don't ever lose sight of that amen that you've been separated from it thank God that you have amen Sodom is not your identification you have been called out of Sodom the angel that came to you did not come to you and shot him amen but it separated you to the tent of a prophet amen oh my that's where we're at friends you realize our identification is not with the fire and the brimstone but we're in Abraham's tent and what's happening in Abraham's tent God is taking flesh hearts are being addressed amen bodies are changing in Abraham's tent that's where I want to be bro sister I tell you when we look around you know that's certainly in the natural sometimes we get places in our life where things aren't going the way that we wish they would amen we make mistakes and things we get like Jonah brother Bram said everywhere Jonah looked all he saw was well Billy oh just stinking failure all around him friends that's what he see that's where we get with our natural eyes sometime well I should have done this amen I wish that would have happened well Bailey whale Bailey amen but with spiritualized friends when we look around you're not seeing whale belly we're not seeing the Firefall we're not seeing the brimstone we're not seeing the wickedness but everywhere you look it's tent walls cause you're in Abraham's chat friends amen you got a tent vision Hallelujah I look around I see tent tent tent I'm separated from this world I'm called out of her I'm separated oh I'm no longer a church I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ I've got tent Vision I'm under a promise he said I'll meet you in there Hallelujah hurry ten Vision amen [Music] said the one who stayed back with Abraham told him what Sarah was doing and thinking all those miraculous things but Jesus was the one in that person and he said when this world gets in a Sodom condition the son of man will be revealed again and now we see that same promised word all these other promises made flesh today as we heard with our ears now we see him with our eyes blessed are your eyes for they see amen see what his presence amen we heard with our eyes but now we see him we heard with our ears we see him with our eyes interpreting his own word we don't need any interpretation of man we don't need any interpretation of man if you think this message is all about you know run down to brother so-and-so's church and get under his teaching and that one what his opinion about it you know in your little background and your little idea and your little pet Doctrine friends we don't need that we're beyond that amen that's good in Sodom but not in this light amen when you walk in the light he is in the light and he is his own interpreter he is present amongst us to make this word live amen that's what the Holy Ghost was given for to be our inside teacher to lead us into all truth Oh Glory to God friends we don't need any interpretation of man Hallelujah we don't need a new message we don't need a new messenger we need a revelation of the message we've already received amen I've heard but now I see amen amen and so you know all this pressure that we feel from this world around us pressing down pressing down all the time certainly you feel the pressure I feel the pressure amen but you know it's not just the darkness pressing brother Brown said what that pressure is amen is it's the light pressing against the darkness when people press on you they can't help that because the dot the light that's in you is pressing the darkness that's in them amen oh my you know how it is sometimes some people you get around they got such a spirit on them you know where a Christian walks in the restaurant walks in the workplace walks into Walmart and oh right away you know it's a pressure why because you're carrying a light amen amen and so don't look at the darkness it's the light that's brought the pressure amen but thank God for the light amen we uh we we say oh brother Nathan you know the church the bride is under such pressure today such critics have risen up such fallings away such problems around the message all these things certainly there are amen oh you know uh it just seems like it's down to a minority brother bran said it would be he said it would get down to a minority said it would be lesson number but greater in power hey man why because I know are you back to light in the corner you'll never weaken that light all you can do is condense it make it brighter make it more oh make it more focused make it more powerful hallelujah amen amen that is what is happening amen look at the circumstances of brother Brandon preaching shalom here's a prophet of God I'm sure I've shared this with you before but but just think this struck me one day looking at brother Branham he's preaching the message Shalom and brother Branham is a man who is accustomed to preaching you know Revival meetings and Crusades and things all around the world he'd been all around the globe he preached to tens of thousands of people at a time in in soccer stadiums and amphitheaters and all those kind of things brother Brandon preached a meaning in South Africa I believe it was 30 000 people came to the Lord in one meeting amen 30 000 people you know that was the height so where God's Eagle had flown and now he's in Sierra Vista Arizona in a house with a handful of people and there's maybe and the churches in the whole state of Arizona that would have him come preach you could count on one hand and it looks like his his ministry has totally failed it looks like he's just totally come to the Twilight totally diminished and that the Lord is totally done with him because here's this great you know worldwide preacher in a house in severe Sierra Vista Arizona and you can and that's and that's no magic thing you can hear that in brother Brown's voice around this time you can feel the pain of rejection you can it's certainly the human the humanity is suffering that amen but see the the gift that's in him amen is seeing what the Lord is doing amen when it comes down to a minority when it comes to the point of the Capstone like that right you know it's not it's not diminishing it's refining that's why brother Branham could sit in Sierra Vista and preach not a message of discouragement but he's preaching Shalom he's preaching Victory Day amen cause he knew it might be a minority but there will be a people who will walk in this light and here we are brother sister amen with a with a positive gospel Hallelujah with a glorious Revelation walking in the light of this message brother man said when it looks like the message and the messenger is just about defeated that's when he steps in he said he lets it get to that place and then he steps in and he rides the high waves friends amen I'm Not Afraid come with me amen like we say none of these things move me come let me Amen Let It Come amen but the Bride of Jesus Christ will stare amen because why she's not the one holding on but there's someone in the ship amen there's a captain at the hell he'll press every wave amen don't you worry whether you're going to take a Rapture just write on it amen amen it's messaging right on it Hallelujah Amen brother Ram talk about the layout of seeing Church action the Lord himself took his finger amen and and wrote it on the wall of the church amen where it would come to in this layout asean age it'd be so much Darkness until it just be barely a sliver at the top amen it'd be chock full of Darkness hey man brother Ronnie is preaching home I love the way he pointed us out he said you look at that picture on the wall you know of those of those Church ages and look at it come down just to that sliver that's not empty space that's light it might just be a sliver but it's light it's not void it's not emptiness it's not hopelessness it's light and compress it down it's just a sliver it'll never stop shining it'll still Pierce The Darkness oh it'll still have Victory amen it's light it's light amen and we gotta focus on that light brother sister that's what our eyes should be on is the light of this day amen a message came so that we could recognize our day not recognize the night recognize our day amen amen because Daybreak means freedom Daybreak means Rapture Day of break is Hope and glory amen oh in Victory amen like brother bran told the story you know of uh of uh when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed and there was a there was a predestinated sunrise amen when all the people would go free amen and you know but there were a lot of people down in a deep valley amen like we get down in valleys in our life and down in that Valley you know they were under the shadow of the mountains that they were facing amen and they could not see that Sunrise but God raised somebody up amen that could climb up to the top of the mountain amen and stand up there amen and see the breaking of the day and call down to the people and say don't worry Church it is the rising of the sun yeah I see Shalom I see sunlight Over the Horizon you might not look like it you might not feel like it but you are free [Applause] the Daybreak has come upon you Shalom Pride your line has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee hallelujah amen thank God for a prophet that could climb up and and read the back part of God's mind amen and see that'll never leave us or forsake us and oh friends you will never put this bride under the layout of seeing rebuke she is not blind she is not wretched she is not naked she has been clothed by this word amen a crown of light is upon her Hallelujah she's under Shalom she's married to her bridegroom not a not a not an ounce of judgment construct this Earth until she's in the palace there's not a bomb that can fall friends amen until we're out of here that's our identification Hallelujah brother Graham said yeah the Shuck's pulling away but now the Wheats begin to be seen so not a Pentecostal age this is the evening light this is Malachi 4. it's Luke 17 30. it's Jeremiah it's Joel I have heard Lord that it was coming but now a kid with my eyes Hallelujah this is our that's our identification around the evening time when things get dark there will be light there will be light now how many know that light in the scripture is manifested word light is manifested word now for it to be light it's got to be manifested now we can we can read it quote it talk about it amen even preach about it amen I'll give him a quote in a moment amen but it's got to be manifested then it becomes light and that's our identification as bright church amen is uh is with a manifested word that's the kind of word we're interested in amen is a word that comes off the pages of the Bible and becomes Spirit quickened to be a real and living God working in our midst amen hallelujah brother Brown said you know but the it and and that's that's what separates us from laodicea amen because we're not lukewarm amen but many people many people get under that I think because they're looking at the wrong thing or expecting the wrong thing my brother bran said you know he said we have no enthusiasm it doesn't seem to strike us right you ever been in that connect in that condition just doesn't quite strike you right you know that something's wrong you don't have enthusiasm he said it's like talks about taking a match you know it's and you could just take that match and strike it and rake it and rake it and rake it amen but if there's no sulfur on the head of that match if it doesn't have the right substance to it amen rake all you want he said there will be no light amen but if that chemical if if it's there when it strikes it will light amen amen and see when the true genuine uh Vindication of the scriptures of this last day message when you see the presence of Jesus Christ just before the Sodom conditions fired over you see Jesus return amongst his people formed in human flesh and do the same thing that he done what ought it to do it ought to strike our souls to Glory amen it ought to do something to us why it's dropping on that amen friends this is no time to be discouraged this is no time for wowzy wowzy wounds this is no time you know to be speaking the devil's language this is a glorious time because the bride amen is not a Pentecostal with no mechanics she's not a Baptist with no Dynamics she's got the mechanics and the Dynamics amen she's got the the sofa she's got the spark amen and it's dropping on her it ought to strike our hearts to Glory there ought to be a manifestation amongst us we ought to see the supernatural we ought to see the moving of the spirit the reason we don't we're not looking at the light you got looking at the darkness and you got under that lukewarm condition but turn your eyes back on this word walk in this light and it'll be a manifested word oh the word is light but only when it's manifested only when it's manifested that's why we see so much organized religion so much denominationalism around the message formality around the message they're not walking in the light not basking in the light well but we say well but you know we got the word brother Nathan we got the word now so you got to be careful all this talking about Holy Ghost and yeah Dynamics and all that kind of that sounds a little Pentecostal to me well you know yeah we got the word we have the body word of Jesus Christ amen that's what we're feeding on is the body word of Jesus Christ the brother bran said sure the body was Christ and the message look he says and if Christ means the anointed one and he's the same yesterday today and forever and he is the word then the word is the anointing let that hover in the atmosphere for a moment the word is the anointing you say we got the word we sure do amen and if it's the word it is Anointed it has a presence it has an atmosphere it has power it has works it has signs it has Wonders It has gifts it has a Supernatural That's the characteristics of God friends though we have the word and the word is the anointing he said another play in the unveiling of God he said the word is God he said the anointing is a person the anointing is not emotion the anointing is not a workup amen the anointing is supreme power coming down into a human being amen supreme power gets in control and it brings a power to the church the sick will be healed the bound will be set free amen The Sinner will be saved the loss will be filled with the Holy Ghost why because the anointing is a person you can touch him you can talk to him he's real Hallelujah and we talk so much about the word amen but the word is a person like we sing the song back home I love this song uh you know the word has a name yeah and it's Jesus I like that you know now let's say you know let's imagine I after service today if I was to go out to to get lunch with brother Brian sister Gracie and I sat down talked to sister Gracie and just just went on and on oh you know I'm so glad that I could go out to lunch with your husband you know I just really I I your husband's a buddy of mine I just think he's a great guy really admire his Stan everything just I just feel so blessed you know that I'm here and I get to be with your husband and just carry on like that a little while she might get a little weird look on her face and eventually she might reach it lean over and just kind of you know my husband has a name in other words he's right here why don't you talk to him why don't you fellowship with him why don't you look at him he's here he's present he's not just a name he's not just a theory he's not just a a mental conception he's a presence he's a person he's got a character you can fellowship with him you can talk with him that's the kind of a god this message came to bring to us Amen to God that can be touched a God that can speak to your heart a God that can be present amongst us not just a word an anointed word a Living Word an atmosphere Supernatural alive oh the word has a name amen when you walk in the light you say oh what we need to do is bask in the light of the word I believe in that but I don't believe that's that's trying to educate ourselves into some mental conception amen and prove how smart we are get out in the parking lot and swap quotes and try to blow someone mind to prove how spiritual that we are I believe if you walk in the light he will be in the light and you will be in his presence if you can walk in this light Hallelujah the anointing is a person amen you say I don't know brother Nathan well look at what brother bran said about the road to Emmaus he appreciated many times how these two disciples are walking with Jesus now their Fellowship was not with the Devil the fellowship was not with a false teacher I'll read some of these use some of these phrases Verbatim what how brother Brown says it he said they're walking with the resurrected Messiah he is revealing the word he's expounding them the scriptures preach the word read it right out of the Bible and they still didn't get it you see there's a there's a there's a place where the preaching of the word is not enough to now the scriptures is not enough amen he said it was the resurrected Messiah was walking with them teaching them revealing it to them you say well brother Nathan I go to a good church with a god called Pastor and he's preaching the words of life to me that's not a revelation that's just joining a church amen but when you walk in the light you got to come to a place where he comes inside and when he comes in personally and breaks the bread of life to you that's when it becomes revealed that's when your eyes are open it's the personal presence of Jesus Christ that identifies you and opens our eyes to what it is we believe in teaching the word absolutely we believe in God called men preaching the word revealing the word expounding the scriptures reading it out of the Bible amen but if Jesus Christ doesn't come down in the church and make himself real to the individual all we got is another Creed amen they could not see the light the intellectual mind cannot see it it's actually impossible for the intellectual mind to receive this revelation it takes the personal presence you because put yourself in their mind now they're looking around and their eyes are on the wrong thing because here he's walking with them he kind of you know they come together on the road sometimes God walks with us longer than we realize we don't even realize that he's spending a little time with us and we're just our minds are so full of what's going on you know the budget and world events and the news and all that kind of stuff that's all we can think about we don't even realize he's walking with us and just he's never in a hurry he always just takes his time you know I love it he just re you know they come together on the road the paths converge why the long face are you serious haven't you been reading the news don't you know what's going on don't you know that this generation crucified the word of God they hung him on a tree and the and the sky went dark and the war the Earth shakes and the veil ripped in the temple and now he's gone they crucified him everything's fine everybody's left him Peter denied him don't you know what's happening didn't you hear about Ukraine don't you hear aren't you looking at politics aren't you seeing what's going on and then he began to say well didn't Isaiah say that this would happen yeah didn't Moses say this would happen you know if you run this back to Joel if you're running back to Hezekiah didn't didn't you know and he began to he began to put the scriptures together oh and they still didn't see it we're so slow you know but he's so patient because he begins to walk with him amen all but oh but you know look it looks like World War III but didn't I say not a bomb would drop before the bride would be in glory didn't I tell you you'd be in a Rapture didn't I tell you judgment couldn't come on you didn't I tell you Shalom why are you looking the darkness why are you looking at the earthquakes amen your light has come and you don't even realize it Hallelujah but he's patient enough to follow you back home amen and sit with you and wait till you get done complaining wait till you get done worrying about everything to wait till you get done balancing the checkbook amen and then his presence just sweeps down so sweet and he says aren't I a personal God to you did I say I'd be your portion didn't I say I'd be a provider didn't I say I'd heal your body didn't I say I be an ever-pleasant hell in the time of trouble didn't I say when judgment failed you'd be hiding in my Pavilion didn't I say there'd be hidden power in the secret place amen hey man in that holy of holies where the True Believer dwells amen amen they thought it was a sign of judgment when that veiled ripped from the top to the bottom but it was a sign of Grace amen because he opened the veil that a Believer could get to a place with God a place where the man I never goes stale where there's Victory all the time brother Ram said you find somebody who's ever got into there he said you they got Victory not just on Sunday but you'll find him on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday cloudy day gloomy day bright day good day bad day [Music] it doesn't matter the circumstances they're in the light of the Shekinah Glory he's in the light oh that's what it takes friends his personal presence brother bran said that's what his ministry was to declare him that he's here to forerun the coming of the Lord Hallelujah brother Ray's been teaching at home quite a bit on his coming took those three Greek words of the Bible for his coming one of them of course is parousia which is his personal presence his his presence you know amongst us now I know they've made doctrines out of that can't help it's in the Bible but as far Asia is presence he's come amen there's another word apocalypse I can't pronounce the Greek version but it's apocalypse which is an unveiling the veil is lifted it's revealed amen and the third one is epiphania hey man which is the brightness the light or the manifestation of his coming oh friends don't you see what this message brought to us it's not only that he's here amen but it's revealed that he's here it's not just piracia it's a it's it's apocalypse amen the veil has been lifted a prophet came to lift the veil and show you that he's here he's in the Bride of Jesus Christ and not only is it revealed but it is manifested it's light it's brightness it's epiphany hallelujah oh Gloria what a day to be alive amen the brightness of his coming the epiphany of it that's what destroys the Antichrist and what is the Antichrist Spirit brother bran said it was church members hanging to their church instead of walking into light but you can't if you ever get a real Revelation this message you can't just be a church member anymore more than that it's his presence revealed and manifested it is a reality in your life it's got power it's got sigh oh friends It's Supernatural it's reality it's light [Music] what we're trying to do is get people to that epiphany get people to that revelation amen that it's he's here we're walking in the light we're identified by that light everything's gonna be okay [Applause] spoken over you shalom innocent no Prosperity Gospel where you know you just uh you just be good and pay your tithes and you'll drive a Mercedes and live in a mansion oh it's a lot better than that friends hey man this is eternal life this is the light of God this is his personal presence I'd rather spend five minutes in the presence of God Amen than that five trillion dollars and one lifetime to spend it amen we're in the light it's shalom good news good morning Hallelujah brother bam said if we could only realize brother Sammy just read this at our church he said if we could only realize he's appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose to release the desires that we have in him to us he's here why to release our desires he's here to be your God he's here to be your provider he's here to be your healer he's here to be your comforter he wants it he's brought his presence amongst us for that purpose to release isn't that beautiful to release our desires and him to us but we've got to recognize his presence and how you recognize his presence is when the promised word for this age is made manifest you know why is it when God does some Supernatural in the church why is it the people get excited we're not sign Seekers but we recognize when when it's made manifests amongst us when the word becomes manifest that it's his presence it shows that he's here he's keeping he's kept his promise he's an ever-present help in the time of trouble when his hardship strikes the church when there's a loss so when there's a death amen and the presence of God come so sweet to bind up the broken heart Amen to be all to to mend and to heal amen at all he's here friends that's why we worship him that's why he loves we love him because he's not a Creed us he's not the church that we join he's not a mental conception he's not a workup of faith he's a present God our bridegroom Hallelujah Hallelujah when the promised word for this age is made manifest you say well brother Nathan what is that manifestation that you're talking about brother bran said it's the word bride the word bride he said is the manifestation of this hour that's where God's at that's where he's working that's where his focus in this message ain't about what happened 60 years ago in prayer lines it's not about hunting stories and campfire Tales friends the message is about the Bride of Jesus Christ amen May uh you are the Reason God sent a prophet you are the one he's taught me on the bail you're the one who was resting on every word you're the one he saw take the book you're the one he saw prophesy as the final voice to the final age you've got the light you are the manifestation Hallelujah oh brother Nathan we need more word we need more revelation we need to figure out we need to understand all these secret Mysteries here's the secret brother Bram said the secret is the word is in the bride amen you tell me a deeper mystery than Christ in you the hope of glory the light of God shining from the countenance of the body of Christ it's another Mount Transfiguration and it's not just the face of the Prophet but it's the whole body of Christ shining with the light of the nature of God friends it's light it's light amen you look all through the Bible amen you realize that every Prophet that spoke about light amen they weren't talking about some artificial electric light amen Moses never saw an electric light Elijah never saw an electric light one of these cold LED bulbs that doesn't give heat doesn't give warmth amen light to Moses was a fire like to Paul was a fire amen and this light to me is a fire we got too many people talking about the word but their life doesn't burn but when I saw this light it was a fire shut up in my balls foreign if it doesn't produce the same things it did on the day of Pentecost it's a man-made artificial religion and never came off the candlesticks but brother Brown said this ain't Strange Fire this is the fire that God started Tim's light it is operating itself in this age and tabernacling licks a fire in the vessels of the many member body of the Bride of Jesus Christ men and women and boys and girls amen that are not left comfortless but there's a fire burning on the inside tell me how you'll take a Rapture without this fire got to have the oil [Applause] now we don't need all that Pentecostal fire brother Nathan that was just for the Pentecostals sounds like a foolish woman to me sounds like a foolish virgin amen but a wise version amen will stay full of oil their lamps will be trimmed and clear and they'll burn bird till the bridegroom comes [Applause] fire that God started oh we can try all we want to make improvements to this message modernize this message make it more appealing to laodicea make it more compatible with the modern lifestyle friends but until you stop tampering with this message and just walk in this light it'll never burn for you friends amen it won't get you to where you're going it'll only ever be an artificial light but if you take your hands off the word of God and call on the spirit of God the anointing to fall on the church fall on your family fall on your life it'll lead you into all truth it'll lead you into a rapture lead you to your future home [Music] said they're looking for something great they're looking for something shiny but the Holy Spirit doesn't shine it glows I'm not looking for something new and shiny no I'm in this glow I'm in the Shekinah Glory it's a reality to me it's life to me it's everything to me get into this place friends get into that holy of holies get into that hidden life in Jesus Christ it's the only way it doesn't shine it glows oh and then brother Branham amen oh he begins to pour out his heart amen this is how we ought to oh we ought to be just vocalized these these these these desires these feelings he said China's of the world glow is of god see if you can identify with this glow Over Me Lord is my prayer humble me down take me mold me make me Spirit of the Living God move fresh on me make me thine own Lord just take me and as he begins to express that desire to the Lord amen the atmosphere begins to change brother Banner makes this statement he says I'm just as aware that the spirit of Christ is moving around this building this morning the god that will judge the world is right here now that's what happens when his people begin to worship people begin to seek his presence if you make him welcome he'll come he'll come about how many times do we leave him unwelcome the presence of God unrecognized God that will judge the world is right here now not to with judgment not with indictment but the god that will judge the world those firing eyes amen are looking at you with love today he has come amongst his bride to be her Shalom to be her peace to be her present Comfort old friends aren't you grateful for that [Music] aren't you grateful for that the god that will judge a world is right here now just as certain as I'm standing in this pulpit amen I I do you believe that I'm not asking for an empty hand this morning but somebody to be a witness say I feel his presence today I was here I feel I feed bread why does he write his presence to release your desires to you he's here he's here just welcome him he didn't have to come but he did why because it's his desire to have fellowship with his bride she's his Queen she's his beloved she's acceptable to him she's holy to him beloved to him are you aware are you aware Hallelujah feel the warmth of that glow oh my Thy Word is a lamp it's a light to my path it's not a theory it's not a mental conception oh it's a light follows you hovers over you identifies you separates you from the world Amen amen leads you guides you gives you the victory lights up your Darkness how will you ever navigate laodicea without this Pillar of Fire we'll never get to where we're going Hallelujah Hallelujah my my I've got more material but you know what I just feel his presence just now sure hey man could we give him a few more moments very intently very personally believe that God has a word for you this morning friends what a privilege to live in this atmosphere [Music] what a privilege to have his presence when he came to believe or spoke on word Tabernacle he passed by a lot of churches that come here today but he came because he you came because you're his Dwelling Place he has chosen you to be his Tabernacle he has elected you you are the one he chose and formed and Sanctified and cleansed that he could live in your heart that's why he comes and moves through the church that's why he moves it's not the gift of the preacher it's the presence in the hearts of the believer it's when the lips of fire come together what a privilege Hallelujah and brother Brown said when there's many people today they don't know that Jesus Christ is alive they don't know that he still rules and Reigns they don't know that the blood of Calvary is all sufficient they don't know that it's real today oh my as it was in the days of life what he came himself he came himself he came himself in a body of Flesh and he Vindicated himself to Abraham said so shall it be in the coming of the son of man watch for these things the evening lights are Shining oh the evening lights are shining friends brother bran said did not our hearts burn within us it does not it burn now to know that we are now in the presence of the resurrected Jesus Christ to whom be glory and praise forevermore who is in the express image of the almighty Jehovah who sailed down in the form of a pillar of fire and here he is amen and by his very actions and prophecy the things that were prophesied to this day have been perfectly Vindicated and he says this isn't it enough to make our hearts burn within us isn't it enough isn't it enough oh that hit me like 10 000 volts to think oh you say it but Nathan we you know times are hard and we're down to one or two or three but it's one or two or three in a Million how many things in your life in my life how many circumstances would we change if we could how many regrets there are how many things we would have had it different we would have had it gone a different way amen things didn't go the way that we wanted uh the plan things aren't going according to plan but isn't it enough that he came himself Annie any any any any he revealed his personal presence to you not to the world but to you isn't it enough to make our hearts burn within us is it enough to have his presence oh believer spoke and work don't you know he's here today he's here and he said I'm here to be a present God I'm
