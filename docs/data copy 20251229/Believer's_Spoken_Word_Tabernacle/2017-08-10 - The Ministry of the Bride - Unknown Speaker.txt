give all the time here just to the word of the Lord and just excited to hear and see what the Lord is doing there in in the Philippines you know the things that it's just like where we see here you

I really feel good to be here and I feel the connection with the church with the people and I thank God that the Lord has made a way for us to cross paths I can remember about the first time but a Browning came to the Philippines and we just take the first time we saw each other there's just that connection and I'm just I'm just saddened at the loss of a great soldier of God I believe will will same again race alone well first of all I want to thank the church thank better Samuel here for for keeping the open door keeping this pop it open to me every time I come this puppet is always open and the church the people are always happy to see me and willing to receive what I have to say I just want you to know that every time I stand before you I really feel nervous because you know it's not easy to preach to Americans in a language that I don't really use in my country you know I never preach in English in our country that's risen 2 weeks before coming over sister Chi Chi heard me reading out my devotions out loud in English just the kind of practice my loose in my town so if I mispronounce some of the words I hope you understand First Lord oh well first let me share with you for just a few minutes then you open [Music] or open to us and we're now work working with this community and I entitled the resettled eight community this place is in Mount Pinatubo in some ballast Philippines you remember there was a great eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 this is supposed to be the second biggest eruption of the century and was so big that the ash we live in Manila about four hours drive from this place but there was an inch of asphalt in our roof and in the windowsills I I was told that asks from this volcano eruption even reach as far as Indonesia and Malaysia was so big widespread and a lot of people were displaced see that's the kind of people that were trying to run away from the heat mud flow and it buried from what I understand 13 municipalities in the area and the people that were affected the most are the itis itis are they're like little African brothers you know they look exactly like our our optic African brothers only they're smaller much smaller and that's how they look so they were displaced and government did a lot did their best to resettle them gave them grounds where they can build their house and you know start their lives anew but you see the the the I test this is we call them our output genes this is our this our this tribe our our ancestors there are the roots of the Filipino race they live they live mostly by hunting farming and were the government resettled them they couldn't do anything any of that you know so 16 years after the eruption some of them started going back to where they used to be right at the foot of it the volcano and started planting things and they found out that years after the eruption the ground has become very very fertile and so now some of them have become moved back to where they used to live and here's how the the crater looks now it's a beautiful place now it's now a tourist spot worth a lot of tourists come to see the beautiful scenery now the brother the man second to the left is better Paul I baptized him 12 years ago in some ballast along with 70 70 other eye tests or people that belong to the eye the community Aitu tribe but I wasn't able to do any follow-up work on them you know because the place was just too far from Manila and hard-to-reach but out of the blue two months ago brother Paul came to my church and he brought with him three of his workers in the church I found out that he had became he had become a pastor of some Korean church and he went to Bible School but he said better oh well you know what the things that I heard from you when you presented a message to us I held it dearly in my heart he said that was just so special and we came here today to learn more about the message and so and then he told me that two hundred families of his tribe he mainly leads this whole tribe of itis or Negritos we call him have moved back to Mount Pinatubo where they used to live and they are starting a community and so we went and visited them in some ballast after we they stayed in our in our church for about a week and I told them more about the message and they were just so so happy to learn more about message and after that they took me to some ballast and we devised a plan because they're asking me the request is for us to be able to start a church in the new community were there they are resettling so our church will be the first church to ever build the church in that community praise the Lord for that and we had to haha rent this vehicle here which is the it's a specially designed vehicle for the two to be using the car fields of Pinatubo no other vehicle can make it I mean even the 4x4 vehicles the new ones they can't make it because the road is just too rough so here you can see us preparing to live we brought some supplies to give out to the people that are already residing in the area some of the workers in our church wanted me about 7 of them wanted me travel with me to the area and here we are preparing to go to the place and when we left it was raining hard and then it and then it changed became very hot you know and you see the mission-team bearing the heat of the Sun after the rain now here's one of the huts that they that Negrito Magneto's have started to build in the area this is one of them and this is the place they were they were pointing to me the place where they want us to build a church so we want to thank the Lord for that that he has made a way amen we did not look for it they were the ones the Negrito community were the ones who requested that we build a church in their area so we want to thank the Lord for that and he moved upon the hearts of the leaders but Paul was one of the leaders one of the illness of the whole community and they agreed to receive us and to support whatever we want to do in the air in the community as far as evangelism is concerned here are the some of the men in the community and this is pastoral arena she's a woman preacher she's with the Pentecostal Church but she's a good woman preacher I believe in women preachers you know because good women preachers when they see in the world that they can preach they stop but here she received us gladly and pledged to do whatever she could she can to help us in reaching out to their tribe hallelujah and that's another house there that's they've started to build in the area and this is the Chieftains house and that mainly made of bamboo and grass grass roof and this is the road here you see if you miss if you live in this area and you miss the they call it the weapon carrier it's like a war machine the vehicle that we use is like a war machine but it runs the route once a day and and if the residents miss it you get to rise the you get to ride the cargo cart you see the car back on in the background so instead of three hours you get to ride the carbo cart for about five hours five or six hours anyway because we have to go across the rivers you have to cross this river six times before we can reach the area working here and here are the eight children and this children have to walk two hours to go to school and wait the nearest quiz two hours away to reach their place you cannot go on this vehicle we call it the Skylab you know Filipinos are very creative there's ten people in this scooter it's just a small 150cc scooter but there's ten people in there in that scooter on that scooter or on this this is a tricycle there's probably 15 or 16 people there but you see the condition of the roads you know when the volcano erupted this you cannot see any green thing everything was grey because of the asphalt and the sand that came out of the volcano but now it's a beautiful place you see it's like paradise so one family was given I think two acres of land to tell and so far there are two families that move in the area it's a place called bagong Silang and and in our language Vavoom salon and means the place of the new birth and you can see here how that pops sorry the this man are carrying steel ramps were putting it beneath the tires of our vehicle so that it would not stall in the mud in the Ratna Hartfield we call the mud flow la Jara all it is is sand and mud and ash that's how beautiful the place is now see the crater becomes a beautiful lake and here's the community right here we held the service in this building it's a multi-purpose building and when I go back we'll be will start digging a well and we we've asked them to start producing the cement blocks because there's no problem getting the sand because it's everything sent over there so we just supply cement and maybe some reinforcement bars iron and we will start building the church when we go back so please remember us in prayer okay and I thank you for supporting our missionary endeavor but the bill just sent me mission money I think two months ago for our plantation rubber plantation that we started last year and because somebody donated the 43 hectares and that about 86 acres of property to our church and we are now converting it to a rubber plantation which in five or seven years time will be ilding sap from the rubber no producing rubber and it can yield about a couple thousand dollars per acre on a per hectare two that's two acres per hectare so this project you pray with us because this project will be the Lord tarries it will be able to support the missionary work in our country and there's just so many work to be done in the island of Palawan alone were we where we have the plantation we are doing follow-up work or 60 groups these were denominational groups that came out of their organization and they has embraced the truth of the message 60 just on one Island alone and there are other groups in many different parts of our country that have received a message as a result of the mr. expose seminars that we do amongst the denominational ministers in our country so remember to pray for us amen god bless you and now I'm gonna go to the message and it's not really a sermon it's just a Bible study to kind of remind you of some of the some of the scriptures that refer to our time and day that we're living in and some of the things that the Prophet said about the ministry of the bride hallelujah banaram says the bride in the last days will do the greater works you believe that hallelujah shall we all stand and read the scriptures the book of st. John chapter 14 and verse 12 says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than this shall he do because I go unto my father now he received that the Lord's work the Lord Jesus Christ worked on earth was an unfinished work because he left the church something to do there's something for you and me to do we're not wait we're not here just waiting for him to come back there's we have to do something there is what we call a ministry of the bride in the book of Acts chapter 1 verse 1 and 2 says the former treaties have I made or Theophilus of all that Jesus began both to do and teach now st. Luke I understand was the one who wrote this verse 2 says until the day with which he was taken taken up after that he through the Holy Ghost had given Commandments and to the apostles whom he had chosen a man let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your word thank you for this evening that you have gathered us together once again to this place Lord to hear from your word father we ask for the Holy Spirit to come may you send the anointing both to the speaker and the hearer alike and we pray that you minister to us the power of the Holy Spirit made which every believer in this sanctuary this evening and may meet every meal how physical or spiritual where we commit all things into your hands and promised to give you all the praise and glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen BBC sovereign Berta Burnham expounded on the book of Acts chapter 1 and 2 chapter 1 verse 1 and 2 he said this you remember the former treatise o Theophilus have I wrote unto you quoting the book of Acts that Jesus what that Jesus began to do and continues to do his death did not stop him no sir he returned again not a third person but the same person returned back again in the form of the Holy Ghost you believe that and it continues to work on and continuous on said the book of Acts and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's the token bambam says that's the sign and he continues on said the book of Acts so the work of God continues on through the church so when you look at the title page of the book of Acts it says the Acts of the Apostles but I'm said its it really is the acts of the Holy Spirit in the lives of the Apostles um so we read in the book of Acts how they taught the word how they ministered to the poor and heal the sick and cast out demons exactly like the Lord Jesus prophesied when he was alive said if you believe in me the works that I do will continue you will do also the works that I do the same work she will do and he didn't stop there he said greater works than they shall you do because I go to the Father our conclusion is the church now is the continuation of the Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ on earth and it will continue on until he returns back to earth hallelujah to take the bride away there is such a thing as the ministry of the bride but what venemous asked the question would the Bride of Christ have a ministry before the rapture and the answer was sure that is what is going on right now it started when brother Branham was here you see the Bride of Christ certainly it is the message of the hour the ministry of the bride is the message of the hour hallelujah it's not some denomination that's why I wonder about these people who after hearing the message and believing the message for so many years turned their backs and give the message but God is doing something through the bride to people that have recognized their day and the age that they're living in and they received the word for their day this is the message of the hour see the Bride of Christ sure she's consisted of apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that way that's the Bride of Christ sure she's got a ministry it is a great ministry it's the ministry of the hour and I'm gonna talk about that ministry today tonight to you yeah and better BAM said then this ministry is will be so humble hey man it would be so humble so we see that the the work of the Lord continued on for 2,000 years since the day of Pentecost and at the end of two thousand years where BAM said there's gonna be a bride aged he said we are not living in a Pentecostal age no this is different age matter package said the church ages are over this this is not included in the church ages this is a different age see we're not living in a Methodist age we're living in another age we're living up here on the bride age the calling out of the church and getting it together for the rapture this is what's going on right now the church is ministering I take that bad the Holy Spirit is ministering to the bride hallelujah and getting the bride ready and getting it together for the rapture that stage that we're living in right now to my honest opinion verbum said that's exactly the truth this is Jesus in Bride form you know the denominational world they're waiting for Jesus to come back again because Jesus said I will come again what they don't know is he is here he just changed his form this is the same Jesus in bride for me let me read it to you but you remember when it went down and the grain begin to ripen that you find before that grain can ripen everything in that stock has to be dead hallelujah can't you see we are where we are standing life is in the grain again what is it just exactly like the same grain that went into the ground amen the very same grain that went into the ground the same Jesus in bride form one grain went into the ground but the wheat plant came forward and in the end a cluster of grain appeared it's the same grain the same life the same Jesus only it's multiplied it's the same Jesus in bright form hallelujah the same word sucked up through this and come out here and come to a head here and all that life come through here pick up its people now it's forming up into a head for the rapture I believe that with all my heart and then better been better been explained the word and morphe God and more feet the changing of mass God's simply changes his mask he said who is this no kiss addict he said this in this way God and Murphy mask in the pillar of fire who is that mirror fire who is behind the pillar of fire it's God he's masking himself in the form of that pillar of fire and God in morphe in a man called Jesus who is that man called Jesus none other than supreme deity hallelujah God in morphe then it says God and morphe in his church it is God changing his form changes my mask now his mask is his church hallelujah is that God above us God with us now it's God in us the condescending of God God has come descended into the hearts of believers what is it it's God himself supreme deity and morphe changing his mask hiding behind the church manifesting is very life and power through the church the believers of the message of the our Alleluia I don't know if you noticed this but it got my intention when the in the seven church ages better Banham he said that there was one that there was a man John saw a man walking in the midst of the golden candlestick we all know that's Jesus Christ right this is the son of God the Son of Man that's Jesus Christ walking in the midst of the seven Church ages he seen their meets right now but listen to what Darwin said in this quotation 1954 now that's the Bible that's what the Spirit says see their candlesticks all right now the 13th verse and in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks is one like the son of man and then he expounds what one like him cause this he said the bride his bride one like him it's not really here but it's one like him hallelujah what's how it was clothed with a garment down to the foot the holiness of Jesus Christ covering her has washed us from our sins with his own blood all right great about the paps paps is a woman's breast his everyone says not a man it's a woman this son of man is a woman oh my goodness oh my goodness with a golden girdle the gospel that held the power and glory of God over the body of Christ hallelujah he's saying the person that was walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks is the bride is like the son of man not the son of man per se but one like the son of man one like him he's the word there for this bride must be the Word of God hallelujah one exactly like him oh my I love him don't you so now we see the combination of the Old Testament the Old Testament which is mainly the law do this don't do this it's actually the male part of the Bible the strictness of the male demand the husband you know most rules come from the father of the house and his trick too and when it comes to implementing the rules so the law is God's rules and we see the ending of the law at the ending of the law and the law ended Jesus appeared in the flesh because really God showed us that Jesus was the very idea of the law only Jesus could fulfill the law no one else could do it and we see the combination or the ending of the Old Testament with Christ coming in the form of flesh that's the combination of the law and then came the New Testament what is that that's the female part of the book grace like the mother is more gracious than the father when the children gets a spanking from the father they run to the mother they know where grace is so let me tell you what grace is actually no one could fulfill no one was able to fulfill the law to the letter so God said I'm going to change my covenant I'm gonna make you a new Anu and your agreement now a new contract what I'm gonna do I'll send my spirit into your hearts so that I will actually be dwelling in you and I will be performing and I will be fulfilling my own word through you you have nothing to do with it I do the sacrificing I do the baptizing me the Holy Ghost I dwell in you I sanctify your life amen I do the good works through you I tell you with my Holy Spirit it's actually me doing the works holiday but in the end you get the reward [Applause] that's why the Bible calls the New Testament grace a better covenant my hallelujah praise the Lord and at the end of the grace age we see grace operate for 2,000 years right and at the end of two thousand years we see what do we see it's the bride manifesting in flesh the Bride of Christ appearing on the scene Alleluia why because the Bride of Christ is the combination of grace us Jesus was the combination of law then the female part now grace the culmination of grace is the brighter price that's why we're here in the last H we are here if we come to the scene hallelujah come on the scene hallelujah Myrtle berm costs this the bride coming of Christ hallelujah I love it he said as Christ was the first one to raise from their problems on the profits and so forth all those type in many places he was the first fruits of this that slab of those that's left in the bride coming of Christ oh my what kind of a language is this the bride coming of Christ they talk about the second coming but Berman talks about the bride coming of Christ hallelujah coming out of the church haven't we all there'll have to be a sheep wait again wave it again that's the cluster of ripened grain the Sheep waved again in the last days oh my matured grain matured weak hallelujah but this bride is going to have a ministry in the last days Alleluia hallelujah verbum said I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people the first time that will come forth for the bride aids for a resurrection of a out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the people bothered by the same signs and wonders that he did back there of mine we have arrived this is the bride coming of Christ hallelujah denominational people they're still waiting hallelujah but he is here oh my I'm so glad that he has come he did not come back for denominational people he did not come back for religious groups but he came back for the bride hallelujah and Balram said seven church ages when the bride will get back to being a war bride she will produce the very works that Jesus produced Oh what's the purpose of the message the message came to turn our hearts back to our fathers again to bring back the original life that has been initially manifested on the day of Pentecost when they were baptized with the Holy Ghost and vanna vanna explained to us but the Holy Ghost was it was a very life of God it's the very life of God manifested in Christ the very life that he manifested we are to manifest the same here on earth hallelujah and we are to become the word bright you read in the Bible where we are discouraged from marrying unbelievers don't yoke yourself up with people who don't believe hallelujah even before the Israelites came to the promised land Moses commanded them not to marry the Haydn's the hidden people that they're going to find living in Canaan hallelujah but marry amongst themselves Alleluia don't Mar the seedling hallelujah don't marry unbelievers so Jesus commanded that the word commanded at her and he's our example Jesus will not marry a denominational Church Jesus can only marry the word bride amen if you are not the word then he will have nothing to do with you you must be the word in order to marry the word hallelujah he said I'm gonna make a people likened unto myself he said in in exposition of church seven Church ages it was God's purpose too big for the people like unto himself that would be a word breifing say that with me word right it's a word bride she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him she was for known and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the earth think of it she was redeemed by the very blood and can never be that can never come into condemnation she can never be in judgment because sin cannot be imputed into her oh my that's the Bride of Christ that's a word bride Alleluia the word bride will sit with Jesus on the throne he said this now then there will not be one person who will sit in the throne of the Lord Jesus Christ unless he has been living that word oh my that's heavy your prayers your fastings your repentance is none of your good works no matter what you present to God none of that will gain you the privilege of sitting on the throne none of your religion will grant you the privilege of sitting on the throne it will be granted only to the word bride [Music] as the throne of the king is shared with the Queen because she is united to him so only they who are of that word even I see so that's word will share that throne oh my I love that don't you brushing of the song we are all familiar with this quotation but I'll read it anyway and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth cause it is part of him I'm part of him so are you and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfillment of revelations any others has spoken of the Bible it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom then it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is ten what kind of language is this it's not even grammatically correct she is him [Applause] as a man and a woman are one and a woman taken from the side she had taken a spiritual defendant of the feminist spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and dynamics the wife the bride becomes the wife hallelujah that's what she is the spirit of him and the pleasure pin and put together and made mechanics and dynamics hallelujah it's important to understand the different teachings of this message it's important to understand the sequence of events that are about to take take place in the future and that are taking place now hallelujah it's important to know the doctrines of this message hallelujah but you see all of this is just mechanics it's important to abide by church order phone cell phones off that's important yeah hallelujah but even that it's just a part of the mechanics but the Bride of Christ is both mechanics and dynamics hallelujah I don't have to explain that to you the dynamics is the power of the Holy Spirit in the church hallelujah the teaching no matter how good it is how wonderful the revelation is without the power of the Holy Ghost it's just a dead duck train hallelujah but the Bride of Christ is not dead he has both the mechanics and the dynamics to back it up hallelujah the token Bedouin said this it has to be because a woman and her husband become one they become one and so does the bride and Christ become one in another quotation a man and a woman are not two persons but they're one one person that's why when the Bible says that my glory will I not give to another and it's the father speaking but then we read in the Bible where the father gives it to the son he gives glory to his son but when he gives his glory to his son it doesn't negate his statement prior statement that he will not give his glory to another because when the father gives his glory to his son he did not give it to another person it's the same person are you ready when he gives you glory you see all this mysteries were given for our glory it's a glorious message my brothers and sisters and it's given for your glory heavenly and we always say glory to God glory to him glory to Him glory to the Lord God is saying going to you he gives you glory hallelujah and when he gives you glory when when God when Jesus gives that the church the bride glory he neither eats the cherry is glowing with another person because Jesus and the bride is one person don't be scared to take it you're not thinking they can take away any glory from him if he's giving it to you Alleluia amen hallelujah they become one and so the surprise and price become one diminishing listen to this one the ministry of the bride and the ministry of christ is the same i say amen to that [Music] [Applause] you have to become the word now how does that happen how do I become the world it's it's hard to fathom sometimes you know God is omnipotent omniscient his holiness righteous he's all-powerful how how can I be like him how can I beat the word the word is sharper than any two-edged sword and it's powerful and it's quick hallelujah how can I be the world when one said this Jesus had perfect faith he said it and it come because he was the word he had perfect faith because he was the word are you with me and you become the word one who you become the word you become the word as you received the word oh my I think that's this is simple enough for me this is not high seola gee how do you become the word you become the word simply by receiving the word if you can take the word hallelujah if he abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will and it will be done to you hallelujah Bertram says a man that is fully surrendered to God is omnipotent and I believe it you can be the word how by receiving the word you can be the word hallelujah you see if you say to this mountain be move and don't doubt but believe that what you've said in what you have said then you shall have what you said when you pray believe that you receive what you have asked for and you shall have it and it will be given to you time-space nothing else will ever change it you know it's done it's already over well how do you become the word by receding the world I say amen to every word hallelujah now we have this survivor because of the message it's called the revival of the bride you may ask what is the revival of the bride where is it you're looking at it I am the brides revival Alleluia it takes the Spirit of God to bring life and that life must not come out of just the intellectual revival it's not knowing all the doctrines of the message that's just intellectual knowledge it's got to come out of the Bible the word revival this revival is a special revival nothing like it hallelujah has ever took taking place in the history of Christianity this is not a healing revival this is not a crowd revival you see we see all these mega churches now sprouting and they're there all they say they're there they're taking pride at the kind of crowds that they gather they say to be qualified as a mega church you have to have 2,000 people attending your Sunday church Sunday Sunday morning service come so far from being that but we are not to make a church maybe maybe I'm my new church well this is not a crowd survivor revival this is a word revival and then Bertram said I believe we are living in a very wonderful glorious day of opportunity when peoples of this daily living are living to see the shadows of the coming of the Son of God I believe with all my heart that the world is going to burst now into the greatest revival take no it into the greatest revival that was ever known or it's going to be too into the darkest chaos that's ever been known in history now you pick your choice hallelujah I don't care what Minister turned their back on the message I don't care about about their negative things that they post on Facebook home I don't have time to read all of that I'm just enjoying my revival right now [Applause] and just enjoying the first kill of this hour feasting on the word it's a revival unlike any other hallelujah but one said this revival will be so small that they'll never know it ever happened I'm telling you it's happening right now and the whole world knows nothing about it hallelujah this scripture should mean more to us than any other time Romans chapter 8 verse 18 and 19 it says for i recon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory what the glory which shall be revealed in whom in us goddesses for surprise for you and me God is gonna surprise this world Alleluia the suffering of this world will will not be a words to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God this scripture means this whole world is groaning is crying out and it's in a in a tantrum hallelujah this world is out of control the weather is out of control our waters are getting polluted the air is getting polluted the forests are the same hallelujah the the weather condition isn't controllable hallelujah what's happening whole creation is looking for its master the whole creation is looking for sons of God amen who can control it I'm telling you we have arrived amen because bambam said everything that Christ that Adam lost he has now restored back to the church hallelujah are you here have we arrived hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord amen and we'll come we will be speaking to the winds we will be speaking to the storms and to the weather condition and it will obey us we are the masters we're the manifestation of the sons of God that's what it means God has ordained us to be masters of this earth hallelujah God Lord she's over the heavens were supposed to be lording it over on the earth all creation should be under us hallelujah and that's what the full word has restored in our hands hallelujah in her power thank you Jesus the Son of Man joins the church to the head listen to this proving his word no more as a church see we're not a church the bride is called seeing that they the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the head to unite the marriage of the bride something is taking place there's a marriage taking place right now it's so you're 19 the whole world doesn't see it but it's taking place it's happening right now the bridegroom call will come right through this when the Son of Man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together the son of man ministry and Bertram did not stop at his ministry as a prophet son of man is prophet God revealing himself as a prophet to the whole world and Bertram doesn't just mean his ministry revealing Jesus Christ listen to this the church has to be the word and he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it will take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman I don't know do you see what I mean see it's son of man in bright form son of man ministry the ministry of the bride hallelujah Jesus Christ will come down into human flesh amongst us and will make his word so real that it will unite the church and Amos 1 the bride and then she'll go home to be to the wedding supper amen she's already United we are going to the wedding supper [Applause] it's like in the Philippines after the wedding ceremony there's this reception that follows the ceremony well the ceremony's happening now the marriage is taking place here don't wait for the rapture to get married to the Lord you need to be united with Christ here right now hallelujah and then we go to the wedding supper then we go interrupts you we're going to the wedding supper we're not going to be married to the Lord we already married yet but we go to the marriage supper hallelujah manifestation of sons adoption but when said this now all things has been brought coming shaping into a headstone to the manifestation of sons coming back and the Spirit of God coming to this man plural this man not just by random but this man so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like Christ until it will join him and his church together hallelujah oh my oh my don't get me started preaching I'm just reading this and sharing this with you welcome said this is the manifestation of the hour we must live by the world because the bride is a part of the bridegroom like any white is a part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour is what's happening today right now this hour the manifestation of this hour hallelujah the bride not a preacher denomination but the living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this are that we are now living in we are the expression of the very attributes of God from the foundation of the world you see that it's a perfect type Moses was a one man means ministry and then Joshua succeeded him better Bellamy's are Moses today he was our Moses today after that is the Joshua ministry that's the Ministry of the bride that's the Holy Spirit in the bride our Joshua today is the Holy Spirit Aled is no longer a one-man ministry it is a body ministry hallelujah listen to this one look God in his body what is that God in his body that's Christ and then Christ in his body Christ in his body was that the bride oh my I love this God made manifest in Christ Christ made manifest in the bride and as God took the body of Adam the woman and she fell and God took from the body of Christ his Flash's body which is his word and it's being a bride out that won't fall by denomination or creed no sir but she is coming back with a pure unadulterated Word of God being manifested hallelu a spire when Eve was taken from Adam as he was sleeping here's Adam awaking from a deep sleep and it since this beautiful woman be late laying beside her God did not have to introduce her to Adam right away he recognized who she is he looked at her and said she's me he sees himself in this bride hallelujah because everything Adam was is in the bride everything price versus in the bride hallelujah thank you Jesus and this is our Commission this is the Ministry of the bride now and I took the little book out of the Angels hand revelations 10 verse 10 to 11 and a t-top and it was in my mouth the sweetest honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and tongues and nations and kings this now is our commission woe unto you if you are not fulfilling this commission hallelujah that's the reason we go to every tribe in our country there's about a hundred different tribes in our country and we will not leave any stone unturned until we find that last seed because unless we find that last seed we're not going anywhere so we're in this together this is our ministry hallelujah our ministry is to prophesy again prophesy again meaning prophesy of the same book that came open in our day not another book nothing use doctrine Alleluia but we are to say the same thing that has already been said prophesy the same the very same thing that has already been prophesied Alleluia amen now people go overboard on this in our country there are church groups that they say they want to bring back better burnham being behind the pulpit being in back in the church again and so they're just playing the CDs no-life preaching that's not the ministry of the bride they say don't you know but one said say what the tapes say yes I understand that absolutely I am absolutely understand that statement somebody has to say what the same was the peg say [Applause] you didn't say play it said say you what the we must prophesy again hallelujah if this message will find that last is hallelujah and it will have the same effect in your life hallelujah sweet in the mouth but bitter in the belly it's so nice to talk about the message so my time just stands still if you talk about the message I look at better right here when we start talking about the message time just stands still [Laughter] we don't run out of words to say message is so rich it's so deep it's so wonderful it's so beautiful to talk about holiday but once you swallow it meaning once you apply it in your life then the bitter experiences will start to come in persecutions will come people will misunderstand you call us cult hallelujah bitter in the stomach hallelujah my bad mom said if it's a bitter it will not do you any good Lois thank you Jesus so the bride age is God's happiest moment in time think about it I say a chapter 6 is to verse 5 for us a young man mariette and virgin so shall thy sons marry thee and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride so shall my god rejoice over thee we think we're excited for the rapture so is God excited for the rapture think of it this is the happiest moment in God amen that God never had in time hallelujah oh my oh my why because everything that God was he bought into Christ and everything that Christ ever was he poured into the bride hallelujah amen now here better Bronwen thought that when Jesus said greater works than these shall you do because I go to the Father he thought it meant more of the same he was just one man performing all this works this miracles but he said when the Holy Spirit was poured into the church now there's many of us performing many miracles doing many good deeds and he was explained to explain that it's more the same now the word there in the King James says greater works than this will you do for but if you'll run that back to the Greek lexicon you'll find out that it doesn't mean greater it means more he said you couldn't do greater he stopped nature He healed the sick he raised the dead he done things well there could be no more done but you could do more of it because he would be in his church as the branch has to bind in his branches or the whole world around the same thing more of the same that was his initial understanding of this scripture but they understand him progressed he didn't stop there but he said you do the same thing plus he said identification pipe identifications he said that's the message of the church Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever living in the church king of the church raised from the dead same yesterday today and forever performing the same works doing the same things that Jesus did that's the message of the church if the church isn't teaching that it's teaching us some false theology we should be doing the same work hallelujah all were teaching a false theology that's what Jesus commanded them to preach and then he said this I quoted that once and a man said sure we do the greater works we preach the gospel to all the world he didn't do it in his day and the man said the truth I mean Jesus did not come to Ohio and preach the gospel somebody else brought the brass for here he didn't come to the Philippines and to those strike people in Mount Pinatubo some somebody else has to go there and preach to them hallelujah adoption Darwin said this oh my I hate this I hate this that I don't have the time remember time stands still [Applause] the Spirit of God coming to men now all things has been brought coming shaping up to our headstone to the manifestation of saw of God sons of God coming back and the Spirit of God spirit about coming to this man so perfectly until their minutes will be so so close to Christ it will join him and the church together I think we discussed that already but he said something else imparting eternal life is the greater work that you do don't take my word for it let me read this now notice that greater works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the sick by prayer and cast out Devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to believers the Holy Ghost was coming and given into the hands of the church hallelujah to impart life oh that's what Carville and Calvary meant we are able we have the power in our hands to impart eternal life so those who will believe think about it Jesus Christ did not do it on earth while he was on earth no he does fall in our lot to do it after we preach and the people believe the word he will have eternal life hallelujah it took stoop degraded man that's me you me and women and lifted them up to a place to be sons and daughters of God to heal the sick and to impart eternal life by giving the Holy Ghost to obedient believers men who were once unbelievers to be made believers and impart spiritual eternal life that's the ministry of the bride Jesus Christ did not weeks the baptism of the Holy Ghost can you show me in the Bible where he did it no well BAM said the Holy Ghost wasn't there yet how could Jesus preached on the baptism of the Holy Ghost it wasn't it hasn't come yet he said Jesus could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost because it hadn't come yet that's the greater works we are doing but do the same work she did he said you would hallelujah are you ready speaking things into existence is the greater works there was no record that Jesus ever did this in his time in the Bible can you find it for me it's not there did you notice one even when we made water into wine he took water first there already created substance and turned it into wine water was already there but he just turned it into one when he fed the 5,000 people he took a face that walk once swam in the water and broke it and hand it out and in multiplied creation he took bread that was one sweet and baked it into bread broke it and hung it out to the handed out to the people and it returned back again multiplied creation huh but they did not speak anything to into existence he just multiplied creation hallelujah but in the last days listen how in the last days where there is no sign of creation he speaks it into creation anyhow shows to be the same God that was in the beginning he can create squirrels he can create whatever he wants to because He is God greater things than this will you do for I go unto the father the words infallible and has to be manifested and has to be fulfilled greater than this she'll you do not multiplying not more of the same it doesn't mean more of the same but speaking out into creation it's made of made available to you now the believers of the message oh my we have arrived my brothers and sisters he says I believe I'm not going to speak it in his name but I'm going to speak it in my revelation of my faith I'm trusting that you have a revelation of your faith now you're not relying on somebody else faith you're not relying on the pastor's faith it's your own personal revelation hallelujah and you can do as well about him says I can speak it in the revelation of my faith what happened in Sabino Canyon the other day I believe that the hour is approaching when missing limbs will be restored and the glorious power of the creator I believe it's a man of he if he can make a squirrel appear that has no he here if he if a man or a woman just got a part missing and that's a complete animal in itself oh he is God limbs will be spoken back to existence that's the greater works and this work has been allotted to you believers of this age hallelujah oh my but remember you have to qualify it sheis him has to be qualified because if not this is a dangerous thing in our country people have started preaching she is him she is him come they now think that they are the Word made flesh today they became the work so one minister of this group I stood before a convention of people and tore up the pages of his Bible and trampled upon the Bible that we don't need this Bible because we are the Word made flesh today that's getting overboard that's extremism that's losing the balance of things we have to we have to have the right balance of things we have to qualify the statement she is him because Colossians chapter 1 verse 8 says and he is the head of the body Christ and the bride and one person but Christ is still the head we are the body he Christ is the object of worship we are not Christ is the masculine part we are the feminine part is all right amen you need to qualify these things officiants chapter 1 verse 22 in 20 and has put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all like a safe prices the object of worship we are not and skip that now here are the scriptures that pertain to the head Christ this cannot apply to the believer to the body I want you to pay attention the revealing of the Son of Man Exodus chapter 4 verse 8 this can only apply to the prophet Moses to the Lord Jesus Christ Moses was the leader of his time Jesus Christ was the leader in his time he is still our leader right he's the head of the church and it shall come to pass if they will not believe the unite their hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the laughter sign Moses had two signs but Abraham had two signs now do you you can't apply it to the believer hallelujah because this is head scriptures but scriptures pertaining to the head only and as it wasn't the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the Son of Man the revealing of the Son of Man likewise also in the days of lot even that shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed the revealing of the son of man when brother Branham started discerning spirits and pronouncing people healed amen that's Christ in Berlin and it's the only one that could do that it can never be duplicated because this scripture pertains to the hand another scripture that pertains to the head jesus answered a senator if thou knewest the gift of God and who is it the selling to be give me to drink thou would have have asked of him and he would give thee he would have given thee living water only Christ can give you the punching effect of the living water of the Holy Spirit of the Word of God only Christ can do that to you you can get living water from your brother or your sister only Jesus Christ can give it to you hallelujah my love in John 4 verse 17 to 19 the woman answered and said I have no husband he said unto her that was well said I have no husband for our spy husband and the one Dallas is not by her husband in that says thou truly Roman 17 sir I perceive that our prophet thou art the Son of man now only Jesus can do this this is not for the rest of the body he's only Jesus now the scripture hallelujah Luke chapter 10 verse 22 all things are delivered to me of my father and no man no where to the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and to whom who the son will reveal him this can only pertain to the head I cannot reveal the father to you I cannot give you a revelation of the word of God only God can do that Jesus the head only can do that hallelujah body scripture now this is for you now this is the body scriptures that pertain to the body is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord as for you mark 16 verse 15 to 17 is for you and they said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and this shall signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with other mean new tongues and so forth is for you first Corinthians 12:10 to another to working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues to another interpretation of time this is for you greater works hallelujah first Corinthians chapter 12 verse 11 to 14 but all these worketh that one of the same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will for as the body is one and has many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ Christ is a many membered body by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles Americans or Filipinos whether we be bond or free and have been made to drink into one spirit first Corinthians chapter 12 verse 11 14 but all this work at that one and the sub same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will force a body's one and as let me skip that hallelujah okay now the minister of the bride will make more sense to the message this means not just playing the tapes or receiving but this man will man said if they pick up this this message and goes out with it they can make more sense to it see to bring it to a place that you would I just want to lay the seed and then hope that they may they they the pipe of ministry the believers the church the bride in this age can make it come to life lujah the eyes of people that they try to play the tapes of better Branham to them they could not even relate they don't know word in English somebody has to make more sense after the message to those people hallelujah the Son of Man is revealed through the bride now we'll skip some bit better man starts discerning and pronouncing people healed and then he said I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of the son of man in human flesh through the bride's body you believe that I believe it with all my heart hallelujah Hebrews chapter 11 verse 14 see how you important your work is to God Hebrews 11 40 God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect after listening the heroes of faith Abraham Elijah and so forth and God says without you they will never be perfect and then Bertram explains a little bit you get it these people who died in there are depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection this church has got to come to perfection to bring the resurrection and they are under Essos souls under the altar waiting for this church to come to its perfection that's when Christ does come uniting time and sign I think this is the last quotation we find that now the time comes when the trumpet sounds that those sleeping Saints back there that could not be made perfect without us they are depending on us on Brian Hebrews 11 and when they come together they unite with the living ones and the church uniting with the word then the church and the word uniting together and being becoming one the dead Saints with the living Saints uniting together to be one and all going together to United Christ under for the wedding supper of the Lamb I should end this one amen but let me just say we are fulfilling 2nd Corinthians chapter 5 verse 18 says all things are of God who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and as given to us the Ministry of reconciliation we have something to do bring sinners before his presence God there preach the gospel be a witness to somebody hallelujah I'm just so happy to be able to pitch the congregation of about 100 people in UAE in the nation of Dubai the city of Dubai one of the people but 20 different nationalities were represented in that congregation now you're listening these are all believers of the message I started a church in Dubai and 20 different denominations are believing the message in in the Middle East and you know if you look at the location you just crossed the border and it's Israel I believe what the Prophet said as the Jews brought the gospel to us we will bring the message to them [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelu let's all stand may God richly bless you amen now you'll be able to identify your part of the body because God is now using a many membered body in this bride ministry of the bride and there is a revival taking place just right now it's not a big revival number survival miracle revival not a healing revival is the word revival it's only for the work bride why don't we just sing will work till Jesus comes [Music] amen something for us to do [Music] till Jesus comes till Jesus comes again [Music] amen hallelujah you know the word when it comes it it challenges us if all God did was come and bring a message and we were just to handle this message and that's it there's no responsibility but you find that Paul told every church he said a dispensation of the gospel is committed to me against my will that you were fulfilled the will of God amen the Prophet couldn't do that he fulfilled what God ordained him to fulfill when you think of those when I look at those what what has been said and those quotes ring in my heart that's a great responsibility brem says younger men he said will come and take this gospel and take it in a greater way than it is now that's tremendous isn't it it's not another message but it's the same God now what's been spoken becomes preeminent in the lives of the people and that scripture that God is you know how I look at that I always look at publications and I hardly ever see that that I never see that quoted in a publication but that is the truth that is where we're at in this hour in revelations 10 8 through 11 that is the ministry that is going on now amen it is that the capstone revelation that has sounded out brought the bride and Christ United as one that's the ministry that's going on and our lives you know even when you don't even say anything but our lives are prophesying out because it's the life of the blood in us that tokin life that speaks out Amen there there try to place you in a world system but we're not we're not of this world we're not of the system we're of that other world and then God has called to our hearts and when we look at that responsibility that laid upon us there's no way that it is by our strength by our might it is solemnly by the sovereign power of Almighty God Amen you love him Amen let's just let this be a prayer tonight of the words that we have we've heard a man to be glorified for him to be glorified in our life is for all that he is to be shown forth you know when he says in his word Jesus was here he was in his time of departure in John 12 he says father glorify that name and he said I have glorified it and I will glorify it again this is that hour where the name of the Lord is glorified in the bride of Jesus Christ it's his life we are bone of his bone life of his life she is him amen you know as I I told the church I was preaching on the name of the Lord in New York I said when you when you say the term giraffe you have to have a signification of what a giraffe is if you've ever seen a giraffe you and I say the word dref you don't think of a oh let me see he's trying to describe some animal and you think of a chihuahua that's not a giraffe so a name has a characteristic it has a signification in it is that right so that name to be glorified again will be the full reflection full life full manifestation of Jesus Christ amen don't you love him amen glory be to God let's let this be a prayer tonight be a man and then we'll be dismissed in the name of the amen in my glory 5p glorified [Music] glorify today let's sing that again in my life Lord [Music] Oh [Music] yes [Music] [Music] be glorified today hit my home or my [Music] home [Music] [Music] today [Music] Heavenly Father Lord thank you Lord for your word that you have spoken
