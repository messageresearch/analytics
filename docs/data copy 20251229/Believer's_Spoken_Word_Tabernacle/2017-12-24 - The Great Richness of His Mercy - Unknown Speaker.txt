in all her life and I mean she's had children and everything but anyway they had to wait so many hours each time as she's eaten they can't they can't take you in and put you out we've tell that so many hours after that I think about six hours or something so so you know we thought well been through this five times and they will take her in and and put her to sleep and put the hip back in and so men David what's out we went to get something I hadn't eaten since breakfast that day and I was kind of fainting and we waited and we was there one of the people that the hospital come and got us and said the doctor wants to see you and so we you know they put you in this little room where they can talk to you privately and there's the the doctor the anesthesiologist I think come out and he he can tell he was really upset and really nervous and he was saying you know they're working on her to get that out of her lungs he said that we don't he said it's so rare it happens but when when they started putting that back you know she lost her food so it went in her lungs and they was trying that you know I I really feel they was trying to save her life they bout we bout lost her there and you

and they had her in in about this tubes down her in a strap in her mouth and couldn't do anything and had her restricted her arms and first she couldn't no they didn't want to pull that out and she was unconscious of course that she was trying I guess your body you're trying to fight that you're trying to breathe on your own and get out of that and she was trying to pull up and all those machines was going off and all the noises as Megan and I was saved God faint my heart when you're someone and you come that close and 52 years you become as one and I was just trying to pray and and I

and I said no he's here it's gonna be okay and what a comfort to know in those times you can go to him and I'll tell you brothers try to you know you kind of take things for granted they're there for you they're there with you but when it comes something close like that you see you know you might lose that treasure and I know you'll see them again but it's just that it's hard to let them go and I went home and I was praying with all my heart I'm trying us I know we can't tell what God what to do but we can ask him he told us to ask and I was pleading as Lord you know how I need her prettiest pair cuz when I left they told me you can't stay in the in the you know all night indeed I see you they don't like for you to do that so that's okay I respect them and went home but I believe God answered prayer and I know she's not out of it yet but I know he C is true and you know we don't know what time he's gonna call on his home so this I say cherish your loved ones cherish your time together with your family I'm encouraging you cherish your brothers and sisters I know father takes them you know you see him again and I know when you pray his no it's just a good is it yes because

[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] god bless you I've had custom oneís and the reason I haven't gave him cuz I break down when I get up sure first one I was back at the beginning of December I've been in the hospital twice of blood clots in my leg and my leg was getting sore and I felt my leg had this hard spot I felt like this and thank the Lord that brother Dewayne and brother Sam at that time that the word that they was bringing it brought me faith and I still don't know where to the Lord and the Lord took it away from me I didn't have to go to hospital this other testimony it's like brother Chris you know the Lord knows your heart and the Lord has put this young lady and her boy he's five years old he's autistic but I met my heart years ago and she's been going through hard times her bills were more than what she is I helped her out whenever I can it and again it's been weeks ago and she sent me to sing on messenger and I don't know about messenger on phone so anyway I come out the woods I'm out here so on a Thursday and I look at my message and I don't know messenger so I go to the caller and when I punched on my phone I hit favorites and you know and her name come up and I'm calling it I said it's person isn't available though maybe I did something wrong so I put it in context her name come up and I called her up and she's telling me how you know she's at her wits end she's gonna move so she's gotta go down to North Carolina hopefully she can get housing paid for and all this stuff and you know and just that the her bills will be covered and she wouldn't have to struggle so hard and I said well you know you can't do that you know you get down there you don't have no residents you don't know if how long it take to get approved and you just can't do that you know inside I you know I love that little boy you see my heart I said I'll help you I hope you paid bills this is the Testament I forgot her all calm down she goes how did you come my phone been shut off for three days the Lord knows your heart they do these people in my heart and you know I believe the Lord open up that phone line just so you know things would go right and they need a great testimony but God he's still got he could open up a phone line you know I tried calling her again and they didn't go through that's my testimony forgive me for holding back I know that the testimonies that we give give strength and forgive me for holding back these these are like a month older I'm sorry we got a special at this time they would come if you're staying you're welcome I'm gonna talk

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] 861 you're [Music] I [Music] you [Music] [Music] I want to see [Music] [Music] we just thank God for His mercy this morning you know I couldn't help but I sit back there and I was listening to the testimonies that were being given and I thought of the testimony that my brother gave here on Thursday night and I called him brother Joshua because sometimes I get his name wrong and pronouncing it didn't you hadn't have to forgive me brother Joshua amen I love you I just I the testimony that our brother gained with right here that night and I just I want us as it has an assembly let us be mindful of what God is trying to tell him because you know sometimes when I'm going through and I'm studying things and I got studies sometimes just a vast number of and it just of looking at scriptures and quotes and they're just looking look and saying God what do you want I came across a quote which you are very familiar with and the Holy Spirit brought it back to my attention when you were giving these testimonies and when brother Joey made the statement here at the latter part of his testimony of how that by all laws that call should not have went through that call should not have went through you you could you can you can talk about it you can try to it should not have went through and my meeting in my heart went back to the testimony I was reading and brother Branham he he tells of this in the in the demonology series when he's preaching demonology part one then he comes around and he mentions it again in another message that he preaches in demonology and you remember the the man who had brought the baby and I just want you to see the sovereignty of how God will move sometimes the man had brought the baby with the brain condition and that and it it needed a touch from God and the man and his wife had sold things and they had done all that they could do in order to bring him to the the meeting to be prayed for and when they got him there here he comes upon the platform and the spirit of God begins to speak concerning the condition that is within this baby's life and as the Spirit of the Lord is speaking it says there is a doctor who can perform this surgery now you would look at that now how many times that God has moved and just miraculously healed the the lives of many that were bound with things but it's important to the details that the Prophet lays on before and afterwards as he goes through each time he tells it and what it was Mayo Clinic had told now Mayo Clinic it would be like I guess the equivalency of what brother John maybe Cleveland Clinic or or these other ones down in Maryland or wherever these other hospitals are that would be the equivalency so here God has it known that Mayo Clinic has said there's no way there's no operation that can be done on this baby no operation but the Spirit of God says there can be and the man walks off they're disappointed cuz brother Graham says I know you're not gonna I know you're not gonna like this see sometimes things happen and we don't like the way they're happening because it's not according to our expectations right but here God is showing that he's God regardless of the opinions and statements of man can make of all that they know and hear but the man is walking down the street brother Branham the Spirit of God let him know this would be this would be the color and this is the color of the man's hair black headed man the doctor and so forth so he's walking down the street and this woman you know she catches it and so forth and and here the woman comes up - oh what's wrong with the baby and everything and and so then the lady says oh she says I by the way she said there's a doctor it's out here in this country that right over here out in the country that performs that that surgery the man was not even catching and all of a sudden as the conversation goes on brother brems says then he caught it wait a minute what did you just say to me that's the greatness of God you see God is showing to us God not only has did it has declared himself to this generation that he's the faithful God but God is declaring himself over and over to you and I and I'll tell you this right now this is what I would do just like the Prophet said in in in in spiritual food in due season he says that we would accumulate these things into our life for that faith I would take these testimonies and whatever that might be that you might be facing or going through and I would begin to look at this and say God you are letting me know that even though the laws of the land and the laws of way things work with communication and everything like that but you're letting me know that nothing is beyond I believe that with all my heart and I and not just for me I'll speak that not just you know for as this assembly but I'll speak that for for myself as well I'm just setting back there and the Holy Spirit just really quick and then I thought you know Lord you didn't have me read back at cross because you know sometimes as I'm study and I have all sorts of thing all this will go in this study and outline things I may not touch to you know sometime later in things and that just that'd be one of those studies one of those quotes that I have that goes along with doctors medicines and surgeries of which I have a very large file and I'll just put it right you know I have two oh no I went to look oh no it's already in there but God knows you know friends that is no less glorious of what took place there and that little baby going through that surgery then for God to move right here there's not one that's greater than the other it's all God it's how we look at it sometimes that determines remember what we looked at on Thursday how you look at things sometimes will determine how you walk yeah is that right well we could probably just close up and say good to be here but I can't do that because there's no way I can hold this this Christmas wrapping may not look like much but I can't hold dinner amen let's look into the word of the Lord this morning it's so good to be here amen good to see I have visitors that are here god bless you see you in Ephesians chapter 2 verse 1 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sin where in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we had our conversation in pilots our conduct in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of Wrath even as others that would have continued but verse 4 but God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of His grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in their delicious barns in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we want to say Lord thank you this morning thank you God once again Lord for your mercy in your grace this day Lord Father we thank you that Lord God that in the face Lord of where we stand in this moment Lord where the world Lord would be celebrating Lord as it were Lord a Christmas Lord but father to us Lord even though we recognize Lord that this was not the time of your birth but yet Lord we are so thankful Lord that you said to us Lord gave to us the greatest gift Lord God that could ever be given Lord God and Father for this Lord we are so grateful Lord for truly Lord the peace of God Lord it passes all understanding Lord and we love you and we praise you this morning we just pray that God that you come Lord the great author of the book and would you come by our way Lord this morning each and every heart that's gathered here Lord and speak to us Lord God in Lord a very personal way we pray Lord we give ourselves to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you being seated I want to read you a hero out of the quote where I started last week and go into and go into a little part here this morning where the RAM says it like this and the God who is rich in mercy he said you once in times past were dead in that amazing we thought we were alive and yet there was a part that we were alive we were alive to those things of the world but yet as far as in we're in serving the Lord in really who we are we were dead you were dead even many here tonight one time can look back and know that you were dead but now why aren't you did tonight as you were then you deserve to be that way because she was a sinner but God who is rich in mercy and we looked at that last week we we don't deserve anything of all the great and wonderful so-called things that we could do still we do not deserve his favor but God who is rich in mercy and that's the thing God who was rich all these things that were but God that made the change right their God who is rich in mercy now this is where I want to draw from and I'm so glad for that that he being rich in mercy if he was just rich in money if he was just rich in materials which he is but yet the great thing is being rich in mercy all what a great word that is how that we once we were once dead that's what I want to look at here this morning just to start into this on the great richness of his mercy because when you think of this here the the word I just began to look at the word a richness and we know that the word rich that we read it means to be great and abounding and plenteous and richness itself is the state of existing in or containing plentiful quantities of something that is desirable in the air in david and this scripture i just i love the scripture the scripture is generally a part of when i'm praying it just comes out but the Spirit of God last Sunday morn and really begin to quicken this scripture to me it was I was in prayer and early in the morning and here David is saying it like this he says when this is when David was in the wilderness of Judah Oh God thou art my god David's letting it be known that in the face of every other god that is out there that others call god you are my god David said I know you and you are mine early will I seek thee he's the priority of my life my soul first is for thee my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is isn't it true that when when and that connection in all things within our life is not right or when it would be hindered everything about our life is affected david is declaring this so notice where david david here he has faith to believe to see it this is where i am to see that power and thy glory so as i have seen thee in the sanctuary david is declaring that not only are you the god in the sanctuary but where where i am you are also caught David knew he's got there in the tabernacle but he's also God to me where I am in my need in my situation you believe that this morning that God is drawn to your need you believe that God when you have a need you have a request even what is not audible out of your lips but God the Bible says in Romans 8 that the spirit maketh intercession for our infirmities and maketh intercession with groanings that cannot be heard so to understand that how that God is drawn to even where our needs are weakness and that he might make himself known in verse 3 here here's where this is this I love this verse of scripture from there to us because thy loving-kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee so my loving-kindness is better than life thus will I bless thee while I live I will lift up my hands in thy name this word as I was drawn to it you know I was in prayer early last Sunday morning and as I was praying the Holy Spirit just began to press on my heart and and you know that word loving-kindness and I thought man just never really thought of it now no doubt I probably clicked on it searched it out before but you know God has a way of making things amplifying it at the right time and the right season so when we look at this so this this word loving-kindness it's the word so we would call it maybe we would look at it and say it just said but it's actually said which means goodness kindness and faithfulness now I want to try to by no means a scholar within theirs but a much of the research of things that when I was looking at this particular word and looking at the very mercy of God because that is indeed where this word pertains to and when you look at God's mercy we know that when we we think of it of how that the very mercy of God and many times the view that is set forth within God's mercy of which we all need we all want God's mercy don't we I don't want God's justice I could never stand before his justice but yet God's mercy is not a powerless to wear that it's something to wear it's just one who looks at me and says you know what you're sorry you're no count you'll never be any good you'll never be better that's not the mercy of God but God's mercy is there that holds for me and is able to provide holding for me and provide what is needed that I might come into the reflection of what he is calling for in his heart is that Alright so when we look at this I was I was looking at some of the things that in regards to how that even with the new Hebrew the letters and the things that are regarded with this particular word and we know that one of the things that in the writings of where they'll go with this is how that God himself in the midst of it all gave precedence to the rule of mercy but yet in giving precedence to the rule of mercy God joined it with justice and with think of this of how the Lord Jesus was standing there when he came before the Pharisees remember they were so adamant about paint as on mint and cumin and anise and they were they were so adamant about certain things but Jesus was able to look down and tell him wait a minute you are omitting the lady or matters of the law so he was able to look and see that though that they were I'm doing this I'm doing this I'm doing this but yet they were limited in their ability to actually understand first of all not just the law we know they couldn't understand it without it really dwelling on the inside of them but yet they were so limited within it by just doing this doing this doing this they did not understand it in terms of who it was that the law him came from it came from God himself now we notice within this when we I want you to think of this for a moment that when you know the end the English of where that the words that will be used here in in the scriptures many times the words that will be used to try to convey God's mercy are the words of loving-kindness and you'll see mercies and merciful and faithful and all of these things that are used but yet knowing that God has a desire for righteousness does he not God has a desire just like you are with our children you have a desire and intended outcome for their life and in order for that outcome to come to pass there is going to require mercy but yet mercy itself is not without instruction mercy itself is without is not without correction but mercy itself noticed God's desire that his word would be lived by was so great his passion for righteousness is so great but to think of it that how that God's passion for righteousness was so great yet God's intent and passion for mercy was so much greater and because that was so much greater by his mercy then he can bring to pass what he desires and that his righteousness to come forth from your eye so it shows within us what a great thing that we can continue to look at of how that God has so coupled this together because when you think of it that even in as the writers would say it like this if there is even a remnant that's to be preserved God has to have had show mercy more than anything else and to think of how that within it you know when we look in the scriptures here and AD speaks in Hebrews 15 verse 13 David or Moses said it like this thou in thy mercy hath led forth the people which thou hast redeemed thou hast guided them in thy strength and unto the holy habitation that promised that was laying there was a promise that had been laying there for for hundreds of years is that right then I'll visit them with a strong and mighty hand that promise in itself was the mercy of God and when God moves on the scene to fulfill that that is God stepping forward as it describes in the book of Luke chapter one that God is stepping forward to perform the mercy that he had promised to the father's this is God stepping forward in the very fulfillment of his word to fulfill his promise I tell you when the word is made flesh and the word is coming to pass that's God's mercy upon earth that's God's mercy because that murder see it's coming not because you and I deserve it but it's God that is common to fulfill his word and when God comes to fulfill that word he's come to perform it and there is a people that are intended to receive that word and by receiving that word then you and I become the vessels of God's mercy now in that mercy notice how he would describe that thou in thy mercy has led forth the people without which thou has redeemed so within mercy itself noticed this as we'll pick it up as we go along mercy itself is not just something that is given and where it's in a manner to where and you can do whatever you want but mercy itself is coupled with the desired intended outcome and it must be provided or leadership must be provided in mercy and it is OMA now notice this how that God would reveal himself to Moses in Exodus 34 and I'm so thankful to God when we look at this here of how this is such a parallel of what God will do and does do in each of our lives as we've looked at this I've made mention this passage of Scripture many times how God reveals himself to Moses here God did not have to reveal himself one more time to Moses for Moses to be convinced that that was the promise of the hour are you with me he didn't have to reveal himself one more time to Moses for Moses to say yep I'm the one yep I know I'm included in the promise he didn't have to do that he don't have to do that to you and I but he does it and he enjoys doing it what is that his mercy but he'll take down a word and he'll continue to show you his mercy his faithfulness he'll show you who you are again and again and again it is not for naught but as he is doing that in his bringing forth and closing faith and strength to build within your life to where you're actually able to stand there knowing who you are not by knowledge but by real faith because this is what he has said whole glory so God doesn't have to do this but God does this after Israel if we can say it like this has fallen short and you know I would say it like this when we look at it God even down through the ages the church ages of how God has dealt with the Gentiles calling out a people for his namesake of how that God would send a word and then the people would fall away from that word and then God then and then another age would come about it was all the very mercy of God sending his word to each generation for what for for those people who were ordained within that bed of time that they would be able to come forth that's the same thing in this hour as well except in this hour there is not another something to come about as far as another messenger we have received the last message this is time to go home so to see how God will visit Moses here in the midst of this and reveal himself to Moses now only want you to watch this here in verse five because he's going to proclaim the name of the Lord you see the name of the Lord is more than just just saying the Lord Jesus Christ well I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ there are attributes that are attached to that name it's more than jibun somebody saying I'm a Christian there are attributes that are attached to what is a Christian so notice in verse 5 here the Lord begins to reveal these attributes and the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the Lord and the Lord passed by before him and proclaimed the Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious long-suffering and abundant in goodness and truth keeping mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin and that by that will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the father's upon the children and upon the children's children under the third enter fourth-generation so God's mercy in itself is also given for that space of time we find that even where than in the Old Testament where the blood was put upon the mercy seat once a year is that right but then when that blood came off in that same seat that was a seat of mercy then it became a seat of judgment and there was a need for mercy or blood for an atonement to come forth once again in order to cover the judgment seat turning the judgment seat to that from judgment to mercy is that right so to walk in that period of time and to receive of the mercy of God to will come under that mercy and not be a part of the judgment that's the same way in this hour as well but notice these words of the words that are used in here the words in verse 6 the Lord God merciful and the word as whereas I'm saying these words are not all the same words but yet they describe a depth of the very mercy of Almighty God the very word merciful that's used here there is the word that is raccoon which is compassionate always of God with one possible exception now you would look at this and you would think well don't we just need that of his set we do need his set we do meet his goodness we do need his faithfulness but yet we also need his wrath whom his compassion which is one of a possible exception see this is part of the richness the plenteous all of these parts that are composed within the very mercy of Almighty God because God remember the scripture said keeping his sin or keeping mercy and he's kept mercy for thousands so the Covenant is waiting there the Covenant he's keeping the Covenant he's not moving from the Covenant but we need the compassion of God to move on the scene in order to fulfill what mercy is calling for and it's all the great mercy of Almighty God you and I need compassion this morning you and I'm grateful to God aren't you I'm grateful to God you know how it is you can be aiming for the barn and as your for the barn you've got it all sided up and all of a sudden here you you fire a shot well that's like the equivalency of Brett Scott you go out of the service man everything seemed lined up and here you fire the shot and you end up not hitting your barn you hit the neighbors barn you need one of compassion you need one of the possible exception one that's able to stand there and not just say my goodness I thought you had it I but you need one who's hands on one with mercy who can have compassion hands on that mercy taking form and that mercy beginning to minister what is actually being called for to where what the mercy is in the Covenant then becomes reflected in our lives so we need that mercy of Almighty God and remember you and I cannot provide this we do not provide the the compassion of God we do not provide the mercy of God the only thing that you and I can do is reciprocate it that means we receive it and then it is given right back to him in the same measure that he has given it to you and I Oh Lord how many of you want God to be compassionate how many of you want God to be one with exception then say lord I won't stop my fall to my my foot again if you don't answer my prayer according to my need or the way I want it you see it's reciprocated back to him there right there so notice within this so think of how that God within himself he made a covenant with Israel he made this covenant with his father's as a matter of fact he told Abraham all the land where you see this land have I given to the enter thy seed afterwards God made it this shall be an inheritance for your see now it's God it's totally in God's hands to be able to bring the people from where they are to where they need to be that's reconciliation reconciliation is not just coming out of Egypt but full reconciliation is coming in to the promised land so reconciliation is actually the coming back and restoring a former harmony that once so when we see this of how that he is indeed Jehovah Jireh one who provides for himself how God would make a covenant with Israel as a whole nation and yet as we're reading this about Israel God would keep and have that covenant of mercy that mercy itself would be the faithfulness the goodness that which is there to ensure that that covenant remains intact and yet God knows that out of all of it there was only going to be a few that was actually out of the hole that he brought out of Egypt a few that would actually cross into the land but yet God said if it's only tell my mercy I will keep it for them very many if it's only two I show compassion to a law that I am controlling my compassion in order to bring about that which is there glory be to God sometimes it seems like let me tell you friends our compassion the mercy that is extending it has shown sometimes it seems like what's the use it seems like sometimes things are spit right back in your face you say what's the years leave that in the hands of God you never know friends the very action and the way that things have been taken that that can serve to minister to an individual what's how that that David would describe this David describes this so many different times in Psalm 78 verse 37 he says for their heart was not right with him neither were they steadfast in his covenant but he being full of compassion forgave their iniquity how many of you want to be full of compassion right notice the very next word he being full of compassion it wasn't just something he's just got it all bundled up with whom he has a bunch of compassion it's just waiting there no no no no no no he's not just holding compassion but remember with his compassion because mercy like their Hebrew authors and different ones that I've studied what they read and you know Hebrew itself it is something that's not just words that's given by mine but it is active words it's actions it's things that depict pictures it's things that depict action and one of the things that the Hebrew authors and many of the rabbis that I've read and studied here that they would say is that the word itself has said that Wow but that is even set forth as the mercy of God it is not something that's just steadfast because that in itself would seem absent of love but it is not just steadfast it is the steadfast love of God there was nothing that Israel could do that could change God's love there is nothing that you and I can do that will change God's love even when you disappoint it even when you let him down but yet his love is steadfast he is faithful to his word glory be to God think of this think of this now being full of compassion he noticed the action forgave forgave but saying I'm full of compassion and you can't forgive you can't be full of compassion and not forgiving are you with me you see friends you got to make a choice whether you're gonna forgive or not forget forgiveness it's more than just you saying oh you know what I forgive you and I'll tell you what it's more than words it is an action that demonstrates itself toward you how many are glad that God demonstrates forgiveness toward us are you glad about that aren't you glad that when you go to pray the next time he don't say he's a little bit hesitant you see that's you and me that's not even today's message but that's you and me our memory but God's memory is the seat of forgetfulness but he being full of compassion forgave their iniquity and destroyed them not yay many a time turned he his anger away and did not stir up his wrath Wow full of compassion means self-control My Lord Jesus so being full of compassion by the senior that's the Old Testament Philippians chapter 2 verse 1 brethren I love that you would be what feel with what bowels of Mercy filled up with mercy not just having a little bit if we are his children and he is rich in mercy don't tell me that we're just barely making it don't tell me that we've got Scott about you know when it comes down to it when it comes down the mercy of God well God's got this much mercy but this is all I've got ha don't see that I don't see that if this is what's given to me then that ought to be what's reflected because I can only reflect what I am sure if God's faithful to his covenant to see it performed then when that mercy is received as divine compassion comes down upon my life then I will not be living a halfway life I will live according to the compassion that has come to minister his steadfast love to my life I will reflect back to him so I'm not reflecting another name I'm not reflecting another Jesus I'm reflecting the same Jesus are you with me my glory be to God for he remembered oh my Wow for he remembered that they were but flesh a wind that passeth away and cometh not again glory so he knows with his word now this is when we understand of where everything is that with Israel at this point that they have not make there's no way that they can receive what you and I now are made partakers of the the atonement the true Lamb of God has not come whereby that the blood being shed the sin debt put away and thereby his life can come upon us as the worshiper and raise us up into heavenly places by no means is this word or the scripture giving allowances for any behavior that is less or unbecoming to better the Christian well brother say no I just can't help it yes you can't help it what Allah saying I just don't yes you can you can say Lord Here I am weak but thou art strong Lord God Lord you can help me Lord and you know I'm the classical member you want him to remember who your flesh remember he's your God remember he's greater than every situation he's greater he is all that you have need of glory being a garden David picks it up again in Psalms 86 verse 15 but Thou O Lord art god full of compassion and gracious long-suffering and plenteous in mercy and truth oma so to think of this of how that God would even display this it's it's wrote of this even in Exodus 20 it's wrote of it you know even in a Deuteronomy here where it would speak of how that God the the requirements that God would lay down in his law in verse 9 and how that God is a jealous God and then in verse 10 it would speak of how that he shows mercy unto thousands of them love me and keep my Commandments so we understand that when we're looking at this you know a lot of times where it seems like in this age this is an age that doesn't want any responsibility is that right this is an age that you know if I'm robbing the store it's the policeman's fault for being there and catching me when I was robbing it you understand it did so in other words it's who can I find to blame for me in my condition I'll tell your friends that's a very damnable situation to be in yes it is because there must be that which we will take account for our own actions and for where that we are at and taking full responsibility for it now when we look at this of how this is set forth God never did away with the law it was not the doing away and saying no the law wasn't any good that's not true as Paul would say that the law is holy the law is spiritual the law is good but the problem of it was was not below itself the problem was is the grace of God and not calm to actually be able to bring what God had allowed to be inscribed there in stone to actually come and bring that to an inscription in the heart and the life of a believer to wear that it's not us trying to walk according to external things of do we do this should we not do that do we do this should we not do that but it actually comes by a relationship to where that God Himself comes down and actually in scripts his very life his nature his character in our life that is God's showing mercy and we love him for that mercy even that God would come down and rebuke us and correct us that's the mercy of God that God would come down and then after repentance has come but God would come and minister to us just what we have nita so he's not just one that's holding around just steadfast love but with compassion God calmed him since to actually bring his mercy that is in the Covenant to a reality within our lives aren't you glad about that showing mercy so this is not a dog that you and I could look at and say well I don't know if he's merciful or not where you can look at your husband your wife is I don't know if merciful a matter of fact I don't I don't know I mean there it's kind of tell it like it is well Sam I don't think this is a family service oh this is plumb full of family plumb full family this is a this is the family book we are his family every service is a family service I tell you right now the more Lord that I look at this the more that I've studied it of how that even when you look at it has said these very things are the very priority and foundation of a marriage covenant yes they are it is that which we look our our words which we try to use that would be the best of what we can do in the English for better for worse in sickness and in health all of those words our words look at the amount of words that we have laid out within the vows themselves and yet there's one word in the Hebrew that will encompass at all he said one word that will encompass at all because there is a steadfastness of love that's needed but not just needed there must be compassionate to minister that so another part of that mercy to be able to minister how say lord help me help me I'm not ashamed to ask for help lord help me I want to be more like him I want to be more like him the more and more the regardless of how many times that I've looked at something studied over it maybe preached from this or that but you know what when God comes by and speaks to our hearts I'm not just preaching to you but I am myself reading I am being transformed and I'm being changed by this word think of it sometimes weeks months beforehand I ever stand here to bring it but yet in the midst of it then when he brings it it's still challenging my life has this presence comes down and begins to break things open you know what that is God could give us his word that's out giving you my word but his wrath on his compassion will move down upon our life to do what instruct us in His mercy is that right Oh glory be to God notice this in numbers 14 17 I know this is this is in regarding how God's journey but you and I are in our own journey as well notice this in verse 17 I'll find this to be very fitting now how that they have remembered now at this point in time here once again they went over into the land they've spied out the land and there's been an evil report that's been brought up there was you know in the camp all of the oh ma everybody was wailing and crying and and everything was going on but yet now it comes time in order for them to move forward just as God revealed himself to Moses back there in Exodus 34 God Himself will must manifest himself to the Israel once again if God does not do that Israel will stay right where they are yet staying right where they are God is a God of mercy steadfast love but it's going to take more than the manifestation of that steadfast love where in that God will display his compassion that will actually move to atone for the circumstance they're in to be able to move him from here to where he's calling for so it's going to require action on his part well what's the require on our part receiving receiving and now I beseech thee here's Moses one who is standing failing this promise Christ is veiled in the promise the word that he's given to Moses in this hour the hope blood should be the name of the Lord notice and now here's Moses speaking to God and now I beseech thee let the power of my Lord be great according as Dallas spoken saying look at him he's bringing his word back up to him as thou has saying the Lord is long-suffering and of great mercy she said forgiving iniquity and transgression and by no means clearing the guilty visiting the iniquity of the father's upon the children under the third and fourth generation pardon I beseech thee the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy and as thou has forgiven de speak from Egypt even until now so here is the very spirit of Christ standing in Moses when God could have wiped every one of them out God was ready to wipe him out but what turned away his anger what turned away his wrath it wasn't the words of a man it was his words that had taken preeminence in the words of a vessel a man and that man could speak with divine authority and move right back in the presence of God and God would recognize his word that he's given for that generation God recognizes the word that he has given for this generation with you and I come before his presence when you and I come there Christ being veiled in our life he recognizes his promise that has been given for this generation according to the greatness of I said as thou has forgiven this people from Egypt even until now what's this and the Lord said I have pardoned only he could I have pardon according to thy word so the messengers word is God's word because the messenger is holding God's message is that right and so God's desire is that that message would be spoken back to him that rehearse not just read not just you know something where it's just rehearsed and said and said now though God wants it set back by a life that's live God wants that set back and declared from our lives Moses couldn't pardon them that God could but you take Moses out and let's let's just cut and Moses out of here right now all right let's just cut him out what court and date the one to do dead the people are dead they go nowhere but there's one standing with a word of promise and the word of promise was not starting an organization the word of promise was not starting another another denomination under the church and that was not the word the word was a promise that was given that I will visit my people and bring them out with a strong hand and will put them in the land of promise remember God himself and look look look the mercy of God is so cold and it shows the greatness of it where it was pulled so many times to wrath and anger where God would say step out of the way I'll destroy them all but the promise Christ standing there the very raccoon the very compassion of God standing right there reminds him your mercy your mercy let me tell you something Sarah we would have been destroyed a long time ago if we were not part of Abraham if we were not United with him in the Covenant but even though God were united in the Covenant it doesn't mean that God just says I'll pretend I didn't see that lion I'll pretend I didn't know no God calls it out that's the mercy of the Covenant why she had to be able to come to a place to receive the faith as it has been delivered and in order to receive that flame faith she cannot have anything clouded in her life whole glory be to God that is the mercy of God that God would deal with every little bit eleventh in our life that is the very mercy of God that God would say I don't want anything that's going to cloud up the promise of bringing forth the promised son glory be to God I don't think I'm the only one having a good time but if I am I am lord have mercy and the Lord said I have pardoned according to that word wow you need to have a promise word you need to have a representation that's able to take that word that is revealed and given and then God recognizes his own words and I pardoned according to that word you note that means stay in the line of duty if we're walking in the path of duty we're walking in what God has said you say brother saying I might stumble on my fault that's sure you have stumbled you have fallen but get back up in the path of duty as long as you're walking in the path of duty then God does not a lot your mistakes to you you know that's a direct quote as I was with Moses now watch this here's the steadfast mercy of God but as truly as I live all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord when God spoke this right here he already saw me in you before he ever spoken but God right here spoke this again all the earth shall be filled not just this day not just this time in this is a necessary part unnecessary increment within it but even after the Gentiles up here that's drawn this time of dispensation dealing with the Gentile Telangana people for his namesake and he moves then taking the bride away in rapture and begins to deal with 144,000 that is God working to fulfill this promise that he has given in his word [Music] this word right here is even where God sees himself seated bare whom the throne of the son of David there in the Millennium dis promise encompasses even the future Hall where that home itself sets down upon this earth that's been cleansed all glory they covered God knew when he made this statement all the wonderings all the backslidings all the failures he knew he knew of even the mess that you and I would be in but still that did not keep from prophesy according to his steadfast love surely all the earth as truly as I live and he ever liveth all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord I say that we are part of the testimony of God's faithfulness right here in this word I'm looking up and said right now this morning I'm looking up at his said that has been ministered by the raccoon of the compassion of Almighty God what shall Nehemiah picks these very things up right here in Nehemiah chapter 9 I'm trying to come down here notice this how Nehemiah picks us up again I think it's been fitting that we look at these these these words here but they notice in verse 16 they and our fathers dealt proudly and harden their necks and hearken not to thy Commandments you know one thing that I find that is very very very important that God would have Israel before they go in the land he takes a whole book of Deuteronomy Deuteronomy is not just an instruction book about don't do this don't do that but God reminds him in there where you've come from and he reminds him who brought you out he reminds him the condition they were found in and he also lets them know this is the character the character life that I desire to see and will bring forth in your life same thing now notice here each and every time its to visit when God is sending this word here is Nehemiah standing remember Ezra has already been there and here is Nehemiah standing at this time in his visitation to me it's absolutely phenomenal how and Ezra 9 he deals with the repentance of God in Nehemiah chapter 9 he also comes with repentance as well and even though neither one of these guys if you could say you could put a finger and say you're part of the problem man you're front no they just happens to be that they were under it but yet they recognize the Lord no matter if it's daddy did it mama did it right here I need forgiveness because I can't lay it on them I stand in me God can deal with hearts like that you know God ain't a shovel kind of God either well let me go on here it's important to look back and recognize where God has brought you from and here this would be remembered think of the message that God has sent to us in this hour think of how that the Prophet would drop here and there at different times and be mindful of to remember where God himself has brought you and I even when he would speak of their early Pentecostal movement of those things that were going on he would speak of how that they had drifted from those things this is exactly where Nehemiah is picking up of the very mercy of God that had been extended to Israel in verse in verse 17 he said and they refused to obey neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them but hardened their necks and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return in their bondage but thou art a God ready to party gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and forsook us them not those two words are encompassed right there has said and as well as that of rock whom the compassion of God now notice yeah when they had made a molten calf and said this my God has brought thee out up out of Egypt and had wrought great provocations remember this is where God said step aside I'll kill every one of them and I'll raise a new nation up with you but the Spirit of Christ and Moses stood like the cross how could it how could he turn God from it because he had God's Word what terms the very wrath of God because God's Word is on earth one day the blood will be lifted one day his day of mercy wouldn't be finished and there will be no more mercy it will be judgment how about dogs a merciful God that's why he sends his word that's my calls to you and I because he does not remember he's not willing it's not his desire that any should perish but that all should come to repentance had you seen the steadfast love of Almighty God wherein that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish he paid for the entire world because forget that elect that remnant and yet his mercy will also grant salvation to others who will call on him aren't you glad it's held for you I'm glad not sure am notice yeah hey now I want to get to this word here I'm gonna get to this one will just try to close somewhere yeah thou in thy manifold mercies this is a different word we're going to look at here yet thou in thy manifold notice manifold mercies forsook us them not in the wilderness well these were tough times don't you say God could have maybe just filed for divorce right there bridge brother Samuel I am I'm preaching justice he's giving it to me these were tough times because what God was seeing was not at all what he brought out over the senior didn't he know it when he brought him out but if God would have been focused on that when he brought him out he never would have brought him out are you with me but God had a desire he had a fulfillment to his word his promise God desires to see his word come to pass in our lives and let me tell you something God is so determined to bring that word to pass that he supplies plentiful mercy in order to bring it to pass in our life [Applause] glory be to God hallelujah for suckers they're not in the wilderness there's many times he could have walked away and said I'm tired I'm no longer dealing with you Samuel I've told you 500 times I've told you a hundred times maybe for some of y'all thousand it depends on what it is they're right once he got to preach so many parts I don't know about you but I'm kind of liking this yeah I'm kind of liking it oh it's ten in my heart too but I'm liking it when times got hard almighty could have just forsook it but he's faithful to his word let me tell you something God knew what he was getting into when he got in you he knew what he was getting into he knew and you know what it wasn't that that he was looking at he was looking at the effect of his word met by his compassion his compassion will bring forth what his mercy is calling for glory be to God so God says not just saying hey I got mercy I got mercy God said I'm gonna show gonna have about two more hours I got going here this morning I said let me work with this scripture here yet down in that manifold mercies for sickest am not in the wilderness the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day to lead them in the way neither the pillar fire by light to show them light and the way wherein they should go now gave us also by good spirit to instruct them and was held if not my manna from the mountain gave them water for their search a faithful father kept path but yet he said I'm still gonna feed you I'm still gonna water you you're my children I'm gonna care for you and it's not just God just giving in but his mercy comes with leadership and the pillar of fire sent forth to instruct his children in the midst of that time the great angel of the Lord the angel of the Covenant present to instruct really I thought you said Moses was the one carrying the message he was but he was getting his message from headquarters and headquarters was not down in Egypt headquarters was the logos does God change his mind the Prophet tells us Moses while the rest of was getting their information from other things Moses was getting his information from the logos of God the pillar fire let me tell you something friends that's the headquarters of the bride of Jesus Christ in this hour it's not some physical location somewhere that we would somehow pay homage to I respect things that God has done within the life of the Prophet in those various things but that is not my headquarters my headquarters is in heaven my headquarters is the divine by divine presence of Almighty God that pillar of fire so I don't have to call nobody and ask him one message shuttle listen to this week I got direct contact oh yes sir I got direct contact with Almighty God I'm not saying that in Pride I'm saying that because that's exactly where God has brought you in I - God has not brought us down to another denominational appointment this message never came to appoint us to man this message came to bring a relationship between God and His people Amen with a pillar fire this pressure upon the children of the Living God no matter what's he doing he's here to instruct us he's here to minister to you and I'm with you and I've polished or will we need strength where you need the Holy Ghost when you need deliverance he's here to minister healing to you and a high that is the faithfulness of Almighty God if he has mercy I won't obtain it don't you well I'm gonna need help I can't obtain it on my own strength I need leadership I don't know if I'm get this word or not therefore thou delivers them into the hand of their enemies who vex them and in the time of their trouble when they cried unto thee thou hurt us them from heaven send me I don't sound like mercy okay let's just look at it like this let's say that your child is constantly misbehaving let's say they're constantly disrespectful to adults let's say that it's constantly things that's going on at school and other places like that now you can look at that and say I'm going to be one of compassion that's wonderful compassion itself steps forward with understanding but if that compassion itself if it moves to a place to say well they're just a child well they're just a kid but yet knowing that the things that you see now if that's let go now where they'll be later on know they so they want now they throw themselves in the floor in a temper and tantrum god help the person that they would try to marry because they'll do other means to try to get their way why the character that's molded or allowed to be will actually reflect itself in a latter time so in order the mercy real mercy is not I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that oh I love you so much even though you're rotten you're a devil you're this and that I love that's not the mercy of God that is called pure ignorance but the mercy of God steps forward to instruct us God never let Israel buy with that sin but his mercy that steadfastness of his covenant he corrected what was wrong he ministered the compassion that was needed sometimes my dad ministered compassion with his arm around me another times he ministered compassion with his hand on the belt strap other times he ministered and when I sat in the corner I hated taking naps I loved the things now if I can get him that was worse brother Joe he'd whooped me and didn't make me go lay down in the bed he did naked naps I was gonna miss something in today I like daylight you know what I'm saying then that was worse than the belt but I thank God I needed every one am I needed a whole lot more weapons than what I got I probably needed one to start today with come on downstairs boy for you breakfast let's warm you up good he not second right down with as well y'all remember that when you get home today go ahead [Laughter] bet it comes the correction we need correction normally the Bible says it right here that invent a child that's left to itself bring up its mother shame God said what I will not leave you comfortless as orphans but he comes to God and direct us and lead us and guide us it's God's mercy that would come down and correct you and I but remember God's mercy to correct you and I isn't that God walks out of services path what then I got him crying today oh I got him crying whew I'm today that ain't God's desire listen you're done he want a broken heart and a contrite spirit yes but look what a broken what a brokenness and contrite means it means to the foolishness that has had you bound in for who you really are that the grace of God has come and liberated you and now you are ready to be instructed so you don't come into that same condition so brother brokenness and contract nurses and that you walk out of here where your lip you have to say let me pick my lip up so I can walk out here in the parking lot but it's to do what it brings you and I to a place to where that God can then instruct you and I whoa my honey was going into this word or not according to thy manifold mercies thou has given them saviors who saved them out of the hand of their enemies I've given them manifold mercies and what did the manifold mercy supply saviors not capital S lowercase vessels that were set apart by God to receive from God a direct ministering of the Covenant of his mercy and then through that ministering of that covenant of Mercy that Savior that messenger would actually take that message forth and it was God's compassion reaching to the hearts of the people let's just stop I don't want you to lose this thought but this word that we would look at here in Mercy's it's another word that speaks of the very mercy of God which is that of a wound and compassion to think of how that God Himself likens his care for us in the world that he watches over us to supply with great care he watches over our lives aren't you glad all of these things all the richness all of this we need we need his care and watching over our lives is that right to think of this how that in Psalms 145 verse 8 the Lord is gracious and full of compassion slow to anger and of great mercy the Lord is good to all and his tender mercies this is that word our overall work so right there in those two verses here the very richness of God's mercy steadfast love his compassion and also that of one who was there holding you and I like that in the womb in protection I told you I saw close over and over when you find David in the scriptures David would speak of the tender mercies of God and when you see that phrase tender mercies that's the very word that David speaking out how God is keeping him close God's watching over him God will call us to come forth what is there within David's life it's God it's his mercy no wonder the Prophet could say the greatness is him being rich I say he is rich in mercy I say Lord that mean be a full reflection of their mercy I'd only want my solo fool you know plumb full of it I believe I'm sealed with his spirit but I want every ounce of my being to be so under the influence of God's mercy I want my thinking or my attitude I want my objectives I want it all to be encompassed with his mercy because remember his mercy is that which he's looking for the fulfillment of his word I want to see that word becoming material in me and in order for that it will take the compassion of God it will take me within my life and even as you're sitting right here you you might be sitting you're listening so intent but yet within you it's drawing on God it's just like that woman with the issue of blood she said if I can but touch the hem of His garment I shall be made whole what was she needed she was needing the God of compassion to minister his covenant of mercy and God came forth and ministered to her so his mercy you don't leave things the way it found it when it steps forward we can never be the same but I say lord help me in my home right here with the church right here between each and between husband and wife Lord God let me be full of compassion now you might say bro send me I can't forget I understand that we're serving a God who has given us the grace and we'll give the grace to be able to pull out the stinger that wall that prevents that's the kind of God we serve that's the kind of God we serve let's just anyone want to be remembered in prayer or Jesus I know Lord in a service like this sometimes Mona I get real nervous and I get to look at Nordic words keeping up with some of these things more but I believe God that there's a fault that's pretty simple and I hope Lord God I trust that's been communicated this morning I know that Lord just my words Lord God it would fail but father Lord the fall behind Lord that you gave and directed and more this morning or Jesus I pray that Lord you'll put it together in all of our lives and what we're asking right now that you would help us that you would put us in that place in what you have for our lives Lord your God our hands are up Lord you know the needs that are behind those sayings Lord father I pray that God that you administer Lord to each one according Lord to the Covenant of your mercy your God by your divine nature Lord your great compassion that you would move down Lord and father you would move Lord God on that heart Lord and just speaking personally Lord to them Lord to let them know it is I Lord Jesus we need you Lord father this is our desire that in our lives we want Lord to be real reflections of your mercy Lord help us Lord if this is just if this stays just as doctrine if it stays just as something Lord God where is your mercy Lord being displayed to us and it stops right there we miss it but Lord God let it be known Lord God that even right here this morning that is your mercy has been displayed and ministered right here to where the Lord if there is one that doesn't know you Lord maybe God has never repented of their sins your mercy holds for them and calls out to them Lord God that father that as they would relinquish Lord and say I no longer want to walk this way that I'm walking Lord then father they themselves are receiving Lord a direct ministry of that covenant of mercy Lord that father would speak to their hearts taught to turn their heart to you Lord and then Lord God even as they would walk out Lord even from this place Lord God there would begin to reflect Lord God a change that has taken place maybe not a something Lord that would be so fully or drastically recognized at that moment Lord but father as they would walk with you Lord and submitting to your word Lord God they would come into a place Lord of complete reflection of
