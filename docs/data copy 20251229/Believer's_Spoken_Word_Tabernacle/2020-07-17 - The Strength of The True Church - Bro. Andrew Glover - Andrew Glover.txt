Lord is truly among us tonight Eve and then I've just been pondering for some time the Colt there and the Easter seal brother Brent says that the Spirit is what gives us access he says it's what gives us wings and I think tonight as Eagles we ought to spread our wings a little bit higher a mana but B of all men most miserable tonight to know of all the things that surrounded us all the political disturbances religious disturbances national disturbances all kinds of disturbance we'd be miserable too not to know we've got to go through those things but we've heard of prophets they spread your wings you can fly above a banner we may be in the world but we're not of the world amen we may be surrounded by these things but by the grace of God we're flying tonight are you find in the heights Amen god bless if we could despite our hearts together for a word of Prayer this evening we'll just ask the Lord to come and speak to our hearts Heavenly Father Lord as your believe in children have gathered themselves together here this evening Lord has believers we know that your word said were two or three with gathering your name Lord you said you would come and be in the midst of us and Lord we believe here tonight there is what more than two or three here represented Lord there's more than largest men and women here tonight father but Lord our believers here tonight they're her sons and daughters of yours gathered in this building tonight Lord where the devil is no doubt tried to afflict and try to oppress throughout the day but Lord there is something only inside of our hearts that no matter our Lord how much oppression would come no matter how much opposition would come we realize we're anointed for this time and we realize that there's no taskmaster there's no spirit of Laodicea they will defeat this bride and Lord as we come here tonight father we do not come to be seen her to be heard but Lord we come to worship you in spirit and in truth and Lord we know that your word said that where the Spirit is there is Liberty tonight so father we call for Liberty to come Lord for those would be bound may Liberty come to their hearts but for those who would be sick Lord may healing bring Liberty to their bodies Lord but for those who would be discouraged Lord may Liberty come and bring them encouragement father that you would set him free from that discouragement Lord may you pour your spray upon us tonight Lord and whatever is accomplished we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for Lord we bind our hearts together tonight and faith believing that you're the same yesterday today and forever and there is nothing that can withstand the kingdom of God we ask these things in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the believers said amen god bless you this evening are you happy to be a Christian are you happy to be saved hey man just give him a hand clap of praise Amen he deserves our praise man he is worthy to be praised if you have your Bible as this evening we'll invite you to the Scriptures the book of Nehemiah the eighth chapter the book of Nehemiah the eighth chapter and while you're turning there we I want to greet you this evening in the name of the Lord we certainly counted an honor and the privilege to be here with you tonight and service and to be able to see everyone out in the house of God we say God bless you and sure appreciate for the same he'll appreciate his friendship and invitation to combine I speak to you this evening and I tell you as time goes on we're learning to value the house of God a whole lot man I think maybe just a few short months ago vacations and everything was always well Church will be there when we get back but we saw a quick drastic change in that I think I think every service that we have is another opportunity a man and I think we ought to take advantage of it a man the book of Nehemiah the eighth chapter we want to look here in the first verse the Bible here says and all the people gathered themselves together is one man into the street that was before the water gate and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the Lord had commanded Israel and what I like about this is it wasn't them begging Ezra to bring the or Ezra begging them to bring the book but it was them begging Ezra to bring the book and Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men women all that could hear with that could hear with understanding up on the first day of the seventh month and he read their end before the street that was before the water gate from the morning until midday before the men and the women and those that could understand and the years of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law and Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood which they had made for the purpose and beside him stood now I'm not going to attempt those names but if you come to the fifth verse the Bible says and Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for the was above all the people and when he opened that all the people stood up so the opening of the book produced a reaction and Ezra bless the Lord the Great God and all the people answered a man a man was lifting up their hands and they bowed their heads and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground if you skip down here to the bottom of verse seven all the Levites caused the people to understand the law and the people stood in their places now they read in the book the law of God that distinctly and gave the sense and caused them to understand the reading we asked Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you may have your seats for just a few moments we think the Lord for the reading of the word of God amen it's the Word of God that is true the Word of God is inspired it's infallible amen and I believe that's where we draw our strength from in this hour we're living in a man from those scriptures tonight for just a few moments I'd like to speak to you here and if I will tell this tonight I'd like to speak to you on the strength of the true church the strength of the true church and I believe with all of my heart that we are the true Church of the Living God I believe that we're the chosen elected for ordained for knowledge of God in this hour that we're living in and I believe that we can all agree tonight and it's not going to be nothing deep or nothing maybe to give you a deeper revelation but just something not to strengthen you and encourage you I believe that we need more strength from God a man I believe if there's anything we would desire tonight is more strength from God brother Branham is actually going to pray in two prayers here I just like to read him - you want us from the 3rd Exodus he says Heavenly Father we are grateful for this another time to be assembled together this side of eternity and we are looking this morning for renewal of strength to come from thee to give us courage for the journey that lays ahead we've gathered as the Hebrew children did only early mornings to get manna that had been provided for them over the night to sustain them through the coming days we gather for the spiritual manna this morning to give a strength for the journey so programs identifying amen that we are going somewhere we're not staying where we're at we're not going back to where we come from but we're going somewhere then where where are we going we're going forward we're going into the rats rayman another place why christ speaker says we think me now and the only way that we would know to correctly fellowship with thee is around my word and thy word is the truth so we gather here a meant for spiritual strength we need it Lord he said we must have strength to endure the crosses that we bear we pray that you'll send the great holy spirit today and will strengthen us all how many could just say Lord strengthen me tonight MN amen it's not just that your brother's carrying a cross or that your sisters in a crawl so that the pastor's carrying across amen but every one of us tonight have been called and we have been summons they meant to bear a cross in this hour amen and I believe that it is an important thing in this hour amen to to stress the Word of God to stress amen while we're here to stress why we're believing amen I don't think it's something that should be taken lightly I don't think it's something that we should take casually Amen but we are here according to the purpose of God's Word we are here for a purpose we're not just here they've been taking up space we're not just here hearing sermons and just here singing songs amen but we are here with a purpose and God Heyman is determined that that purpose will be fulfilled in his church can you say ma'am we noticed there in the book of Nehemiah the eighth chapter how that this is the return of the Exiles amen of Nehemiah stay now that's amazing when you read that and study that they were actually returning and they were facing amen the rebuilding of their society and their nation now everything has been torn down it has been changed it is drastically different than it was the last time they saw it and as they return they're seeing that there something's got to be done something's got to be built amen amen but they've got to remember that they were not rebuilding through human ambition amen but they were rebuilding through God's words so so it's amazing how that they come back and they see all this work ahead of them and the Bible doesn't say they come back crying they don't come back weep and they don't come back sad but when they see the work in front of him but Bible said they begin to rejoice and they begin to worship God amen because they were not laying the foundation stone amen but they were laying the headstone oh thank god tonight church amen that those young people Haman could return and look amen and see everything has been torn down and it's got to be built again amen and if fate tonight Church that we have not come amen and all this work is laying in front of us and it's a heavy burden but it is actually a rejoice and amen because we are not working at the foundation Amen but we've come to the top of this thing amen we have come to the final hours we have come to the final moments I don't know where you're at tonight but can I just tell you you can be one step away from a body change amen amen you could be tonight up on the threshold hey men of that city that tongues all coming down from God out of heaven this is not the hour to hang your head this is not the hour to put your hearts on the willows this is not the hour to quit worship and this is not the hour to quit rejoicing if there ever ought to be a time that we ought to be praising God it's right now it's hurts amen because the headstone is calm amen the headstone has come to the church and then they were not sad you would think humans would see all this work in front of them and begin to get sad but they were not sad amen they were happy Amen I think it's amazing how the Ezra Amen would come back number themselves as Sosa's here Amen that Ezra was a man who was consumed with the word if you look at the meaning of Ezra's name it actually means hell now he was the priest he was described Amen who led the reforms of the return ex house in Jerusalem he was a co-worker a men with Nehemiah and a priest with cerebral hey men Zerubbabel sounds familiar Don it Ezra 7:10 says for Ezra had prepared his heart's amen to seek the law of the Lord and to do and to teach Israel in statutes and judgments now amen I'm the Scalia foundation here but it's amazing how Amen the Bible says that answer Arendt the word Amen from the morning until the noon time Amen now if you go study that you'll find that from the morning to the noon time with six hours Amen it's not a coincidence Amen that Ezra is going to read the word for six hours Amen now let's bring it to another point Amen when Jesus resurrected and he walked with those two on the road to Emmaus maghreb said what did he do he preached that six hours Hermon Amen beginning at Genesis all the way to where he was all right now let's not leave it there but let's bring it to 1962 it's not a coincidence that the spoken word is the original seed is another six-hour sermon Amen begin Genesis to Revelation they've been showing you that the word has not come to defeat the church the word has not come to bind the church the word has not come to confuse the church but the word is calm Amen to set the church at rapture condition thank God tonight church that we had got strength to make a rapture Ezra was consumed with the word so so so his answer was consumed the word so what the church become a men consumed with the word Ezra amen was teaching them now Ezra new amen where the street was it was in the word so in Ezra brought the word laid it up on the pulpit read it before the people Amen there must be a response to the word Nehemiah chapter and the sixth verse says Ezra blessed the Lord the Great God and all the people answered a man a man with lifting up their hands and they bow their heads and worship the Lord with her faces to the ground see the people were not a men in Hazra Amen but they were a many or acknowledging the great God that Ezra was reading about Amen see what they were doing they were not acknowledging that his room was in their mess and then they were not acknowledging that Nehemiah was in there miss they was acknowledging that the great God Amen that part about Amen is that God is going to take him through and I think tonight Church it's a good night to get familiar with the word again called a man it's a good night amen to just remind the devil I'm not just here taking up space I believe what I'm hearing I agree with what I'm hear the word that I'm hearing is release enough power hold me inside of my heart I can't preach for preaching amen it's something about it friends when you hear the word no matter how tired you are no matter what you're going through no matter what your faith said no matter what spirits is attacking the church no matter what's going on in the world when you hear the word it releases man in your heart you know why this hats because it's drawing you beyond reappeared and taking you where God is horn ain't you to go we are not discouraged tonight there's a lot of work ahead of us but we're not tired come on church what by then do we ought to be tired because here we are all these years later and God hasn't returned and we ought to just get tired and then we've been serving Lord for 30 40 50 years we ought to be tired not a real son or daughter of God they are more stronger tonight than they were when they first believed they are more excited about the message tonight than they were when they heard their purse paid you know why because it's a headstone ain't been coming up on the church amen when they heard his to read the word answered it had to beg him to say man yes what it has to beg him to clap their hands as we didn't have to beg him to smile amen it was nature to him amen they were happy about it amen and I'll say tonight that the devil is pull equipment over on the church and he's got us away from Santa a man ain't meant to we just sit there and nod and we give a thumbs up every now and again amen but there is a power in nowhere day man hey amen there is something happens it could be a cold service and nobody's saying nothing but somebody break through and see a man and watch the fire God come down upon the church and consumer young man and consumer younger what is it friends it's the word returning to the church we are not in Paris to the word a man well then I'd say Amen but the devil told me he was going to get after me let me give you a good little word of advice okay he's going to get after you whether you say Amen or not he's going to get after your family whether you agree with her during Hajj amen so I learned a long time ago let's steal him a run for his money go ahead and say amen amen can I preach to you tonight if we're gonna get ready we might as well come and enjoy ourselves and then why we got to sit here something amen that we can't identify ourselves with amen this message is not a message of a million miles away it is present its message that what you are hearing you don't have to wait for the next meeting to have it you don't have to wait till the next Sunday but when you hear the word you can say Amen and identify yourself with it if you need healing all you gotta do is say amen amen if you need deliverance when you hear the preacher say time it's still a deliver all you gotta do is say hey man if you need the Holy Ghost when you hear the preacher say car it's still giving the whole it goes only thing you gotta do is say man amen identify yourself with the word what does the word Amen mean it means barely it means truly it means so--but it means let it be so so it is so shall it be amen so it is ain't it so shall it be oh when I hear the word I say it was I say it is and I say it shall be oh brother and ER that word ain't man it's just the word that a bunch of holy rollers around the message carried over from Pentecost know that word a man is a title of Jesus Christ revelation 3:14 says he is the a man he is the a man he is the Soviet he is not going no further o friends do you see why the devil hates it when you say man because your Amen draws a line in the sand Amen you're a man ain't men draw some mark and since devil it's over tonight when the devil says you can't have joy and the preacher says there's joy unspeakable and full of glory and you say Amen that draws a line and says Satan I'm leaving here with my joy you're not stopping me any further the part of God says in the impersonation of Christianity paragraph 189 he says material is not tested by its quantity but how big it is how bigger the church I mean here see it's not tested by its quantity but by its quality can he say man I love this metal is tested by its strength amen and the church it's not tested on how big a church or how many members it's tested by its strength by the Bible how can it say Amen to every promise that God has given come on church the test Amen of the strength of the true church is to be able to say a man amen to every word seat but today we have changed the signs of a thriving church amen to how many members of God's or how fancy require you got or how educated of a preacher you've got Amen but that's not what the Prophet said he sent the sign of the truck of a strong church a mint is when they can say a man Amen to every promise of God's word brother sister you know why the devil hates some of you tonight is because he's puts you through hell and back amen but you still come to church and when you hear the word you say a man when you hear the spirit speak this hey man when you feel the Holy Ghost you release yourself to don't you see what it is it's a sign of a strong church and then there could be five people here tonight amen and there would be enough to take every devil out of here amen there could be two people here tonight and if those two people agree upon the word there's enough Street they meant to defeat ever sickness amen defeat every disease it's not how many members you've got amen it's not how many degrees or how how educated the church is it's the ability to be able to agree with the word 2nd Corinthians 1:20 says Amen for all the promises of God are in him and they are a a and in him a man unto the glory of God by us Amen then you want to know what a pedigree Christian is the Prophet says I like a genuine pedigree Christian he knows where he come from Amen from the original baptism of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost glory to God he is pedigreed and sealed by the kingdom of God say is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and that old mule a mental holler well in some ways he is but a pedigree will say hey man amen it ain't a preacher calling you a mule it's your response to the word identifying whether you're a mule or a pedigree Christian amen a genuine experience of God will punctuate every promise with an amen faith always admits the word is right amen if your faith punctuate every word of God's word with an amen there is something wrong with your experience the Bible said he is the same yesterday amen today in forever and if it don't say amen to that then there is something wrong jesus said the works that I do shall you do also if it don't say amen to that then there is something wrong if it don't punctuate every word of God's promise with an amen then there is something wrong amen but how many can say tonight what we want is an amen church amen what we want is an Amen preacher what we want is an Amen congregation what do you want to be young people another young generation of argued with this message we're simply saying a man why we find today that there are two churches in the last day can you say man and then there is a true church and there is a false church you find Amen that Genesis is the seat chapter Amen so everything that you see in the world today it actually began in spirit form in Genesis see it was birthed from those two trees amen now the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil was symbolic remem sense of persons he meant now the tree of life aim it was symbolic of Jesus Christ and the tree of knowledge of good and evil was symbolic of Lucifer aim it but you find that the true church is elected not to be deceived by the false church Matthew 24:24 for there shall arise false Christ's and false prophets and shall sow great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect the church takes button out of this first key that we have received of the Lord there comes another and slightly less wonderful truth I said that the true church would always try to be like it was in the book of Acts that's exactly right but we have discovered that the word also teaches an invasion of error until there is a complete blackout of truth in the last day when the Lord is about to appear the question now arises in our mind does God forsake his hold and let them fall into a state of complete deception on or no accountant on no accounts for the scripture says very clearly in Mathew 24:24 the elect somebody shout elect cannot be deceived what then the answer is clear before us there is a true church and a false church there is a true vine and a false man but of course that false church false-9 body will always try to assert amen the position of the true church and contend that she and not the elect are the real and authentic but false will try to kill the truth that is how it was in the book of Acts that is how it is set forth in the seven ages that is how it is declared in the various epistles that is how it is being that is how it is now that is how it will be it cannot change but I want you to remember that the book of Acts was not defeated they meant the sons and daughters of God and Acts was not defeated Amen so if they were not defeated then and they will not be defeated now that if this pain tears for another twenty years amen they won't be defeated in twenty years I'm trying to preach a meant they won't be defeated listen there is something about this church it is the undefeatable Church it is the church that cannot be defeated it is an invincible army it is too strong to be defeated it is too strong to be stopped what has given us that Street they agreed with the Word of God from the hour that we're living in see what we must remember is is that Jesus was upon the earth Judas was upon the earth Amen we must remember that the Spirit of Christ amen return upon the true church and the problem of God is going to show us that as the Spirit of Christ returned upon the true church the spirit of Judas returned upon the false church see Judas would have a form of godliness but would deny the power thereof in 2nd Timothy 3:5 the Bible says having a mint a form of godliness amen but denying the power thereof and the property picks us up I believe it is at the only ones and he says see don't run to it but turn away from it see when they begin to deny the power he meant now not deny the power of God amen kind of preach they meant not deny the power of the Holy Ghost amen but when they begin to deny the power of the vindicated word for the hour which you're living you turn away from it amen because that is a false lying spirit that is a false church spirit and you're looking at one young man that's not afraid to stand and say that is a spirit from the pits of hell any spirit that tries to set this message down is a damning out of hell but I want to tell the devil there is a pride upon the earth for not who you are not cetera you will not back her up you are not quite there down she has got the strength of God to withstand that spirit of deception in the age were living you may deceive them but you ain't gonna deceive us amen because we agree with the word and the very sign of deception is when you can't agree with the world but then who you better just be careful no Amen cuz that's the spirit that destroys homes it's a spirit that destroys marriages it is a spirit that destroys churches it is a spirit that destroys ministries it is a spirit and there is a bride here to contend and withstand that spirit see the Prophet said what he done Judas done was he leaned amen to his own understanding instead of the understanding that was the vindicated Word of God and he did it to Jesus just what the scripture said he would do and today the church world has turned Christ that in the last stage just exactly like the book of Revelation said they would have it is the spirit of Judas again in the form of church they meant having a form of godliness but denying the power of the word see that's right now oh my what did it result in death just like it did the heed it done and all others who tries to provoke the Word of God and lean to their own understanding even now they sell not for thirty pieces of silver but maybe become old some great officers some seminary experience wasn't even worth thirty pieces of silver but they sell it anyhow he said see they sale their understanding of God hey I hear me church what didn't II am I say in the book of Nehemiah what is one word that is attached with the opening of the book is understanding when the book comes open there comes that understanding when the book comes open there comes an understanding see and when there is an understanding then there is a year of Thummim and then then there is a sign Amen that what is being said can either come back to the year and the Thummim and be proven right or false and I say tonight friends Amen the same spirits that rested upon Paul has returned in this generation that if you're not going to say what the seventh angel is said there is some sons and daughters that's going to stand up and say you're not preaching from an open book you're not preaching from an understanding you're preaching from a seminary you're preaching from an education but there is some people here tonight let's not more than a feeling we got more than a sensation we got more than an education we've got an understanding that God would be here that the church would be here I'm not crazy I'm a message believer and this message has fallen understanding the church go ahead praise the Lord you might as well we've got an understanding you wanna shout about something you got an understanding about something you got the opening but seven seals the third book has been clearly identified we're not a confused church we're a strong Church brother what give us the street brother behind the message gave it to us you take the message out of the pulpit and it'll become another Hollywood evangelism you take the message out of your office and it'll become a lot but if you lift this message up power no we always stay in this message I'm not ashamed of it it's the understanding of God okay go ahead Judas if you want to sell out your understanding of God go ahead but there is some seed here that cannot be deceived if they didn't have something to give you 30 years ago don't think they got something now let the Pentecostal church 30 years ago to follow the message and I tell you what I think now it's about time to go back because the message has gotten stale and and all they do is read clothes and all they do is holler about a seventh angel amen but let me tell you if they were dying thirty years ago then let me rest you sure tonight there are more dead tonight than they were thirty years ago amen but I'm preaching from a message that is not more higher in it tonight it's got more reality in it tonight but then I want to quote for that okay the problem of God said he becomes more real he becomes a realist he's going to be at the end of an age at the end of an age is when he becomes more real don't misunderstand me please but he's more real here in this building tonight than he was in 65 he's more real here tonight than he was in treatment amen because the Prophet is gone but the message is still in power in demonstration it's real tonight there are some people here that is lifting up holy hands and saying a man because the understanding has come the understanding has come when you read about Cain you got an understanding now when you read about Moses hand or Jesus saying it wasn't so from the beginning you've got an understanding now when you hear the cleanness Sheba you got an understanding now when you hear about the woman at the well you've got an understanding now when you hear about blind Bartimaeus you've got an understanding now what give it to your church the message of the hour the message of the hour has revealed that we the bride is the true church the true church is the Church of the Living God then what does that qualify us for Amen brother Samuel it qualifies us for the contest we are not a met in a contest Amen but we are into the contest bro we wrestle no look at this short rest on the feast in 6:12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places see what the word wrestle means it means a contest between two in which each endeavors to throw the other and which is decided when the victor is able to hold his opponent down with his hand up his neck oh and the term is transferred to the Christian struggle with the power of evil see I meant the word wrestle amen becomes the word wrestle but victory comes when the opponent is able to put his hand can I bring it a little bit closer home or put his foot upon the neck of the enemy do you know what the contest is it is a test of strength see the Indian used to put a fire and they would put so many men on this into the rope and so many on this in in a tug-of-war the contest of strength would pull the losing party across the fire and now we know there's many things that we could face this upon for a few minutes amen but the greatest contest there is that's between the church and Satan amen if you could give me a bit more on these monitors I'd appreciate it it's it's the contest between the church and st. now that scares people because notice he didn't say it's the contest between God and Satan it's now the contest between the church and Satan notice here that great strength of Satan and we want to speak of the great strength of God in his church all right now catch this that's why you've been through what you've been through but you still got to victory is because it's not you fighting it's not your streak it's the strength of God that has come on the inside of you no wonder the devil hates you because when he finds you it's like spotting God he thought you it's like God himself you know why because God has changed his mask in this generation and himself in young men in young women in preachers in deacon see the devil scared of you to not church brother ender I don't know if I can keep fight well you ain't fight in the first place God's just using your body to fight through the contest has been going on for many years the contest actually started in heaven and Satan was kicked out into the earth and then it became an enemy to God's people but the Prophet said so amen the word is God and the word becomes our streets God in the church becomes its strength to pull Satan into his own tire that he has made you know why the devil's embarrassed is because he said they had a contest because they were trying to prove who is stronger then they would say okay if I'm stronger then you're coming in the fire but if you're stronger then I'm coming in the fire Amen but the devil hates you you know I hate you because she was born in sin we were safer in iniquity we come in the world speaking lies and God wrote about us in the book of Revelation and said we saw overcome him they meant so God has already written victory about you in his word oh brother Andrew then we just need the by but we just need Christ alright let me preach to you for a second put your seatbelt on Amen but just having the Bible or the word in letter form it's not straight come on church don't get cloud on me now Amen the false church read this same Bible this weekend the false church carries the same Bible they met the false church preaches from the same Bible Amen it's not just carrying the Bible or the word being letter form but the streets of the church or the street that the believer is when you can say Amen or agree with all the words from Genesis to Revelation second Corinthians three five not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything is of ourselves but Paul says our sufficiency as of God who also have made us able ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life the Spirit give a streak the Spirit quickens the word remember census in Hebrews chapter five and six but Paul being well trained knew the Scriptures by the word but you see the scriptures no matter how well you know them if the Spirit doesn't quick them then the letter killeth the spirit giveth life C it must be quickened or made it alive by the spirits if the spirit doesn't live in the word oh I got time to get into it but I will preach on in a few days when the spirit alive it's the word then you ain't got no right to sleep in church oh I got caught there when the spirit live in the word then you no longer have a right to judge somebody for shouting see because the word has become more than a book to them the Prophet said if the spirit doesn't live in the word and make it a reality than the letter is just intellectual then do you know why you're shouting tonight is because they're scholars there's philosophers there's steel oceans that have been trying for years to understand what's your understanding but they can't understand it but there is a spirits in the house of God to quicken the word rather somebody shout we need spiritual strength we need spiritual strength amen amen the bible says in psalm 28:7 the lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusted in him and I am helped therefore my heart greatly rejoices and with my song will I praise him the prophet said if a man will shut himself off from God's spiritual sunshine then there's something wrong with this spiritual condition for when a man refuses to walk in the leading of God of a good God like our God who is our comfort and our streets and deliver his sunshine and spiritual growth it's spiritual strength to live in here sunshine the shining of his glory well it's the greatest privilege we have to live under the sunlight of God's glory to look at the good healthy Christians amen I don't get mad but you're pretty healthy tonight oh brother I don't feel like I'm healthy no I talk about the natural man because my Bible says the outward man perish a neighbor day but the inward man is renewed day by day [Applause] amen you know what you come in here and sometimes you don't even feel like you're saved you don't even feel like you got the whole ego you feel like the devil has done everything you can to destroy your testimony but when you begin to hear that word something begins to turn a mint something begins to pulsate what is it it's a sign of a healthy Christian the Prophet said helpless this morning Lord as we read the word may the Holy Spirit reveal it to us somebody shot revealed that the church might be fully established in the faith that was once delivered to the Saints to hold them and may as you give the dish and some two years ago to store up the food fine healthy-looking vegetables then I saw an addition being stored here in this tabernacle may we today receive a whole barrel full of that or a tape Amen that it might reveal Jesus Christ to us in this hour that we might live amen to give a sustaining strength so the strength of God that's not just strengthening you to move it strengthens you to stand are you following me the streets of God does not just strengthen you to get to the house of God and then hear the word and then get out of church and say well I don't know how in the world I'm gonna live that no the strength of God gives you sustaining streets to sustain you in the word that you hear see but the problem it is is we got to get in the spirit some time or another I'm just gonna take the brakes off here and preach for the last a little bit but sometime rather we just got to get in the spirit what will endure you don't realize that we we can't get in the spirit because we're practicing social distancing well and then I've come to realize brother Samuel that a long time before social distancing become popular people was already practicing it we had spiritual social institution Amen we had people that when somebody went to the altar and they got to cry a little bit in a snot little big hole stay away from me come on they met her somebody around them get to shouting let's say what will hold your peace over there and then see what it is is that devil don't want you to get in the spirit because if he get in the spirit listen the person shouting has got just as much a right to be critical as you do but then they decide that critical spirit and got in the Holy Spirit and it released something in there see what did John say he said I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day amen I was in the spirit isn't that just beautiful the whole of the Christian life it has to be the Spirit of God with us - or all of our efforts are in vain see Paul said I will pray in the spirit he said I will sing in the spirit he said I will live in the spirit if is anything good that will come to me it has to be revealed by the spirits confirmed by the word and made manifest by the results it bears see now you read acts 2:38 and they never get in his spirit or it would happen to them exactly as the word says pray to God for a revelation by his Spirit that is the first step is get in the spirit see all we need to get in the spirit then the things will be done don't go through the acts first get in the spirit and then go through the acts and watch what God will do now if you read there and second Kings 3 verse 16 it amazes me how and then that the Bible actually says there thus saith the Lord make this valley full of ditches now what happened was they was in a drought and what they had to do was they had to dig out the ditches for the water to come now you got to realize something here they meant they were all in a drought there wasn't a one of them that wasn't in a drought and the Bible says to dig out the ditches now the problem God says now what do they do they didn't know it today he said men walk around amen ignorant sit this way amen they're down here in this valley and it's hot it's dry they're down there trying to get water trying to move trying to get strength aim it and there's nothing happened the nail marry and then God sends a prophet by the name of Elijah oh brother I want to preach on that sometime but the Prophet shows up and a prophet comes walking down there and they're all in a drought and Elijah walks down there and says hey but now let me just say this it was so dry they couldn't even hardly talk brother it was so dry they can t barley say Amen but I should come down there and said hey look it's hot now down here and they said yeah sure is I said what's wrong they said we ain't got no water Alaska said okay I have come with the answer what isn't of I said he said pick up that shovel and dig some ditches here big big you're not are you not dry like us I'm going somewhere stay with me today but ever since men walk in early they don't know that's a true seat they don't dig down deep enough to get in the spirit of Revelation they don't pray enough they don't call upon God enough they just slightly take it oh well I believe there's a god sure the devil believes the same thing the devil believes the same thing and the Prophet says he trembles see what are they guilty of crucifying him sure but him says I indict this generation finding them guilty by the same word that found them guilty at the beginning see what they did when Elijah comes and says dig out these ditches in other words you were saying if you want some water you got to do something you got to get to work they said okay I said how much water are we gonna get he said just make the valley full of ditches Elijah you've lost your mind Elijah had lost his mind Elijah had been in the unseen Elijah had been up there where God takes his profits to where the Prophet God sent a prophet goes above the people and sees the Feynman's coming up on the church he sees the judgment that is coming upon I'm getting ahead of myself he sees all this stuff coming notice here and Elijah says now go down there and make the valley full of ditches you said with Andrew why with Allah should tell me to do that well because he knew what was coming all they could see what was what was around them Oh church hear me oh they could see was the dryness around them all they could see was all the trouble around them but I should have been in the unseen and they couldn't see it yet amen but what they had to do was they had to catch the vision of Elijah and believe Elijah's message if you make this church full of ditches if you make this church full of ditches then there's some water coming there's some revelation coming brother sister I don't know about you I want to dig some ditches tonight I wanna together ditch I want all the water I can get I want all the revelation I can get I want my life to be more than just a life of carrying a Bible but a living reality I don't know if I can believe I don't know if I can believe in God I don't believe if I can believe in this message well let me say this as plain as I can Amen if the devil believes in trimble sir he believes in God and trembles amen he believes this message and trembles and then I don't know if you can help me up here on these monitors but but blow this roof off if you can't I'll buy your stake afterwards if they're open I'll do something the devil believes in trembles all right but now remember if the devil believes in trembles then the church should believe but we coming to a close but we should not be trembling at the prophets message we should be rejoicing look brother we we don't need to rejoice we we just need to get client know if he get clients you're gonna drop if you quit praising God you're gonna drop see the partner God taught us a very beautiful story about a woman who went to a quiet church one time I'm going somewhere stay with me he said she walked in there and she got in there he said now she was a real emotional person she was a real real believer and she comes to his church with her family and the usher meets her at the door and says praise the Lord sister and she says hallelujah and he said remember said they kind of looked her little funny he said they got her in there and set her down said the preacher got up and said I came to save our souls she said hallelujah see the difference was everybody around her was in a drought but she was in an oasis everybody around her and let their ditches get pulled to her they joined the church and put their name upon a role and become a better citizen amen but she had done some Haven she had made room for some race Oh are you hearing me amen the prophet god said the preacher stopped kind of cleared his voice so well let me carry on and he died a pull across that we could be saved and she hollered out hallelujah he said that he can come down and send our sister you have to climb down or you have to follow us out of here she said well I guess I better go ahead and follow you because I'm not gonna climb down and the Prophet said that's the way we feel about an old-time Holy Ghost meet you don't have to be all the time down in the dumps but when you get to a place where you can feel the first little tinkle of God coming down from heaven into your heart it makes a child of God sing glory to God in the highest I'm bout done but can I preach you for a second no matter how cold the church is or anything about it if you are a real believer how many real believers have we got here if you are a real believer it could be in the middle of a cathedral rolled and you would holler you know the postal world is in a drought the word is intellectual - but unto you that has been quickened by the spirit it is more than just a book it is more than just a page it is more than just a picture it is a whale springing up in the heart of the church I don't know about you but I say spring up o well we need some water Amen can I get a witness we need some water we've got a lot of drag around us but we need some water we'll don't let me just leave in the future brother bride let me tell you the water is not coming no you have got access to the revelation of the word [Applause] maybe good writer energy job but you ain't gonna drop it maybe get dry around your house but you ain't got to drop it maybe get dry in America but this Friday gonna dry it's more than religion to us the message has made the Bible a living reality now I have a tendency to preach some time so I'm just gonna preacher for a second if this message remains any simple form to you it's gonna do you no good if all it is it's charts and pictures I'm on this preach for a second I may get in trouble but I want the preaching I was in the Church of the day and all it was was chart - well I say the other day here's a while back but it was just charge this chart that chart this chart that chart this and that picture this chart and you talk to people they said well you know what we sure get into a short learning this message at the same time you got young people struggling with pornography at the same time you got you hear me see it's it's one thing to be in charge for me it's one thing to be in semaphore but the symbols are not going to change nothing it's got to become a reality it's got to become something real to you if all this message is to you is a book on the shelf and a tape in the player and a picture on the wall just a few more setting to the Sun and you're gonna be as dry as the rest of them in that valley oh but if this message becomes your absolute if this message becomes the reason you live the reason you breathe the reason you see the reason you get up and if this message becomes your all and all little brother let me pay in the skies and limit and then ain't no devil can cap you off ain't no spirit can shut you up call come on church this message is not just building churches it's not just making preachers this message is taking us out of this world leave here one of these morning sir this is more than just a book this is more than just attack this is the understanding have you ever noticed how Satan hates two books of the Bible more than all the others now the devil get quite here but that's okay I won't cut his head off through the liberal theologians through persuade no scientist is always attacking the book of Revelation and Genesis in both of these books we find Satan's origin his awful ways and his destruction that is why he attacks them he hates to be exposed and in those books he is exposed for exactly what he is jesus said about Satan he has no part of me and I have no part of him the devil would like to prove that different but he cannot do so then what does the devil do he does all he can to destroy confidence in the word come on church amen people that's walk away from this message they're not trying to destroy your confidence in the book Oh get back to my abou Bible okay we've been there they try to destroy your confidence in the interpretation of the book because a church that is a closed book has got a closed wound and she cannot bring forth nothing Church it's a hotter church but if there is a seed in there then the seed comes to the body and if there is a quickening spirit in there then it won't just quicken the preacher it will quicken whoever it comes in contact with it's got a seed but when the church disbelief Satan and believes the spirits revelation of the word maybe if we sit this way believes the message of our the gates of Hell cannot prevail against her without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can never have your eyes open to a true spiritual revelation of the world why can't people see that I said there it is I happen to think I don't care how clear it is how much the scripture teaches it you'll never be able to see it until God shows himself to you and the whole Bible has built the whole Church of the Living God is built upon a spiritual revelation of the word then I want you to notice here and I'm gonna quit here because I'm running out of time but I want you to notice every man that ever has the spiritual revealed truth of the will of God makes preparation for the fulfilling I had preached out already ever every man that has a spiritual revelation is faking preparation for the fulfilling now let me say this do not talk about obtaining the literal until you can obtain the spiritual are you ready aim it now people say oh I'm going to that future home they read revelation to anyone that I'm going to that see that John saw coming down from God I'm going there brother Samuel ain't nothing gonna stop me I'm gonna I'm gonna walk the streets of gold I want to sit I'm going there and then they hear a prophet breach the future home and say well I disagree with that disagree if you can't obtain the spiritual you won't obtain the literal but the reason for time but the reason why we are so confident we're gonna tame the literal it's because we're shouting tonight about the spiritual amen when a prophet said we're gonna sit by the river we said hey man when a prophet said are you hearing me what a prophet said we're gonna walk the streets of gold and describe the future home we said amen we heard the spiritual and becuase we are possessors of the spiritual we are making preparation to take the literal altar time closing my prophet said to theophany is in this building tonight when you heard that and you said a man that wasn't preparation that you're gonna possess the mineral I don't know about you Church but I think we ought to just let some amens go on this building for a few minutes you anybody wanna fill up your tank with some toy anybody wanna feel you take up with some strength then what did the Prophet say if you can say amen to the spiritual revelation of the word of God that will give you strength you know what we are some people tonight then when we hear a prophet saying we can say man let me ask you a question what did you say when you heard him say that a lot appeared on the Ohio River what did you say when you heard him say a boy spoke and said his John the Baptist was sent to first come into the price your ministry or for up to second what did you say when you heard him say that an angel of Peter and said you'll take a sign of your hand and be able to discern the very diseases what did you say when you heard him say that time will come in the second Corps that you'll tell them there is secret to the heart what did you say when you heard him saying that the third pill is the opening of the word what did you say when you heard him say seven angels make me up on the mountain and commissioned me to go back and preach the seven seals what did you say when he said my ministry is different from the evangelists in the pastor my ministry is to declare him he is here what did you say when you heard him say that every devil in hell could not stop that boy from rising off the ground and fitment what did you say when you heard him say the boy said go by the way of Carter's what did you say when you heard him say you are the sinless payment spotless just in fact ride but Jesus Christ as though you never done it what did you say what did you say to say a man I believe in explain it but I believe with one of these morons between 6:00 and 9:00 it's gonna change me what you spend your feet tonight when you can save man to the spiritual you are a candidate to obtain the literal I say man that's all I can say I remember I remember I remember as a young 16 year old preacher barely out on the field going to a preacher's office then they're studying and the preacher sent me you know v8 motor the seat of God in you we looked at me and said he said you know you're not going to see the God in here I said brother what do you mean he said now don't come here preaching that stuff he said we were not going to seat in you you received a seat in the altar he said what do you believe I said well I believe a prophet of God sent in several places like one white Christ speak the seed was put in yet from before the foundation of the world I said another one is a thinking man's filter the seed was in you always a third one is future home you wasn't saved on any certain certain day you always was saved a fourth metropolis pack him up over there all right now fourth one was the spoken word is the original seed you are a predestinated seed just like Christ was he said when you heard that did you try to explain it or what did you say I said brother I couldn't explain it I was too busy shouting hey man I was too busy screaming in bed because I was hearing something that was giving me strength we can't deny this message now Church it's our strength it's why we're here tonight come on musicians if you don't come out never quit what do we doing here tonight we're making preparations we receive the spiritual revelation we're going to obtain the literal a man a man what'd you just say a man I'm an overcomer I'm more than a conqueror I'm going in the rapture my body's gonna be changed I've been justified I've been sanctified I've got the Holy Ghost I'm sealed into the day of my Redemption what are you doing you're agreeing with what the word says about you round up suddenly come to you and lift you square the eyes and said you ain't nothing and you'll never amount to nothing you'll never be nothing and then they kept it off by saying you're ugly you know what ain't gonna have no effect on you until you agree with what they said then you begin to think upon it then it begins to affect you and before long ago think well I guess I'll never be nothing I guess I'll always be defeated I guess I'll never make a rapture I guess I see but the reason why you don't pay in the digit is because that's not what you see in yourself then do you see why we're not here agreeing with the devil tonight it's because what he says we just simply don't see it in the mirror of God's Word about who we are we see in the mirror that we shall abide in him and his word and I said we shall have all things and we identify ourselves with that and say anything related I don't know it's just a few more settings of a sudden I guess he'll run out a streak than have to quit there don't talk like that go listen to a tape and just sit there the whole time saying amen you go listen to the news that sit there crap go listen to a tape chat see the devil he that was very determined Reza said no the devil he is the most faithful church member you've got is you know why he's the most faithful church member Richard can stand behind a pulpit they call him a liar tell him he came from Haley's going back to him he's a liar from the beginning the preacher can't stand the pulpit until the church stand up and stomp on take your spiritual fish to give you a my god you can read out of the book of Genesis and expose he got started turn over to Revelation and expose how he ends tell the people to ignore him shiny don't listen to him don't pay no attention to services dismissed you get up walk out he'll be back seven morning you know what that tells me that Neville is so determined he can't be discouraged you can read about his end in the book of Revelation of being phone a bottomless pit and a Lillian put a polymeric chain of circumstance and it doesn't discourage him enough to quit well let me just go into the book of Revelation don't just tell him it also tells yours so the same book that tells him his in doesn't discourage him enough to quit I'll do the same book that tells us our end and doesn't discourage us enough to quit here as a matter of fact it encourages you shall overcome him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of your testimony I say man this messages calls me to be too determined to quit now [Music] company sister not Lord I want to be more than just to church member every man that ever has the spiritual revealed truth of the will of God makes preparation for the fulfilling I know these are simple Falls tonight but I pray their streets to you brother that's how the church you have a revelation of this word you believe this message go get your Bible have their name put on it but what am i doing make it a preparation for the fulfilling this will be the Bible they'll carry when they come back to church oh brother and you're a problem with my feet I'm crippled I can't walk and go buy you some shoes why make preparation for the fulfill a spiritual revealed truth in your heart has moved to beyond wondering if it's true or not it's moved you beyond thinking you might be come on church look at Abraham Abraham the probably God say for I come to church he said Abraham never the promise thank you back Abraham notice he didn't say he didn't look at the symptoms of Sarah's body he didn't look at this condition of his own he also said he never even looked at the promise brother what should he be looking at the promise remember said no he was looking at the one that made the promise because ultimately the one that makes the promise is who except to to fulfill the promise then tonight Church quit just looking at the promise and look away to Jesus the one that made the promise look at him he's the one that's never lost the battle he's the one that's never been defeated that's the God that makes you the promise that's the God that made you the promise tonight sister that's the God that made you the promise shuttle person over there I want the Holy Ghost but I can't get it that's the God that made you the promise of the Holy Ghost we look to him tonight we get your eyes off of all the droughts around you know all the conditions where you start making preparation for the fulfilling its power horse together today make preparation for the fulfilling I believe the spirit of Goddess you're denying maybe there's something up on your heart you've been praying about you've been desiring from the Lord God how's it gonna happen how is this gonna come to pass can I encourage you tonight can I courage you tonight start making a preparation for the fulfilled it amazing how Abraham Abraham never never considered those things but a prophet of God said in that new commentary divine commentary baberaham's live for me it says he staggered not at the promise of God where did his strength cut from his strength come from the same place your strength is coming from by agree with the word it's a powerful study sometime if you ever see it now that the Bible talks about Abraham saying Amen and how the name perhaps Amen was actually an exclamation mark it what's in the question it was in the comment was in the period it was an exclamation mark I believe it could you raise your hand and I didn't say Lord here's my exclamation mark I believe it I believe it I'm done worrying about how it's going to happen I'm done trying to figure all the ins and outs of it I'm gonna start making preparation for the fulfilling I'm gonna get the fatted calf ready I'm gonna get the best robe ready that child is coming home that healing is coming that victory is coming the devil's told me what's going to happen but tonight it's moved from just read that in the word to spiritually revealed of my heart that's going to happen and nothing is going to stop it Heavenly Father Lord all across this building tonight there God is your believing sons and daughters Lord mother pool has been upon the word tonight father I believe there's an atmosphere in this building tonight that all things are possible now lord I know the devil right now is nervous he's trembling his knees are knocking because he hates atmospheres like this he hates atmospheres if the Spirit of God becomes so real that the word upon the page becomes flesh hallelu he hates services when the spirit begins to move in the heart and the person quits question what brother Matt said it just starts saying a man he hates those moments where the preacher hits himself out of the way it begins to walk down channels and avenues and he doesn't even know why he's gone in and the believer begins to say only speaking the mean that's speaking to me and the devil says no it's not he heard about that the for church or somebody told him at the spirit of god is saying no there's no way you could have known it it's for me and a man comes out of a turn what is it Lord it's a victory hallelujah it's a word transitioning from letter to spirit line coming from simple to reality oh god I pray to that Lord if there would be one here tonight it's some shape form or fashion would be struggling with the spiritual revelation of this word called the message of the hour I pray tonight they're gone Lord that your spear would cut down and would move that away from Lord as I wrote your prophets say just the other day he said let the Holy Ghost come in and search your conscience in your conscience will argue it forward be the dishonor of all doubts will dissolve all doubts in your heart but we're living in a day in time where there's more doubts than there's ever been before nor those voices becoming voices about becoming voices of confusion becoming voices of chaos becoming voices of the nation but tonight near God we look up to you tonight Lord who is the true voice welcome to you tonight their God who is the God that can drive away all the confusion you can pry the way all that now it's real in the promise can make it real to us to that Lord Lord as it was that day when Ezra come before the peoples and read the word they rejoice said amen they were tired and she preached for six hours they were tired because the word was given him strength for the task that lays ahead with Jesus rose that made art and you want Menem and Stroke pathos to preach the six hour sermon they weren't tired of hearing you preach because the Bible says you come to their home they paid you to come in and keep on going to not gun we're not tired of hearing your word we need more of it it's streets to us it's victory to us it's drawing to us it's healing to us help us tonight near god help us tonight Lord to receive the spiritual strength that you desire in the true church hallelujah all friends tonight I believe you see her we've never had bounded right close get you - raise your head straight right now get me to star tip in your own way Lord I need strength
