family today is my the message is mine oh the message is mine the message is [Music] i told satan to get me behind for this message and it's just such a such an encouragement and you hear just the songs that's being sung and you know the channel that god has and it's just it's just always refreshing it's so important you know when we i think years ago probably now almost 19 years ago and maybe more than that just looking at some things you know sometimes you know we look at the importance of the word and the word is very important there's got to be an atmosphere that's set and the word itself sets an atmosphere and it to where that in our lives to invite his presence but you think of how that without worship there's always been worship that goes before the word coming and we want to be able to receive the word we we know that in ourselves sometimes you know if we can look at the honesty of god's prophet that he could say sitting in that back office when he could say he said my spirit was all tore up he said from everything he said but this song service it made a way and we just we know that's so important you know any any person who's ever done anything with athletics or whatever more and especially as you get older you realize you've got to stretch in order maybe hang pictures you know but when you you know if you don't stretch you risk injury stretch is a lot of times it's some of those things sometimes it can be seemingly laborious you look at huh i don't really want to stretch i don't want to take the 15 minutes and 20 minutes but it's important and that's what real worship is it's it's just getting loose you just press in there sometimes you you know you say well really i don't always feel like it but that's the time to sacrifice a praise that's a time just to start just you know like paul and then they just started tapping their foot they just started entering in and began to think about the goodness of god that's what happened with elijah when they brought that minstrel there it just changed the whole situation and we're no different than what they were we still we deal with this human part this part of us that is weak but thanks be to god we've got wisdom to know where to go for help when we need help to say hey turn on some good gospel music turn on some instrumental music we we know we have we god has given us direction in that because after all there is even god will heal even by music amen i think how many pro how many individuals i don't know what i'm saying is i'm just saying it but how many went through the prayer line and brother branham even stopped different sisters that dealt with gloom about their life and brother brahm told her he said he told him he said now you go from here you play some snappy gospel tunes snappy you play some snappy gospel tunes and then he refers it back to how in his trailer or the the office that he had he said i keep that going in my office he said with billy he said to keep that atmosphere there and that's there's a way you get to feel a little bit down and you get you know you say oh i should be reading i should be praying we'll understand that but just put on some music just put on some music just put on some you know do like little drake has his mama do he has he has sister rebecca put on the services here and he plays his drums and he uses his microphone and they have service all over again so oh how we just love the lord just little simple things like that but we're simple people and we want the desires just that the lord would just have his way in our in our lives we want to just look into the word of the lord but maybe before we turn our bibles here and i'm going to have you turn to daniel chapter 9 this morning but we just want to look to the lord in a word of prayer and as you're turning there just want to give an update on sister linda or my aunt linda you know this at the beginning here my goodness my days are all mixed up mom when was that was that the end of last week or the beginning of this week she had that this past friday no no the friday before life the days are all all twisted around here so we she real real early in the morning got the call she had been on a waiting list for a lung transplant and so you know everything had to be in line and clear you know this is why you know if she had a little sniffle or anything she always had to call them over the past year and a half and uh let them know if something was going on and so they would you know evaluate where she was at on the list well god moved her up on the list she was you know you'd say 45 you think my that's far from the top but if you're in 45 they tell you to be ready at any moment that's just how quick it can go and so she had had a little we we had prayer on uh on that i don't know if it was thursday or the friday but we had prayer she had texted me and asked me says can we have prayer because she was having such pain in her flank and just thought man maybe it's a kidney stone or something and we just just agreed together there on the phone and then i found out early the next morning when they called her and let her know hey you need to get in here about two in the morning you know here they're they're arriving we need to get you prepped god completely removed that pain that she had and all that was going on that was there kidney stone or what have you and she was then ready to go into that surgery she went through what i thought and i had always thought it was just a single lung she had a double lung transplant and you know they've got pictures of her and she's setting up on the bed she's getting ready to go into step down and maya and linda i can tell this honor because we're family and i understand that anybody who's been in the hospital understand it she was telling her daughter you get my get my purse you get my phone get my clothes i'm leaving she's just ready to get out of there you know she'd been there about a week but i you know she just wanted to pass along just thanking each of you for your prayers she's like i said getting ready to go into step down unit and they've already had her up walking and setting and everything she just she just looks really well and so we just thank god for his mercy amen let's just bow our heads on the word of prayer heavenly father lord as we just come before you this morning lord jesus we humble our hearts and our spirits oh god in your presence we just lord desire that you would just lord have your way lord in this portion of the service lord we thank you for the song service thank you for the songs of zion thank you for the joy in our hearts oh god and lord we pray that father you would just move among us in a special way i know lord that father there would be more lord in the unseen audience than what's gathered here but father together we desire lord to unite lord our hearts together you see the circumstances lord with the weather and there are also some who are sick father we just ask that you'll come by our way and you would speak to our hearts you know what we have need of in our hearts right now is your children lord we're praying and we're asking o god that you would speak to us lord minister to our hearts in a special way i pray that god you'll help us to take these next few moments just to step aside lord as we invite you lord god just to have your way we ask it in the name of jesus christ amen amen let's read here in daniel chapter nine i'm just going to read just a few verses of scripture and we'll let you be seated in daniel chapter 9 verse 1 it says in the first year of darius the son of a hezrus of the seed of the medes which was king over the realm of the chaldeans in the first year of his reign i daniel understood by books the number of the years whereof the word of the lord came to jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of jerusalem amen may god bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i'd like to just just draw from there just just for a few moments here and i'm not going to i'm not going to keep you long and i want you to pray that that'll be true but i just want to look just at a thought here this morning just some things that as we've been looking in on prayer and i just thought as of from even there was another direction i was going to go but just here one day just being in prayer here hearing the lord just spoke to my heart i just want to speak here on on a thought honest reflections honest reflections daniel we read here daniel being a prophet of god daniel was directed and he said he understood by the books the number of the years whereof the word of the lord came to jeremiah the prophet remember it had been prophesied through jeremiah that there was going to be 70 years that israel would be out of the land and in captivity and when we look at this time i want to just move just into that word of understanding because we know that understanding itself when we're speaking of this here in verse 2 it's more than an understanding of just a natural man's mind any man can put scripture to scripture to scripture together but it takes god to put it in order you see many times when you can look even at times in theologians in the past and men that have lived and i'm not i'm talking men of god that have lived before that they could look into things such as here in the book of daniel and look in many places and they could write certain commentaries on things those that could even look into church ages and so forth but to understand that there are things that they were looking at and glimpses that was there but the difference when it understanding comes from god that is something that can only be given in a designated time man has a desire to seek god man has a desire to know god's will and that that really comes to our hearts as believers with everything about our life is we desire to know god's will and so understanding is is something that you know sometimes like brother branham brought that up with the man at work and they read about the book of revelation said who can understand it you know and he made the comment you know john must have had a hot pepper supper and things like that brother branham told him even then he said it could have cost me my job but i told the man shame on you and he and he spoke even in that moment that when god gets ready when it's time for god to reveal something because that's a principle in god's word then god will reveal it and it's his spirit that comes forth to make it known to those who it's intended for that they would understand and so daniel is here in this moment and he's looking in into what was spoken there by jeremiah and the understanding that god begins to impart to jeremiah and our to daniel in this time and i just want to just just move here on this this thought of understanding that understanding as we said moments ago it's more than just as brother brown would say it a student comparing verse to verse now we all know the scripture says study is that right but the bible also says in the book of proverbs much study weary of a person so it shows it's not conflicting but it's to move in the channel that god is giving in that hour things that god has many times you hear brother bran will say now write this down you can look at it when you get home you can read over when you get home you can pray over it when you get home so it's study in line and in tune with god's mind so we're not i'm thankful god hasn't left it up to you or us to me to try to figure out our own way god in this hour has has sent to you and i the message straight from the throne of god that we don't have to figure out we don't have to figure out all we have to do is believe and when we believe it shows itself in our own lives because after all real understanding remember the scripture said uh in john 3 that except a man be born again he cannot understand the kingdom of god that understanding deals with seeing it isn't that we become smarter people but the understanding is where there's a seeing there's a there's a reality that strikes our heart where we're more we're not just aware of the unseen realm we're tapped into the unseen realm and it's also by that understanding as jesus could say he he that heareth my words and understand it believeth on me have eternal life and brother random will pick it up in satan's eden and says now understanding he says is more than just hearing he said the drunkard could hear it and remain a drunkard the prostitute can hear it and remain a prostitute he said but understanding means he who heareth or understandeth it he said because once you've understanded there is a change come about within your life so it's not a natural change it's not something up here but it's an understanding of the living god who is present in our midst and that word is speaking to our life and it's him personally and that's an understanding that opens to you and i of the living god who is present right here and so when we look at this understanding i'm going to go right into a scripture actually brother benny used here on thursday night but i want to just i want to just take this here in verse 6 of job 32 here is elihu all the rest of those three previous friends of job have come and they don't know how to interpret what's taking place and as a matter of fact when you read in the scripture you read job is standing on his sacrifice the message that god has given him he doesn't know what's going on but he knows because he's tapped in as a vindicated prophet that there is a channel of inspiration that i don't know what's taking place but when it's time for me to know god will make it known to me amen and then we find that with job you and i can look into our own lives and we can see that even as job himself he got just so under that that the the the conversations of those others that job actually begin to justify himself in their presence but you see when you get to looking at all this here comes alihou on the scene and elihu is a type of christ is that right ella who could tell job i am thy wish in god's dead i am clay as thou art clay you see it takes the living god to bring understanding and clarity you or i could not understand what's taking place in this hour or even in our own lives without the holy spirit coming and i'm telling you we don't just need one visitation we do to be changed from death unto life but we need visitation after visitation from the holy spirit glory be to god this message did not come by the mind of a man this message is that of the mighty angel that has come down amen i want to just look at this here just for a moment and i i'm just going to just just read this in verse 6 and allah the son of bhakkara forgive me if i butchered that the uh the buzaite answered and said i am young and you're very old wherefore i was afraid and durst not show you mine opinion stay with me verse seven i said days should speak and multitude of years should teach wisdom now here ella who has looked at things and he says behold but there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them understanding great men are not always wise neither do the aged understand judgment now he's just put it here very clearly that it's not that it's not anything that rests in man of how old a man is even though we know that even those that would be among us as we grow older there's more wisdom we have experiences experiences of things we could say don't go that way don't do that there there comes experiences in our life and those experiences come about also by honest reflections brother brandon says bill brown said it like this in the message he said when you got a man he said all he's ever pronouncing is the blessings of god on you and he doesn't speak of the cursings he said you better get away from that man then he goes on to tell us he said when you have a person he said and they know ev they know the answer to everything he also said you better get away from that person because there's only one one person among us who has the answer for everything and sometimes it's not the answer or the way that you are even thinking about it it's god's way because his way is higher than our ways we get in trouble when we try to make god's ways our ways instead of allowing our ways to be molded to god's ways true notice days i thought days should speak some multitude of years should speak great men are not always wise neither do the agent understand judgment notice where elihu is putting the focus that understanding it comes by inspiration from almighty god it is sovereignly given right true therefore i said i hearken to me and i also will show you my opinion hello who's got some opinions come on now joe what are you going to do i tell you what job's going to do he's going to recognize that these opinions are coming from god amen are you hearing me now you see brother branham takes it and i heard but now i see i i love this statement it's at the end of the message of that and brother brahms just been talking as you heard brother benny going through that here the other night and and this you know over weeks it just pondered in my heart brother branham begins to speak about the channel of inspiration that's open to you and i in this hour and he speaks of how here he is he's he's watching in the midst of of a congregation and he says and like this he says it seems like there's a channel kind of i spoke that's pulling me this way now here he is discernment is taking place and he's he's looking and he's feeling a channel pulling him a certain way now i want you to watch what happens here he says being i've directed it that way now it comes wonderful and then the vision breaks you're here with this and your husband is with this and this situation you see the channel comes open and the prophet feels the pool so what he does is he yields to that pool and then it becomes wonderful i'd say that's a pattern of what god's desire is and how we are to live our lives in that place to where when we feel the channel of god pulling us in a certain direction maybe there's something we need to be looking at in the word and we're overlooking or our answer is right there and here we are it's to be sensitive to that and just direct ourselves that way it'll come wonderfully amen it's an understanding that comes to you and i and this is why we we need we need to heed to the channel of the hour the pull of the hour get ready make sure the token is applied where christ is your life and your whole life is wrapped in him amen you understand what i'm saying it's more than just overcoming drinking overcoming smoking overcoming sick overcoming all you can have a whole is it's deeper than that it's where your life becomes wrapped in jesus christ it's inspired into him where he is your life as brother branham could say our life is so wrapped into him amen so let's discern let's discern the time we're in you know jesus spoke of the pharisees they could discern the skies it's going to be rain or it's going to be a good day or it's going to be this it's going to and he said you fail to recognize and discern the sign of the times it was right before them but they weren't discerning it did they know the scripture they knew the scripture but they did were not in tune with the inspiration of god you see even if they didn't see it which they didn't but the thing they could have done wasn't say i don't see it but i hear what's being said and their testimony was nicodemus let the cat out of the bag we know thou art a teacher come from god hallelujah we've blasted you on youtube we've done this we've done that but we know behind closed doors thou art a teacher come from god because no man can do these miracles like this see it was a lack of humility if they only in that moment could have just said i don't understand it i don't see it i know it's of god but can you help me to see it yes god would have honored that oh my may we never be too big to say god open my eyes amen lord i'm not seeing that exactly but god opened my eyes if if the word is coming forth and there's things being directed down if that's god is speaking lord i may not see it the way that you're bringing it but open my eyes so that i can see it lord the way you're bringing it yes amen amen we want to discern the hour the time we're living in we want to be spiritual we want to be spiritual spirit-filled setting our things on things our affections on things above now when we look at this with honest reflections honest is a great quality the scriptures would also refer to this as uprightness and honest reflections is reflection is something that we're able to see or to or to look at that'll like like a mirror a mirror will show certain things up within within a life and i want to look at it in that way of where we can we're looking at the mirror of god's word and i want to just just just to just looking at this a few moments because the word of god as it speaks in james 1 22 the word of god is a looking glass this word is a looking place it's one that you we can behold ourselves in and what it becomes then once we are beholding ourselves in it it now becomes our choice and responsibility as to what we do with the image that we're beholding nobody else can do it for us a pastor can't a prophet can't nobody not only well we have to take responsibility as we were looking at last week work out our own salvation with fear and trembling the distrusting of one's own of one's own ability but a cleaving unto him who is able to change us and bring to pass what he is calling for in his word so in james 1 22 let me just read this here be you doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves that's a pretty bold statement because we recognize then hearing is not altogether understanding hearing a person can hear it but what separates a hearer and a doer and he separates this from coming to pass is an unction of the spirit of god in a healing to that word and look when the word speaks to us let me tell you the word calls for things that are word and in order for the word to be fulfilled it requires the living word himself to move on the inside and it requires his quickening in our life and a continual quickening we are made to be dependent upon him amen we're not goats we're sheep right is that right and sheep we're helpless we need his leadership so when we look at this this is where we we have our own life evaluated in the light of god's word and notice for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he's likened to a man beholding his natural face in a glass he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was now this word forget actually means it just it just just just doesn't care just in care now i i'm going to say this i don't believe that there were people i'm just going to maybe i'm making a bold statement here but i just don't believe that people just walk around and say i don't care we understand there's people saying i don't care they'll never be back you might witness them to them hey they'll cut you off right now i don't want to go there i don't want to see that but this is dealing with situations where that a person's beholding their life and yet not really taking inventory about it and putting it off to another time i i'll take care of that later or that's too big for me let me tell you something every promise of god is too big for me and you but it's not too big for god if you can just let god have his way in your life and submit to him there's not a giant two-bed there's not a giant that can stand on your mountain if you'll just get in line with that word and say be it unto me according to that word i can't i don't see this right now but i know that's my promise i'm going to stand on that promise with sincerity and prayer i'm going to dedicate it and like a child of abraham i'm gonna say get the diapers ready go buy the crib go get the stroller go get it cause it's mine and god has spoken it [Applause] hallelujah we're following a message in this hour that god has spoken who can but prophesy what tongue can raise its lip and raise against judgment or tear down the promises of god in this hour i tell you a person is fighting in the wrong direction you can't take away the promises of god from the church of the living god this is the hour that we are made to excel and ascend in the promises of god that's what i understand by the books praise the lord hallelujah we don't want to be forgetful we want to be diligent sometimes what we see we don't like right let's just be honest even things that i can pray about in my own life there's things that i behold in the word but what i'm saying i don't like our flesh gets pinched a little bit and there's things i can see in my own life and say oh god i don't want that there but don't walk away just stay right there in his presence but who so looketh into into the perfect law of liberty and continueth therein so the things that you see you're beholding yourself but notice the scripture said whosoever looketh into this phrase looketh into means one who stoops down and has to get down and to look in you know what that is humility amen because you see god's so big he can make himself so small we think greatness is something big out here but no greatness is humility amen and god shows us that that really to stoop down stoop down to look into that perfect law of liberty the things that we see and we can look as you look into that liberty let me tell you something as you look into it if you look into the law of liberty you will see your freedom you will see your liberty you will see the very thing that's tormented you and haunted you you will see yourself as a master over that thing amen glory be to god oh my and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed amen i believe i'm speaking to doers this morning we don't want to be here as only we want to be doers we want us that word it moves within our hearts to see it materialized in our life brother brown would say it like this and just referring to this and i i have this down but maybe i'll just refer to it without reading at the same time he talked about in his own home in kentucky they had a piece of a mirror now he deals with this in the message identification shalom on and on throughout and he they had a piece of a looking glass didn't have one in their house they had it there tacked to the tree and you know dad would shave at it and his mom would comb his hair he said it was just a piece of a looking glass then he talked about how there was a little boy down in that same area that he never seen a mirror in his life he went to one of the relatives homes and he was playing a little bit and finally the door closed and on the back of that door was a mirror and so what he began to do was he was going to walk because he commanders and a little boy i don't have to be bored there's another little fella just like me you know there's another little guy he began to walk and when he got up to it he realized and he turns around mama this is me hallelujah he saw himself in the mirror let me just say this to you in this hour that's exactly where the church of the living god was at we only had a piece of a mirror are you hearing me now we only had a piece of a mirror but god has delivered a full reflection a full mere full glory to light according to his promise in this hour when you hear the revealing of the son of man that's dealing with the fullness of god himself the fullness of the holy ghost coming that's what it was in jesus christ is that right god upon earth in his body right that's how it was on the day of pentecost but god promised i will restore is that right they they fell from that they got away from that they got away from steadfastness and things crept in but god promised that in the days in the days of the son of man as it was in the days of noah as he was in the days of life so shall it be in the coming of the son of man let me just say that same ministry of the son of man is right here now amen because the ministry of the son of man is the angel of the lord that is right here now the same one that came before abraham and sarah's tenth are you with me now he said i will return to you according to the time of life oh my it wasn't it wasn't the same body that he used but god was announcing i'm coming into my body he was calling his body into a place of full deliverance and yielding to his presence that's why the prophet could address us and say i charge you to believe that the son of man is manifest in the bride's the body of man is the fullness of jesus christ not just a portion not just a piece of a mirror we don't have a piece of a mirror just to see ourselves justified we don't have just a little bit more of a piece of a mirror to see ourselves sanctified we don't have just another piece to see the restoration of the gifts and supernatural among us but now there is a fullness of the mirror in other words the seals are taken off and the mirror is fully in view i understand by the books amen hallelujah because this is a time of understanding oh my and that's why we want to look as brother brown would say it like this we want to look into god's great mirror of his word don't get nervous i want to look into god's great mirror of his word i want to read this part it's paragraph 39 he said i want to look at me and i want you to look at yourself as we look into god's great mirror of his word let's be able to identify ourselves with some we're going to speak about some of the characters of other times and i want to see myself in god's looking glass because if there's anything we'll show you where you're standing it's this book there's no book like it because it's all truth i don't say that other books are not true but i know this one is true it's all truth because it's the word of god he said jesus gave us the example of what we ought to be looking at when he reflected his life to us through the word what we should see when we look into god's mirror we should see ourselves identified with him that is a perfect example so when i look at myself in the word i ought to be able to see myself as a son and daughter of god and if there's anything that that that limits that then i then i know that what i'm looking into if i just humble myself whatever that i have need of if if i have need of the holy ghost i'm not going to get it looking somewhere else it's only going to be the word that's going to show it up the word is going to say you're missing this or you're missing that but if the word is not to pick us apart the word is to show us where we're lacking why because it's time to get out of here i understand by the books it's time to leave amen god god made a preparation man didn't do this man didn't take the seals there were many good men in heaven he said i looked in heaven there was elijah there was elisha there were jeremiah all of them but not one of them could come and take them up amen it had to be one who was sinless nature amen come down and take that book for you and i he prevailed he took that book in the garden of gethsemane he took what was lost the right to the tree of life the right to eternal life he took back what rightfully belonged to you and i and then that same life could come to us as a believer and this book has been in the hands of god the whole time and the lamb comes forward to do what take the title deed to redemption and he's announcing this is the hour this is the time of rapture i understand by the books now in daniel chapter nine daniel said in verse two if you don't mind me reading it again i understood by the books the number of the years where the word of the lord came to jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of jerusalem i want you to notice what spiritual understanding what it did for daniel and i set my face unto the lord god to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes and i prayed unto the lord my god and made confession and said o lord the great and dreadful god keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his commandments see this was the time it drew near this was at the part of brother branham would say it like this it was at the time of the 68th year and daniel notice when daniel himself i want you to take this in mind daniel without the blood without the baptism of the holy ghost he lived a victorious life you hear me now that's not a type for you and i to say without the blood and without the holy ghost you can live a victorious life he was living according to what god had revealed to him at the time when i'm talking about the blood i'm talking about the blood of the lord jesus just exactly how the prophet put it there but he was living victorious you know what that tells me it tells me that no matter where that a child of god would happen to be now i don't believe in putting ourselves in places we ought not be amen come on now oh brother samuel i'm a believer i'll tell you i can just go anywhere no no no daniel didn't put himself there come on now daniel didn't just say you know what i'm going to do this right now i'm going to be a light here daniel didn't decide where he was going to be a light amen he was a light and god decided this is where i'm going to put you you see when we try to do things don't we might be a light of god but we actually are hindrance when we're not moving under his leadership but when we move under the leadership of almighty god you know what that shows when you're in the will of god that there is nothing of satan that can overthrow or prevent the work of god you're in the keeping power of almighty god oh my no wonder we should strive to stay in the will of god that's why i don't go to places that jesus can't go don't watch things that jesus can't watch come on friends if you jesus can't be your buddy and do it then you don't need to be doing it and again there's something that's in you within that you need to ask god to remedy that within your life if it's a habit if it's something that you can set in shame god don't want you to sit in shame he's here to bring deliverance to your life it's time to understand this is the hour of deliverance not just the change of the body it's a time for deliverance the lamb has tried it over every devil every demon every sickness amen he's bigger than your situation he's greater than your problem the lamb this greater worthy is the lamb that was to receive rich's glory power and honor oh blessed be the name of the lord daniel notice when this understanding came he went to prayer right i said he went to prayer amen brother brown words it like this he says how daniel was able to see we're near the time of deliverance daniel's looking into the word and he said what it is he said daniel he set aside all his work he pulled down as it was the shades of all his daily tasks he set his face to god put on sackcloth and ashes and went to fasting and praying that he might understand when that time would be because it was so important to him you see whatever is important to you or me will come out that's true amen you understand whatever is important will come out in our life it's one thing we can say this friends i'm talking about honest reflections we can say that god is first in our life but what comes out of our life tells what place he is and if we're honest about it he'll help us amen honest reflections releases the purity and the cleansing power of the washing of water by the word amen you see when isaiah got in the temple isaiah walked in there like any other time but when he went in there after the arm of flesh he was leaning on uzziah you see the arm of flesh is deceitful the arm of flesh is not your joy the arm of flesh is not to be your comfort oh i tell you we're in just such a a terrible time oh i need to find something to settle or something the arm of flesh is not that right the arm of flesh will take you away isaiah walks into the temple of god the arm of flesh is gone but when he walks in that day there's a meeting that god's arranged with him and the post of the temple were moved amen and there was an honest reflection that began to come the presence of god moving down in the temple isaiah looked there and he says woe is me i'm a man of unclean lips see what was happening is the presence of god was bringing a true reflection amen it didn't matter that isaiah was a prophet it didn't matter god's presence reveals truth amen the bible said you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free satan wants to hold back from truth i'm not just talking about mysteries i'm talking about truth of who you really are brother brown tells us in deity of jesus christ he said satan wants you to think you're some trotting down something he said but you're not you're sons and daughters of god somebody has to let you know who you are and know what your rights are so you can go and claim your rights with a humble heart [Music] woe is me i'm a man of unclean lips honest reflection and when that happened there was a confession then came the cleansing then came the fire the cold the live coal the live coal it wasn't an old an old coal that you know was just charred up and and want no life in it it was a living word that came forth what was it what brought that what was me i'm a man of unclean lips it was his confession that invited the cleansing cleansing always follows confession it doesn't work prior to that's right that's why the holy ghost could fall and a person can experience the holy ghost falling on them and yet they've not repented but yet they can hang upon that right there and knowing that there's things within their life that are not right that need to be fully cleaned out it can never produce a real birth are you with me i just just heard it the other day brother sent it here on on on a chat the other day you know a group of ministers i'm with and how that here brother brad was speaking to a man and here he was he begins to go in the man's death and then god moves down on the scene and he heals the man i want you to watch sovereign grace you know sovereign grace moves down and that man is has a hearing problem and god moves down and brings deliverance to that man in his hearing and then that man's able to repeat everything i mean his speech was perfect going right out brother told him to say this say this say this it was perfect going out then that spirit of the lord speaks to that man and said just a minute sir he said there's a habit you've got in your life that's not right he said were you willing to throw those from the smoking of cigarettes down he said god will bring complete deliverance to your life you see what it was his hearing had to be opened and god was gonna deal with his life he didn't want that man walking around thinking everything was all right just because he had been hearing but there's got to be a union with almighty god he measures more than just than a deliverance from sin it's to be united with him he delivered you so he could unite himself with you amen condom wonder mistaken in this hour this is what i'm talking about this is where the full mirror is in view he set aside he pulled down as it was the shades of his daily tasks words if we can break this down daniel evaluated things in his life that could be cut all right that's not necessary all right that right there is not necessary what did that understanding amen understanding by the books revelation doesn't make us more loose that's right right well by the same i've seen something that somebody's not your focus i know i'm speaking pretty plain but jesus christ is your focus don't you live your life and order your family based on somebody else you order your life by the word of god amen you have to have an absolute you have to have thus saith the lord not going along because well so-and-so did this so and so did that they are not your mirror your mirror is the living word of god that you get before you prostrate your fourth self before how do i do that you understand by the book this is the hour to be sure yes lord this is the hour see daniel brother baby says it like this in another place he says i think daniel i think daniel was reading the prophets before him i don't have this up there this is just what i have in i think daniel was reading the prophets before him and he had this kind of an understanding that he was near the end and he sought god to find out how close the end was he said then i think we're justified by seeing that we're at the end of the road now put on not sackcloth and ashes but throw off the things of the world and our cares of this life and seek god to find out what day of the year we're in because we see we're at the end and so the church will fast and pray and be ready brother braham goes into that same quote and he says you remember he said in years past i would just touch them 70 weeks and went right on by him he said because i didn't understand it he said but now is the time amen remember he told us that is a key juncture that message 70 weeks of daniel is a key juncture there with from the from the church ages and from the seals and breach and brother ram even goes into that on the seals again so i want to just say it in this way we we know that has to be a humility that our lives god requires humility is that right amen god will always humility and humility is as the scripture could say whoever exalts himself matthew 23 12 shall be a base and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore unto the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you now you know daniel goes through here and i'm not going to read all these verses i have them down but i just want to get to this point in daniel 9 9 daniel's praying this whole time he began to pray and make confessions daniel when you read this here in the scripture daniel is not looking at it in a manner of saying lord your people did evil your people but daniel said we lord us lord we lord same way in ezra chapter nine when ezra prays for intercessor he puts himself beneath the word not above the word ah no no no we have so in humility to the word because he's recognizing where we're at there's one way there's one way god has made a way out of this but the 70 years god just wasn't going to come down and get him by the hand and just pull him out the exodus out of there in 70 years was going to be a fulfillment of jeremiah 29 when you begin to seek me with all your heart amen then i'll be found of you there was a lot of stuff that it got between israel and god all right and god was sending his word to him but they weren't heeding it they heard it daniel goes through all of this but i want to just drop into these couple verses and just tie it up right here he says in verse 9 to the lord our god belong mercies and forgiveness that's true in it amen where would we be without the mercies and forgiveness of god that belongs to god though we have rebelled against him neither have we obeyed the voice of the lord our god to walk in his laws which he set before us by his servants the prophets you know there was confusion that came up in the church in galatia you had those that wanted to take the focus in galatia judaizers false brethren that came in there and one of them to start keeping feasts and festivals and everything else again and putting the people's faith on that and taking it away from the lord jesus christ that the miracles were not done by the law the miracles were done by the spirit of god the hearing of faith and paul could let him know jesus christ has been evidently set before your eyes in other words the gospel that i've preached it's not been word only but have been in power and demonstration the same god who sent me and ordained me from my mother's womb and called me to be a prophet i've yielded to his voice i've met him face to face and that same god has stood right there and reflected himself through the message that he gave me it's not my life this is his life i am only his they didn't ambassador israel come into this situation because they didn't obey the voice of the lord god sent him prophet after prophet you see what a prophet was a prophet is the mercy of god but also within when remember when mercy is rejected judgment comes it just depends on what happens see it was god's mercy the people's eyes would get clouded over they were looking at the law they were still going up and keeping the festivals isaiah once said god told them said your feasts your feasts have become a stink in my nostrils they were still doing orders but what it is they were failing to have a real examination in the word of god they were doing it out of tradition instead of being moved by inspiration amen brother say what should they have done i'll tell you what they should have done if they felt themselves getting stale when israel felt themselves getting stale felt themselves getting cold and god would send a prophet to reflect his presence down in their life and show up where is wrong the greatest thing they could do is say god forgive me for my sluffleness god forgive me for my stillness lord rekindle the fire in my life lord i've let things become too common and let things creep in lord i want you to recognize the word that you've given to me in that festival amen now look at it and say what's that amen he set before us by his servants the prophets now profit you just tie it with this a prophet is god's reflector prophets are reflectors there's things that they are they that god takes a prophet they are not made a prophet they're born a prophet right i'm going to say some things very straight here amen god's prophets are reflectors the reflector doesn't reflect itself it's out of god's only provided place of worship the reflector isn't the reflection right there has to be something strike the reflector to make it reflect so a prophet is a chosen vessel of god that cannot reflect nothing at all but he's in direct line with that reflection god to reflect the image of christ the word nothing else can do it now notice how he ties it together you are a reflector that's the reason the prophet had to eat the book that's the reason he had to eat the scroll he had to reflect the word for that age then he said enoch that was god's perfect reflector and type everything that god told enoch to do he did it he was a perfect reflector there can be things lacking in enoch's life but remember the very word enoch hebrews 11 was 11 4 11 5. enoch had a testimony the word enoch means dedicated dedicated had a testimony that's raptured dedicated dedicated to the word dedicated it's not just my efforts it's not my strength but god has brought me into the dedication by the fire of god and that fire has lit our life we are dedicated by the fire in the fire through the fire amen it's a separate thought we are dedicated amen it's eating the book remember revelations 10 8 through 11. right wouldn't there not have been there would not have been revelations 10 8 through 11 if there hadn't been in revelations 1 through 6. and you don't get from 6 to 8 without seven you can't skip around seven and say well i'm gonna get to eight and take the book can't work that way god has sent his word through his prophet his prophet the angel of the lord has come and there was a seventh angel on earth that was a reflector one who was set aside yielded to god that the image of christ not a piece of a mirror but the fullness of god could be reflected into the church of the living god that there might come a true examination for rapture amen the bride have made herself ready then she's got to look back there when they you know we've had weddings and things like that i mean those of you been married and thing you know even as you get mad you know you go in well you know you know anybody goes into the the bridal area where they're getting ready i mean they got oh well i mean there's mirrors everywhere they're looking everywhere you know everything near why the bride is looking in the mirror a lot of times the guys don't care they're happy they got their tie on they're happy they got that suit on hey man everything's good to go they're just you know whoa i can't wait man i can't and this and hear the bride she's in there checking everything over before she comes out of that room there's mirrors that's given to her i'm telling you that god in this hour he did not leave it up to a man or ecclesiastical system but god will feel his word and reflected his presence in this power that you and i can look into the mirror of god's word where the seals have come off and we're able to take an account amen [Music] i understand by the books i understand by the mirror where i'm at let me just say this you can have a mirror we've got mirrors in this church you got mirrors in your house but if you don't got no light that mirror ain't too good that's right i've walked back through that hallway closing out of an evening it's dark early or walked in early in the morning and that mirror is straight back there i can't see too much but i can see myself brother joy a little bit i kind of see an outline because if there's just at least a little bit of light that mirror will catch it is that right those you have it sometimes it helps you walk around your bathroom at night it'll kind of catch off of that mirror oh how much difference it is you got the mirror but when you can bring on full light when you bring on full light then that mirror what does it do it reflects the intensity and the degree of light in that hour it reflects so that you're able to see certain details i know i could go back to that mirror when i would walk in early in the morning or when i'm leaving at night and all these lights are off and i got to come out here i know i could walk out there brother carlos and say oh i need to zip this up here but if you had asked me to put a contact in no way buddy there ain't enough light there for me to see that you see god knew what we would need in this hour it would take not just a partial life not just a little bite the member of the bible said we've had enough light to see where people could join a church people could build hospitals people could do this but we're promised in this hour that when this day nor not but i will send light in the evening time amen i will send light for you that you can rise and shine and become a reflector amen hallelujah so i'm not reflecting my own life my life has come and my light came according to the promised word of this hour amen hallelujah glory glory be to god in the highest amendment it takes that of the light upon the mirror remember they've had the bible many people you could talk to they had the bible but without the light shining upon the mirror remember they can talk about it but brother brown tells us unveiling of god he said but it's no longer letter to us he said it's become light amen amen and amen made light it's your kind of light it's your kind of like the power packs within a transforming power it packs within it oh my you know hear the light of a candle stick he can come in because the the spirit of the lord searches the inward parts remember he can come in and bring conviction but what it'll point us to it points us to the source of light and that's the shekinah light amen oh lord have mercy hallelujah y'all okay amen praise the lord a reflector paul let it be known in second corinthians four this is not my light god has shined in our hearts amen the same god who shined by his word let there be light in the beginning that same god has shined his light into our life what was that light it's the word amen it's god it's his life and paul was saying it's not about us it's not us we're not preaching ourselves all right you know paul's saying i'm telling you my opinions what i'm telling you is what i've received from god are you hearing me now amen oh my you see we preach not ourselves we have this treasure this light this word this reflection in earthen vessels amen that the power of god may not may not be of us but it's of god brother brown would say in letting off the pressure he says i'm only trying to represent him reflect him like in a mirror to you making my life his mirror that he might reflect himself amen see god brings that of a prophet on the scene israel they get away from the word brother brown will tell us testimony but true witness voice of the sign and he'd let us know that what israel he said israel was still carrying around the law but they didn't have the word of the lord you see it's one thing to have the bible but it's another thing to have the word of the lord that's right is that right amen the word of the lord let me just say this the word of the lord is just more than books and tapes amen because brother adam lets us know very clearly he takes us into what the true evidence is of the holy ghost is those who could hear and not only would hear but would he to what that messenger is saying because in the holy ghost the bible said when he is come this is what he'll do he'll lead and guide you into all truth he opens our understanding it's him that makes known just like in a service like this today it becomes it's between him and you speaking lift to ear and you're looking in the mirror and you're looking around anybody else see this about me no it ain't for anybody else it's for you and god and as you'll see yourself in the mirror then what do i do just stoop down and say lord jesus lord help me lord god let that be in my life what do you do humble yourself look into the perfect law of liberty and continue therein amen and watch it'll change you amen because before change can take place there's got to be change inside of here when there's a desire and a longing for change inside of here you didn't put that there god put that there and what it is it's aligning with the word it's saying amen to the word even as the word is coming forth and you begin to agree with the word what do you find you'll find yourself in the presence of god you'll find that same pillar of fire you'll come right to where you're at and you'll be changed from glory unto glory you see a prophet the brown calls him a reflector brother brown tells it in this way he said but some hear this message and they put a carnal interpretation to it and it go off into sin now remember demas didn't go back out to nightclubs come on now amen brother brandon brings it on down and said demas was a spirit-filled man but spirit-filled where not in his soul he had it on his spirit come on now so he had under his shared understanding is that right judas shared understanding but we're talking about an understanding of life amen we're talking about an understanding of his presence and understanding that there is a complete transformation in this life that it's not i who live that's what i understand but it's christ who lives in me oh can you put this together put that together put this no but i know him who is the feast amen i know him where all that he just come out of can you just tell what i'm saying look let me tell you something everything that my wife is or or that i am to her when we're united all she is i'm a partaker of that she's a partaker of with me are you hearing me that's why when being united with jesus christ when you've been united with him he is the teacher he is the spirit of truth he will lead and guide you into all truth amen glory be to god this is what a prophet as the prophet comes to do brother braham said they who hear and he to that prophet will be blessed amen because brother branham puts it and i think about this i'm closing but i want to just i stopped there on that verse right there just feeling just drawn by the holy spirit this word was set before israel daniel was letting it be known the word was set before him it wasn't just that god was just giving him a letter but god in his mercy would set a prophet before him to do what bring reflection in their life so they could have reflection because remember you had false prophets shepherds it caused them in the old testament as well all they were interested in was their own selves they weren't interested in the souls of the people but god had prophets he had a man like micah or one think about it when micah came out there and he spoke to ahab he had said i don't want that guy preaching you know why i hate him what a thing to say you know why why do you hate him ahab because every time he preaches the presence of god comes down and i find myself under conviction but adaf that's what you need is an honest reflection that's what i want i want the holy ghost to come down i want them to bring conviction i want to see where my short areas are because every one of us in here we might have ourselves right here but once in the presence of god that mirror don't lie amen glory be to god in the highest aren't you glad for that this morning that the mirror don't lie mirror mirror on the wall who's the terrorist of them all amen [Music] glory be to god we're not snow white but we're the bride that has come up out of seven church ages oh my we're not spiritual gods but we have been grown up in the things of almighty god in this hour think of this statement in the message the rapture repeat it again the message the rapture brother brown takes that and he takes the text of psalms 27. we looked at that last week that david said one thing i've desired and that one thing i want to seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life and behold his beauty his character his fullness and inquire at his temple that's what i'm seeking for but david that's going to show up your shortcomings but that's what i need because whatever the word is speaking to me is the vitamins i need in order to get there i've been saying this for the last 15 minutes but a prophet brandon picks it up again he says this the latter messages the message the rapture and i've just been drawn to these these parts and meditation thinking about things things i see brother braham said a prophet is born a prophet they're not made a prophet a gift of prophecy in the church two or three judge that before the church receives it right but the exact words he said it just like this but nobody sets before a prophet are you hearing me nobody sets before prophet these are brother brahms opinions nobody sets before a prophet that's right are you hearing me nobody sets before prophet because he was absolutely the word of god he was that word in his day and you seen god reflect amen amen and the bride of jesus christ says amen to the word i want a complete i i don't want no you're not taking any mirror from me if you want to take a mirror away you can take a mirror away from yourself but you ain't taking it from me hallelujah this mirror has come with a complete reflection amen amen god did not call me i listen friends god's already vindicated this message he didn't call me nor any other minister to try to take statements and vindicate him god has vindicated his word already amen i'm caught up in this revelation this is not a man's thoughts if that's what a person thinks it's a man's thoughts you miss the revelation of what a prophet is amen come on friends a prophet has done saith the lord you may not understand some things that he says as far as to try to make sense of it but the greatest thing we can do is have good sense and say god in your time i place it here if it's something i need to know if it's something for right now he'll make ready for it but in the meantime i want to look in the mirror and see where my shortcomings are because i'm interested in getting out of here amen amen i'm talking about understanding the hour we're living in amen i understand by the books spoken word books without this message we wouldn't understand where we're at here in this book are you hearing me i'm gonna just say it's so bold like this the bible was written for right now are you hearing me all the way down through the scriptures there all of these things which have been hidden in tight of the coming of the lord and have prophesied of this hour it's the same holy spirit that is returned to the church of the living god like it did in luke 24 to walk with you and i and show himself in the word and show you and me ourselves in the word glory be to god that's what it means to be a friend of a prophet i said that's what it means to be a friend of a prophet amen amen so i say it very clearly to you as a church of the living god and i say it very clearly and there's a pastor we tune out all other voices amen any voice that wants to rise up and talk about opinions we tune it out amen amen amen are you hearing me friends we're nowhere we're at in this hour we're not caught up in that kind of stuff we're caught up to recognize in this hour they that knew that god shall do great exploits the wise shall understand in this hour god does things in simplicity amen brother brown would even say it like this he said god says things sometimes even throw people off unbangling of god all right you mean eat your flesh and blood how am i going to do this all right now if we're going to talk about when we just close see they had enough they had enough scripture they could have pinned jesus down this is why think back think back to what the holy spirit even spoke here which we believe this all along a joshua generation with an elohim revelation that the revelation itself prevails yes they have the written word before but it's the revelation that uncovers what the writing is and brings transformation amen brother samuel what are you saying i'm saying that i'll take his opinion job what do you think about ella who's opinion i'll take it cause [Applause] listen i want the word to show me where i'm short i want it to show up you know we all got mirrors we like i mean sometimes i like mirrors that make me look trim and you know and come on some of you don't look at me like that you like them too you like certain mirrors the way they you know we all got mirrors we like there's one mirror that we need we need that perfect reflection amen we didn't need a church member of the brian we we didn't need it we didn't need it it served its time pentecost on me or served the time baptist mayor served it we needed we needed the full mirror and that's why when the word is preached even right here we're not preaching a different gospel we're preaching the word that's been vindicated backed up and god's still moving with that same word because that word is him it's the angel of the lord in the camp of the host let's pray heavenly father lord jesus i pray father god here this morning lord as we look up with honest reflections upon the word of god looking in our own lives lord i thank you lord jesus for this message that you've sent to us oh there was light here that that's true what is your prophet would pick that up from the scripture in zechariah 14 7 but it was a dismal day there had been enough light to see certain things but lord god you promised in the evening time there shall be light light would come upon the word of god light would shine upon this world lord it would be your unfailing presence that would take the seeds of promise that have laid here within your word sown and ordained for this time and your presence would come and ripen those seeds from just seeds of wheat grain to me bring them forth as shoebread man manna as your prophet would refer to it over and over as that shoe bred manna that hidden manna it's shoe bread meaning bread of your face bread of your presence lord jesus [Music] help us lord [Music] help us that our eyes would be single lord we don't want to be people that come to church and we hear the word and we just we hear it and then we leave out of here and we forget or simply don't give key to or care to the things that we're seeing we want to be doers lord god as you spoke to us even over the past few weeks to be that of a doer lord does not mean that it's us in our own efforts trying to do something but you went on to tell us in your word if we'll look into that perfect law of liberty if we'll humble ourselves if we'll lord god give ourselves to you and pray over these things when understanding comes to our life lord we understand the hour that we're living in we see it [Music] the world is in such a a chaos such a time and yet it's it's not just that those things were prophesied to be but we we understand it not because of events that are taking place but we understand it by books we understand it by the inspiration of the almighty god the lord you have come to unfold and inspire your word to our hearts to inspire us to put us into motion lord god to draw from us like you did isaiah whoa am i a man of unclean lips you you sent your word that it might bring out of our lives a real confession that there might come forth a real cleansing because from that cleansing then will come a commission a consecrating of our life lord as daniel bowed his head and prayed and he sought you he sought your presence he began to pray as your prophet put it lord he began to pray lord is those setting aside the daily tasks there's things that david or daniel begin to just set aside begin to evaluate when he's recognizing as the understanding is coming to him oh god the more that we would understand lord really as we see more and more lord god it causes us lord god to lose sight of the things of this earth lord jesus the majority lord god of your children lord that i would speak to lord and stand here with lord god they're not out there running in the world but lord jesus there's things affairs of life [Music] and lord god sometimes they become entrapped ensnared in things that lord has creeped into their life where they can look at here this morning and look into the mirror of your word and say lord i realize i'm not what i was a year ago i'm not what i was two years ago lord god help me lord forgive me lord god i realize i drifted oh god thank you for your mercies lord lord god thank you for your mercies lord when your word would come to us lord and that mirror of the word would show us drift in our life sometimes lord it's drift where it gets caught up with the cares of life sometimes we drift lord god into wrong attitudes hurts feelings everything else lord god but father how we thank you for the mirror of the word lord and when we can just yield of ourselves lord god and look into that perfect law of liberty really humble ourselves like daniel did or jesus there's liberty there's a blessing the blessing of liberty the blessing oh god that accompanies humility to the word of god lord jesus we invite you lord father as we give ourselves to you lord we invite you lord we invite lord god that you would come and we as we lord god would lay ourselves down lord it's a dying to ourselves lord oh god there's things lord that i can see in the mirror or jesus even over times there's things that i could see lord god i want to be changed i want to be changed i don't want to forget lord there's things that even as we get closer to the of the way [Music] set just right available when i i'm looking and the light is fully on there might be what would show up an ink stick on that shirt in a small place lord god this is an hour where leaven is to be searched out it's an hour lord god we we want you to search us how many would join with me in that prayer like david search me oh god brother branham would take it in acts of the holy spirit search me the lord try me see if there be any wicked way in me lord take it out of me lord i don't want it there i got my hands up with you lord search me not just this service but each day not just waiting till i come to the service but each day of my life lord god lord jesus to give ourselves to you things that lord that need to be corrected in our life may we lord god accept the grace of god that comes the mercies of god to make those corrections lord grant it lord jesus help us lord i pray we want to have honest reflections in this hour honest reflections we want to say what the word says lord we realize that everything lord is the word's coming forth it starts with agreeing with the world when we begin to agree with that word oh my lord sometimes it takes the height off of us but help us because we realize that what we're agreeing with is the word that's there to change us lord god may you move change our hearts change our attitudes change our thoughts granted lord may we move with honest reflections in this hour i want to say thank you lord for the privilege your god of this this mirror the mirror of your word that your light is shining on lord with such brightness thank you lord lord we say thank you because lord we can see our shortcomings we can see those things but we know that lord those things that you're making known to us you want us to draw closer to you the bride she has made herself [Music] and to her was granted the final ending that fine linen which is the righteousness of the sins oh lord jesus may we lord god like like the bride may we lord take full full opportunity looking in the mirror and giving ourselves to you [Music] granted lord jesus in jesus name [Music] i look at this in the i look at this in the word looked at it even last week they had no idea was going to go in this direction here this week but i've looked at that with daniel of how when daniel that understanding broke daniel immediately began to go into prayer i think what a fitting time in this hour the time to really be in prayer we've got things to pray about oh yeah brother samuel this person's sick no i understand we've had that those are all requests but we've got things individually in our life and it's not just about us but there's things that god is making known to us and yes we god will lead us there's there's needs that we do pray about from one another we do pray with all that but don't limit your prayer to just request have fellowship with him talk to him what you're seeing what he's showing you in your word what he's showing in the word he doesn't do it to intimidate us are you hearing me now he doesn't do it to intimidate us he doesn't do it to say i see where you're feeling no no he doesn't do it that way he is a high priest who's touched by the feeling of our affirmations but he shows us these things in his word that you and i might give ourselves to him see what a blessing it is he could he couldn't show it to the rest of the world he couldn't do that you know what they don't want to see that i don't want to see that how many times you ever heard anybody you go to start talking or and you mean you don't have to say very much it's what it is is the character of life that's on display and they'll say no no don't go no don't go preaching at me i hadn't even said anything yet but you know what it is they don't want to see themselves in the mirror because when the mirror comes out it now becomes the responsibility of the beholder what will the beholder do with what they're seeing well i want to look into that perfect law of liberty we sing that song i want to turn up my praise i say turn up my prayer praying always praying always remember don't limit it to just the closet it's not just closing closet is a secret place you can be as it were in a closet walking right down the middle of target that's not all my prayer time you understand that i know sisters would be like praise god we can go down target no that's not all my prayer time but you understand you can have a moment and prayer with him at any time so don't limit it to tradition just always invite him you're welcome lord jesus will you go in here with me [Music] thank god for his mercy [Music] we want to be doers of the word we want to take that word over here let's stand if we could [Music] we want to take that word and live by that word pray over that word god bless it be the name of the lord [Music] this is [Music] yes i want to see you to see [Music] as we [Music] me i want to see [Music] i want to see what i want to see [Music] lord jesus open [Music] i want to see oh yes i want to see [Music] pour out your power [Music] oh [Music] i want to see to see [Music] pour out your power and love as we sing [Music] [Applause] yes [Music] yes [Music] lift it up in our lives don't you i want to see him in something that's his rightful place it's preeminence in our lives don't you love him oh i just appreciate him appreciate his mercy appreciate his goodness we're not gonna i'm not gonna keep you um in a little longer it was about a normal time we get out but tried to be mindful of snow but glad nobody went like this on me but i couldn't i couldn't the the the preacher came by but i was looking at but the preacher came by and just amen just be careful on the roads and let's just take the word of the lord with us remember god loves you he cares about you he sent his word in this hour to you and i he took the seals off so the mirror he would speak to you and i such clarity it's not there to condemn us but if we just give heed to him it changes it'll change it'll show up any shortcoming anything in our life it'll show if there's something lacking whatever you have need of don't turn away from it if you look in the mirror and the mirror says you need to go further and be born again don't turn keep looking into the mirror because it's the mirror that told you that and keep walking on into it if the mirror speaks and points this thing out in our life hey you're getting too entangled in this just heat to what the mirror is saying and say be it unto me just be simple that's what we want to be just just just simple just take what what the mirror is saying yes yes god bless you as you go amen be careful be safe on the roads out there may the lord just watch over [Music] my life [Music] we glorify [Music] yes [Music] is [Applause] [Music] in my own life [Music] glorified [Music] my [Music] glorified today in your church yes [Music] in your own church [Music]
