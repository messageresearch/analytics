level of God Lord to count those things that are not as though they are or God or granite Lord we ask it now father for your glory now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Matthew 26 we can go there we'll just begin reading we're gonna begin reading that verse 31 this morning verse 31 it says then saith Jesus unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night or it is written I will smite the Shepherd and the Sheep of the flock shall be scattered remember this is a very the Passover supper was a very intimate setting but this is already after Judas has departed so this is the shepherd speaking - not a mixed gathering but he's speaking to the Sheep I will smite the Shepherd and the Sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad but after I am risen again I will go before you into Galilee Peter answered and said unto him though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will I never be offended verse 34 jesus said unto Him verily I say unto thee this night before the crow thou shalt deny me thrice Peter said unto him though I should die with thee yet will I not deny thee likewise also said all the disciples may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I want to continue to minister to you this morning on that thought victory over discouragement we can see and realize that there's something here that the Lord Jesus had spoke and has ministered to them they don't understand it they don't understand what he's saying though through a great part of his ministry he makes these things known regarding his suffering he lets them know what's going to await and what's going to come about yet they don't understand it and even in the midst of this time where Peter as well as the rest of the disciples as it is said they made a death great declaration though all men will be offended because of you yet I will never be offended those were some mighty big words I think that we can agree together there's Peter was not just loosely speaking this this was of one who was of love you remember there is a progression through the walk with the Lord Jesus in the disciples there was three folds to that there was where he would regard them as servants and then and the unfolding of leading into this after Judas has departed now he begins to unfold to them I'm no longer gonna call you servants but I'm gonna call you friends they were they were accompanying him at that time a friend is one who's a companion but then after the resurrection is when that he would make known to them go tell my brethren so it was a continual unfolding of the relationship as it continued to move and you know when you you see this in the word of offended there's a lot of things that you and I do not know we do not understand but remember it's not our understanding that is faith faith as we said last week and look in the scriptures through faith we understand so it's not understanding and then having faith but it's faith itself that leads to understanding and the understanding isn't that we and ourselves would need to put all the P's and Q's together that is where that we and ourselves will frustrate ourselves trying to make things fit and you know brother Bantam laid that out you know in in just different parts you hear throughout all the message you see what has happened down through time were people trying to figure things out and I don't believe that people meant wrong trying to figure things out but I think there is a common thread and a principle that it brings us all back to we are not to be anxious about anything we're not to be anxious the Lord Jesus went through that Paul lays that out in the phrase be careful for nothing you don't need to be anxious about anything but you see waiting is not anxiousness waiting in hope hope meaning an expectation of what faith has revealed to your heart you look for that to come to pass and it's something that you're not pulled away from it's something you're able to move through your daily tasks your life and for a moment to moment you're looking for the fulfillment of that as a matter of fact brother Bannon would put it like this where he said believers these things are made known and revealed to believers he said believers then are on their toes waiting for these things to come to pass and realizing that it won't be our understanding that actually is able to grasp what's really happening it will take the same Lord God who spoke it to make us aware of what is taking place within that hour and there is many things that you know and I know as well it's the net it's not always things that we come to a place and say AHA that puts us in motion part of that is where we'll come to are I see it and it starts putting us in motion into what God would have for us and then there's other times where the Spirit of God will move on our life and actually put us in in motion and we don't feel it we don't feel spiritual with it it isn't some great aurora or all about it it's just we see it moving and here it is it's God Himself sovereignly moving in our life you say why does he do it that way because the whole part of Christianity and of the gospel the whole essence of the kingdom is complete trust in him it's not trusting in ourselves it's not trusting it's trusting completely in him and God allows situations based upon each and every one of us how our temperaments our makeups all those things God knows how to deal with each and every one of us I'm glad about that I'm glad that the formula for dealing with me isn't given to you and so forth I'm glad that it were in here sans because the whole goal is us coming to complete trust because when we can really see at Genesis 22 where the RAM Himself comes who was always you know as Abraham went there he comes on the scene and when you think down through time they had been looking for the RAM they stood on the promise that God had gave to them they came each one of these men and women brothers and sisters down through the Old Testament all of the elect ones they stood in the promise of the Lamb and the Bible says that they embrace these promises looking for a city whose builder and maker was gone you see where God had opened the word to them they would actually go to that place in the word by the sovereignty and leadership of Almighty God and they were there with expectation in their hearts the same way it was down through the church ages it's the same way even after the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ the disciple says is it now that you will restore the kingdom to Israel what did he tell him don't worry about it he says it's not for you to know the seasons which has been put in his hand you see brother man tells us the Lord Jesus did not even know his position at that time and even with the coming he said that would actually be revealed after he entered in to his meet at Oriel work what trust I could just preach on for that right there what trust you see everything with the life of the Lord Jesus he did not do everything by a knowledge it was by faith he knew who he was and as long as he walked in submission to that every fold and every part of his life every Junction it would be unfolded to him when it was necessary for him to know it oh my if we can walk and live with that kind of arrest to know that the same God as he moved there in the life of the Lord Jesus his son that's the same way that for each and every one of us has believers as sons and daughters of God as the Prophet would tell us in the indictment he said he is the example son of what God intends every son and daughter of God to be I believe that don't you and when I look at the scripture here there's many times as we said that we're things that we don't know you know we can't figure out and we'll get to looking at things and you know the worst thing that we can do is wander I'm not talking about meditating meditating is where you take a word a promise and you know it's true and there might be something you're looking at saying you know I just don't understand how all this comes together but you just put it before the Lord and you meditate about it and just wait for God to make it known to your heart but then there's other things when situations arise in our lives that you know you don't always know how things are gonna come out you don't always know the Hal or the wind everything's going to happen but it all comes back to trusting the Lord and yet here in the midst of this the Lord Jesus lets them know that all of you are gonna be offended because of me this night now this word offended which we read out of it last week in dealing with John the Baptist where brother BAM says he was kind of offended we look at this word offended in the way and the word itself it deals with something being a stumbling block or an impediment that actually would get in the way and so there's many parts and meanings to this this verse here and it was something if you'll notice and remember the member Peter when Peter himself had actually you know spoke these great words of what he was not going to do remember what the Lord Jesus told him I the scripture he said Peter I've already prayed for you and after you get the Holy Ghost after you're converted then strengthen your brethren but what did he pray for that your faith fail not he said well Peter end up denying him but his faith never failed it just had to come become quickened to the same faith that was dwelling in the life of the Lord Jesus you see there was this was not this offense this was not an offense like it was speaks of a stumbling stone where we look at that the Pharisees they looked at the Lord Jesus and said you're Beelzebub and where there were different ones that walk completely as Peter would pick up that scripture in disobedience to the word these these men right here these disciples though they did not understand what was taking place they were walking in obedience to all they knew and understood at that moment and what they understood he is the Christ he is the Messiah they walked fully in obedience to that you see God does not require from you what has not been revealed to you but what has been revealed to you then great is the requirement and the responsibility I believe that we ought to pray for Revelation but I believe with all of that as the Prophet would lay that out for us and praying for Revelation it comes with the desire to be drawn closer to the Lord that more of us might be consumed that more of him might be made known and reflected in US and through us it's a desire that the relationship would grow deeper and then more even more intimate I believe that's what revelation really is revelation is not knowledge of the scripture there's no prevailing power and knowledge but when revelation is taken hold though you yourself would may not be able to explain certain things but as the scripture says they that believe shall not be confounded and you know what there can be things where you can actually there can be things arguments and whatever more presented it's not because you can now argue somebody you can out prove them with scrip you know this and you know that that's not what we're talking about we're talking about an anchor that holds you even when you don't have the answer you have the answer that's what we're talking about here and so this this experience where the Lord Jesus is going through this were defended it actually is a word scandal II so which means scandalized that's that's what this word is scandalized and to scandalize is where someone is shocked or horrified but the actions that come out of somebody if it's shocked in the Lord Jesus let's say no you're going to be shocked there's gonna be it's this one is going to take place this night it's actually going to shock you but he one word the very next verse I love how the Lord does this this is all the way through the scriptures it's the same way in the israel's journey through the wilderness you'll watch it time and time again judgment and so forth will come out but then you'll notice what the next verse is in verse 33 but 32 but after I'm risen this has to happen but after I miss it I'm gonna go before you into Galilee they couldn't even see the scripture of verse 31 much less verse 32 but that was all right he would make it known to him when they had need of it you see this is where principals of Revelation when we look at it revelation itself is sovereignly given by God remember Jesus he said flesh and blood didn't reveal it unto you but my father which is in heaven so it is a sovereign supernatural act by Almighty God where God would impart an understanding or it would just be dropped in our heart and this is given direct and God can you see who he'll use the agency of man God can actually use the agency even within nature there's things that you can see but remember it's none of those things that actually within itself brings the revelation they are only elements and things that whereby God can use remember Apostle Paul tells us in the book of Romans that even all of creation in nature declares the Godhead so we can see the if we're sensitive enough as brotherman would tell us he says that God is in his creation God is in nature these things would be able to speak and express to you and I aren't you glad that you and I can look all around and it isn't just that we carry a Bible and the Bible speaks to us now that it's become open but you and I are our feeders of truth we are people of truth we can actually take in truth and be able to say thank you lord so Revelation itself I'll say it like this it's also given in the season to those who it's intended for it's given in the season you can't get ahead of the season I I know right now we're heading into a season that maybe some y'all don't like but boy I can't wait til there's more snow comes down here but at any rate yet has to come in its own season huh i never expected a snow storm in july i never expected one in august but i certainly was blessed and shouted a little bit when one and had a little bit of snow came in october than one day and some frost that's set outside but seasons themselves it's reserved things are reserved in seasons it's just like right now this time of the year right here in ohio we don't know if it's gonna ice if it's going to snow is there gonna be sunny is there gonna rain we don't know what's going to happen but yet we know in this season of all you know learned ohio anything can happen we know that so a season itself it's it it is a revelation is reserved for a season and it is given with the in purpose to guide those it's intended for it is the Spirit of Truth that reveals the the spirit of error and gives you as a believer dominion over the spirit of error because remember the spirit of error comes in very innocent the right and then it makes its ride all the way through once it's conceived it leads to death so that the Spirit of Truth gives dominion over the spirit of air even though those who live back there as the elect of God in their time and stood on that revelation though they themselves could not understand everything but it was the patience and faith of the saints that they could rest in what God had made himself known to them in that generation and though they did not see all things but they did see him in their day and they walked faithful to it the other part is that it will always revelation is revealed to us as we have need of it I'm not gonna ask you to raise your hand but I can testify my own life and I know you can as well that there's times there's things that you've you've looked at and you said I just don't quite understand that I don't see that maybe it's things that maybe you know someone has to let you know and you look at it I don't see that quite yet and you're just looking at it but you know when we place it there before the Lord to know that if I have if this is something that I need then God he's provided all I need then God will make me aware of this because he's not going to keep something from me that I need oh I think I brother branham stands there in that phrase as we have need of it programs say let the holy spirit come tonight Lord and land may he come and minister the word to the preacher and to the congregation revealing as we have need of it so it's as we have need of it you see because revelation is what is to put us in action if what has been revealed does not become vindicated in that life it's not been revealed you see it must revelation is given for that in might come preeminent in that life and then put the individual into action to wear what was spoken as a direct communication between God and them now becomes manifest here in this realm you see the lamb Abel offered up it wasn't something in a spiritual realm there had been a supernatural instruction that was given and it put him into motion Oh glory he heard the same preaching that Adam did he heard the same one that Cain you know Cain and him heard the same thing but what different is is that God was speaking directly to Abel God opened up what fruit was what blood was if it was open to him and Abel himself moved by revelation and that's why the scripture could say by faith see notice all of them scriptures come after as we read through faith we understand how did Abel understand he understood what God had revealed to him and he acted in obedience opponent he heard it he recognized it and he acted opponent you see it's also how that it requires it requires a mystery at selfless you know a mystery has many folds there's things that within the mystery even of the coming of the Lord has been one of those things that's been unfolded all the way down through the scriptures and yet it was reserved in this hour there are things that though many wanted to pry into they could not it's not because it wasn't that they weren't good men it could not be given until this time because it is in this hour when you and I would have need of it I thank God for that I'm glad that God is watching over his word this is where brother Bram would say that a mystery itself it requires the teaching of the spirit it's not something that's just a one-shot deal it requires the teaching of the Spirit it requires that God himself as we were saying last week God unfolds this mystery it requires him to do that or it never as brother Brent says never becomes clear so it all comes back to the Lord so now when we look at this here in John 6 my goodness in John 16 verse 28 here the disciples they said after as Jesus said I'd come forth from the father and I'll come into the world again I leave the world and go to the Father his disciples said to him know now speak us now plainly and speakest no proverb and now are we sure that thou knowest all things and need us not that any man should ask thee by this we believe that thou camest from God they didn't say we know all things they said we are sure thou knowest all things and they said by this we believe that thou camus from God you see this was not something that just ceased after he had asked him the question of who do men say that I am this continued to unfold remember brother brems tells us like this when the disciples were with Jesus he said it was kind of confusing for them he said because sometimes he said here was the son talking other times the father talking it was sometimes he said it was Jesus talking the man and then other times he said here it was his father that was dwelling within him but you see what was happening for them is an understanding that these that they are indeed one I and my father are one this was being unfolded to them and they believed now art come from God jesus answered them and said do you now believe indifferently sometimes Jesus answers my questions oh I love that you can come with the question and Jesus said I got a question for you well how lord I I'm the one I ask the question first but you see Jesus has a way of answering questions with questions verse 32 behold the hour cometh yay he's now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet I am NOT alone because the father is with me where is the Lord Jesus his confidence in the word this is his confidence it's a trust it's not he's not going to lose one of them but this is a necessary part they're going to be scattered there's coming this you shall every man to his own and you'll leave me alone yet I'm not alone because the father is with me these things have I spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world now notice this in mark chapter 8 verse 29 the Bible goes on here in this part which we would know even from Matthew chapter 16 and Jesus said unto them but whom say ye that I am and Peter answered and said unto him thou art the Christ and he charged them that they should tell no man of him and he began to teach them he began there's got to be a beginning of this unfolding now watch what'swhat's the beginning the beginning he begins to teach them that the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests and scribes and be killed and after three days rise again now I would say you and I were sitting there and we would not have been shouting and saying oh ma then that wonderful he's going to be rejected he's going to be offered up now even right now we do not shout and rejoice on that but there is something that touches our heart that knows that was necessary if that would not have happened you and I would not be here today there would not even need then the entrance there into that of eternal life and even the change of the body and this was necessary but you see even though he's beginning to teach and he's beginning to unfold even a mystery of his coming they do not understand it at this time it would seem like that these words are falling on deaf ears but they're not remember it's not a man that's sewing these words these words were already laid out all the way through the scriptures but right here it's the same God who inspired David and all the messianic Psalms it's the same God who had inspired the prophets before that would lay out this example of the Messiah all this was inspired now here it is the Living God taking his word that has already been sold once before and now has come to harvest within his life and he himself is standing here in a manner of former reign the same Holy Spirit the same God and he's letting him know this seed is going to be sown you ask them what does this mean we don't know what it means we don't understand what then what's being said here but you see their faith it was not based on their understanding it comes back they knew who he is and that's the same way it is with us as believers it's knowing who he is I'm not just talking about us one who died upon the cross but it's knowing that he is my Savior he is my Redeemer and I am his son and his daughter by way of the new birth it's very very very important that that would be unfolded to you and I now notice this when he had turned about verse 32 and Hiba spake that openly and Peter took him and began to rebuke him when he had turned wise Peter rebuking him it's Peters understanding it's Peters understanding that's how he's rebuking Oh God his understanding is causing him to rebuke the Lord Jesus but when he had turned about and looked on his disciples he rebuked Peter saying get thee behind me Satan the Jesus was not calling Peter Satan but you see Jesus was using discernment it was discernment that was given and that you think that what has been spoken when Peter began to rebuke him and saying man this shall not be Lord this is not going to happen this is not going to go you think that according to the flesh of the Lord Jesus you think his flesh wasn't tempted and pulled to go along with that it was known he prayed three times let this cup pass from me you think he wasn't tempted the Bible says he was tempted in all points such as we are when God became flesh it was not an act he was tempted in all points such as we are now for many of us how God has brought such a deliverance in our life and that by the new birth to where that you know things that were we once were tempted we're no longer tempted by but there is still within our life a personal contending with ourselves on a daily basis not only daily moments ours areas are contending with ourself and pulling ourself our thoughts in line and when I say our thoughts I'm saying things that would even come into our our pathway and we might be able to allow those things to dwell and then we have to bring that in submission in obedience to Christ and say get out of here Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ a constant battle but remember greater is He that is in you than he that's in the world it's one of these things the Lord Jesus could have taken this and said you know what Peter you don't want me to go you're my buddy you're my pal I'm not gonna go but he discerned greater than buddy pal brother sister he discerned the word you see the life of the Lord Jesus as an example to us as believers as mature believers is to discern everything not by my feelings not bhai life ile this feels good wait one day it'll fill it's not about feelings we do not walk by feelings we walk by faith if you don't walk by faith your feelings will change and feelings will come right around it's got to be faith that is the walk of the believer anything we do it is to be done in faith faith does not mean I know all the peace and QS there's many decisions that God has had me to make in my life even of one some recent years that I did not have all the peace and cues I do not understand it was totally against my way of looking at things but yet it was dry God's grace to be able to discern what his will was at that moment in time and listen if he did it for me he'd do the same thing for each and every one of you and no doubt each one of us can testify of how that God has moved in those different times discernment is not based on feelings it's like when you're praying about something how you feel about how feel good what should I do keep praying well I'm kind of feeling towards it what should I do keep praying and you know I'm quoting to you right whistlin Answers 54 how do we seek the will of the Lord in anything I started leaning towards it I feel I keep praying because what it has to be is you've got to have thus saith the Lord to be able to stand there when everything else comes your way because things will come your way every decision everything we make is either rock or sand every decision we make you love me get thee behind me Satan I'll tell you what I had been really hard wouldn't it I'll say yes for you yeah the Lord they said yes it would be hard for him get behind me Satan do you think Peter understood that he didn't understand the previous verse but here the Lord Jesus says for thou savourest not the things that be of God but the things that be of men it would seem harmless it isn't like Jesus was you know going to go out and commit some sin or whatever more know it was his obedience to the word what was his obedience to the word it was leading him to death for us it would have been easier to go according to how Satan was anointing Peter you see Satan had always come after Lord Jesus and tried to get him to abandon abort his mission he would come in him now you know you're hungry turned the stones in the bread he would learn him no I'll show you all the kingdoms of the world I'll give him to you if you only fall down and worship Me but Jesus notice jesus knew the Prophet tells us he was going to fall heir to the kingdoms of the world did he understand it he did not understand it but the Lord Jesus had faith in what the word had given for him to do in this hour and this time you realize when they said down knowest all things you realize what Jesus knowing all things he's standing presently in whom God has revealed himself to be and who he is and he's standing there in that present revelation with full authority you cannot stand in authority on future events that have not been revealed to you the only way you stand in authority is you're able to stand presently knowing who you are in the Lord Jesus Christ and when you know who you are you can have rest and peace to know that he who holds the future will unfold the future in his time and when it comes to the future then that will knowest all things in the future for the future right now it's present that's why Peter could say it's important to be established not in past not in future present truth establishment is more than just knowing about it it's actually being planted and actually having roots and fruit itself beginning to come forth from the life established life now notice this now savourest not the things which be of God but the things which be a man now I want to go on here in the message Shalom I love this sub R of the RAM places in here he says we said we noticed there was Judas the make believe or the unbeliever that waited till he found a fault then he turned to the disciples and said just the twelve and Judas was one of them he said you want to go - then Peter said who would we go - Lord you're the composer anybody ever heard a music composition composed a little differently from what you've ever heard it before I haven't am I'm sure probably most of you have but you see this sheet music here even though it was already written out before the foundation of the world and then inspiration dropped on the prophets of old and they were riding down these notes sometimes the writing down of the notes was just simply their lives expressing the notes right and here this is the sheet music that's being laid out in this hour but they do not know the next note they don't even know how to play the notes that's in front of them but that's okay they've got to wait for their part he's got to play his part and then they can get to their part Oh glory be to God you're the only one you know how it you know he says you know how what's going on you're the only one that has the word of life where could we turn to we couldn't go back to be a Pharisee or sad you see or Herodian or whatever it might be you're the one that has the word of life we have no other place to go we've joined ourselves to this great concert we are in here we're listening we're in the rhythm we believe that you are the son of God the manifested Jehovah were sure of this what was this thou art the manifested Jehovah we don't know what these great trials and troubles and afflictions and things and you saying you're going up to be offered up and all this and that the other and on the third day and all this stuff we don't understand that but we know this but we don't understand that but what's important is that you know this because if you know this soon and very soon you'll know that and you'll be able to say this is that oh ma but we're listening to God's Symphony we're a part of it we're waiting to see what takes place next were following clothes with you you catch this we're following clothes with you the lemon goes on in this here program will deal with this talk on the spiritual mind you remember Paul will even make a statement regarding the commandments that Paul was given by the Spirit of God for the Church of the Living God and Paul could say let a man he who is spiritual acknowledge that the things that I've given unto you are the commandments of the Lord but if you're not spiritual you can't acknowledge it but see spiritual isn't well a person they pray for the sick and they get well that's not what spiritual is spiritual means spirit-filled are you with me little man we'll go into this and deal with the spiritual mind and he deals with how think of this here were the disciples the Lord Jesus had called them from their fishing their tax collecting and everything else he had called him from the way that they were walking in the things that they were doing and here when he began to make manifest the the very promise in that hour it drew them away from where they were the things that they were doing that's the same way that he works and has worked in our lives and noticed when he comes to this place and you know he says I and my father are one the Bible tells us that many John six six six many of his disciples walked with him no more they went back to what listen now they went back to what they knew you know why their walk was not faith it was what I know and so what they knew is what they counted his faith that's not faith we do not walk by sight we walk by faith on through the Scriptures but we could just preach you know that this is the heart of it when the Hebrew children went into the fiery furnace they did not go in there knowing they were going to be delivered they did not know that but they knew their God we know this vow our Jehovah and belong to him we don't understand that but they walked faithfully fully in obedience and all how God showed up when they walk fully in obedience how God will test us he'll call us he draws us in times where we don't understand but it's to see will we fully trust him and walk in obedience or is it what I got to know the next step because if I don't know the next step Lord God I can't make a step oh but if you are ordained for the rapture he will bring that about within your life he'll cause that to increase in our life listen even in your very nature than might be in nature that has to have all the t's crossed all the eyes daughters got to be said with a certain vernacular and this has to be like that you know the same God will actually manifest his victory in overcoming your nature and my nature our temperaments that he himself the lamb the RAM might be glorified in the very change of the body were you and I can say by God's grace he overrode even my my own temperament think of how brother brandon talks about it if God be with us we're building miracles at the very last closing paragraph in prayer he said Oh Claud if there was anything this year that was done that was good in our life it's because you overrode our stubborn rebellion and you went ahead and performed it through our lives you say how did God work over stubborn rebellion it's the same God who moved the darkness that was covering the face of the deep he spoke his word and the Spirit of God went forth to cause a condition and a change to come about but the seeds he had already planted by his word might come forth as the spirit was brooding over it that's the same way in our life it is no glory that we have in ourselves that I brought forth the word I've done this no sir it has been him alone a sovereign work if you ask Sarah Sarah what did you do nothing as a matter of fact I laughed in God's face that's what I did but in the midst of the time there's something happened in me that the faith that my husband had it actually moved in my heart and I started judging him faithful and as a judged him faithful I received strength from l-fatiha down into my life and I was able to be ready for the Lord's visitation how'd you do it Sarah I didn't he and Sarah could say y'all read about my what my works were weren't you Sarah could say you you read about mountain the tests you read about the might of the wild man that was created right that fella still gives trouble today to Israel will glory don't worry Isaac your each meal gives you trouble too but Isaac is the one who the covenants with and the cabinet one has the authority over the other one who was born in permissive will the Calvin had won by the perfect will of God the brother Graham tells us like this the spiritual mind he says I can imagine the congregation walking away and they said this man expects us to be a cannibal eat somebody's flesh no he didn't think that at all that's what you thought that he thought they were they walked away not on his thoughts why went away cuz he said this no it's not why you went away you went away because of your thoughts of what he said it's not because they his word well if he hadn't no it's your thoughts it's not his word remember his wire there is a thought behind that word and that thought is life that thought is Jesus Christ doctors and medical stand doctors and medical doctors and so forth said the man is insane that's all there is the priest is right that man is crazy give us his body to eat that's all he said and about that time he just ended and said alright let's stand let's sing a song take the name of Jesus with you but you just got to the point he didn't need to go any further you see even though this was a great mystery that would be unfolded where that Paul himself later would be given access by the holy spirit not by Paul's will but by God's will when he can say I have received of the Lord I have received not I pried into I received of the Lord and Paul begins to unfold the Lord's Supper it was not unfolded in this season listen but it had to be spoken it's just like out here when they plan out winter wheat and things like and some of the rest of you live in Moore farm country they have to get them the seed in the ground at a certain time you cannot get the seed in the ground and all of expects all of a sudden expect to have a crop but if you're going to have a crop later on there's got to be a sowing time and it's not necessary you'll understand in the sowing time as far as what's being so come on now what's necessary is to understand who it is that's doing the selling because if you know who's doing the sowing you remember he that is sowing will bring forth that of his own kind and in due time he will manifest what he sold right so here this is why even the ministry in this last days as sowing the urgency that was going out a sowing that was going forth and many of the things you talked to different ones it's set right there when the seals were being opened and you hear it down through the message and he wouldn't even been that you had to hear from people who were there that could say I knew something great was going on but we didn't understand it at that time why not it wasn't time to understand but it was enough it was enough for the believers to know God's doing something what's he doing well we don't understand that but we know this you see this is where faith is I know this I don't understand that but I know this so then when we look at this he says that's all he said but the spiritual mind maybe they could not understand it those disciples they didn't know exactly what it meant but they believed it anyhow because where did it come from it come from the one they knowed to be the Son of God so why were they receiving it they knew it was God they knew it was the truth you weren't gonna move him from it I explained this to me I can't but I know it's the truth I might not be able to understand how I love this I may not be able to understand all that's in here but I believe it it's God's word I want to separate myself from anything that's contrary to it I've tried to stand like that now we realize that within this here at just said just beautiful things that you can look at it that rest itself it's not based on our understanding because our under with just the Aaron and our own understanding we can stumble if that's why our faith is that now you might say I kind of think this or I can't but I don't know nor do you know but it's when we rest in certain things and it don't happen according to how we think it's going to happen Oh Lord then it's like what's going on what's happening what's taking place I thought this great utopia I thought but their understanding was veiled you know is like somebody telling you how to drive a car and never drove a car remember they read and read the drivers manual you need to do this so many feet back here watch this year what is it that's wonderful but they just read the manual right did they they don't have an understanding by experience right it's just like with with anything else and understanding its Vail he is laying these scriptures concerning himself in suffering but yet they themselves their understanding is veiled to it why it's not their cup it's his cup he's got to drink his cup before they can drink their cup his suffering was his cut so we look at Matthew 26 verse 37 the principal coming out that we can only and we will only understand as the Spirit of God will reveal it in the season and in the time it wasn't necessary I've got to know no it wasn't necessary at that time they just walked on in faith verse 37 and he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be very sorrowful and very heavy then saith he unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry here and watch with me what's happening he's pouring out his soul unto death the pouring out of his soul did not take place just at Calvary he lived by the word and as it come to this time he's pouring out his soul it's a dying it's a giving forth it's a yielding of his life and he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying O my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me you know what he's praying for to dodge the cross those are the words the Prophet gives us he was praying to dodge the cross there wasn't that he didn't love the love the his father he did he was as obedient to the word but he's experiencing he knows what lays ahead of him this is not an act he cannot remember he cannot be made to go there if he's made to go there Satan would still have a claim I don't care if he's virgin born or not st. whenever claimed it said he did not go willingly so he's not the lamb because a lamb can be glad and remember Satan knows the word he was wearing like a lamb to the slaughter Satan could stand right there and say that's not him he's got to be willing what's going on right here it's the same thing within you and I when you've been born of the Spirit of God it's laying down our will for his will I tell you what when God is so moved within your life I tell you you come through that of the new birth you mature I'll tell you the greatest battle you look back and you look at things that God sanctifies you cleanse you and then it moves on the inside there are things that you go through and it's a contending with self it's what you know to be the word and remember obedience is not something that's easy obedience when obedience comes forth here is suffering that's involved and you learn obedience by the things you suffer things that you suffer and you go through that you don't understand what's taking place but yet you stand there and say lord I know you're in control Lord I know I belong to you what's happening learning obedience it's a price obedience isn't easy there's a cost Peter expert swordsman flips off the ear has the records there in John the Lord Jesus picks the back up puts it on I've always looked at that verse of scripture I thought was everybody else blind to what was going on I mean they just went around like business usual oh thank you appreciate that like some I hand you salt or pepper I mean here was a man no stitches his ear is put back on where they blind through it I don't know I don't know they were but then again maybe they weren't they could look at it with 20/20 vision say huh but they were blind to what was going on they were blind to who who it was it was their remember it Paul said if they would have known this prints of life they would not have crucified him remember what Paul said if the world he took all of those religious men and he identified that there where they were act was of the world even though they had the Judaic customs and everything else that was laid out but the way their heart was in it that heart though they could carry her out a Bible and have great priestly robes but Paul identified as Jesus did when Jesus said that you're full of dead men's bones Paul could look right back around and call it of the world if they would have known it they would not have crucified the Prince of life what was it it's the same spirit that motivated Cain to take Abel's life it's the same spirit that's worked all the way down through the Gentile world powers it's that same spirit that's moved right through that a Roman Catholic system it's that same spirit that works that has worked before but one of these days he's been lettuce it's going to be taking another way and then the mystery of iniquity is going to be fully revealed I'm glad it's been revealed but I'm glad I won't be here for the manifestation aren't you I'm glad I've got a token out of here oh it end about fear and about being around that I just my lover's coming back for me the lover of my souls come there that's what it's all about it's about it's not about all that right there because if God look at if God had ordained when we you and I look he even said in his word John 16:33 that be of good cheer for I have overcome the world in this world you shall have tribulation you and I have our tribulation I try I suffering right now we're being proved out what's being proved of faith that is laying on the inside that's been raised by the Lord Jesus Christ himself right now we're drinking our cup and you know what it's the same cup it's just now that cup has been passed to you and I remember the mother of the sons of Zebedee asking that OMA Jesus had mentioned shall I not drink this cup sure I've got to drink it see how much time I got let's go to Luke 24 I may have just cut it off here Luke 24 verse 1 let me just try to save just a little bit of time here and verse five those that he came to the Sepulcher says as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead he is not here but risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee notice word that's already been sung he's calling the attention to the word that's already been given saying the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again and they remembered his words it didn't say they didn't know his words they remembered him you see even to this time these words have been sown they didn't understand him still yet they don't understand them but they have faith in who he is right and they remember his words and returned from the sepulchre and told these things unto the eleven and to all the rest it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and other women that were with him which told these things unto the Apostles and their words seemed to them as idle tells and they believe them not how could they not believe them the veil of their understanding is still on it now it's being it's it's being opened but it's slowly he goes on to say then arose Peter and ran into the sepulchre and stooping down he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves and departed wandering in himself at that which was come to past do you see Peters faith was not overthrown the Lord Jesus had already prayed that his faith fail not he didn't know what was going on yes he did not him thrice but Peter you could not get that out of Peter what was already in him he wasn't born again yet but remember it was not natural man Peter looking at the Lord Jesus said thou art the Christ no it was that representation on the inside that spoke out at that time that was necessary do you realize that is what was necessary at that moment thou art the Christ and Peter ran he looks in and he's wondering he's wondering and what he's seen two of them that day same day they went through a village called Emmaus which was from Jerusalem about threescore fallings this should have been at Jerusalem this should have stayed at Jerusalem but the prophecy said the Shepherd is going to be smitten and the sheep is going to be scattered john 16:32 every man to his own you see at this time when they could not see the fulfillment and what was taking place they went back to what they knew but they didn't go back to the organization's you as me they went back Peter said I go fishing they were discouraged they were disheartened they had it seemed like a letdown and it's been instead of it they were going away from Jerusalem but the Lord Jesus isn't worried after I'm rinsing again I'm gonna go before you into Galilee do you realize he wasn't just talking about a person going before him in the Galilee he was speaking of the word that has been fulfilled he's going to lead you to the place you need to be not a feeling but the word will eat you and they went to Emmaus which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlings and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they commune together and reasoned Jesus himself drew near and went with him here was one thing that they were doing that was good remember said what they had about in the midst of all their disheartening in the midst of all their discouragement one thing that they had that was right was their conversation now you know Jesus wasn't going to show up on negative conversation hello somebody Jesus wasn't going to show up on that you said they were sad they were sad but they were still talking about him when they witnessed he indeed this is what he did everything they were still talking about him do you realize them talking about him caused him to draw near that's why the presence of God will always come where the word is being preached and the word is received he will come and draw near and make himself known according to the word he will answer questions he will dissolve doubts he will cast out Devils he will clean up the unclean he will sanctified but unclean he will fill up those that are empty and reveal those that are in need of an every feeling he will always come where he's welcome that's why it's important even when we are coming to the house of God then we're not coming lickety-split oh don't get quiet on me now when don't just show up as a dude it was time to go to church well we're coming here to hear from God it's important to you in your daily walk it's important to entertain him it's important to have him on your mind well I'll do when I get time no let him redeem the time and you can't redeem nothing without a sacrifice and in order to redeem it it can't just be any sacrifice the book of Malachi it said you're bringing me lame blind all these sacrifices it says you go offer the governor that sacrifice you see if you'll take that you're gonna preach with me see if he'll receive that but you want to bring that to the house of the Lord like when I'm my sacrifice God you just received it God won't receive no lame no blind no halt he only receives the sacrifice of himself and alive that is willing to surrender itself to him and let him be Lord one of the great signs of a believer is a sacrificial life and I'm not talking about taking fruit baskets to the poor anybody can do that that's religion I'm talking about a lot better set aside as a vessel of Honor that's been redeemed where the fire of God dwells in that vessel and makes his glory know through that life and that life works in harmony with Almighty God with the pulsation of his presence on the inside and when this presence is dwelling on the inside that vessel on the inside will reflect the glory of God that's down on the inside it are reflected as a chosen vessel that is not conformed to the world but it's transformed by the renewing of the mind and it actually will be a lot that will actually sacrifice its own will for his will this the Lord Jesus has drawn near to them talking with them they got the right conversation I believe this is what a a great portrayal for us I don't believe this is just Scripture we're reading I don't believe this scripture here is just Scripture that's being fulfilled in this hour I believe that this scripture right here is a daily expression that there are things that sometimes you cannot make the ends meet but you've got to trust him let me find a place in here to stop though we'll just go to squid today while they commune together and reasoned Jesus himself drew near and went with them he knows they don't understand he knows they don't understand but he's drawing near because he's the one the only one that can help them to understand and they understand the understanding is faith in who he is what he has fulfilled because what he has fulfilled is a necessary piece to what he's going to fulfill in them and through them must an the Bible says but their eyes were hoping that they should not know him there was a veil over their eyes they were looking at him it was not like comparing pictures like they put up missing persons and they tried to you know move in ahead by years and this is what they probably look like now no a veil was upon them their eyes their heart they didn't they didn't realize what had taken place and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk and are sad there's not one of us that has not experienced sadness disappointments discouragements it's not one if God Terry's no it's not maybe a positive thing but yet it's a reality we will experience sadness and discouragement but if we can apply what's taking place right here it'll give us victory when sadness comes what is that listen start thinking about him start talking about him maybe it's a song that comes to you that you start singing and it's about him and you'll find that his presence it'll draw near it doesn't mean that you'll understand it right then but his presence will draw near the whole time that he walked with them on the road he was opening the scriptures but it was until he was invited in that they knew it was him then they sell didn't own our hearts burn within us as he opened to us the scriptures along the way but you see they invited him about their conversation it's like things sometimes you maybe you've gone through certain things physically sometimes with the surgery whatever it might be other things that you go through maybe it's financial whatever it is but friends this is not this is not a self-help session this is reality David said when all the rest of them rose up at Z after zig lakh and they rose up to kill him his own people right around him David said he encouraged himself in the Lord he encouraged himself I think it's wonderful we can have encouragement from one another I believe that's what the scripture admonished us comfort you one another with these words but there are some times of things that we go through if you let your thoughts go and keep going and keep going and keep going you'll find yourself moving from sad to a very sad very low state what do I have to do just start thinking about him thank you Jesus are you wonderful you don't have to get up and you know recite a whole doxology and get up in prayer God don't want you to act he just want you to be who you are this is so simple it's so simple but what a formula that it is that lays here one of the great mysteries of redemption redemption itself is opening parts are being unfolded right here regarding Redemption Lord willing we'll go into it next week folds are being open that they don't even understand because Redemption itself comes in a three-fold manner and they themselves are not aware of any of the faults they don't understand it they say we thought he should be a redeemer they're wanting him to manifest the third fold of redemption but you can't he cannot do it without the first two folds they made manifest Lord willing will speak on the next weekend they don't know they're looking for these things they're sad but they just start talking about him anybody know I'm talking about times where you just say Lord I love you appreciate you thank you lord maybe some sort of a thought comes your way what I do say thank you lord I praise your Lord Lord how wonderful you are it's not mind over matter this is reality I want him to draw near and you find within that you might be busy in what you're doing having everything laid out before you in your job and doing this maybe I'm putting the biscuits in the oven or whatever it is that you're doing but you find his presence will draw right near and he'll just drop a little something in your heart say thank you Lord that means so much Lord but do you understand no I don't understand but I know it's him I've recognized his presence when he comes how did he'll make himself know what you love you this is victory over discouragement they don't know they don't know it isn't they have a formula Road out but what they do know see what it is something has grabbed ahold of them they didn't want to go back to tax collection they didn't want to go back to fishing but they didn't have a shepherd leadership to know what to do next but he told him after I'm risen alcohol before you I the Shepherd will come gather my sheep I will not leave you comfortless glory be to God let's pray or Jesus we love you Lord this morning father the depths needs or that we have Lord before us things that Lord that you don't look at and just say all that simple the father I'm so thankful you you help us Lord a great thing has taken place in the life of these disciples as far as an event they're not able to explain it they don't understand as a matter of fact as a fulfillment of Matthew 26 Lord that we read in the opening chapter they're offended they've stumbled there's been an impediment in the way but father as you gave the word you come right back around and you make known the word that has been sowed and that word was already sold it was laid out by the prophets all the way down then here was that word itself here came the wonderful filmin it's soda ghin the son of man shall suffer they didn't understand it Lord I believe Lord God this service and last service you're really trying to tell us something Lord not something that's so deep and profound that we don't already realize maybe but we just need to need it to become more more personal that it's not about what I understand Lord the phrase I took that Lord on a study and the message I don't understand oh my just to let alone all through the message Lord how the Prophet goes in to certain things saying I don't understand even when it comes into the message lean not to your own understanding he goes right through it Lord to me this is a comfort I believe it is to all of us Lord as a believer it shows you're working in our lives it's not about what I understand as far as in my mind it's to understand you Lord to know you like the disciple says we know this Howard the Christ as far as the trials the troubles the afflictions all these things as your prophet said all this stuff you're talking about we don't understand that but we know this father this morning if there is any Lord under the sound of my voice that doesn't know this by way of the new birth may they know this or they don't understand they live maybe can look Lord a pad of being born again and don't understand but lord may they little God have faith to know faith that's drawing them Lord to rest and say Lord I believe that you are my shepherd and I'm one of your sheep I believe Lord that this is for me Lord I believe in Lord God may that faith Lord God within him Lord it may not be this moment that they'll receive it it might be Lord God in some time today tomorrow whenever but they can stand up on that word Lord God by faith Lord Jesus and you will make it personal and real to them it will unfold itself in their life Granite Lloyd father lives Lord hearts Lord those of us Lord God that's been born again yet Lord many things in our life we don't understand many things we cannot explain what as you told us last week Lord through the quote some order the message that anything we can perfectly explain is no longer faith your profit goes on and on telling us that if we can understand it then we don't need faith faith is not something Lord God that is blind but faith itself is not the natural eyes of man faith is the eyes of God it's faith that moves in our heart that though we see not all things as yet but we are witness all things are under our feet Lord right here sitting in this building standing here right now believers lives and hearts Lord God that father you're molding and moving into things our Lord desiring to see and though Lord not seeing all things yet but father from that soul can say Lord you have freely given me all things I can believe you Brannen Lord I think of how your profit would place it over and over he's asking questions and answers on the seals do you know your name is there he said I don't know but I believe it's there believing is greater than knowing you O Lord God faith faith does not explain faith is not something of mental understanding faith is an expression of a life [Music] lord for each need right now Lord I pray father may our faith as believers Lord may it rest in you Lloyd Lord one of these days one of these days in a moment and at wrinkling twinkling of an eye [Music] will be changed your prophet tells us Lord in the Pergamon age that when we get on the other side he said revelation will still be unfolded in that time he told us in that moment in that same quote things that we have wondered not understood questions it'll be answered then Lord God has believers it shows we don't have to understand and know everything that's no longer believers we're believers because we believe and the reason we believe is because we're believers and we're believers because we believe help us Lord you prove your word by believers may we Lord God like these disciples invite you our conversations our thoughts then it would be a conversation that you'll draw near help us Lord if there be any negative talking help us Father forgive us the Lord God for those negative confessions coming out your prophet tells us that's the devil's language your heart I pray father Lord may we confess you for who you are [Music] Brennan or Jesus or in the precious name of Jesus Christ thank you lord thank you Jesus you love him blessed be the name of the Lord you know one of these mornings he's gonna draw now [Music] Enoch got closer to that place than what he was to home and that quickening power that was already upon Enochs life it just transported him right on into that presence remember when the Lord came on the scene down there in Genesis 18 where the RAM tells us what took place in the tent that morning he said was a fuss between Abraham and Sarah that morning he said what it was Sarah got to talking about some of the fashions and dresses that she just seen passed through in that Caravan but Abraham stood and said don't you get your eyes on those fashions on the things of the world he said what it was Sarah did not realize there was another Caravan that was on its way but you see what it was Abraham would not allow the fashion of the world to dominate his home in his life I'm not just talking about clothing and dress I'm talking about we don't go away and along with how the world is going we have a redeemer are you with me we don't talk like the world we don't think like the world it's to be as believers it's not just dressing we we don't want to dress like the world we should dress like believers but remember it's dressed not only here but it's dress in here as well because that daughter as it says in the Book of Psalms she is all glorious within and without so he turned away her thinking oh my things changed that day the caravan came it was different he true near I'm telling you one of these days it'll be the final day you get up for work it'll be the final you'll be paying one day it'll be the final tax bill your pain it'll be the final electric bill final gas bill it'll be the final why

it how did they labor the Prophet tells us right there in the Pergamon age right there where Satan's seat was that they labored all the more so souls were one right there underneath Satan's seat how did they do it they were living for the coming of the Lord how did they overcome in the photographer overcoming by living for his coming in the tremendous overcoming living for his coming that's
