Lord we need you Lord father how our hearts oh God just just Desiring Lord just to invite you Lord into this further part of the service Lord you're already here Lord there's a desire Lord in our

we are partakers Lord of that divine nature of the grace of God that has come to us Lord how thankful we are Lord may you come in a special way this morning I pray once again Lord that you would just have your preeminence and disservice for every need o God may you just come Among Us the Lord and just Lord May our hearts Lord be found to be open Lord to be receptive to you Lord the father I pray that may we just lay aside all of the cares of this life for we can do nothing about him right now and frankly Lord there's things that we have before us whether Lord in the spiritual realm or out of the natural we want your leadership Lord we want your Direction Lord and I pray that God that you'll move to every realm and every life oh God Just Have Your Way father that in all things you might receive glory to yourself Lord granted Lord we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen God bless you this morning man's certainly good to be in the house of the Lord amen and we just want to invite you to the word of the Lord and thank you musicians and song leaders I want to go into the scriptures here in the first John chapter 5. and verse 1. good to see good to see each one of you amen see some faces of Heaven I know some sickness and things that's been among us but uh so good to see you amen it's good to be together amen first John chapter 5 and verse 1. whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that began loveth him also that has begotten of him and by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments now this word keep is not expressing as though as they did it in the Old Testament where they did it in order to be righteous but this is expressing from a heart of reverence that moves by a righteousness inwardly to keep the word of God reverence it to observe it to look at it and just to be even when Lord I don't know exactly the step to make your how to do that but I'm captured right here Lead Me Lord and the next part is a very key to what we just said and his Commandments are not Grievous there's not one to to a real believer there's not one thing that's Grievous there's not one word that's offensive is that right verse 4. for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith I want to read that that one more time for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believer that Jesus is the son of God amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated we know that when we look here in the scripture I'd like to read a statement that brother Branham makes here in the message why Christ speak out of 63 and he's he's opening in prayer and I'd just like to just to really draw our attention into this here when we're preparing to speak on here this morning he said we're grateful for this time this morning and open to us by the Holy Spirit the contents of this word that we shall read May the Holy Spirit teach us today the things that we ought to know I say Amen to that and may we then in return listen closely to every word and weigh it deeply and then may those who are listening by the way of tape may they listen close and may we be able to catch what the holy spirit is trying to reveal to us for we realize if he should anoint us then the anointing is not in vain it's for a purpose that we might work to the good to the Lord and may our hearts and our understanding be open Lord may we have freedom to speak and freedom to hear and access to Faith to believe what we have heard as it comes from God's word that it might count up to us eternal life in the great day that is to come and bless us today Lord condemn us when we're wrong let us know the faults that we have and and bless us in the way that is right that we might know which way to go and how to act in this present world that we might bring honor in our living here to Jesus Christ who died to give us a life in the great Hereafter and we ask it in Jesus name amen and I want to draw our attention to this statement that brother random has made and just pondering this and he says what I just read for we realize if he should anoint us then the anointing is not in vain so the coming of the holy spirit is not in vain how could it be in vain if I don't receive what he is actually saying if I don't move within it then it passes right through but there's got to be something there to say oh God I my natural mind it's not in my natural mind but oh God let my heart be open Lord give me the understanding that I need to see the things that I need to see in the light of your word so then anointing is not in vain it's for a purpose that it might work to the good to the Lord and I want to just speak here this morning on anointed to serve his purpose when you think of that word purpose the word purpose itself common word to us and all the way through the scripture we find it that God God's purpose God's Eternal purpose and that's where that we are called according to his purpose and so when we look at this in the word the word very word purpose is the reason for which something is done or created or for which something exists so it's the very reason for why something is done or created or for which something exists brother Branham takes this here and the message faith is our Victory and he speaks of how that he says when we would be brought here upon this Earth how that it ought to be something that would cause us to reflect and to consider and ask God what he would have us to do see it's that's something that arises I I just I don't have all of these quotes up there because some I want to read and some I don't want just just follow me here it's something that arises in our hearts that when God as it begins to move in our life you know sometimes there when our lives can work around and you're you can be worn looking around what is my purpose for being here why am I here I think that's a very deep question I think it's a question that Satan would love to try to fulfill and try to answer and every time that Satan has tried to take things and then twist it to his own good or to what his interpretation is we see what it leads to it leads to death every single time and that's where we're at today but you know to ask what is the purpose that that I'm here the purpose of the coming and what is what am I here to fulfill and brother Brandon says it like this he says we but we seem to be just wanting to keep up with the world and the Bible said we cannot we that we can overcome the world but how do we do it not by keeping up with the Fashions of the world but the Bible said that faith is the victory that overcomes the world that's why and that's the whole principle that's where even where the fall came in Satan begin to come and anoint God's daughter with unbelief and that anointing was actually taking her away from the purpose of God and that that anointing as it was coming because it was unbelief is an anointing and it was coming to it to to anoint her in a measure to say well you see you see this here and look what God is keeping from you and she she yields she begins to yield to the voice then she begins to yield to every touch she begins to yield to all of those things and that is where that where the world stands today is to try to seek after other things as a source of comfort and there is no other source of comfort you can choose the in pink color and it'll be out next month and don't say that to be funny I say that and there's nothing wrong with liking certain colors but I'm just going to say it like this that if your satisfaction in life is over things of this life that is Satan's track our purpose is not to keep up with the world we're not of the world I don't plan on this is not I don't plan on staying here everything right I'm not of this world I'm in the world but I'm not out in the world we're kept by the power of God so there's a way to overcome the world so when we look at this brother REM gives an example here and you're familiar with it and he talks about when a bum had come to his door and he said this bug came to his door and asked him for a sandwich and brother Brian said well sure step on in and while brother random had him there in the home he asked him a question where did you come from and the man just Shrugged his shoulders nowhere what then where are you going and he stopped eating and he looked at me and he said nowhere and he swallowed a big old bite sir this is what he told the brother around him sir just wear my hats resting that's where I rest are you seeing here there's there's no sense of commitment there's no anchor there's no stability there's no ambition is that right how long have you been doing this oh some 20 years or more with no Ambitions to better himself so living that living that that form of a life and just wandering around now brother Branham will then parallel this and he says that's the way he says it looks many times with the attitude of the people he said what we call Drifters or floaters how many know what a floating piece of wood looks like we call it Driftwood right so brother Rahman is going to bring that in comparison of the sins it's just you know wherever it just wherever his hat and rest okay that's where I'm at for today and where I'm at here and and you know and so let me just say this not only is the man himself unstable but everybody else can see his instability is that right it's just like when you go to show up for a job and you've got a resume and you've got it loaded with jobs that you've man you've been and out of jobs and changed jobs like people change socks right I'll tell you what it says it says a lack of stability well you don't understand brother Samuel this child was like this and this job was like this I know it was everybody else's fault who we're preaching now it shows instability and it brings a question now I'm talking in the natural for the employer why would I want to invest training time training hours why because the past shows that even when adversity comes you've not had an anchor that holds you through adversity and so when adversity comes you freedom to the easiest place so he's talking about the attitude of the people and I'll tell you uh when we look at this he says floating and Driftwood and he says you know Driftwood and we've all seen this when you go down you know through the Black River you go many times you go into streams and and places Driftwood or wood like that it just it brother says it hangs up in any kind of trash it gets hung up in trash and it can't go no further it gets caught up with things of life he gets caught up in Gossip it gets caught up in trash come on Friends notice but he says it's like that he said in the Stream of life Driftwood hanging in every trash pile but everybody's seen a boat right so we got Driftwood we got a boat hello everybody's seen a boat right now don't go daydreaming and act like you're out there fishing for walleye right now now watch watch I know the boats that we look at and is they're mainly made out of you correct remember wrong fiberglaster am I right about that fiberglass who knows we hope they're made out of fiberglass but if the boat as it has even when brother bran was talking about it there that the boat itself is made out of wood says this boat notice it's made out of wood too so same wood but it's shaped out by a master who builds it and not only is it shaped out but it's Guided by a master and it's pushed by a power so that's the difference between Driftwood and a boat Driftwood has no control it just goes wherever the current of Life takes it yeah why it has there's nothing there to guide it there's nothing to control it and when it gets hung up in trash it has no power to get it out we're all made out of the same stuff so this is where it comes down there are no natural genes here better than one no we're all made out of the same stuff it just depends on how your Ambitions run and are you willing to let the master Craftsman make out of you that which he could use and that which he could control and that he could power but said you take this little certain craft it's been made different it's been crafted out by the Master's Hand and should it ever stick into some weeds along in Shallow Waters there is a power behind it a little bolt that the master can turn on and push it out in to the Deep Waters again what does it say there are obstacles in life that we will need a power behind there are trials that come our way and takes a resource of power from within to overcome there are Temptations around us but there must be a power in our life that we're not drifting here and drifting there and drifting here but it's a power that when we come into shallow times and shallow Waters but there's a power that'll move us into deep Waters again he said God wants to mold and make us what he wants us to be he said how can God do that when we won't stand still for him to do it we want to be our own Master we want to think our own way of thinking and he said many people who even come and they'll join a church and they don't even consider what does that church believe well I'm going to church you could be going to church and it'd be almost the same as going to a nightclub depends on what that church stands for is it because a Man packs a Bible to the pulpit does not mean it's the gospel are you hearing me the gospel is the power of God in demonstration that deals with your life that brings Jesus Christ from the sea that lifts the word from just a letter to a living reality what is that that is the sword of the Lord that goes down and deals with our lives for the word of God King not gospel came not in word only but through Power and demonstration and I don't put no knock on no church but when we're not just here as a member we're not just becoming you know we're not just coming we want to know what does it stand for right because what the church stands for I want to stand for not just floating and drifting because he said if we do that we'll never amount to anything and we got to think about it because one of these days we're going to be in the Valley of the Shadows of death no matter how young how old you are let me just say this the Rapture is upon us I'm not a News Junkie I'll just tell you that right now and even looking at a lot of times I'll stop that some some years ago out of I don't I just the thing what I'm saying though there's enough that you see even where the changing of the standard where the dollar is no longer held to be the standard for trade I'm telling you there's a lot of things that's already got those things but it ought to be a welcoming in our life and really examining by the spirit of God lord the hour that I'm living in it's not an hour to be a casual church member it's an hour to be on fire it's an hour to really shirk God let me tell you the Rapture is not going to come to Rapture knowledge I know the Rapture is coming to Rapture the raptured it'll be a sad day one of these days when lives come in like look and walk into this parking lot and maybe you come in the same late time you always do and you realize where all the cars at nobody notified me we weren't going to have a meeting brother Sammy don't you believe everybody's going I preach and I was extreme I call out that everybody's going to make it but you every Bible said the Bible said let a man work out his own salvation with fear and trembling I can't take nobody there but there's a gospel there's a life there's a token that's here there's a blood that's here that can set you free and give you faith and bring delivered you in your life but you've got to want it [Applause] you talking about torment showing up to them doors and all of a sudden the thought strikes oh Lord it was a rapture and you missed it right it really behooves us to contemplate those things you'll either meet him as a masterpiece I want you to think how brother Brown said you either meet him as a masterpiece that he has worked on or a floating piece of driftwood to go into your final destination and I like how brother Brown says this right here so don't use this life you ever think about that our life is what's entrusted to us to use how are we going to use it such when I've stood to what our young people told countless other young people that have stood and ministered to your life is like funds that God has entrusted to you you can either waste it use it or invest it nobody in here that's that's a choice and they're not just young people it's all of it I think that's what it comes down to that even as We Gather here in services and we're Gathering into this moment don't just use this life to drift around float around get a better job dress better get a new television I hope we ain't getting new televisions but then again if we take the television out there some people lose vision altogether whoo preach brother Samuel oh brother let me tell you whatever you feed on affects you whatever you feed on affects you and there is avenues that all of that comes through Avenues oh I know I know we want to sanctify it or a better car life means more than that don't try to use it to say well if the rest of them join church I will too over to the salmon this is you're preaching domestic Believers I know that this is a message two message Believers this was a message preached at Branham Tabernacle all right straight is the gate now is the way and few there be that find it I tell your brother REM said that he saved to speaks to us of how but out of every generation there's only a few now remember each day there is an ending to a generation and how few of that is now you know to a real believer as we're talking about their faith on Thursday night it's not something that I'm worried about that I'm unsettled about I know in whom I have believed there is a witness in my heart and in my life it's not what I say my life says it all right are you with me broad is the way that leads to destruction and many that go therein we've got to have a purpose of something we've got to have a purpose something some reason I don't think anybody I don't think anybody wants to be known as driftwood where you just float around I mean you might anchor down a job for years on end but you floated in your spiritual life that's right you've drifted around drifted from here to there let me just tell you something friends I'm gonna be very honest a lot of times where people are calling and saying they need I need to change churches the reality is them many times they need to get the Holy Ghost they need to meet God because this changing Church ain't gonna do it now it's different than somebody not preaching the word but friends I I just don't see that I I'm looking at situation because you say why I have heard it I have seen it I've had it said to me and what is my response you need to get the Holy Ghost because if you don't get the Holy Ghost you'll be the same way wherever you go you gotta see that it's not a building that changes you it's not a man that changes you you've got to meet God for yourself you can't live under an anointing that comes from preaching and just live under an anointing from a service the anointing I'm talking about is the anointing of the word which is the holy ghost coming to the seed of God but the man talks about in days gone by he said how many times he said man the command would come to God he had a purpose of doing it he said now here's the question he asked is your purpose just to drift with that congregation or is it to look up towards God I ask you what's your purpose here to drift with the congregation or is it to look up to God this is personal this is personal it's not me following somebody else it's between you and God that's how important that is the rapture is between you and God the token is between you and God think about Daniel Brethren takes this up right here I know I'm taking some time but I'm laying this in Daniel was down in Babylon and remember Daniel himself he purposed in his heart that's what the Bible said that no matter what they did to him he wasn't going to defile himself with a Babylonian sin and brother Ram said if we had more Gallant men like that that would purpose in your heart I am a Christian I'm going to find out every divine blessing that belongs to me so in other words I'm not preaching a socialistic Jesus that blessings just show up in the mailbox who but tell me what are you doing I'm having to address because that Spirit wants to affect even people's thinking as though well I said under a Ministry I come to church we're not entitled to anything we have rights but we have to take those rights and recognize what they belong to us and battle through every force of hell every demon that would want to try to keep us from it and remove every Spirit over on our inheritance amen I want to find out every divine blessing that belongs to me want to know what belongs to me listen to this and claim it if the Bible teaches that I can receive the Holy Spirit I'm going to stay on my knees till God gives me the Holy Spirit and just not drift Hebrews 11 1. I think what I said before about churches I think that's I think that's pretty self-explanatory I friends I understand there's some situations but I think there's also things too you know I might have been born in 75 but it wasn't just yesterday why would you say that for for if a person or individual why would you say of that right there because friends if we don't come to a realization of what's really needed yes then things continue on right you move out of one house into another house the house ain't the problem it's what's in the house now let's look at this here because with the purpose in order to serve this purpose we're talking about the anointing that's come to serve that purpose and that anointing is Faith now let's look at this in Hebrews 11 1 faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of Things Not Seen faith is real for by it the elders obtained a good report now think of this the elders even those that were wrote here in God's Hall of Fame were by Faith by Faith by faith and by it they obtained a good report so God had a purpose for Abel God had a purpose for Noah but they were unable to obtain it without faith so there's only one thing that'll put purpose to work is faith right and there's only one that can build that faith and bring that Faith to what we're speaking of to where it becomes substance where it becomes evidence and that is God himself in other words taking Driftwood and hollowing it out and then shaping it and making it a vessel that he can ride in and there is power to guide it through the streams of life through faith not by revelation we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God did it all happen at once no but day by day Moment by moment is that right so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear that is such a precious precious law right there that that things that that are to be made manifest do not come from things we've seen in other words change that we want to see out here in this realm does not come from an outside Source it comes from an unseen Source it comes from an invisible God and there's no other way other than by the spoken word of almighty God that is the original life that's the original way God said let there be light and there was light God's way and God speaks and then the word comes into manifestation through faith we understand that the word is made manifest and becomes material verse 6 of Hebrews 11 without faith it is impossible somebody say impossible to please him this word impossible means without strength to be impotent powerless weakly disabled unable to be done without faith we're without strength so now we're seeing that this faith is a faith that has a power in it it has power it has life it's not weak it's not disabled it's not impotent it's not without it's not or without strength so the only thing you can be talking about this faith it has to be talking about God that's what we're talking about here we all we all have human Faith I'll get to that in a moment we all have that but this right here that we're talking about is not human Faith this is God's Divine faith is that right we can go by human Faith a long time but will never satisfy the purpose of God by human faith alone it'll take Divine faith stepping down behind our faith well brother Samuel said that faith is the victory that overcometh the world this is the victory the overcometh world even our faith right and Jesus Christ is overcoming through you you're an overcomer but how are you an overcomer how am I an overcomer we are Overcoming By the blood of the Lamb because it is his life that is living through us it's not I or You who is overcoming of ourselves not him that will it nor runeth but God that showeth Mercy it is God on the inside it is the Overcomer of the holy spirit inside and working in our life so when it says even our faith it's not speaking of our human faith alone it is speaking of God's faith motivating Our Lives notice without faith it's impossible to please God for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him I want to know what all that God has for me I want to search it out if it's too high for me to get to then let me get a spiritual ladder and get to it are you hearing me now I can try to stand on my tiptoes and get to it I know some people here you've never seen the top refrigerator I understand that but let me tell you something there's there's some places in God that we're not going to be able to get to by just standing on our feet we're not even going to be able to get toe and see it well brother Sammy I need a ladder well well I'll tell you how the latter is we're the only way up is the way down is when we humble ourselves in the presence of almighty God where our heart comes in humility and says search me out oh God that promise belongs to me I want that promised Lord that belongs to me so if there's anything in me that's hindering me from ascending to those Heights coming out of my life Lord what is it that's a gallon man that's a gallon woman that's purpose everything that God has for me I want it Now watch how important this faith is brother Brown would say it like this and the message by faith Moses he talks about how that science has come in to explain away God's word that ain't nothing new the devil wanted to do that back in the days of Noah they could shoot the moon and they could prove there ain't no water up there true come on friend the Bible how many I'm quoting the Bible the Bible said there ain't nothing new Under the Sun is that right sometimes we think that all of a sudden we've come to oh we've become so smart in this generation listen this generation is only a reproducing of the generation as it was in the days of Noah and as it was in the days of life you say why would God identify those two because within that lot had to come out and Noah went in so in order in this generation there is a power and a Grace that is given to call you and I out of the world and take us into Christ that's the revealing of the son of man that calls us out of the world and takes us into Christ under the shed blood of the Lamb to where a man or a woman can no longer be the same but they've been chainsaw glory be to God by the spirit of almighty God if we ever lose this great faith brother Ram keeps going with this statement let me just read to you some of the things he talks about if we ever lose this great faith now you're talking about this Faith Of God being among the church talking about faith being among the people of God if we ever lose this great faith then we are totally in darkness he goes on to say if we lose this faith we'll never get a prayer answered by God we don't know if it's a scripture if our heart condemneth God is greater than our heart if we lose this faith if we lose this reality because when we pray prayer is not I hope it happens for the same here what is he and that that seems like what I've got then let me tell you something the problem is what is there that's causing you not to have faith in the promise you're approaching open brother Samuel I just don't got the Holy Ghost yet but you have faith but you're allowing things in your life to keep it covered up and covered over and Satan's doing that to bind you up so your faith can't be let loose in the right way you might be asking God for things but are you asking in faith are you asking in Hope because if you're asking hope it'll never be answered the Bible said let a man asking faith is that right so there's never there's no way to please God Only by faith if we lose Faith we'll never get prayer answered by God our prayers he goes on to say our prayers are annulled and we don't get nowhere if we lose Faith all hopes are gone if we lose faith all our spiritual reality is gone if we lose faith we lose our Glory that's how important faith is right so faith is our Glory faith is our assurance faith is our connection to God right these senses are the connection to this Earth but Faith was the sense that man was given by God that he might contact his Heavenly Father oh my so if we get away from Faith then what do we have all we have is intellectual realm where we're explaining this and explaining that and going through this and it all becomes human inspiration is that right but real inspiration comes by doing the will of God whether he said it's just one or just a handful whether it's a big church or a small Church it don't matter whether he's great eloquent speaker or just a man that hardly knows his ABC they don't matter it depends on the message he's bringing whether it's inspired by the word of God or is it inspired by intellectual conceptions of human inspiration he said it's only through God's Everlasting Eternal blessed word can we receive inspiration that's given by the Holy Ghost and by faith we receive it so God's sins true gifts to make himself known to his people is that right he makes him something on the Bible said there are ministering Spirits angels that are sent for Messengers come on it ain't just talking of the seven why are you hearing me now it ain't just even talking up a faithful Ministry the prophet brings it in the Hebrew series and he's saying when you have been born again of the spirit of God the Covenant keeping God then you too are an angel messenger of the Covenant because you are a witness of the Covenant keeping God hallelujah not just what you say but your life speaks so loud amen oh glory be to God God sends those because remember he promised and he said a little while the world will see me no more but you'll see me remember they asked him a question how is the world not going to see you but we're going to see you and he was speaking I'm going to leave as far as the Corporal body is departing from this realm but I have to go and make a way that the life that is within me might come back in you and then you will see me how will I see you you'll see me through the keeping and confirming of the promise of my word it will just be an outside event but it will be an inside event me keeping my promise will bring you in to that place of Refuge oh glory be to God that's how we see him that's how we know how do we know that we've seen him the Bible tells us in first John chapter 3 he was manifested to take away the sin of the world and if we are still living in sin then we have not seen him faith I say like this faith is a necessity it's the lifeline of the Church of the Living God you take Faith away we're in trouble faith is not what you can explain we understand by faith the world's refrained not by a textbook not by a video clip It Is by Revelation Amen to our understanding is not by our intellect right but Faith let me just say it like this is the sense given by God his grace that's given to us in Romans 5 verse 1 and 2 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God now notice by whom we have access by faith in Galatians 3 2 remember Paul is dealing with a group of Believers here and they are are being pulled back into that order trying to pull them back into a law but he said I would ask you this question received you the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of faith for by in Ephesians 2 8 for by grace are you saved through faith and not of yourselves it is the gift of God so how do we receive faith it comes by the grace of God amen Romans 12 3 the Bible would say Paul talking about the grace that's given to him last part of the scripture but every man thinks soberly according has God hath dealt to every man The Measure of Faith now I'm not talking about a human Faith we're talking about God's faith Galatians 2 20 I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who left me and gave himself for me so without faith God's faith it's impossible to please God so God the senses that God has given us these natural senses they help us here we contact our Earthly our Earthly realm the seed taste still smell here so forth but to understand that the senses that God God never intended that these senses would be the dominating part of our life but God intended what he had back there with Adam the fellowship that they had back there where God was there with them and they were in perfect Unity what was that Fellowship they had the prophet tells us in the message Oneness they had God's image inside of them is that right they were in perfect Fellowship God was dwelling there he was veiled in their lives now to think of it like this that sense that God gives you and I this what we just read about where it comes by grace that is what the prophet would call the super sense The Sixth Sense or he would call it faith and you see this is how he says it he said if you were given this Sixth Sense and it only belongs to the Christian and you cannot have this Sixth Sense until you become a Christian now I didn't say you didn't have faith but he's saying we don't have that sick sense or there's not been an activation until we have become a Christian so then we're only limited by our reasonings and all these other Realms out here but once a man has been born again by the spirit of almighty God remember Jesus said except the man be born again he cannot even see the kingdom of God is that right he only sees it as a church only sees it as a gathering of people what is it just drifting around if it's just in that way but when a man can say I know there's something real I know there's something that's touching my heart what is that that might be a life that's drifting but there's something on the inside that's saying I know there's one here there's something that tells me I don't have to stay the way that I have there's one who's here that's able to anoint the purpose that's in my life Hallelujah who's given that energy it ain't the music it ain't the preacher it's the Holy Spirit the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost there's only one thing that'll Inspire the believer and that is the Holy Ghost and when he comes he doesn't take us away from the word that would be counter-intuitive he takes us in the word because he is the word and you can't have this Sixth Sense until you become a Christian and that's the only way you can have any more than the financial senses that you've got now think about it that faith is given he gives eyes to the believer it's an experience by the grace of God that comes to us to anoint our faith and I want to just narrow this down here recalling we have human faith Peter let me just use this example where we have it before I move on Peter had human faith all the disciples had faith even when Peter it erupted from within him Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God what was that that was the representation that lay in there awaiting the quickening fully into the promise that's why there's quickening after quickening after quickening but it had not been transformed are you hearing me Peter said I know that thou art the Christ right just like like a person can say I know this is the truth I know this is absolutely the truth okay that and I that that there's a start you've got to believe remember you've got to have see something to be an absolute that you know what nothing else is worth seeking after right the message is not a collection of ideas it's the person of Jesus Christ is that right now I want to say this to you right here here we have it Peter had a human faith and when things didn't go the way human that Peter thought they ought to go well Peter all of a sudden cussing walking around naked and come on you know the scripture is that right he just he just because there wasn't nothing to hold him oh come on now but Jesus said like this he said Peter I have prayed for thee that thy faith failed not what is he saying until your faith can get into the right place he couldn't let him know I've got to go away and fulfill this prayer Peter didn't understand that Peter didn't understand the sacrifice has got to be offered up and it's got to be presented before the Holy Ghost can come back he didn't understand that but Jesus said I pray that thy faith fell not let me tell you something right now this morning you ought to take that to the bank I don't care how Wayward you've been I don't care how wondering you've been let me tell you something there is one who prayed for you and that was almighty God it was interceded you say when did that intercession take place before the foundation of the world when the names were wrote in the Lamb's Book of Life when he put his name in the book he wrote your name Hallelujah [Applause] then that reveals the revealing of the word is the revealing of the intercession of Christ it's the revealing of the inner tale atonement it's the revealing of who you always were I prayed that your faith fell not now I know we could look at Peter and we could look at her and say I don't know I don't know what I'm saying that's a steep one right there because it sure looks like his faith failed well he couldn't it didn't fail to wear it completely when you read this here in the scriptures of what it is where it just completely just throws it all away now let me just can we just take one example here this morning I want you to watch God's grace because I'm certain that no doubt every one of us can identify at some point in time in your life whether today or in the past with Peter and then with one I'm getting ready to talk about right now and what I want you to look at is we're talking about to be an anointed to serve his purpose I want you to watch the unfolding of God's grace that comes down can you earn Grace let me ask that again can you earn Grace no it's unmerited favor tell me what Rahab did to deserve Grace unmerited favor we could go on and on but I think this is enough to leave it in that place well I want you to watch how Grace comes to claim and Inspire faith for one to arise and begin to claim their god-given privileges the right and their purpose here's a man by the name of Moses I when I look here in the scriptures in Exodus chapter 3 the Bible said that Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even the Horeb and the age of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the Bush and he looked in behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great side while the bush is burned and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God Called to him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I and he said draw not and I hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place we're on thy standeth is Holy Ground moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God here was a man that had walked this same old path he had been this path he had walked it day after day I don't know how often it was maybe it was day after day maybe it was monthly by month I don't know but it was a familiar pathway he knew it real well he had a great understanding of this pathway but in this morning he catches sight of a bush that's on fire and it's not being consumed here's a supernatural breaks out you understand why we need the supernatural because human intellect is not good enough this message left to human intellect is death [Music] come on now I'm getting the scripture the Bible said that without that and Paul refers to it without the spirit of God it is nothing but a dead letter but this word was meant to live and it was meant to live behind flesh it was meant to walk in flesh Hallelujah you're the Tabernacle that God wants to dwell in [Applause] God wants to work through you're the vessel that God wants to use and the supernatural comes by and Moses looking upon it and you know he realizes in his self I like how brother Brian just puts it he said he had been a bitter failure think of that he knew that God was the one was going to deliver the children of Israel he could talk to you he knew the promise yet he tried to do it within himself 40 years before that and it became a failure and had lost all the vision of Victory and of freedom for the people enslaved I wonder setting here this morning is there one is there some that's well I've tried but you've lost all Vision in other words you can't even have anything before you it seems like there's no glimpse of Victory or a feed of freedom here was a man in the same condition a man that God would use this ministry and it would be a Ministry that would be a type of the ministry of Christ and yet here he was in a place as a bitter failure he had lost all vision of Victory and freedom I can guarantee you when you got around Moses all Moses could talk about was sheep all he could talk about was the things in this life because it became uncomfortable to talk about the things of God who made him that way wow who made it that way you see his own efforts and failure failed attempts after attempt after attempt it had brought such a bitterness to where he was a bitter failure not bitter against God but in his own self so that bitterness it would affect him to where he had lost all vision of victory of freedom I may know what I'm talking about and to see how that God had promised to deliver the church but I want you to look at this and I want to just bring this here to you look at what Grace that comes to Moses he's lost Vision he's lost freedom but somewhere down there inside of him is still that faith that God had deposited are you at least somewhere down down inside of there is still that Faith oh a bitter failure in his own eyes but can you see God had to allow him to get to that place and God allow us to get to that place listen friends even in our Christian walk with God we do not become independent there is not everything we're going to speak to everything and everything's going to move out of the way there are times that we have to pray we have to pray and we'll be doing cranking up the engine that's behind us here it is we're cranking up the motor well I've been prayed for I'm still caught right here what do I do I keep praying and I hold on to God I see God anoint the man of God anoint the word of God anoint my vision Lord I do not want to become a person without a vision of freedom without a vision a victory because where there is no vision the people perish God anoint me Lord Jesus anoint my eyes anoint my understanding here is this faith that is there within him and God speaks to him let me just read this to you how to why Christ speak I want you to catch this here was this great gift of faith brother Graham says Moses said he was anointed in commissioned at the burning bush to deliver God's people what great qualities this man had now this is before the anointing ever came he had these great qualities he was born for a certain thing God had a purpose in it and God has got a purpose of you being here if you can only to that place how much trouble you saved God and yourself too let me just say this friends you're never going to be able to try to sort through and undo every little thing and this and that listen there's decisions that have been made that you will have to live with those decisions are you hearing me well what can I do you can receive the grace of God that's coming to you remember remember it's us the reason we are in many times the shape we're in is because we have went by our own devices we've got a call we fill a pool to serve God but we try to do it in our own way and this is why we have caused so much trouble for ourselves and also for God cause trouble for God he's the almighty God he's brought down walls he's part of the Red Sea but do you realize there's things that can get so mounted up in your life that the enemy I'm talking now a life that can become so entrapped with the carers of this life and why did I make this decision and why did I go this way hello the reason it is is because you're trying to do it in your own way you can't do it your own way you've got to come God's provided way yeah that's why sometimes I said before with changing churches or whatever more I'm not against that friends you understand you'll understand right what I'm saying but sometimes it said we look at just changing physical things it's going to matter it isn't that God's after your heart let him have your heart heal straight now he'll answer every question let him have your life say God right now today right here today I'm going to start saving myself some trouble and I'm going to save you some trouble how are you going to do that by accepting your salvation for my life instead of me trying to do it me trying to figure it out I am going to accept the anointing of the grace of God that's what this message is it's the grace of God to you it's come to anoint the great qualities have laid in your life [Applause] [Music] Moses was brought to the place where he was anointed brought to the place that seed can I read on that seed was laying there with an intellectual conception with all the faith that he had was born to deliver the people yet it can never come until that light that life that light from the burning bush flashed across it until he seen not something he read about but something he's seen with his eyes something that spoke to him and he spoke back oh that did bring things to life brother said I think of a woman boy or girl in an intellectual conception of what they think the word is and so forth can never have a full Foundation stand until they have met that light that brings that word to a reality No Church in its practice no matter how intellectual fundamental it might be that church cannot Thrive until the Supernatural is made known among that people and they see it something they can talk to that will talk back to them that vindicates this written word if that's what we ought to pray for that's what we ought to pray for Even in our homes it's a supernatural oh glory be to God Moses let me read on basing his great call upon the word it was great until one day he met this light and the Very word itself spoke back to him then he got his anointing and that anointed what he had in him see it was already in him he had this faith in him but he did not have God's faith it's like having a car full of gasoline with no spark are you with me you know where I'm going but on the inside the intellects believe it the faith that was based upon this belief in God that separated from his mother and now when he strikes in the prince of the Lord light it anointed that what he believed it didn't hit it anointed what he believed you see friends this is why when you work in a looking in situations I sometimes you can look at situations and maybe your life is not where it needs to be I say Let There Be say God let a desperation raise up in my life Lord God and not just we don't just come into the Holy Ghost and settle down it is a rest rest from sin rest from laboring against sin but it is a yieldy to the working of the Holy Spirit man but sometimes it's even that of holding a life holding a place holding them in a place saying God encouraging them till what until they meet that Pillar of Fire are you with me not throwing them under the bus because they've made all coins of mistakes and everything else but to hold them that they would be held in a place until they meet that light are you with me friends my Lord have mercy what a hollowing out that God was doing on Moses oh brother Branham he says it like this in Victory Day I love this statement he said just a word from God on the back side of the desert boiled the whole thing up again it was there it just had to have the right inspiration to come sheep heard and magazine wasn't going to inspire him sheepherting.com was not going to inspire him the way to shear sheep on YouTube was not going to inspire him all it was doing was trying to come being a source of false Comfort but one was going to inspire him a direct word from the Lord and that's what God has given us in this generation and that's what God is giving right here this morning not a different word the same word by the same anointing by the same Pillar of Fire a word to do what boil up what is on the inside of us amen where the cares of life would like to cover it over would like to Cloud out that purpose but there's a word from God that boils out that purpose that all of a sudden we're sense of Victory sense of Freedom where all that sense has been lost but here comes a word from God that begins to build and says you know that's who I am you see what's happening you're starting to identify with who you really are what do I do let that same word keep bowling and up bringing it up bringing it up because you know what happens with water when water is boiling it's changing it's transforming from a liquid to a gas Hallelujah that's what the word of God does it brings a boiling brother it changes our attitude it changes our Outlook it changes the way we look at things it changes doubt to Faith it changes unbelief it changes us foreign Moses had a purpose he was serving down there he had a beautiful woman beautiful Ethiopian girl he had children brother Brian said all this right here he had but his mission was to deliver the children of God not from under that bondage that was his Commission that's what he was born where all the rest of them important they were but not out or above God see we you never live a successful Christian Life Victorious Life if you let other things compete in your walk if you put other things ahead of God you'll never live in Victory and that's why friends it's got to be there's got to be a power behind you there's got to be a Grace that receive in your life that Hollows out all the unbelief and all the sin and all the isms of this life and God comes into control and guide and direct brother Brown said it like this and I close right here think of this grace to a man by the name of Moses but I want you to put your life there he said here was a man who had been a bitter failure he said maybe you've been a failure as a housewife maybe you've been a failure as a husband maybe you've been a failure as a Christian maybe as a minister on and on he says but let that be a has been amen this is real Grace let it be a has been and start from right now start from right now Lord I want to walk under that anointing part I want to receive Lord that Grace in my life your faith may not be there right where it needs to be right yet but listen let him continue to build that faith until his faith steps down I tell you friends this is where in our lives this is where we are to live in a real victory in our lives before God anointed to serve the purpose of God it shouldn't be a moment I'll tell you it shouldn't be a moment that we don't put off anything for tomorrow of what you can do today well you know later on down the line I you know I'll do this why not do it today well brother said no I got to get this out of my life where I get that why let something continue on in your life right now and put it off down in the future you don't know your life might be required of you tonight why waiting man you're not in your life but what about the rapture God's calling to live a real overcoming life a life that overcomes a life that's got a power behind it and if your Visions got off if you've lost Vision if you've lost drifted then be humble before God and say Lord renew my vision renew Lord God that vision of freedom of victory let God come and refresh that let's pray Lord Jesus we're not here Lord just by chance we're here oh God by a real Divine appointment Lord I'm I'm certain and I ask oh God that may Lord is hearts and lives Lord throughout this congregation Lord this morning May our hearts Lord rise as Gallant men and women looking Lord upon the promises of God that are made manifest before us Lord as you are revealing yourself Lord in our midst oh God may we rise whatever that promise and that need is Lord I pray that God May there be just such a real determination Lord may it be a gallantness lord like Daniel that is purposed that God that we are not going to rest till every promise I want to know everything that belongs to me and I want to claim it I want to become one with it Lord I pray father for lives and hearts Lord God that Lord as I I thought back lord you know we look at this Lord we are here for a purpose we're here for a purpose we're not here by an accident we're here for a purpose Lord just like Lord every every part Lord God that within our body is for a purpose it has a purpose then Lord God we are here for a purpose I pray Lord this morning dear God may we be in that place Lord God With You Lord that father to where it comes Lord in our lives Lord no longer Lord God walking Lord within trouble and causing it Lord but I pray that God right here this morning may your grace just move Lord Lord I know father even as you pressed upon my heart notes and things that Lord God that even as Lord going over combing over in the spirit of God would just come to inspire these things Lord Jesus to our hearts Lord that father there are many things Lord we can look back in decisions in Lord regrets and so forth but God I pray this morning may we lord not reason with your grace may we accept the grace of God and Lord fully surrender Our Lives Lord if there's a life Lord that father maybe they've Lord had Faith Lord and faith that lays a great quality as your Prophet Lord would place it right there a great quality Lord of faith that lies within their heart Lord but never has been anointed by the faith of almighty God Lord grant this morning Lord I thank God many times Lord among young people sometimes the Lord middle all it all it really don't matter what age group but sometimes the Lord we can get in our mind of one certain thing of Lord that when we went to an altar this has to happen or I've got to do this or this it isn't bad at all it's giving our heart to you lord it's turning our life over to you because Lord God the real transformation is when we pass from Death unto life Lord no sure Lord God I'm sure there'll be emotions strike Our Lives Lord God and their lord no doubt about that but that is not what the new birth is Lord there can be emotion Lord but that is not what it is because we could be very emotional and steal our faith not be anointed with the faith of God but when that Faith Of God has come down lord it brings forth a new creation I pray this morning God is your grace moving over this audience Lord maybe there's lives and hearts that's tried and tried and tried and maybe the Lord God within themselves Lord in their minds Lord in their heart Lord God there's been Lord just such a vision that's been lost but I pray God right here this morning Lord has your Grace has moved down Among Us Lord God has your presence has come Lord God may they Lord I pray accept that Grace Lord oh Father may be Lord it'll start with just that acknowledgment yes Lord the presence of God if they were just Lord yielding to your presence Lord say Lord I will lay aside my thoughts and My reasonings that's what's got me in the trouble I'm in right now but Lord Your Grace has come Lord I'm here in this prison cell I'm in need of pardoning Grace Lord God I need your mercy Lord God I'm not here to debate with your parting Lord I'm here to accept the pardoning grace of almighty God granted Lord I pray father granted Lord God may you move Lord upon the hearts of your children may they accept Lord that Grace Lord lives Lord let it lived Lord would continue to live Lord in sin may I pray God such conviction Lord just settle down lord even now Lord upon their heart may they not get away from it

been a failure don't lay in your failures don't lay there let it be a has been and start right here this morning let God give you ground to stand on Hallelujah in the name of Jesus Christ granted Lord God let's stand you love him what Grace that's given to us if he's anointing should come it's come hasn't it his anointing has come then it's not come in vain it's come for a purpose it's come for a purpose to anoint us to serve the purpose of God say Lord with all that's within me everything that's within me see even as you look even as we look through our life all of us all of you had a mental image had a picture of what Driftwood looks like he had a mental picture of what a boat I I know we were well aware of that just to look as we Ponder in our hearts where does your life fit at this morning why do you come here [Music] why do you come to this church why are we here why do you believe this what's the purpose should be because of him because of him if it's just a purpose of this is where daddy goes Mama goes it can be an end to that because you steal what has to happen is you've still got to meet if your dad and Mama have met God then you've got to meet God you've got to meet God personally and to think what God has placed in our hearts he's here to anoint it he's here to give us strength to overcome [Music] snags in life yeah we all go through we all have snacks we all have times but thank God there's a power behind us Jesus spoke of this power he said if a man believeth on me as a scripture is set out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water [Music] Jesus promised we would be endued with power from on high that would be the necessity of the church that would be the necessity of Our Lives is his faith motivating our faith you realize God would call out the faith throughout the church ages he would speak to different at different times he would regard their faith but how were they doing how was that how was he seeing their faith it was his faith that was motivating their faith so it had moved from something of just I know what's right it had moved to something that goes beyond even what I think what even sometimes is considered say it this way plum crazy to believe that to stand like that that requires more than human faith human faith can go so far to the place of eyes can you explain it but when you can only go that far let God's faith come and when God's faith come it'll lead you into places where the human intellect cannot go it'll lead you into places that you look at you can even look like Peter oh my goodness where am I standing here you are walking on water here you are walking in the word walking in the promises and it's a reality but it's just it's a paradox and you know what a paradox is it's something you can't explain but it's real it's real it's real let me say this the same in what will my family think what will this think Hey look you got to choose what family you want to be identified with the Earthly family sinking grounds but if you want to be identified with the family of God the family of God has been considered nuts they've been considered oddballs Hebrews chapter 11 by Faith by Faith by Faith by faith decisions have been made because of the faith of God moving behind their lives I say Lord let it move in me whatever you need is this morning I just accept God's grace this morning don't reason with it just accept it just step right into it and say Lord I accept your grace this morning if it's for your life if it's for your heart you can't undo decisions but you can make the greatest decision and surrender your life to God listen friends you can spend your life with regrets after regret after regret but don't let the Satan trap you there when he traps you in all those things like that it all it does is further beat you down what should I do receive the grace of God but brother Samuel what about my regrets you're not more humble by Rolling in them what should I do do the greatest thing that can ever be done and repent of your sin and say forgive me Lord Jesus forgive me for my error forgive me Lord for doing things my own way Hallelujah and what do you do then and you say Lord right here's the place you brought me to the place and the place he's brought you to it's the burning bush for your life [Music] what a paradox what a paradox a bush that was on fire and yet was not consumed what a paradox how you can have the Holy Spirit the fire of God can come down in your life and consume out every inbred sin it can consume out every filthy habit every desire of the world and what does it do it's a fire of God on the inside of a yielded vessel it is a light that in the inside has been consumed but yet it's not been destroyed the same God that can do that is the same God that can take care of cancer same God that took and changed that nature in your life is the same God that can take care of your Affliction your disease Hallelujah the Holy Fire of God he
