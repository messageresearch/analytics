enjoyed the word of the Lord on Friday night and What the Lord Has spoke to our hearts amen this is a word that truly is of authority and power God speaking over our lives and God knows exactly what lays within us and he's listen I always like how brother Bram said it when he I don't know who the brother was he just said brother Mike he said brother Mike to think of it he said God chose us before the foundation in the world knew all the mistakes he said we would make but he chose us and God God's word cannot fail we're a part of him and that's what the word of God the Holy Spirit coming in this hour to make real to our lives of what lays within us I've mentioned this to you many times the first car that I had that you could do an auto start I didn't know it had it on it I had this button on on my key fob that I didn't know what it was and I was purchasing the car and I while they were back there drawing up paperwork and I looked at this one other guy I said what's this button for he said here let me show you and he walked over there to the window hit that lock button twice and hit that start button it started right I oh my goodness you know the only thing what I could see is I could see sitting in the classroom when snow was outside lock lock there you go I could see when it was hot in the classroom lock lock get the air condition going Lord see I could already see myself enjoying it and when God makes known to you and I what he's already placed in us then it's you seeing yourself in the vision it's not just looking at it as a spectator you see yourself in it because we see him in US amen I want to say U to um first of all brother Aaron sister I'd like you to stand I know they don't like this but it's part of it I want to say I appreciate brother Aaron and sister Amanda to um and to organizing and getting all of that uh together for that dinner that the fellowship that we had yesterday the menu getting all those things as far as to bring that organization together and we so appreciate that amen we love you all amen amen we really appreciate that and that that you know there's parts of it that go along with that I'd like also I know there were many that went out there as workers that if I'd like the workers to stand that came out there along with them come on now brother Willie sister Mercy I know you were there I know there were some other brother Shane I understand sister Lily can't stand right now but we'll get her amen God bless you God bless you now if if they say all all the eaters stand up I'm already [Laughter] standing I was already when uh sister Caroline I watched her pull in it just happened to be I was coming by and I made sure I found her a spot in the parking lot and I said you need any help she said I do I said let me open my trunk we'll just change it from one vehicle to the other but uh I you know I just love to be together with you all and I'm I'm so thankful we're going to get to spend eternity together amen after all this is said and done after all the tests and trials and the molding and the shaping and every we're going to stand there and say it's been worth it all it's been worth it all yes amen so we want to just just turn our attention to the word of the Lord and want brother Wendell just to take his Liberty and I want to say it's so good to have he and sister fresa and the young ladies here with us amen it's just been such a delight and Brother David and brother Thomas cren and my I asked Brother David to sing that song I I just love him singing that song that he sung this morning and so we really just appreciate amen each one of you amen the different visitors that's been here and of course I don't see too many unless I'm overlooking somebody but I don't really see visitors here this morning too much outside of them and sister Gloria and but uh we're just good to glad to be in the presence of the Lord aren't we amen so we want brother w to come and um appreciate brother wend and them taking the time to be here with us and uh we just want to pull on the gift of God this morning God knows what we have need of he knows just how to speak and I I'd say no matter what the situation might be we've got two services today that's true but God don't have to wait till the second service to meet your need and a matter of fact God don't have to wait till the end of the service to meet your need you can receive what you have need of as even the word is coming forth receive an authority receive what you have need of I believe the Holy Ghost comes through the preaching of the word I believe it's the preaching of the word that creates an atmosphere of Faith to believe God for all things and I just say no matter whatever is maybe on your heart that might seem like the biggest thing that you could look at maybe it's something of a loved one just put it before God right here this morning and invite the fire of God to come down and just dve that rest that settledness it's over hallelujah it's finished it's settled just invite him to come and bring that amen you love him Amen brother w why don't you come on we amen we just want uh if brother W would like to sing how many enjoyed that singing oh [Applause] yeah eventually here before whether it's this service or next service there's one song he's going to sing before he leaves here for sure but I but I I guess I could have wrote notes for brother Jonathan you know he's a pastor but maybe I could have wrote him a slip for an excused absence and maybe could have wrote one for brother Joshua they could have been here was a part of that Trio but he he does all right on his own amen God bless you brother W love you praise the lord well are you in love with the Lord Jesus today [Applause] amen we sure we

say God bless you Amen brother Samuel amen let's look here at First Kings 17 And1 and Elisha the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of Gilead said Ahab as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be due nor rain these years but according to my word oh isn't it wonderful to have a prophet and the word of the Lord came unto him saying get thee hint turn thee Eastward and hide thyself by the Brook cherith which is before Jordan and it shall come to pass that thou shalt drink of the Brook and I have commanded the Ravens to feed thee there hallu I want you to say feed thee and then just you say there I have commanded the Ravens to feed thee there and he went and did according unto the word of the Lord for he went and dwelt by the Brook cherith that is before Jordan and the Ravens brought him bread and flesh in the evening and bread and flesh in or in the morning and in the evening and he drink of the brook and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had not been rain in the land and the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise get thee to zerath which belongeth to zidon and dwell there for I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain the I want to minister on a on a real simple subject this morning a place called there let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you for your love thank you for the abundance of your mercies and your grace to us amen I thank you Lord for the wonderful anointing that we feel here this morning as the congregation has come Lord with one heart and that's to hear from you and to love you Lord oh oh God lord as we come to this part of the service Lord and fall in my lot to minister I pray Lord that you would anoint me and help me to get out of the way so that you can speak to your people I ask Lord that you not just lift me into your presence but Lord Lift us all into that Supernatural realm of all things possible father we thank you for it I ask Lord that you would bless our pastor and his wife and his family those who are laboring here to with him together just ask Lord that this little congregation would be a beacon Lord to this part of the the world Lord and just let your grace be made manifest through them we love you Lord with all of our heart we love you in Jesus name we pray we look to you this morning amen and amen God bless you you can be seated amen I want to minister on on a a subject called a place called there and I know that's U that that's quite a title a place called there I believe that God's the great architect and that God has got a master plan for each and every one of us here this morning there is none of you that are here by accident there are none of you that are in charge of your own destiny now I know that the world wants to say if you don't do it no one else will I want to say if God doesn't open it up and God doesn't lead you you will not reach the destiny that you that God has intended for you to reach I I believe that each of us have an ordained Destiny I believe God knew us before the world ever begin God knew where we would end up God knows where he's taking us how many believes that amen he he knows matters of fact this is not just to the Natural or it's not just to the spiritual but I believe it's to the Natural amen I I I believe God is interested in your job I believe God is interested in who you marry I believe God is interested in Amen in in every area of your life God is interested in you and he's been eternally interested in you man the prophet would say the church positionally before the foundation of the world when God in his labor pain was bringing forth bringing forth you knowing what you would do he placed you positionally into his own body now many people want to stop there and say well yes that was the spiritual aspect but if you were to go on brother Bram would would then give say he positionally placed you into his own body to be a housewife to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a a a prophet to be this or that he placed you positionally amen he placed you when before the foundation of the world and so God's Got A Plan God's got well glory to God some of you may be sitting in here this morning and saying well I I you know I I think God's forgot about me God's not forgot about you God's got all eternity invested in you amen you are here according to his Divine Purpose and plan amen the prophet would say we often get a view of him that makes him seem very impersonal it is as though God made the whole universe and all the laws that pertained to it and then stood back and become a great and personal God it is as though God made a way of salvation for lost Mankind and that way being the cross and then when uh when the death of Christ was atoned for our sins his resurrection gave us an open door to him and then God just folded his arms and stood back it is as if we have majored in believing in a great Creator who having created has now lost personal interest in his creation Now I say this is how too many people are apt to think but that is wrong thinking turn to your neighbor and say that ain't good thinking for God is governing in the Affairs of men right now yes sir he is both Creator and sustainer well oh I just want to I I feel like doing a real good Pentecostal jig right now amen because he is not just the Creator he's not just the savior he is the sustainer of his work amen amen many of times we we fail to realize that God knows the end from the beginning he knows when you're going to reach your destiny he knows where your destiny is and he is taking you to your destiny right now but you see in between amen the the time that he starts you to the time that you reach your destiny there's a lot of places called there amen

the the Pharisee Clan God had to bring jerus to a point where he needed God more than he needed anything else he had to bring him to a point amen where his daughter was dying he got my doctors had failed and everything else had failed and when everything else had failed amen what did the Bible say he he he came and and he began to search for Jesus it didn't matter anymore it didn't matter who

Samuel come to look at to anoint a man he looked at the big physique and he says God says uh and when he went through all of the sons he says do you not have one he called Jesse told he told Jesse bring all of your sons up one of them's going to be king and Jesse this is the kind of confidence Jesse had Jesse called everybody but you know [Laughter] who and when he went through him he says Jesse do you not have another son oh I do I do I do but he ain't no King David was out in a place called there David was pushed out because God was training D to be king come on he was forsaken because God was training him to be king his brothers didn't acknowledge him because he was ordained to be king the world can't see who you are because you're an our to be a king world don't see it Daddy might not see it Mama might not see it the preacher might not see it but God sees it he yes he [Applause] does hallelujah David come running up laughing like a sheep Bing like a sheep bowing

amen and he open the took the Horn of it off and he be to pour it it ain't going to fall on you Hallelujah and he begin to Pour It hallelu On David that's right that's right Brothers didn't see it daddy didn't see it David didn't see it nobody seen it but God was training David David felt forsaken David felt belittle David felt no one loves me David felt I don't understand I don't know why I'm forsaken but it was God training David David was fixing to be anointed to be king Hallelujah you cannot be anointed to be king by satting at the house of the master all the time right are you hearing me it think changed much no David went back out to the pasture right made fun of by the brothers brothers were out fighting a battle one day now in between time David the anointing is upon Him David's singing songs while you're reading and while we love the book of Psalms I want you to know it was forsaken David out there in a place called there that he chose to Worship the Lord and to love the Lord in that Barren place called no one else wanted it the brothers didn't want it daddy didn't want it no the only place that was fit for David was that place called there Hallelujah but it was there where he learned to praise it was there where he learned to write it was there where he learned to sing it was there where he learned the fight it was there where he saved the sheep and he killed the bear it was there where he killed the lion it was there he was anointed for [Applause] them now there was a fight going on am I doing all right there was a fight going on all right God called or Jesse calls his little son and says hey take some sea cheese and Cornbread right to your brothers they're out there fighting and you going out there and let him know that Daddy's proud of them David goes out there he's looking for a battle right hey fellas hey hey is there a battle going on right here and about that time a hand shot up from behind the [Laughter] rock what what what what what are you doing back in there David comes over and scurries behind the rck and says hey what's going on well what's going on is what you see going on there's a big giant and he's big and he wants to kill us hard David jumps up from behind the Rock and he says you're going to let that uncircumcised Philistine keep some circumcised Seed of Abraham behind rocks are you guys crazy and about that time here come the giant send me a man who will fight me David says hey I'll figh [Music] [Applause] him they said he said man he say all I can know there was this there's this bear came after my my daddy's sheep while you Fellers thought that I couldn't handle anything when the anointing came on me I I ripped that lion apart and let me tell you something else Hallelujah I'm feeling good right now he says and then the bear came up and he snatched the lamb and I took off after him with this slingshot oh he says there ain't nothing that my God can God has been training me he's been preparing me now I can understand why daddy sent me here this is my new place called there he's been training me he's been preparing me I'm ready to fight him I'm ready to defeat the enemy come on now I've gone through my Valley I've gone through my testing I've gone and I seen God as The Miracle Worker Hallelujah can you say Amen [Music] I'm way off my message but this is pretty good bring it bring it the bishop of the church came and says now listen SA or listen sa says listen you can't you can't handle that slingshot might be good for the pasture but this is a new place so they come in and bringing the armor and everything on him now he was Head and Shoulders taller than everyone else and David was just as scrawny little lad right David couldn't even walk around in it right right he says listen I've not tried these let me use what God has trained me with he's not trained me with a sword and a spear and the armor but he has trained me in the shepherd or in the pasture with this little Shepherd sling and he defeated the enemy that day come on church he went from a little nobody to hearing the women sing songs Saul has killed his thousands but David has killed his tens of thousands he went from a little to a Hallelujah he went from a little to a man that was now going to be persecuted he was now going to be hunted like a like a rabbit being chased by a dog now the King was going to see he put his entire life to killing Avid destroying David destroying his influence but now he found himself that's good yes sir that is so good right great I killed the Giant now the king's trying to kill me and now he's hiding in caves for years he was in another place do you feel like you're ever going to you jump out of The Frying Pan Into the Fire do you ever feel like it's ever going to God is it ever going to so I'm dying in this one that is so good but in that time he's learning that he's not going to kill the man that's trying to kill him right in that time God put Saul right at his feet where David could take his own dagger and kill his own enemy but he was so he was he was trained so much by God that when he had him in his hands he says I will not touch God's anointed I will do him no harm what did he do God was training David to be the king just because he was anointed to be king did not mean he was ready to be king he was anointed but he had to go through training you could be anointed to be the bride you could be anointed to be this end time bride of Jesus Christ but but you've got to be [Music] trained but the day came when David sat on the throne David was not going to be just an average man he was a man after God's Own Heart praise the Lord his trials took him to his Destiny wow yes sir what did the Bible says there in Psalms 105 talking about Joseph 105 and 17 he sent a man before them even Joseph who was sold for a servant whose feet they hurt with feathers that's he was laid in Iron until the time that his word came the word of the Lord Tried Him amen didn't Joseph have a few places called there can you see man brother Brandon would tell us he would say in perfect Faith he says when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance Faith he has isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ there now you're getting into bride material you see see you're getting into rapturing condition now that means for each one of us not just the pastor deacons trustees that means for the leoty every individual Walks With God Alone you're baptized in his kingdom there's nobody in there but you and God he gives the orders and you pack them out whatever he says there's not a shadow of a doubt anywhere nowhere you walk right on if the Lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it you go right on just the same now you're coming into perfect Faith perfect Perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails yes he was a Mystic to them with his perfect faith and so is it now

to wear you out we got another service here tonight but I want to get to a point here it requires the challenges we can rejoice in what we preached the other night positioned to rain right but see there's a lot of the ups and the Downs that comes with it to take you there amen amen what I am today required all the church splits it required I when I started pastoring I was I was I was just a 19-year-old Pentecostal and when I came into the message my pastor groy who I idolized and loved tremendously he didn't see he couldn't see what I had I was left alone I brother Sean and myself we we would weep we we were we didn't we didn't know we didn't know there was a Donnie Reagan or a Tim PR or a brother Browning or we didn't know nobody someone had just given us the adoption series that's good and we just we would weep as we sat there and cried and listened to it over and over and finally we looked and said hey there might be some more maybe we can get some more sermons and then we found that Jeffersonville there and we and started listening they gave started put us on the tape club and started from the very last sermon leadership in ' 65 and we started going backwards and we're and we're learning and and and all about all the trials and I I lost my church right they all walked out I labored from the alcoholics and druggies and you man they they they all make good Sunday

dark places I've gone through some you can ask my wife I've gone very dark dark dark dark places but it was places called there that God was training me you've gone through dark places but it was God

knows the way and he will make sure you arrive right on time [Applause] yes sir when he created you it took a little bit of potach and a little bit of calcium and a little bit of sulur and a little bit of the Masterpiece Adam it was just a 16 elements of the earth that he put together to create him can you say amen amen it's God's Masterpiece praise the Lord for you to even be here this morning Hallelujah I I I I I just for for for those of you that maybe the devil fights you on your personality or fights you with this and fight do you realize that God is satisfied with you back when I was back when I was back when I was a kid we it didn't matter with I had friends with buck teeth and snaggle teeth I mean we we all it didn't matter but we're in a day today where you've got to have your teeth just right you've got to have everything just right no one's satisfied with what they are no one's satisfied but when God was bringing you God brought your great great grandma to meet your great great grandpa come on now come on now because he wanted a certain Ting come on now in you when they're creating the bells they take so many different kinds of metals and they put a little bit of this

everything about you God designed you Hallelujah Satan will come in and he'll try to anoint those things and he'll try to take a leader and make a bully out of them he'll try to take a soft person and give them complexes and right right but that doesn't change the fact that God made you to be a leader and he's got some places called there to make sure that you're not a bully right and he's going to

his daddy was an alcoholic his mama was a Catholic I believe it was his mom one of them is a Catholic came from a Catholic background he lost a wife he lost a baby disassociated from the Baptist

you well come on church but it took the world forsaking that man amen that is so good god brother Brenham would say Christ revealed in his own word he says there's many that's try to impersonate them prophets he said what do they do they mess up that's all they they couldn't do it because God has selected the man for the age and selected the message and even selected the nature and what would go over in that age and what he could put over how he could with the nature of that certain man he could blind eyes of of others and the words of that man what would say the way he acted would blind others and open others eyes he dressed the man in the type of dress that he was the nature the ambition and everything just the way he had to be just perfectly selected for that certain people that he had called for that certain age Paradox he says I asked my wife the other morning I said honey have I lost my senses am I becoming a mad man what's the matter with me why do I say the things that I do
