here at the Word of God tonight and you know here we are we're already more than a few days into into this year and but yet we want to be able to by God's grace ask God that would give us the grace on the departure from the previous years amen and give us grace into this next year find so many times when you take just the phrases through the message and I don't know if you've ever done it or not but if you take the phrases coming year or this year and just look at the things that brother Baron himself would set within it it wasn't something that was just loose in any way but it was a real burden that would be what God would take us on further in every oncoming year and I believe that you know that's what we're that's our desire to here tonight and I thank God for the opportunity that we're able to have to to come together like this I know some of you have been speaking about this for a while to come together and have some singing and have testimonies and yet here we are in the midst of a time we have so many that are dealing with sickness and you know so some are not able to be here tonight for that but we want to remember them in prayer and we also will take those requests up in just a moment and just ask that God would be with them as well if you would right now I want and let's turn in our Bibles here and I will stand with me I want to read out of Philippians chapter 3 there just for a few moments and I'm not going to I know you're probably thinking what we'll see but I'm not going to speak that long just if just really a few reflections that's on my heart in Philippians chapter 3 and Paul here in the opening verse verse 1 he says finally my brethren rejoice in the Lord to write the same things to you to me indeed is not Grievous but for you but for you it is safe beware of dogs beware of evil workers beware of the concision for we are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh though I might also have confidence in the flesh If any man if any other man thinketh that he might or of he might trust in the flesh I'm more circumcised the eighth day of the stock of Israel of the tribe of Benjamin an Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching the law a Pharisee concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless and verse 7 we'll just will read this and pause here but what things were gain to me those I counted loss for Christ what things were gain to me those I counted loss for Christ amen let's just pause there and just ask the Lord's blessing Lord Jesus as Lord we bow our hearts Lord in your presence dear Heavenly Father we're just asking Lord here your God your blessing upon the service we're asking for your guidance Lord as we would just Lord share a few things Lord that you've placed upon our hearts and we certainly would just desire O God that you have just complete preeminence Lord Father may in the further part of the service Lord I pray that your God as we Lord take this time Lord to set aside and to Lord just - Lord speak God the testimonies we've we've given testimonies here in Lord the services Lord but just feeling pressed just - Lord call this and just to have these times these moments Lord and we pray that God may it be an edification because that's that's the objective Lord in everything that we do that it would edify the body of Jesus Christ so father we pray that you'll just bless the specials tonight as well Lord may it be an encouragement Lord through our lives we pray Lord we love you and thank you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you as you're being seated I want to just just draw your attention here just a few moments here into that verse of scripture this verse of scripture here is one that I could not get away from it's something that it just continued to resonate within my heart where Paul makes this declaration what things were gain to me those I counted loss for Christ there's no doubt about it that there are things that when we are looking at it in our life we know that when we have been born again and born of the Spirit of God we have been lifted from just where we were looking and living on a plane in this world but now we're walking and we're walking in two worlds we when we've been born again we now are aware of that other world that brother brems says we were bumping into all of those years and we we come to a place that we recognize ourselves as a song we sang as Pilgrims and strangers and that's when we can truly say we're a pilgrim and we're stranger when we realize that we're just passing through this life and yet they within the midst of this life it's always a challenge it's always a battle for us to keep the two parts of us always in check and to keep it separated because Paul is letting it be known here what things were gain to me those I counted loss for Christ but yet there was a part of Paul that desired more of God in his life and Paul is here when he's placing this before us is that there is an evaluation that Paul was making that for everything within his if it is just profiting Paul the natural man and that's all that where it's at Paul said that if if that if that's it right there and it hinders the spiritual then that in itself is not profitable to me but in everything that we do we I believe as believers that we desire that with every step Lord I want to be in the center of your will we we don't want our lives to be entangled and you know in held in bondage with things and I believe this with all of my heart when we're praying for God's will in our life God is not going to lead us into something that would take us from him he'll never do that we have that we have that assurance but if anything God will always open up the door his will is something that will see to it when our desire is to be closer to him it will be unhindered there's gonna be challenges sure there will be challenges when God opens a door and he makes known his will it's not without challenges but when he makes known his will it is that which gives us strength and confidence when adversity strikes that we know that we're in the perfect will of God and we can look to God to bring answers to give direction of where we're standing in that time so when Paul I believe this to be a real mark for our lives as we look into this year what things were gain to me those I counted loss for Christ and you think Paul goes on to say it like this he says ëi doubtless I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ there's no regrets here think of what Paul what Paul was removed from in his life because of now what God had done in Paul's life Paul is able to say and those things which I have suffered the loss of I count them but dung in other words Paul is making a declaration he says I'm not like that of Lot's wife where I look back and say oh I oh this could have been all that could have been there's no value within those things Paul realizes and is declaring my heart is no longer their accountant but dumb he's recognizing see he's moving on and you recognized this that here he goes on to say in verse nine this is the desire coming out of verse eight that I may win Christ in to verse nine and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith that I may know him in the power of his resurrection in the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead and watch out Paul goes here his desire notice what Paul's focus is is the promise of the first resurrection then I might attain unto that resurrection out of that that I ain't aend to that first resurrection that's the goal that's the desire I believe that's our desire is that is our focus within everything not look I says is in verse twelve not as though I had already attained either were already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus I look at this very clearly this verse of scripture has always been a verse of scripture over the years that's always stood out to me that Paul could stand here there is the church age messenger having the revelation that he has but Paul could say I do not count myself that I've already attained in other words I'm already there I've already come to the pinnacle I'm already at the summit Paul is very very very clearly stating here and I'm still moving on I'm following after I'm in pursuit of what God has made known you see if God hadn't made it known to Paul think of it God works in that channel to make it known to the age and then how God would disperse it out through that age and that is always kept before the people the focus of the hour and what God is calling us to down through the ages every age has been focused on the coming of the Lord that has been the expectation that has been the hope of the gospel of every one that has lived in every age and yet as they lived within their age lived within their time think of this here it's constant where the vision was always placed before them we are we are made as a people that we are a people of vision and I'm not just talking on a spiritual level I'm talking also on a natural level of things there are things that you know that we we are meant to have a focus and have a goal and have a direction within life think of this and the message faith is our victory brother Branham talks about the bum who's at his door you remember the story the bum was at his door he said I invited the man in and I invited him to sit down at the table he said and then I thought I would ask him a few questions and brother Brian begin to feed him brother Brendan washed his feet and brother brown asked him he says where are you going hmm he said well where you come from mmm but the brem says what's your ambitions what do you plan to do the REM goes into that fate now watch this he this is us this is relative to the subject he's speaking on faith is our victory faith itself is the sovereign will of God revealed to you and I yet without details I don't want to labor on that tonight but God's will that is what we want when we walk by faith it's we're walking by divine revelation and we don't know how or when and how all the other parts will unfold but what we know his faith is we're walking steadfast in what God has shown us for that moment when we get to the place we need to get to he'll open more to us he doesn't open Luqman by God told Abraham he told him to get to the mountains he never told him what mountain yet it was till it wasn't until Abraham got to a place in the scriptures then everything begins to single down begins to narrow it's walking and obedience to what God has opened right then that's faith even with Abel Abel didn't know that the Spirit of God was going to come down and give witness on that sacrifice but what he knew is this is what God has revealed as the acceptable way and so he took that and he walked by faith and that God came and God recognized and honored that this was indeed from me so when we think of these things here I look back on that bum you know that that was there but so brother Brown described it he had no purpose he had no direction and brother Branham spoke of that he says what a sad thing it is he said for a church member someone who's just aimlessly floating down the river of life he said you take for example he said these the wood that's going down the stream he said yet if you take that wood and it's shaped and molded put together and you put an engine behind it he said then he said he can go somewhere it now has a purpose and I believeth on my heart and we recognized I'll say it like this I believe that I'm speaking to and I'm one of believers that have matured into a place that we recognize the predestinated plan of God is not like a bunch of marbles thrown in the air that just happens to roll around but we recognize that our lives are divinely influenced by the Lord Jesus Christ even when you don't feel anointed you're still anointed the anointing the Prophet separated he said anointing is not a feeling he said it is in power in control right there so you're walking and sometimes we don't recognize of all how God is leading us and how we're being moved within our life that it is not and we do not treat God's program as though it's just something that's just well if it's going to be it's going to be we recognize God doesn't do that he never haphazardly treated our salvation in that way and said well we'll just see it was all God's plan his program being unfolded and all through the time even the types that were being laid in the Old Testament they were all moved upon by the Holy Ghost and as they moved by the Holy Spirit that each part would be laying there that would actually speak in part of Christ they were moving in the will of God for their season you know it was something it took ahold of their life like it did Abraham's life Jeremiah's life and on and on to where that Christ revealed to them in them and through them in that generation it took precedence over everything else it was what they made their decisions in life by everything hinged upon that and I believe that this is where Paul is speaking to us with in this he goes on to say in verse 13 brethren I count not myself to have apprehended those are tremendous words aren't they in other words I'm not already there I'm pressing C there's a goal that is out ahead of me there's something there's a reality that is before me I want to see this word me and this word become one not just what brother Sam I believe that's already happened Paul did too but Paul is still saying he said I'm not there yet I want to fully become how Christ as fully made himself known that's what Paul is saying so Paul's recognizing there's a goal there's a focus and that's why I think the scripture is so clear you what the Bible says then what is it proverbs 29 13 where there is no vision the people perish and you recognize that word vision where there is no vision that word means a lack of leadership is nakedness it's the same word that's used in Genesis and they knew they were naked so to be naked is to lack leadership leadership is to be clothed is to have a vision have a direction for our life and this is why that where the scriptures even as it would portray we won't go and spend that time tonight but it even portrays and shows itself within our life but I believe that these two next parts here what Paul says in verse 13 are very very applicable to our lives and they must be applied I count not myself to apprehend it but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind how can you forget what's behind unless you have access access to power that's able to minister grace to you to you recognize it's in the past leave it in the past don't dig it up don't talk about it brother branham actually says in one place the message help us Lord to bury it there and never dig it up again and he wasn't just talking about sinners coming to the altar he's speaking about from what the pastor was coming into the upcoming year we need to forget those things you know sometimes when we look at the past boy you could really labor on this thought but sometimes even the way that we even will allow ourselves to enter into other relationships with people and so forth is based upon previous experiences and we look and say I've forgot it but yet that at previous it's to keeps us in that place whether it's a lack of trust or it's a lack of this and it keeps us there and it's not God's will for us to be bombed bound to them but do do I believe that there are things that we can learn how many believe we can learn from things absolutely you know you never take things like I've told people before setting in the office I've taken paper and roll up I said you don't take your experience and just throw it off and say well praise be to God on this go on no let God teach us from these experiences it's true that Mozart and Beethoven threw away a lot of masterpieces but they learned from them to go forward onto the next sheet right so we learn from our mistakes and we we we need the grace of God to be able to forget those things that are behind it without laboring on this point let me just say it to you like this when God has moved into the depths of our life and that change has been brought by the Holy Spirit there is no longer a desire for the things of the world you with me there are traps and things that can be put along the way but this is where you have to come back to in applying the scripture is to come down to what is the desire within your heart if the desire within your heart you can stand there and say here is a repulsion to those things then listen to me brother and sister when God has brought those things to our attention you've repented oven you've made it right it's under the blood it's finished there's no trace of that coming up and that's where you had that's the ground you've got to stand on because you can't see it go in the blood you can't feel it but what you recognize is the release comes by you know the desire that's in your heart that desire you didn't place there it wasn't there but that is what the change of the new birth has brought in your life that's a powered see that's a that's a hidden power that's in that scripture because Paul is speaking brethren this is what we do and we reach forth unto those things which are before how many you realize sometimes the past can keep you from moving forward the past itself you it still of what the past was and the failures and all those things and it keeps you from reaching forward for what God has for you remember keeping the duality of yourself in mind when you've been born to the Spirit of God you've got a natural part and there's a divinity there's a divine part and remember Paul would see you tell us in Galatians five that the spirit lusts of against the flesh the flesh against the spirit it wasn't lowercase s its capital S there's a war but libram called it a constant war that is going on he also placed it like this white dog black dog you with me tonight and to see that how that that would be moving there back and forth and to recognize that within this here that by the grace of God there there is there is a goal that what God has for our life you realize that how God is so personally in services you watch how God will so hone our focus in so here you are you're sitting here in your home church but then here you are you'll be listening to a message you're reading in the scriptures maybe you go and visit another assembly visit some friends or what have you and here it just seems like everything is so personally being directed to you you know why that is there's a feeding that's going on it's a feeding that's going on it's not something that's scattered to you but you're recognizing this is a feeding that's going on it's God ministry and you know what you and I have the opportunity the privilege the honor at that time to be able to either hold ourselves or surrender ourselves we can either hold it I'm not gonna go it on that pathway I don't want to visit that pathway if I visit that pathway what it's going to require me or we can say Lord you're the one who's leading Lord I'm gonna follow after you I may have never been able to overcome this and this might have been a trap but by God's grace I'm gonna aside every weight and every sin that does so easily beset me you say that's impossible it is not impossible I can do all things with Christ Jesus who strengthens me it's not your strength or my strength it's him he's the strong one here he's the RAM who's on the scene it's our Lord Jesus Christ amen it's him we're not here turning new leaves tonight we're not here tonight say well I hope this but I believe with all my heart there is a vision there's a renewing to think of how they would start a new year and it would be a firmly spoken there at the beginning there were among the Jews this is a new beginning for you that's a very statement of exodus 12 this is a new beginning for you the world takes and they take it to one place and I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna do that and there's nothing wrong with all those goals you know many times I've always thought if I can always watch the neighbors and the exercise equipment they're buying now maybe by October I'll be able to get it for half price from them in their garage sale you know in a but in everything it all does start with a focus it starts with a goal we have things in a natural life we have things in a natural life face is still even in the natural life look was here around the church let me just just for just a moment here I think of what God how God has has blessed us with you know being able to do different things around the church here you know if there's a lot of things that's changed and it's in it it's it's very it's very nice looking I think so I really appreciate I appreciate everything that the brothers have done and have labor I appreciate how that things have really you know come together and things that's taken place and all of those things it starts with a vision you know you or me I mean that we might not have that vision of this needs to be done but yet we still have our vital vital part in all of it how we're bringing you know bringing to what God has blessed us with and here we are laying and saying Lord Jesus this is for your work Lord and how does he how that God through little things you know and I think of it there's no way that we would have been able for the work that's been done there is really no way that we would have been able to really have paid for it to have somebody to come in and do it but I'll tell you what I think it's been done professionally I really believe that with all my heart I think I think God for the brothers that's come in and I love the daylight on Sunday morning when I preach I'm looking forward to daylight springs gonna be coming I know somebody I know we're in January but Springs just around the corner I felt the warmth the other day but I think it's important that we look at those things you know God has allowed us you might say oh brother Samuel those things seem a little carnal but what if we don't take care of the natural what if we don't take care of natural things and cares of this building then it will hinder the spiritual the focus is let me make sure my natural does not hinder the spiritual let the spiritual govern the natural let it keep things in check because the spiritual it desires to be unhindered that Christ Himself could be glorified in me that natural man is always trying to encroach and sometimes as I said here it's not necessarily the encroachment of doing sometimes it can be the lack of you know there's things that all of us have had around our house said I was going to get to that I was going to get to that I'm gonna get to that I'm gonna get to that I'm gonna get to that and then by the time it comes around it's it's a repair beyond us then we get to a place why did I put it off so sometimes it's not us doing more sometimes it's putting off we really need the help of the Lord don't Lee we need God's help and to think we're living the time all of us since this we're all living in a time of such pressure there's more pressure in this age were pressured all around there's demonic oppression all around there's pressures all around there's things all around there's more you know so many different things you know that people are always you know things you have to normally do let alone having to tell people and turn them down I don't want new windows I don't need new windows my windows are only a few years old or 10 years old my house is this I don't need that you know you're gonna meet you got to run an extra part around the store to avoid them how many times I told you all I don't have TV in my house you asked me the same question over and over you get the same answer the pressures pressures so for all you forget those things in the past and reach those things are before verse 14 I press toward the mark of the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus I believe that should be our focus I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus look how Paul such this fourth year I'm gonna I'm coming down here let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if in anything you be otherwise minded God shall reveal even this unto you how precious is that we are perfect he said let us be less minded that we're pressing toward the mark and if there's any part of our life that's not in line with that Paul said this will be brought to our attention because why the desire of our life is to hit that mark the desire within our life is truly the rapture the change of the body and within that there is a longing within our lives to be closer to him amen we want to be closer to him we find ourselves this year no doubt within the past month you're more watch full of things hallelujah aren't you glad for that what comfort that is you know I've read that verse I don't know how many times and it just jumped off the page and I just about I just you know I had tears of joy within my soul if in anything you'd be otherwise minded God shall reveal even this to you I'm glad that he's watching over I'm glad that when we sit there and say and for my heart's Lord I want to be more like you the word pulls on our hearts he pulls in our life and if there's any little area he says don't worry I'll reveal it to you whatever areas out of line because I know the desire of your heart I'll bring it in line Alleluia I think God for that verse 16 nevertheless we're we're too we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing brethren be followers together of me and mark them which walk so as you have us for an ensample Brennan said it like this in the message Salome so he says as we face this year just like we do all years there's a regret of our mistakes in the past and I look looking forward for a future of the glorious light of Christ no doubt if we live through this year we'll find many mistakes that we have made and we just expect that because it goes along the pro and con that's the law of average that we live by here in this life but we're so glad we have a mediator who sets at the right hand of God to make intercessions when we are willing to admit our mistakes that we done wrong then he forgives them he is full of grace and mercy to forgive us for those mistakes aren't you grateful for them amen thank God for His mercy but the bantam says it like this here in another place he says images of Christ he says I want more of the Holy Spirit in me to reflect Christ in me he says I want to be more like him the Lord Jesus look what he says he says it'll take the Holy Ghost to do that that's the only thing can do it he said I'm not interested he says in seminaries kissing the crucifix or pulling them to my heart or saying prayers they did he said I'm interested in one thing that's more of the Holy Spirit to take over William Brennan I say man I'm not interested he says in joining a greater Church than what I belong to I belong to the real Church of the Living God the first point I was born into it I want more of the Holy Ghost in my life to reflect Christ who I love brother Branham says I don't care what plane I have to come on to get to it and these are some of the planes some of the planes some of the places we can we come to where people will call it bro Graham says they call you fanatic quite a Holy Roller see you're moving and desire I want to see more of him reflected in me no matter what that requires his focus was not on the requirements it was on I want more of the Holy Ghost because I'm not interested on the plane I have to come on I'm interested in the Holy Ghost so I can look at this here's the reason I'm interested in the Holy Ghost so I can be more of a servant like he was this is my heart's prayer I want more of the Holy Ghost to take over Samuel Brown II so I can be more of a servant like he was that's my desire you know I I know I'm no different from you you're no different from me you find yourself just as I find myself reflecting except I don't believe that we just wait to the end of the year there's times I always find myself reflecting could I what can I do more what can I do more when something hasn't turned out in a certain way or something's going on how could this have been better handled how could I've done this or how could this are your constant even even listen to me even when answers themselves come to a place sometimes things are uncomfortable and there's no other way around it but yet steel within our hearts there's always that place of reflection I've said this many times as a parent when I became a parent I find myself its constant constant reflection but let me say this to you reflection is not beating yourself up that's not reflection but by God's grace to be able to look and that the Holy Spirit teach us show us because our desire because we know that we make mistakes there was a statement I don't know how many times I've read this in Joshua chapter one but brother Matt Watkins was preaching there the first night at or the second night at the youth retreat and I just thought I was going to have to run the scriptures in Joshua were God told Joshua as I was with Moses so will I be with thee I will not fail thee I will not forsake thee and brother Matt under the leading of the Holy Spirit said if you'll notice he never said Joshua you'll never fail he said I'll never fail you he never said Joshua you won't forsake me but he said I will never forsake you I am so grateful because that's a reality he said I'll never forsake you I'll never leave you I'm so glad about that and tonight I pray that we can in our hearts with the testimonies we'll take a prayer request and then I'll let brother Brian do the bringing of different things up here with the testimonies songs and so forth but I pray tonight you know the desire that really would be within Hart I said god I want to be a better pastor I do I want to grow more you know I've said it over and over I said if there's ever a sign put outside that door don't you ever just put Samuel Browning brother Samuel pastor you make sure you put in front of Pastor associate in training because he's the pastor I'm just his assistant and I'm constantly in training but I mean that with all of my heart there's things you know because within let me say this to you within a church there's always has to be a vision we're not talking about filling the pews up but I will tell you this right here I doom in my heart pray God let there be hearts and lives that even Souls you would add to have a burden for your work what's going on here you might say brother Samuel that self is it's not selfish at all we realize we're part of the of the of the mystical body of Jesus Christ around the world but we have our part right here and God sees to it within our little platoon that we have here there is a focus and everything itself it's marching right under the leadership of the Holy Spirit and God has ordained that we are a focused group of people that we're there's a goal you say the rapture I agree the rapture but also praying God let the love of God let it so flow among us Lord and brother brems said keep malice from us Lord keep jealousy from us he said keep sickness from us keep these things from us and praying for that Lord granite Lord God let us let us be found wearing the garment of as the elect of God putting on that garment with bowels of Mercy for one another let us be found in that way - it's a place that where when there is those that's coming in those who would come they would visit it's not where they're just coming to a place it's just cold and I I believe this with all my heart the testimony that I have received from visitors not only from other churches but from that's come in here they have testified to the presence of God and to the love of God but I don't take that for granted it can go just as great as it is here it can leave you realize that we can't look at something of where it's at now or where it's been you know when you think of it ministry and different ministers I you know by God's grace I don't have when it's calling and you know many times of asking a minister to come in here they're not looking and saying you know this and that because the calm the comments that always come it's an easy group of people to preach to say brother Simon do you think and you take knowledge of that I sure do because I know that to be the truth but I always want his presence it's nothing that I look at and pride I look at it that it's because of his presence his Liberty hearts that are in tune and love the Lord are we a perfect people we're not a perfect people but we have a perfect sacrifice and were identified in a perfect sacrifice or it be to God amen I love him don't you I thank God I know not everybody's here tonight but I think God for each and every one of you I think God for your labor and how laboring but I believe with all of my heart there's more there's more for us there's more there's when we're looking at things in all my I just could keep going tonight but may we may we with all of our hearts this coming year may it be the desire as we're praying we need to pray for one another I need your prayers when we're coming here we're coming together as a people you're praying you're praying maybe you're on your way to work and you're praying the car Lord direct brother Samuel nor do you know

things that I continued that throw inspiration the Holy Spirit is breaking forth and yet then here it comes a day before and the Holy Spirit says put that on hold and this is the pathway I want you to go you know why my value is following his leadership because he is the one who is feeding us and he knows what we have need of these other things that he's dropped inspiration that here you are within hours and times of looking at and it's just such a blessing to you and you think oh Lord when I can bring it to the people but God knows he knows and I'm glad that he's here to minister to our needs aren't you that means so much to me each time I tell you for the bill and there's times when he drops things like that to me in my heart I know now he's taking me on that path and I'll say the Lord I

got in actually he started getting into my testimony and I'm one of the trustees and actually their testimony I want to give is just a continuance what brother Sam you started talking here about the church you know been a long time we were having meetings in the back room back there but the Samuel myself but the bill but they're all Bobby Carper and better all the trustees we were talking all the needs that the church needed and all that needed to be done brother Brown he was sitting back there and as we were talking he kept saying where's the money coming from every time we had a meeting he said where's the money coming from and nobody said nothing and you know we we got started working you know brothers and ourselves none of us were younger all Oh old people and we were able by the grace of God I don't believe we ever asked for a penny nobody ever got up here and asked for a penny and he seen the work that's been done to this church in the bathrooms the floors in the back and we had new stairs put up and we've done so many things the only people we've gotten in here to work on the people for the furnace and we got two brand new furnaces two brand new era conditions and all this work that's been done here in the church we never asked for a penny that's a miracle in itself why because we're a small group or not a big group no and you know I the Thursday one brother Sandhya was talking I already give this testimony Thursday I wasn't I didn't want to wait till today and then what his brother Sam you're doing into my testimony and yep but it's been just so much been working you know myself and brother Richard Sanchez and and all of us brothers got in here and we had a wonderful time we had a wonderful time working in here we worked hard and we got tired but we had a wonderful time because we were not going this work for the Lord but for the people all of this has been done it's been for you you know and like brother Samuel said you know we we have a testimony within ourselves as people come in here and see the condition of this church you know I sometimes I sit back there and I marvel at everything that's been done and we've never had one professional come in here well we need an electrician the electrician was laid off victim I Sonny and he came in here and he says he said I asked him but he said sure that I'll do it all and he said and I don't want no money first thing he told me said dad I'm not coming over here to get paid so let's get that thing out of the way lo and behold after a while we made a collection in the church and he was shocked but glad at the same time so you know I I just want to just get thanks to the people but especially thanks to God that God had moved upon the hearts of the people and we have everything paid off for all these things this little church is done and I'm just so thankful you know I came here one time when brother browning was preaching I was so tore up about his situation I had the financial situation and I left here this church what out of doubt not a penny more in my check and never looked back I made sure I told brother brought me back I said brother brownie I was I was just so tore up I just didn't know what to do what was confused my wife knew I was confused I was I just just didn't know it had no idea I sat down there and I left here like somebody turn on the light and that was it never looked back you know and what was it it was gone I'm thankful for God for how beautiful our church looks and all the work that's been done and we worked hard but it was sure we sure had a lot of fun back here brother Gomez brother Richie myself but Richie the brothers that came in here cleaned up after us you know and so forth and so on oh god what a nice place we got it I'm thankful for it god bless you yeah and let's give a special round of applause for the brothers did all the way here man you look nice sister Marian whether he's good to sit back there for the Richard doesn't ever have to get hit by the door when it opens now back there and I want to give a special thanks to the I don't know exactly which brother crawled under the church to do want the wires I'm just glad I'm not the brother what's brother Richard over the Richie where the Richie's down here I'm gonna give him a big hug well next time I see him because I would never be able to do that but thankful for the brothers that have done all the work and and and God providing for everything that's just thing that he's already provided brother Gomez is next give his testimony he's already proven he's always providing everything you need he's already provided every promise you can claim just asking his name everything that you need he's already I am NOT a person with many words but I thank God for what he had done for me I have a long testimony but I try and make it as sure as I can but being a person you know not knowing much about God and how he protected me through the years and how he had given me life and I had to really 76 years old that I am and I thought that I would know God when I was a child and and I really didn't know him but but I tried the best I could well says when I was a child to serve God yeah that was a little child that didn't have really much help from my parents didn't even know my dad when I was born he died and I didn't even see a picture of him I could have been there when I was a teen yet the Lord protected me in those years when I was in the service I didn't go to Vietnam and everybody else was going Vietnam and the Lord kept me from going to Vietnam and and there's so many times that my life games that I thought that if it would have been because of God I would have been dead a few times and I'm here by the grace of God I just wanted to talk older brothers and a sister I'd thank my pastor with the bottom of my heart God knows that I'll pray for him all the time the Lord would protect him protect his family and I thank for all the brothers and sister gather here somehow someway and one way or another you helped me to get closer to God believe me any little thing that anybody do for God he helped me to get closer to him so let's try to encourage one another and they just keep up one another in prayer and let's just say God been so good to me and I just want to try to do the best I can to pray for everyone every morning every night I pray for the brother and sister in Christ I pray for my own all my own cell loved ones I just thank God for the gift that we have we probably don't see it but we have a great gift in this place and you know sometimes we say man if I would have been in time of the Lord Jesus when he was here all the good things he did where he is doing it today what did we see her or not he's doing it his donor among us is doing it here and I thank God for that because let me tell you if I would have been the when Lord Jesus was walking on the earth one greatest thing got done in our day with brother Branham but yet it wasn't the man but he was always the gray I am Jehovah the Lord Jesus Christ they have a present why he is the one but do we see him do we hear him when he speak he speak to us all the time believe me if we can look beyond the veil of the flesh we can hear God talking to us many a times I have come with my wife talking about things that the product did not nothing about it and then the Lord from here he started to talk and I will tell my wife you know you see what but you see that's to me that is for me you see and I see it but he's doing it all the time here and and we keep looking back all the time we could look him back when he did in the past and you know what old it is we did in the past like the brothers in a little while ago what can we do with the things that we did in the past but repent but yet if we repent what are we going to do from this day on that's that's the main thing we can't repair all the things we did in the past because that's all we can do but what are we gonna do from this day are so you see I just say brother and sister I love you if you remember what the guy mean you pray pray for me because I tell you when I was going through this pain for seven day I had it the third day I say O Lord is three days already can you just eat a little bit and it was so hard that my wife had to help me get up from bed and I told my head was gonna fall off I have to hold it it was so painful but the seventh day and I was I was reading in the Old Testament I read in the morning I read at night from the Bible but I was reading about medium when medium was same things about Moses and house she was huddled on leprosy and she had for seven days and for seven day I had a pain so I said well it's okay you know God knows whole thing dad I knew God knew what I was going through I knew that and I said there's a reason for it I just got to know that I am in pain right now when this pain is gone away and when it feels so good but sometimes we have to go to those little test on trials to see when we are down there we keep looking up to him but we'll reach reach the top that's what we have to look to him the most always remember that when we feel that we are on top of the of the whatever it might be the mount or whatever how big the mountain is that is when we need the Lord the most because when we are down in the valley we know we need them but don't never forget God always be there but he's because of him we could have life pray for me and pray for my family know bless you I'm so glad well part of the family praise God I'm so glad part of the family of God I've been washed in the fountain cleansed by his blood joining us with Jesus as we travel this and I'm so glad I'm a part of the family here next year though I'm so glad I'm a part of this family of God oh I've been washed in the fountain um cleansed by his blood and we're joining with Jesus as we travel this one more time I'm so glad I was bleeding blood you know but then it went away so then there's a weak habit again I'm healed the Lord healed me infirmity you know I thank God that my brothers and sisters I thank God for you that he he's done so much for us we none of us should ever regret just living for God you know I like I always give testimonies about I got took me in 1983 I went to the tomb of brother Branham I seen the pillar of fire there you know and I then I went to Honduras and with brother browning for the first time around 1984 and I see that pillar fire comes down and but the Browning was healed by him so I thank God for everything he has showed us and His mercy what does it say his mercy endureth forever so we go forward this one to bless a year ago I'm looking for it's coming you know and and hold your families in prayer and put on your seatbelt we're leaving here god bless you [Applause] thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you lord thank you Lord for you brought me you brought me a mighty long way mighty the wave thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you lord thank you lord how do you love me yes she brought me a mighty long way for the retreat whoa thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you lord I thank you lord he brought me yes she brought me mine a long way was a mighty long way oh thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you lord thank you lord oh you brought me yes you brought me - everyone I have a testimony and it's a to me it was very very how would you say it was it's been a hard testimony but it's been a it's a good testimony this last Monday I was supposed to have a double knee replacement for both knees one on each knee and it's a major surgery so what happened was it was it come out of nowhere really what happened I'm not saying this to to boast or anything but we were we were fishing the the work back here on this floor and that's benched brother Carlos and myself and this was 13 days ago so that was the last job that that I have even to do here before to get to surgery and what happened was that I was trying to negotiate with brother Carlos on who was going to go on the floor or who was gonna go outside and cut and because I don't like to go outside with God and he makes fun of me I said I'll do the floor but then while we were getting ready I decided to lay some tarp down and I put all those saws in the back room here so I said now you could lay the floor because of my knees so what happened was the flooring didn't go too well instead of two or three hours it took us five hours and every time I would get up and down where the colors would go bendito bendito means you know he feels sorry for me so when we left he said he took some talent on I said I took some Tylenol when I went home and stayed home when that was the end of us but we got it done but the strange thing is that it was eight days before my surgery and I didn't think anything of it so the next day which was Saturday no Sunday Sunday morning Sunday morning I woke up and I had no pain in my knees so I'm puzzled because I'm thinking what's going on because if you you got to understand that I took all the tests CT scans every test that I needed to take I've been on the I've been on the Internet and took and watched hours of YouTube or these neat operations I even watched an actual one which wasn't very pretty and and I joined a gym to exercise so I figure I'm gonna get ready for this I'm ready for this probably three weeks before the operation I was give it a little bit nervous but then I committed it to the Lord and then I was praying for the doctor so when this all sprung on me it was you could say it was like an ambush almost but it was like an ambush because I didn't have the stay at the Lord I didn't have nothing so Sunday came by and I'm puzzled I'm I don't know what's going on so I Monday I thought I'm gonna go work out really really hard so I went at I worked out hard and I was okay so now Wednesday morning I'm supposed to see this doctor so the last step is talked to him he's going to tell me exactly what's going to happen so Tuesday night I prayed I said lord if I wake up I'm gonna tell him that I'm not going to get this operation but I was I was in a conflict didn't know what to do because he didn't tell me to do this and because you know how we make mistakes and I've made mistakes where I prayed and I thought the Lord I didn't know what to do so I was in a trial so what happened was Maria went with me she stayed in the lobby I don't think she wanted to see what was going to go on and I never I never talked to people and trying to tell them I'm a Christian and this and that but when I went in there he he came in finally and he says are you ready for what I'm going to tell you and I said I need to talk to you so I told him I says you know I've been a Christian for a long time I said and and then I started telling what happened I says when I was 16 I used to wrestle and I tore my left knee cartilage big operation six days in the hospital that's the way it used to be then at 18 my senior year I told my write me but that one I'd let it go in it and I didn't get that operated till thirty-nine I'm telling him all this so I said at 55 I said I could not even stand five minutes at my job I was a machinist I could not stand in five minutes and I started getting cortisone shots but at first I went to a doctor and the one that did my knee my right knee at 39 and he told me that I needed a knee replacement so I left him I made another appointment with another doctor didn't say anything he said you need a knee placement at 55 so what we did we started getting cortisone shots they would last for two months every three months I would take them and after a year in two months he got to a point where it wasn't even helping me so he got to the place where one day the Lord just I felt that he showed me but when I got this bill that he just told me that you're being robbed and from there on it was like 85% and it got better and better see the Lord gave me like nine more years after that and about four years ago I started getting cortisone shots again but all that time when I ain't getting no shots no knee replacement by then now the other needs going bad so this is where we came to where August first I got my last cortisone shot and it only lasted about four weeks so I decided I'm done I gotta get this done so we got to this place where November I made the appointment about three months ago that I was going to get operated January 7th and about and I had another appointment for cortisone before November 6th so I thought I'm gonna sneak one in here so I don't have to take all these pills because I was popping a lot of pills taking a lot of pills I was stiff I mean you know pretty bad there's just a few people who probably know that brother Cruz bill my wife and brother go misnamed oh but I didn't say too much to anybody brother Samuel they might have known but he got to got to a place where I thought I was going to sneak another cortisone shot in there when I got in there he said we can't give you another one so from then to the time that we were putting that floor I was taking a lot of pain pills and some were pretty strong but what happened was that Sunday I woke up and that's what happened I didn't know I was a trial so when I got in there I went through the whole story I says when I was 55 when I was 56 that's when it happened I said the Lord gave me nine nine ten more years and I said I think that's what he's what's going on right now and then you know I told him I said you know what if he said no it's fine he said it's fine you know I don't know what he knows what he believes but I said if you don't want me as a patient anymore you can get rid of me goes no no no no he said you're fine you're fine you do what you got to do so you know we put it that he said if we do this again we'll have to go through this again we have to go through every step all over again and I left and I said okay you know I left I was you got to understand through this whole thing as a trial because I didn't have those things or but I could say now it's been I think 13 days and I've been fine ever since I have not taken one pill for pain not one I'm standing here right now a hundred percent sometimes it's 85 percent but like brother Gomez today I asked him I said how's your shoulder he says 95 percent and then he tell he told me this I'm giving the other 5% to the devil back to the devil so you know it's something that probably would have been easier to tell you the truth I told the doctor this I said I'm more nervous talking to you than the operation because I was not scared of the uppers I was ready but I'm just thankful to the Lord that what I've learned from this is that even though I wasn't praying for this I prayed before but what I've learned from this is that we always ask him for healing or praying for someone like those we don't know when God's gonna do this we don't know I don't know I didn't know you know that's what I learned we just got to keep praying believing and when God does it it's in his time but the stainless said the other day we can't beg God and that's true we ask God so I'm just so grateful that what he's done it's been a little trial my daughter-in-law she's a physical therapist she told Maria she says well what's going to happen when the pain comes back see so these are all things that come at you while you're trying to hang on to what's going on still not knowing if it was God or not but now I know that it well I've known that whatever happens I'm just going to keep claiming it and believing his word [Applause] he's a known time God yes he is oh he's an on time God yes he is well he may not come when you want him he'll be there right on time teasing on time god yes he is see one more time and he's an on time God yes he is oh yes he's an on time God yes he this job said he may not come when you want him but he'll be hit right on time as he's in on time before I get started my demo saying don't tell me what he said I just get that all mixed up I see don't die I also dyslexic side say don't tell me what he said tell me what he for brother Browning he's just he's laugh now you sing that when I first came here I think but anyhow before I get started I thank God for my family my wife my kids my grandkids God's been good to me you know I thank him especially for her she's I've been with me through thick and thin if you put up me people of anybody anyhow she I found that she's a good nurse yeah she'd be my nurse any day she's a

through the darkest night his light still shines god is good god is good all the time yes sir amen amen how many's ever uh had something happened to you and you know God did somebody say that's a testimony I'm gonna get up from the church and I'm on testifying give God praise and then three years later brother Samuel has a testimony service and you realize boy I really I'm gonna I'm gonna tell that one tonight I got one I have several testimonies I could give but we kind of I don't think we have time for all of them but I want to just real quick give a short one and then a slightly longer one um a couple years ago about three years ago I had a surgery and I had never had surgery before and I was I was very very worried about it the devil had you know I heard stories about people getting put under and never waking up and I you know I am bleeding to death on the table and cut you up like a you know and I was I was very very worried and I I'd been praying and asking God to heal me and this was this was just the way that it was gonna be this time you know and I was and like I was thinking about what brother brother Richard was saying I didn't feel like I had thus sayeth the Lord on it like nothing had come down and settled in my heart and I was I was very distraught over it and we went sue and the kids took me to the hospital and you know sitting in the waiting room and you can't escape that there's no way yes you know by the time they they get that gown on you and they will you over to a table and I couldn't see my family and they were gone and I I didn't know if it was really the will of God and everything and I was I was laying there and I was I was just so distraught and the Lord just dropped into my heart my favorite song I remembered it and it was he gives me peace in the midst of the storm and I just started singing that song and as I sang it I started crying in the Spirit of the Lord came down when I was singing that and I was and I felt that pit that peace that he's talking about it so how many times a million times I've probably something that song here and it meant more to me than when I was when he came down in that room and not only that when I sang that I didn't know they were gonna do this here I hadn't seen my family for a while because they can't your family can't be there while they're opera they brought him around and had him come over and they they came over and talked to me daddy you're gonna be fine we're we praying for you everything's gonna be fine so and that this period of God came down and just blessed me and I I was I knew I was gonna be okay I wasn't afraid anymore I was like yep hooked me up go get it done uh-huh I didn't have any doubts anymore so I was thankful for that and I'm gonna try and keep this short but this is almost a life testimony for me I've been some leading probably since I was I think it was about 17 Sam you were what 20 21 it's been a long time and when I first started something I always wanted to you can ask any brother anything anybody that does some the Brian but the bill we delete songs anything that everyone think one thing we want to see is we want to see people God's people blessed I don't care if someone comes out and tells me great job I'm smack you on the back I don't really care about that I want to feel God's presence and see God's presence move on as people that's that's our desire and any brother that does anything in the church they want to see God's people blessed whether they're working or they're anything they're doing they want to see God's people bless and so I always put in my life I always said god I want to be where you want me to be doing what you want me to do supporting the work that you want me to be supporting so I've been here for a long time so I believe God's wanted to be here for awhile and I've had several times in my life where you know job situations you know they shut that this job shuts down there's a new job you gotta move here move there but it's always been right here with it within about an hour of the church it was over in Sandusky and then I'm over over where I am now and about five years ago I was working at FedEx I don't know if you anyone remembers I used to work at FedEx and they had a new VP come in she come in and said guess what I got great news all of you we're gonna let you all move down to Memphis so you can keep your job if you want to keep a job you have to move down to Memphis there wasn't really a choice given to us they said within the next year too we're gonna cut off all the Java development up here in Hudson Ohio so everybody was everybody was freaking out it was it was it was a scary time and so everybody started looking for new jobs and everything and I had I had several jobs on my on my plate that I wanted to sign up for and I was I was reviewing had a couple of recruiters looking at me I didn't know which way to go I mean I was also looking at moving down man can I move down to Memphis is that is that the will of God and I just I knew in my heart that wasn't the will of God I didn't think I wanted me to wanted me to leave here it's what my family is and this one my church my home churches and everything so I had those two jobs and there was one problem was how many knows what corba is anyone ever heard of CORBA when you leave a job if you got health insurance with your job you got Cobra Corp is a programming language I always get that one myself Cobra yeah Cobra is so you get three months of that you can continue your current healthcare but you got to pay for it every penny and it was gonna be about $3,000 me doing I did not have $3,000 laying around so I was praying about it I went to brother salmon we were in the back praying and I and I said I said I don't know what to do I said I don't know what job to take and I said I I've never asked for you know extra you know anything whenever I sign up for a job I just take it yes I'll take it you know I never said oh I want this and I want this and I want this I've never done that before so he said why don't we do this he said you need that korba money Cobra money you need that Cobra money to get you from this job to the next one he said why don't we put it before the Lord and you ask them if they'll pay for that Cobra asked both of them if they'll pay for that Cobra if you take that job no it was the one job I was I was looking at one instead of the I said we'll ask them and I went in and I talked to the HR lady on the phone they liked me they wanted me to come work for him I said I said I've explained to them a cobra situation I said it'll be three months because at my the new job they wouldn't give you health care until you'd work for them for three months so I would have to cover that out-of-pocket I said I know that's your guys policy I said but I tell you what if you'll pay for that Cobra and you'll give me one more week vacation I said I'll come for you I'll come work for you now and a day or two later they called back and they said yep no problem we'll sign it up no problem you come work for us I came back told by the same he said that's it yes yeah I was like yes that's what we were praying for it because because I said I said I just believe that God will provide and this is the last little part of this testimony just like I said I believe that God's always led me to be here God doesn't have to always have you in the same place God might someday all of us might God might have us go some once but I know that right now this is what God wants me and but I've been tempted I mean Columbus is a nice city there's a lot of Java development down there my kind of work and I was I've been working on a project for the last three years I've worked on a really big project and there's a lot of bosses down in Columbus who they've been working and they don't know much about the people that work up here in Twinsburg where I work for Cardinal health and I was working with one of these bosses and he said Brian you know what you are just the kind of guy I'm what I'm looking for for our architectural team because I'm just a programmer I'm a team lead by my just a programmer and he says I want you to come down because you've got on the ground experience I want you to come down to Columbus we will pay for you to move we will pay for everything I want you to come down to Columbus and we are going to give you the job title of solution architect and I've always wanted to be an architect to move on to that next level where you're designing systems the big systems and I was like oh man this is my dream and I was thinking abut Columbus how am I gonna make it work so I tried to my mind is you know it's like thank you lord I believe this is your will and I'm going going forward I didn't really wait for him to tell me if that was his well I just went ahead anyway and I started trying to work out how could I do it I talked to him maybe I could come stay in a hotel two days a week and then you know drive back every other day and you know maybe we can work something out he said no no no if you're gonna come down here and do this job you're gonna have to move down here I said we don't have the budget to support you stay in hotels okay so that I called up brothers and I was talking to sue and I said well maybe we can move like 30 or 40 miles north of Columbus and then I could we could go to brother Erikson's on to Thursdays and then on Sundays we could come back to the and she was like make it work it could work and I you know I called up by the Samuel and I asked him prayed he didn't tell me Amy he didn't say no but he didn't say anything like that I called him up he said let's pray about it let's pray about it and see if it's really the will of God you know and you know it said you know it's it sounds interesting because like I said it's what I wanted for my career it's really what I wanted and we we both been praying about it and he called me one night later that week and he he said you know brother Brian I've been praying about this and you know looking at it and and the way that you were talking about it he said it just dropped in my heart Lord spoke to me and really said this really isn't his will not definitely not you know not this time it's not God's will and like I said in my heart I knew I knew he was right I knew it was right but I wanted so badly that job and I said lord I it was so hard to I called them up the next day and I said I'm really sorry I said I want this so bad I said but it's just not gonna work for me right now I said my family my church I don't search everything I have is up here I just can't do it and the guy that was gonna hire me he was a Christian too he said well I understand that you know I have a whole church he played he plays an orchestra or something down there and he he said I understand that he said I wish you good luck and I felt so bad there was a guy at my job and said you better take this because this will be the only this could be the only time your career I had one time in my career somebody asked me to two to go to a place and I didn't take it and I've regretted it every day saying so I was so tore up about that but the last part of the testimony is so I've been working still at this job for the last you know I've been continuing on the projects been going on for three or four years now and they came I got a new boss I keep getting new bosses but I got another new boss he came in and he said Brian I want to talk to you about something and I said well what's that because I'm still just a programmer and I'm still team lead senior engineer he said what I want to do is we're gonna restructure the department what I want you to be is I want you to be a solution architect here in twins were we're gonna we said we're gonna change your title we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna change your title we're gonna we're gonna you're gonna be designing the big system that we're working on you're gonna be one of the main ones in charge I just I just a thank you Lord you know that thing that I had wanted so much it wasn't the time yet and it wasn't the right opportunity but and that's that's the title I have right now at my job solution architects so I appreciate the Lord I always wanted to put him first I would said Lord I want to do what it is you want me to do where you want me doing it and so God is good he's good all the time [Applause] praise God sister mercy has a testimony and then the young people are gonna come and sing and whether Shane I think you have a testimony tonight too but the chains going to give his testimony while the young people are getting set up and then they'll give their testimony they're there they're gonna sing their song and I think that's it for tonight but sister mercy makes her way listening that this is my desire to honor you Lord with all my heart I worship you [Music] all I have within me forgive you praise war all that I adore it's in you [Music] lord I give you my heart I give you my soul Holly for you alone every breath that I take every moment I'm away lord have your way praise the Lord this is truly an honor and a blessing to give God all the glory even for my life you know I've always I was I was brought up Catholic and didn't know the Lord other than just the Catholic Church and how they taught you and and once the Lord got ahold of my life and it was like the brother was saying he became a reality in my life and once it became a reality in my life it was something I had to share my mom my sisters everybody can get ahold of it because it was like oh my god you know this god is amazing it's like he is alive he's this is the true God so then my mother who had a very difficult life just just so many hardships and my father passed away when I was five years old and mom raised us by herself I love my mother I have so much I thank the Lord for my dear mother and she she never gave up and I my sisters when the loire heck out of one of my life there was a complete change it was a transformation like they couldn't believe because when I was in the world I was in the world and then what happened they seen this transformation in me then my mom and my sister got scared and they were like she's in a cult she's in a cult we got to get her out of that call we gotta do something to get her out of that cult so then they start to plot in the meantime the Lord's dealing in my life and mom comes over and my mother's oh she was always angry bitter and angry and it was like and I was floating because I was God had dealt and changed my life so much I was floating in a different world I was so excited like and my mother couldn't believe where I come from and so then she was so agree and I remember her sitting on a sofa and I had the television and she was watching it and she was just full of so much anger and all of a sudden the Lord just something happened and I start to talk to about the Lord and she was sitting on a sofa and I put my hand on my mother's shoulder in the back I says mom why are you always so angry why are you always so mad and then the Lord put words in my mouth to tell my mom and I didn't know that but my mother wouldn't move she would not move she did she didn't do nothing she was frozen and I thought and I just kept talking I don't know what it was it kept talking and talking and after a while I saw my mother's eyes and tears were coming down her eyes and I thought you know I didn't know what's going on I just kept on you know but the Lord was leading I was just a tool in his hand so then my mom when you know she she just she couldn't say anything she just when she but I think when it was over she just stood up she goes oh let me go leave me alone and she left and I thought I don't know what went there anyways and then it wasn't till the Lord that Belinda and Mom were saying okay we gotta get her out of there we gotta get out of that cult and then they came to church and for the brownie was there and sister browning and the Lord was dealing with my mom through for the Browning and from then on my mother knew and my sister knew that the reality of the Lord Jesus Christ he changed my life she knew it they knew it and even my mom said this is her testimony she goes do you know that day I came over your house and I was so angry I said yeah mom she goes do you know that I wanted to scream and yell at you and tell you leave me alone shut up leave me alone but she goes do you know something had me by my throat and I grabbed my throat and it would not let me speak because she knew because God knew that if mom would act that way I'd shut up and I wouldn't say anything so guy thought I got this in the control don't you worry I hold her throat she wants anything you keep speaking until I get ahold of her so god is good he's kept me all my life you know he continues to be my strength is Amanda strength what she's going through and God has given us direction there and we're just taking it as the Lord leads and even a man they give you a quick test a toastie testimony so I just want to with you since she wasn't here

come and brother Jane you give your testimony young people make ready for her specials tonight let's just sing that he is my everything he is my old he is my everything both great and small he gave his life for me made everything new he is my everything none other will do one more time he is my everything he's my own he is my everything both great and small he gave his life for me yes made everything here's my everything [Music] myself us and sister needed to the winner you thought you don't know if you guys are familiar with that but it's a think seventeen and up or 18 and up singles only just gathered together to draw closer to God and from all around the world and just going to share some things what God kind of did for me and I think Paul too wants to share some things but I guess the main theme of it was not to be ignorant Satan's devices you know we have these phones and just so many things you know video games all this stuff this the way brother Samuel and and others broke it down but the theme really was just being disconnected from God and also distracted from God and and for me you know I just got this new job I know it's just a lot of time you know gets wrapped up in it but I just first wanted to thank the Lord for just just just really making itself just personal to me and how much he cares where I'm at right now and also for brother Samuel he wasn't supposed to originally preach for the Winter youth retreat it was supposed to be brother Aaron something and I just thank the Lord for him you know he does so much for us youth he hasn't set his house you know once every Friday and for his wife too I just so many people came up to me and it's a man that message was so good and I said yeah that's my pastor says why ice and you know they plan on visiting and it's just I just think brothers thank you brother Sam for everything you do for us the seen and unseen things and just it's just amazing but just that that concept just how God brought everything together every message was so personal just just about the Satan's devices and one of the biggest things for me was just how the Lord reminds us when we get off track a little bit whether it's our time we're maybe spending too much time in one area and whether it's it was through you know this retreat just God got me straight again got me back on track and I know he can share some things too but one of the last nights to God's presence was just so real after brother Matt had preached is the last night the expectation and things are high and we were just worshiping it was going up yonder we started singing that and I don't know if you ever seen those big like fans in a basketball gym or something it's like someone turned a fan on and I was pause me and brother Michael Belton in the front row I was like just a huge rush of wind just swept through the place and I had my eyes closed and I opened up I was like wow and I look back and then you know sisters started dancing to rejoice and people were running and it's just a good time you know I it's just just I think I've heard just pastors who care brother Paul and all that just they care about the youth you know because we're coming up here we're the next generation you know if the Lord tarries well this is my first time speaking in front of you also a little nervous you can't really tell but I'm nervous you know I want to share some real quick testimonies I'm not going to be long me as you know well I don't get out as much you know probably because I'm a homeschooler but you know I know that Lord really you know he's really been the only one with me he's been helping me a lot to overcome my fears anxieties going to certain places god I would just get so scared you know I get scared you know I would be like so afraid and I just I didn't know how to comprehend it I was just like yeah I don't think I can make it in life I'm an I'm just I'm so afraid of everything you know I'm just like I'm so scared you know I can't I can't go with a certain place and stuff like that but you know the Lord really has helped me and you know what for our family we went through a lot where so many of you know 2017 my papaw you know he went home to be a floor and just that's really struck me I thought yeah I never would have thought my papaw girl so you know I always he was my buddy you know my best friend but uh you know and I was just in the shower you know that I want you nights I was just crying it's the Lord you know I everything there's so much change going on and I don't know how to comprehend cuz we also just moved to I mean wow you know we just moved and and you know but I was just saying Lord you know just you know I just need your help I don't know I don't know what to do I just said I don't know what's going on but it was like you something just spoke to my hurt you know I thought you know I everything's changing like for me everything was just changing and I'm a person that doesn't like change well uncle Jerry a week before peple passed away he said well he said you know I know a lot of hole not a lot of people like change you said what it depends on what the change is that's pretty good so of course that that was needed that was needful at that time and so I was thinking me I just I don't know what I do I'm just Christ the Lord I don't know if I can I can't do this and why there's so much changing but it was like some spoke my heart said I've never changed I'll always be with you oh my I mean that was Wow I needed that and I and I I thought I got courage and I got a surge and I went out and I started going to youth cancer I said well you know I don't get around much so I don't you know there's I'm still learning some things so but I went to be why see last year and apprentice of Lord just come down and the services and I was just worshiping and having a wonderful time you know and that that's what he wants to do to have you once you have a wonderful time we're not we're not we're not we weren't made to be sad and miserable and just oh my goodness I'm so afraid everything no you don't have to be because he said he'd be with you and he never looked forsake you and he's just I'd say he's really dying a tremendous work in my life I mean he's delivered me from some things I never thought I'd deliver from that's just the kind of God he is he's that kind of a guy you can't you can't comprehend I mean he's wonderful and even at winter youth retreat like you said Prince Loren just coming down the service that's like we had a good time didn't we my goodness what a time we get in the door man we start talking and stuff and just fellowship around the word and well just talk anyway you know that guy is now guys are so but it's it's it's barely been wonderful I I just so appreciate Bloor what God's doing and he is working and and just real quick you know I'm not taking too long but I can't believe I'm doing this but you know what you know God's got a plan for my life I know I'm here for a purpose to know my mom can witness and testify that God's got a not meant to sometimes like see it we're just meant to believe it that's by faith sometimes it's hard but you know you just got to put your faith and trust in God and believe in him and believe that the work that he's already starting your life he'll finish it and so it's just you know just keep praying for me you know I know I know I don't I'm you know I'm a quiet person I'm a guy very few words you know but uh but you know just pray for me you know that God will help me you know with with my career's my futures and you know he's got my life in his hands so I'm just trusting [Applause] singing a few songs to the Lord for his honor and glory although testimonies we heard today just

specials but I think the Lord what encouragement you know it gives to our hearts and you know there's many testimonies that could have been shared that what has already been done within the past year that are things that would be very I think needful to be reminded but I'm grateful that how that the testimonies that are given and my you can just see the hand of God and I think God for that you know if we look at the testimonies and we take them in the right light it shows that God not only is he among us but the Lord is mindful of every situation and there's things that you can look at and the testimonies that you give don't ever think that one is too insignificant because whatever it is it's personal and there's someone else that might be dealing with or going through that same thing and they can look at that and they can take encouragement from that very thing right there and say Lord how you directed that one you'll direct me as well amen water water what a comfort it is to us so boy I tell you we have to do this again you have to do this again it just has been way too long and I just I got to feeling really bad I thought my I should have just read a scripture tonight and that's it or not even got up here at all but we're so so blessed of the Lord amen we have a reason to be happy we have a reason to be happy Amen you know I looked at that scripture in Luke 15 how many even know where that talks about the prodigal son and you remember the two had the younger younger the prodigal and then he had the elder son do you remember what the elder son his complaint was at first he said what is all this music what's all this music and all this going on he didn't understand but you see what it was one had come home and you know what it means something to our hearts our hearts are full of joy we're not living this way because we have to we're living because we love him and that's the real joy of the Lord in our lives amen let's just wrap our heads an order prayer
