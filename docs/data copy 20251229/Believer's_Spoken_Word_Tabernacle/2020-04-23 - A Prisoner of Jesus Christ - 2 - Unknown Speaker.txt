Christ god bless you we certainly want to say some greetings to each of you we miss you and certainly just can't wait for the opportunity as it would allow for us to be able to start together back together again and we want to just turn our attention and our hearts to the word of the Lord tonight and just to see what the Lord would would have for us I believe that God knows what our needs are and so tonight as we would just begin to look into the word of the Lord I want to go back into begin into a few places that we were in last Thursday in looking at how where Paul is is expressing here in Philemon chapter one and verse one and Paul would write and I just want to read the first phrase of that Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ and then in acts 28 16 this is where it records when they had arrived to Rome and when we came to Rome the Centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him then in verse 30 and Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house and received all that came in unto him preaching the kingdom of God and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence no man forbidding him amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you would have your seats I want to continue to look at this thought on a prisoner of Jesus Christ and when we think of this thought of it we recognize that where Paul is at and what Paul is speaking of when he would write this even in that personal letter to Philemon regarding uneasiness Paul would also have the same riding and declaration in the book of Ephesians which Ephesians was also a prison epistle one that Paul wrote while in prison in this time same with the book of Philippians the same with the book of Colossians same with that and within Timothy and you find that with within this that Paul had experienced being in prison already three other times he wrote of that in 2nd Corinthians when there were men who had come in among the Church of the Living God which it was known that there would be men that would come in those that were not really fully converted but they came in and they weren't lazy Paul called him workers but he said they were deceitful workers they had other intentions in mind he would say in another place their Grievous wolves they did not have the mind of the flock or the kingdom of God in in there and we we see that within this of how that these as it would be laid out within these times and Paul would write of this a prisoner of Jesus Christ even even though Paul himself was here in Rome and he was awaiting the the trial the court appearance just like if somebody you know today if you were to have a court appearance and you know there is a time that they give you and say well possibly by this time and you know you've seen things where there's been judges around us here in these localities where sometimes they've actually lost their job by voting because maybe they haven't moved the docket or the cases that have just started to pile up and we find that this here was a situation that Paul did not know how long that this was going to be it was not something very simply that you know his Paul had been transferred from Agrippa to Felix and these things you know he just went from one to the other and it wasn't like a day in between there was a little space of time but there was nothing like this right here where Paul was in a place of just waiting and he was waiting for that appeal that he had made unto Caesar and the very thing that what is so pressed upon my heart as the Lord was just just some weeks ago just pressing and looking at this is to see how that within the midst of this circumstance how the Holy Spirit so dealt with Paul's life in the writing of these prison epistles that it is so much within these that it so captures the very nature and the character and expression of Jesus Christ it so captures that it so captures the the capping of it and here Paul is waiting and you know there are things that I think within this that we can take such a lesson from this where it says Paul was waiting in that rented house and like we looked at it last week Paul himself was there and there was a soldier that was was keeping him the whole time these soldiers were actually some of the elite guard within that of Rome and Paul was considered though he was not a mal factor though there were things that Paul had not seemingly according to even the one that had placed him in this kind of a custody as though Paul was of a of a serious threat like has that of a malefactor as I said but yet it was enough to where Paul himself built the others going in common prison Paul would be kept here in his own hired house and with that of of a soldier where they were changed every four hours so you know within it there was not much as far as you could see within paul's of life that it would be a very personal it would be he would not be one who would be left to himself every four hours they were being changed out but these are things that I believe that we can look at that you know Paul's time in Rome was not a waste God never in the mid just say it like this god never wastes our time though we may waste it because we don't sense God's purpose for our life at the moment and this is something that I I just it's just to see that the will of God is is is so great and I believe for every heart and every life of which God's will is revealed and has been revealed it is such a precious thing that God would reveal his will even for a heart to come into repentance even for in sanctification that those are things that even with sanctification Paul would say these things every man ought to know how to possess his vessel unto sanctification for this is the will of God these are things that are before us it's such a value to a heart to a life that the will of God is such a value it means more than anything of this life it's things that when walking in God's will many can look at a life and say I don't know if I'd make that decision I don't know if I'd go that route why did you choose this or why did you do that but we recognize that the desire that we have in our heart is for the will of God and we recognize that within that we need his leadership even to prepare us for that moment for the next step for the next Junction we are resting in him that he would prepare us that we would have a willingness to be able to surrender to his will because here we find where Paul is writing and if I may just refer to this here in the book of Romans chapter 1 Paul has wrote to the Romans now this is years before Paul would ever get there it's well years before this letter is wrote and Paul would write this testimony and say for God is my witness whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his son that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers making requests if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you for I long to see you that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end you may be established that is that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me now I would not have you ignorant brethren that oftentimes I purposed to come to you but was let hitherto that I might have some fruit among you also even as among other Gentiles I am a debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians both to the wise and to the unwise so as much as is in me I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also for and I want you to catch these statements I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus cries for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith unto faith as it is written the just shall live by faith now we realize when we look at this here in in the book of Acts we we know that God when he spoke to Paul and he revealed himself to Paul remember how when Paul met him there on the road to Damascus Paul said Lord who are you what would you have me do and here Paul was so tired and so yoked with that of the religious of that day but here the voice the vadik's that speaks out of that pillar fire I am Jesus whom thou persecutors and we find that that revelation that Paul would have it would be a greater revelation than the rest of them would have although that they would all be partakers of the divine nature of Almighty God but yet Paul would have this revelation and God would continue to unfold to him that indeed that of Jehovah of the oldest Jesus of the new and it would continue to move forth to where Paul was ordained to take the gospel to the Gentiles as much as Peter was to take it to the Jews and we find that here when Paul remember here is Paul you know he begins to move as God would lead him into the different places and you find that Paul would move into the Gentile parts of the world in different places there in Asia Minor and other places you know Cyprus and other things and we know there were Gentiles that were there but every time that Paul came into those places remember there were two Jews that were withstanding him the Jews were stirred up against him it was the Jews that they they they could not stand and what it was was representative it was that life and they were so stirred they looked at it that Paul was taking away and trying to lead lead other Jews from that of the message of Moses or the law and it was quite on the contrary Paul was not trying to lead them away Paul was trying to show them that the fulfillment of the law is in Jesus Christ and he was trying to let her know that the life itself now has come what who was spoken of and have been prophesied to come hasn't become and now the Holy Spirit now is among us the spirit of the atonement but yet they would not receive that and we find that here Paul you know as he's coming in his different parts in the journey he comes here and he's in coming you know to Ephesus and remember Paul has been gathering almost we could say making his last rounds before going to Jerusalem and Paul makes this this declaration here in to do to that in Ephesus in acts 20 verse 22 and he said now behold I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me but none of these things move me neither count on my life dear unto myself so that I might finish my course with joy and the Ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of God and now behold and know that ye are among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God shall see my face no more and that's where many of the brethren the Saints you can just imagine it they were troubled at that statement you'll see my face and no more Paul knew he said I'm bound in the spirit you see he was a prisoner of Jesus Christ he just did not become a prisoner of Jesus Christ this was not a play on words when he was in Rome Paul was already a prisoner of Jesus Christ he had become yoked to the word by the spirits hey man Paul once had an absolute there he had an absolute of all of the the Pharisee teachings and all those things but Paul and on the road to Damascus Paul he found and met a greater absolute an absolute that was the end of all strife Paul met the Lord Jesus Christ after his death burial resurrection in a section he revealed himself to him and Paul turned loose of everything else and he was tied in a union to that of the word remember Paul himself for three years he searched out his experience he would not even for three years he would not proclaim anything but he searched out what happened on the road to Damascus that it must be tied into the word what was it speaking this is what we are restored to is coming back into that Bible faith where a man would know where he would stand with God it is not upon feelings or sensations although all those things can come with it but it's got to come to a place that a man or a woman it's founded upon Christ the solid rock and they know within their life my life has been changed it's not me making a difference its Christ in me that has come and here was Paul standing as a witness here I go bound in the spirit to Jerusalem I don't know what things are gonna be for me oh my what trust axe 2110 now here they come to some other brethren a new familiar here is a profit that comes here is pawpaws the profit to the age there can be minor prophets those prophets that arise up but let me just say this very clearly a prophet e a prophet in the New Testament is a preacher so nobody is going to tell me they're a prophet and they don't preach because that ain't scriptural come on somebody they're not a prophet in setting in church and well they don't preach but you know they're a prophet that is not scriptural are you with me now you see here when it comes into this place here comes Hagia bus he's moved in and the Bible says a judy and a certain prophet named Agabus and when he was coming to us he took Paul's girdle and bound his own hands and feet and said thus saith the Holy Ghost so shall the Jews at Jerusalem buying the man that owned at this girdle and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles and here they write has Luke would write this when we heard those things both we and they of that place besought him not to go to Jerusalem then Paul answered no look at this answer what mean ye to weep and to break my heart for I am ready not to be bound only but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus this is God's purpose moving in his heart this is not the DNA of a man come on somebody this is not the DNA of Paul who was of the tribe of Benjamin this is the DNA that comes from the tree of life where the purpose of God means everything where a person can be so overtaken to say I'm now ready that's a question are you ready for the rapture can you say I'm now ready this is what Paul was declaring I'm now ready I don't have to wait till I get to Jerusalem I'm now ready and when he would not be persuaded we see saying the the will of the Lord be done now what Agra bespoke was the truth is that right the Holy Ghost came upon Angelus a true prophet of God he was not the prophet of the age but he came and the Holy Spirit moved down what he said was absolutely truth but notice this this is where it shows within the heart and life of an individual it's got to be so solid that your dependency is solidly resting in the purpose of God that has been revealed to your life think of these these that were gathered around Paul they were crying and they were pulling on him trying to persuade Paul don't go up Paul you don't know what waits Paul you know I'm telling you there was so much fear and scare that was gone all around there it took the grace of God to expel all of that to where Paul could say I'm now ready to go up to Jerusalem I'm ready to die you know what it was then the random tells us that what Paul had witnessed when he saw Steven and Steven take his last breath he said Paul it never left his mind and Paul was so determined that as Steven had sealed his life Paul was determined I'm gonna seal my life for the gospel I want to ask you tonight are you that determined that for you to seal your life for the gospel of Jesus Christ let me just say it like this this these statements are not things that came out overnight this is from growth and maturity which is a result of dying out Paul said I die daily these these portions of the word that are given to encourage you not listen we're not ignorant of this here was a life that here would put his heart and his life before God to die out daily the preparation that God would pray with wit would place and bring through a life in order that his desires that God's desires might be fulfilled through our life God has an achievement that he alone works out as he gains preeminence in our lives think of this here comes Paul you know he arrives here you know in in in Rome and let me just read this here in acts 28 here here is Paul and he wants in verse 17 he requests after now he's here he is he's he's there in Rome he's awaiting his appeal before Caesar to appear there he calls the chief Jews together then are there in Rome and he begins to speak to them and he says men and brethren though I have committed nothing against the people or customs of our fathers yet was i delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans who when they had examined me would have let me go because there was no cause of death in me but when the Jews speak against it I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar not that I had aught to accuse my nation of for this calls therefore I've called for you to see you to speak with you because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain I was not simply talking about the chain that was upon his arms but the hope of Israel what was the hope of Israel the Messiah they meant the outpouring of that life which David would write by where a David would write let all Israel hope in the Lord hey Manny this was this was the expectation and notice when Paul would would write this this is so strikes my heart he said in verse 19 I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar not that I had aught to accuse my nation listen there in what we read within here what a readiness we've seen with Paul leading up to Jerusalem now here he is standing there before Felix standing before them and before the rest and Paul would say I appeal unto Caesar Paul he's letting it be known right here he did not appeal because of a vindictive reason it was not out of malice it was not out of hatred what a readiness this is the same readiness he witnessed in Steven when Steven could say lay not this sin at their charge this was the same readiness when our Lord and Savior when he hung on the cross and they were making fun of him they had spit on him they had rejected him and what did he say Father forgive them for they know not what they do that's readiness that's readiness amen Paul he had become so ready so yielded saw overtaken with the love of God such molding such training that he had received for this moment now let's look here let's begin to look by the help of the Lord into this life of a prisoner of Jesus Christ and as Paul would write here in the book of Philippians one of the prison epistles here Frank how Paul would would express in verse 1 Paul entomo theists the servants of Jesus Christ to all the Saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi with the bishops and deacons grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ I thank my god upon every remembrance of you always in every prayer of mine for you all making requests with joy for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it unto the day of Jesus Christ what a character the first words that he would write in this letter of coming out has nothing to do with his circumstances it has nothing to do with Paul he's letting me know my prayers I've not ceased to pray for you and make requests with joy for what for the furtherance of the gospel in your life all what a lesson that is to be learned right here amen I'm talking about a ready life power without character is satanic it's alive that's to be lived life in humility here Paul this is we want to we find eternal life living for others Paul did not take the first few verses and tell us how bad it is I am I'm trained and there's a guard that relieves every four hours I want you all to pray for me very earnestly I need you he wasn't writing about that you see what it was it wasn't Paul in the front weld it went Paul before everything else it was Christ then others Paul was last that's an overcoming life Satan is the opposite Satan is me first and I don't care who comes after me or who I've got a walk off to do what I want to do that Satan's way but that's not God's Way and God Himself will not force his way into us he don't force his way God don't force his will upon nobody even when it has it's God's will for a life and that life can be where it's written in the will of God but yet God does not force that will because remember it's got to come on free more agency every man in every woman has got to make a choice and listen to me closely you're choosing does not stop you've got to choose every day and every moment of your life that I desire I'm going to do God's will you've got choices I've got choices daily that are put before us how we going to respond how we going to take this approach Paul said in verse 7 even as it is a meet for me to think this of you all because I have you in the heart in as much as both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel ye are all partakers of my grace you know Paul was letting him know we're in this together this is the very listen this is the very prophet of God that had received the inspiration and wrote about a body and would write if one member hurts they all heard if one rejoice we all rejoice he this was not just something that was wrote it was it was from his heart what was live Paul seemed that God would allow that to be unfolded that you and I could understand it because you see God loves to be relatable is that right and so hound that this would be where Paul was letting them know you're right here in my heart you're represented in in both my bonds and in defense and confirmation of the gospel because those that he was writing to in Philippi the Philippian Church remembered those who he was writing to they they themselves have been mourn witness of the gospel of Jesus Christ that had come to them through the ministry of Apostle Paul and Paul was letting them know as Paul would say in Ephesus Paul would say you know in the other places he would say it over and over that this grace in the book of Colossians what God has given to me it was a gospel that is given for you that you might fulfill the will of God he was letting to know were sharing together in this grace for God as my record how greatly I longed after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ the innermost part of his life and I pray and this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge in all judgment that you may approve things that are excellent that you may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ being filled with the fruit of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God he's admonishing the believers to keep growing that the love of God would abound in you in all judgment that there would be a continual growing in their lives you see this was no different you read in the book of Colossians read in the book of Thessalonians first and second Thessalonians has been primarily the first book of Thessalonians Paul would open his letters of how then he himself had been praying and the prayer of his desire would be that the fruit would be made manifest in the life of the believers he would write how that you know the desire is that that life would settle in into your heart that you might know Christ back that of faith that of faith revealed and love in your heart he would write the desire that fruits might abound within your life that's what Paul was praying for you know what Paul realized Paul recognized that he was it could not be anything that was man handled it had to be God to do the work brother and sister one thing I realized I can preach to I'm blue in the face even just not my voice that makes a difference it's got to come the Holy Spirit into hearts that are receptive because God don't want anybody to serve him out of a their freighter they're scared or one or more there might be fear have to sit on your life to realize there's a real hell I tell you there's a real hell to go to there's a real happen to go to hell is real nothing is real but hell was not made for human beings it was made for the devil and his angels but I can tell you whatever kind of life you're living will show where your york to in your influence if you let the things in the world you're being influenced from beneath there's a pool going on a downward pool but if there is a love and a desire for the things above then brother there's where you got representation it's pulling from above you gotta pull to perfection oh yeah I think many times I had just you know thought about that many times I thought oh God has it been so long since the word hell has been said in the church I'm talking about churches around you know you say brother Samuel wewe shouldn't be preaching that let me tell you something there is a heaven to gain and a hat to lose hell is real it's not a joke and heaven is real the rich young ruler was a good boy he did everything and he kept all the commandments but he wound up in hell he wound up in hell because he left the world too much he had one thing when Jesus touched that one thing in his life he wasn't willing to get rid of it you know what it comes down to God touches things in a person's life and then they want to say I can't do it but I'm telling you God ain't asking you to do it God said I already have done it for you if you'll just accept it but the rich young ruler he had he went away sad because he had great possessions then the Bible said he lifted up his eyes and hail well that was free but verse 12 of Philippians 1 but how would you should understand brethren that the things which happen unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel these are the same believers once you think of this now we can bring this right down into our homes these are the same believers he's writing to that in that city government men and when there was an uprising after a man began to lose money when Paul cast that demon out of that woman who was following them Paul had to wait till God give him permission to do it and when he did it though they seemed the loss of their revenue and their income and they went straight to the rulers and they took Paul and Silas and they threw him into prison but once again here was Paul and Silas they were in some very dire circumstances but the Bible said along about midnight this is after they'd been beaten they had already been striked they begin to sing praises unto God they begin to praise the Lord and you understand we know what to place these were believers that had a witness of how the power of God had come down when Paul and Silas had began to worship the Lord they would not allow the walls of the prison to hold their spirits in there but I'm telling you no matter what situation you're in don't let the situation hold you captive there is nothing should hold you captive as a son and daughter of God you've been set free I don't care how many cinderblock walls how many and bars or whatever more there is nothing that can hinder the word of Almighty God he let him know I want you to know what's happened because remember after all they could have been wondering God brought deliverance before in Philippi the walls come flying down and the Philippian jailer was led to the Lord and his house is that right along with many other Saints that accumulated but you see God doesn't always do the same thing the same way all the time but yet he's the same God you and I can look back and say well he opened the Red Sea so there's a need in my life he's the same God and I can say Amen for that but to see what God will do he'll always manifest his nature and his character the same way God is always the waymaker but you see why were they even in Philip I see it comes back to this place and Paul no doubt these things are coming back to them as believers why was Paul in that Philippi in jail it was more than just about a disturbance in the city God knew I gotta get Paul there because I've got a son of God right there that needs to hear this gospel and he needs to see the power of God that'll break the yoke of bondage about his life God knows what he's doing to get things in position and Paul's letting them know hey God a week but what's happened to me is for the furtherance of the gospel so that my bonds look how Paul writes of this so that my bonds in Christ he ain't talking about the trains upon his arms now he's talking about the bonds of love from his heart the bonds of Christ my bonds in Christ are manifest we're in all the palace and in all other places if you have an opportunity and you look to see where these hired houses are where they would have to rent out and stay there awaiting their court appearance you would find that they're not real real far from that of the palace but yet there is a great distance from that of the palace it's a very very small dwelling and remember now in this dwelling Paul has been receiving not just the chief of the Jews but after he had just spoke to the chief of the Jews that we read in the book of Acts remember they reasoned among themselves when Paul got into the Book of Isaiah the Jews didn't show up no more but remember at that time this is when Paul turns then to the Gentiles there had been Gentiles that had been warned throughout the other previous journeys throughout around but here in the midst of this time you're talking about being alone Paul was alone sure at times he would have been timotheus he would have at pride itis he would have different ones that would actually come in and room with him in that period of time but yet within at all think about how alone that he must feel how it would be so easy to get down on himself how easy it would be to complain how easy it would be to marmar there's no doubt that there one temptations all around you think the devil didn't try to show up and peck on Paul's shoulder and say hey if you hadn't opens your mouth you wouldn't be here if you had just said quiet and not appealed to Caesar you even know it you said it's yourself Paul they were going to turn you loose because they could not find any charge against you you know what I'm talking about there's some times where even you or me have looked at a situation we know it's the will of God but yet sometimes in the midst of a waiting when the midst of when we're waiting for the next move or the next Junction that's when the enemy can move in and begin to try and God will allow him to try that's the same way he did in the days of Noah Noah waited in the ark seven days it was on the seventh day that the rain came Noah thought day after day surely the rain is going to come but it did not come until God's appointed time no matter how much the enemy tried to attempt him Pat Noah knew where he was supposed to be at that time and I'll say not only for Paul Paul also knew this was God's will that had been unfolded for his life the same as it is for you and me when situations arise even though you and I can look at and say well maybe should I went this way or should I went that way but there's an absolute you can always come back to and say wait a minute I did not open the door wherewith I have walked through but God has opened this door and it gives you a peace and a comfort to wait on the Lord this is a prisoner of Jesus Christ and many of the Brethren in the Lord waxing confident by my bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fear now notice this in that of the palace the bonds of Christ they were not talking about Paul the prisoner of Rome that's not the bonds they were talking about this was the bonds that were in Christ that that reality that revelation that it's so gripped Paul's heart it was that which had affected the lives of servants the lives of different ones throughout Caesars house even as history would account even some of Nero's very family members were converted under Paul's ministry here's the end of the live of Philippians 4 let me just jump to it real quick now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever amen salute every saint in Christ Jesus the brethren which are with are with me greet you all the saints salute you chiefly they that are of Caesars household so it had not just went into the palace but all those in Caesars household servants all the different ones even family members now think of it Paul said I want you to know what's happened to me is happened for the furtherance of the gospel if Paul had not been here I wonder if Paul had said men when they go hurry up with this I'm sick and tired of being locked in my house I'm tired of this I want it you're not wanna I want to go I wanted this you know sometimes what we miss that we miss the blessing of God is because we complain too much at the circumstances we find ourselves in now listen it's not the sole part when we've really been converted it's not the sole part because you'll find yourself quickly repenting and retracting because you know it ain't the right attitude it's not the right take on it but this guy the flesh that of the Spirit the the flesh those that God gets weak sometimes he always wants his way wants to get out there but think of it within this time it was necessary that Paul would be right here no doubt then they covered here is a man that had went around and preached meetings though they weren't maybe real big meeting some meetings he had great audiences and things like that such as when he would peer before their men Athens in Greece and but many of the audiences of which Paul himself would preach too would be very small the Bible would say from house to house it was very small gatherings but nonetheless it would be gatherings that Paul could go to and freely fellowship with the people of God but in this particular circumstance right here it was not so much that easy but yet Paul opened up the rented house he was in and Paul would preached the gospel to those of the servants different ones of Nero's household that were coming in brother let me tell you something in order for the bonds of Christ to be made manifest it could not have been Paul telling them telling them who were coming in of the meager circumstances and I'll tell you it's been so hard today you know I had nothing to eat I had nothing because you know Paul he even writes in this letter about being hungry he would write I know how to be content but you see Paul did not put that out because why that is not the gospel but there were things that came along and Paul would be able to so surrender that he was not Paul that was touching the hearts of rose family and Nero service it wasn't that at all it was Christ who he was yoked to that was actually touching their life there was an impression of the very image of Christ that was being reflected through Paul's life and ministry let me tell you something you may not remember who preached what but as long as there's been an effect of the image of Christ as long as the Holy Ghost comes down and he impacts that life with his divine image as long as he comes in the meeting that's all that matters oh my sometimes the circumstances that we frankly would have erupted to complaint we frankly would have a right to ask what good is going to come out of this you know sometimes there's things where on every one of us get in tight places I'm talking about tight places that are not convenient or comfortable to the natural man then they're tight places where there be there's a tendency for that old flesh man to raise up but this is where is let me just just for sake of time let me just refer to it how did the message Jubilee year brother Brown would say it like this let me just refer to instead of read it he said you take a man or a person that says I'll tell you're going to God I used to cuss but I quit cussing he said that's what you did said another person said glory to God I used to be I used to drink so much but I quit drinking he said that's what you did that's what you did that's a moral thing you did you stopped or if you could only get that lined up with the power of God where a person said you know what Lord I'm sick of this life then it's more than a moral thing it becomes a god thing but you see to receive Jesus Christ is to receive his person is to receive him not an attribute of him but him and this is where then you find hearts and lives and people that you know you come into tight places on the job among family died in situations and here to see that where a person can testify of another one and say I'll tell you that's a real Christian I've seen them in tight places that's they're not in popular but I've seen them when the odds are stacked against him I've seen him when people have been pushing their buttons and work I've seen them in tight places and you know what there are Christian in tight places you see one one makes that the seal you're sealed the baptism of the Holy Ghost the seal of the Living God you are sealed unto the day of redemption it seals you on both sides coming and going are you with me now it seals coming and going you're a Christian through and through you're sealed by the Spirit of God amen Europe he'll be brother Benson he'll be christ-like today he'll be christ-like tomorrow Christ like the next day in the trials he's christ-like in troubles he's christ-like in hunger he's Christ's life in joy he's christ-like everywhere you see him or her they're christ-like for they're sealed by the Holy Ghost you see what I mean that's not your spirit that's not our spirit that's his spirit he gives us strength it gives us it empowers us because we can feel pulled this way feel pulled that way and let me just say it that even if there's something that said in what you might say might be right but it might be a little snarky how you said it the Spirit of God will pick that right up and bring correction to it in your life and you'll be going back and asking forgiveness not because of what you said but you'll say I said that wrong shouldn't have said that maybe it was the timing of it why because he's in control you could say well I got a right to that you don't know what they said you don't know what they did but remember the Spirit of Christ within you it rings out it's done a lot brother you won't get by it you won't be able to cross over it you've got to come back and line every part up with the word so circumstances if we really look at it right circumstances neither change or bind the Word of God that's anchored in the soul of a believer amen the seal shows coming and going the token shows coming and going this is why I love this quote out of enticing spirits brother Brown said you give me a preacher you give me a Christian you give me a housewife that's a Christian you give me a farmer or a factory worker that'll put God first in everything I'll show you a man that'll be successful in the spite of all the devil can put on him he seeks God first what is the depth of this seeking I believe this is what the depth of it is like David said here in the resurrection Psalm I have set the Lord always be for me it comes down where we set the Lord before our attitude we set the leavitt before our feelings we set the Lord before our opinions we set the Lord before all things why because the desire within us is to be pleasing unto him look what Paul wrote in 2nd Timothy 2:8 this is a prison epistle notice how Paul writes this concerning this time remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel wherein I suffer trouble as an evil evildoer even unto bonds but the Word of God is not bound there it be the God you see the word of God listen to me now the word of God would have been bound if Paul would have had a bad attitude if Paul would have said thank guys why don't they listen to me you know God will put you in situations where you're the one who's right I hope you listen to me now that got a little quiet God will put you in situations where you're absolutely right and when you're right somebody criticizes you somebody says something and God lets that test come to see how you're gonna handle it because you know it's easy come on now it's easy as Peter said to be buffeted for our faults somebody's a man you shouldn't have done this you shouldn't have said that but it's a different thing Peter would write for us to take it patiently when things that you've done where it's you've searched it out and yet you criticize within it you know if the tendency in the pool is to prove your point who is that that's a flesh man that's the flesh man always wants to prove his side so that I'm innocent I'm this I'm that and listen we all deal with that every husband a wife's a man glory to God we all deal with that but the Word of God is not bound even with her Roman centurion he realized there was no bound Binding of the word distance didn't matter distance didn't matter a man even in present circumstances the Word of God is not bound let me try to bring these things together therefore verse 10 under all things for the elects sake that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory it's a faithful saying for if we'd be dead with him we should also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he will also deny us if we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself the cow Paul would write this in second Timothy 1:8 be not thou for there ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor me of his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the Gospel according to the power of God we have just a moment let's stop one of these that are going from Nero's house where y'all going today what temp are you going to today or when I going to a temple well where you going to service well we're we're going down here to this little hired house little hired house you mean that man that they've got a chain on him and on a Roman every four hours you mean that man that's a prisoner you're going to hear him you're going to listen to him now they would say yeah we believe that's God's a messenger to this hour think about how it would have looked a man in whom the government was against you did not look like a fitting circumstance it was not the beauty of because they didn't have the churches at that time they just had houses it was not even better than normal but to think even the people that would come there and to hear the gospel they themselves had moved beyond shame and Paul was not ashamed of the gospel and he would implore them don't be ashamed of the gospel nor of me his prisoner because many of the things that we look at now that's wrote in the book of Ephesians when Paul would write about husband and wife what Paul wrote there was so contrary to that of life in that day he would be considered a nut compared to that of society but don't be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor me of his prisoner he would write in Romans 8:28 which we've read from you know he would say we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose being there in that prison was not a good thing but look what God was doing out of it Ephesians 1 verse 11 he would write of that of being of the predestination of being chosen in Christ and he would and he would move to write this by the spirit in verse 11 in whom we have also obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will this is trust remember as we were ministering that before Paul did not know remember I'm ready to go to Jerusalem and die he didn't know I was going to Rome he appealed to Caesar God didn't tell him I'm sending you in a room it wasn't until the angel of the Lord showed up right there on the ship and said fear not Paul that shalt stand before Caesar hallelujah girl repeater God you want a confirmation that was Juana what a a strengthening that was in that circumstance though that circumstance Paul could have been remembers we looked at it Paul could have kept on talking about it why did they lose why did they do this why did he do that why did he do that he could have been posting that on his Facebook day after day after day after day complaining but he didn't do that he didn't do that the prophet of God tells us that Paul was down in that ship dragging his chain and he was praising the Lord and he said about that time wouldn't go and Paul was worshiping the Lord about midnight he said the angel the Lord came in there and spoke to Paul I'm telling you on a testimony though the circumstances were undesirable but God met his child right in the midst of those circumstances God was working everything out after the counsel of his own will if I could just divert just for a moment in wrapping up here tonight remember John writes in Revelation chapter 1 a John who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the isle of Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ next verse I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day you and I would not know that dire condition conditions of this aisle if we didn't read about it brother branham gives us a little bit of things are in there you try to study it out in history you don't find much on patents Paul John did not make it a point to emphasize his circumstances this is talking about already life I'm talking about already life a life that is so yelled to Christ to where it begins to in more and more it's losing sight of self because he this was his testimony he knew why he was there but John didn't say I'm here because some guys disagreed with me but you know what they never give me a chance to talk they didn't even give me a chance to prove myself them guys are so wrong they shouldn't this was not how it was if that would have been John's attitude he would not have been wrote I'm here for the Word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ and we certainly wouldn't have had I was in the spirit and we wouldn't have had the Book of Revelations remember was not the revelation of st. John the Divine it was a revelation of Jesus Christ this is the one book that Jesus broke personally himself what was it circumstances think of how that Paul would write this let me just close Paul would write and we've referred to this many times you know it in second Corinthians 12 this is we're just talking about this the life that's been lived unless I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to buff at me lest I should be exalted above measure for this thing I besought the Lord thrice but it might depart from me you know his eyes would come and go and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me that very thought the power of Christ you know what that speaks of it speaks of like the tabernacle and the tent of meeting set down where Christ comes to meet Paulsen Paul was not thinking God for the infirmities what Paul was saying I've asked God for a complete deliverance in other words it ain't coming back no more but it's come back and I prayed and it's got taken away and God let him know Paul I heard you I know your requests but my grace is sufficient it didn't mean that Paul didn't pray for his eyes no more what it meant is Paul would did not allow the infirmities and the situations in that of his life to stifle his life the attitude that we take in circumstances can either invite the power of Christ or it can keep it away that's what Paul's talking about what invites what invites the power of Christ not our power our our weakness invites his strength and I don't know about you but I think I can say for all of us I realize right now more and more Nord I need your strength I need your help Lord as I'm listening and greening and taking in over the word I find myself over and over looking back and say God help me help me Lord help me to die more to myself Lord Lord God give me grace Lord God help me Lord just so lay aside my will or God say brother Samuel you're kind of a little bit of it you're a little bit of a determined person a little bit of an organized person but that's not what the accomplishment of Christ is in my life that's him if I try to put that in anyway I'll get right in his way just like you or me in our temperaments and our makeups but remember it must be Christ fulfill it but we have to surrender we have to ask and ask God the Lord help me what a testimony theevans 3:1 for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles i don't think i don't feel like i got words to express what's in my heart when I've looked over these things I said God how did Paul be moved by the Spirit of God here was a life that was already yuck to you as a prisoner but in these times would express the very life the very life an expression of that character and nature of Jesus Christ it would Express that the walk of a believer and Hera's Paul for this cause i paul a prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles was Paul saying is something about me it was about his will for you it wasn't about what I wanted it's what he put in my heart no wonder Paul could write later on down in Philemon just a few verses below that opening verse one you would say yet for love's sake right into Philemon yet for love's sake I'd rather beseech thee beings such as one as Paul the aged and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ circumstances not convenient circumstances that were not conducive or things that would been have been elected to be but as a believer or they're gonna let circumstances dictate our praise or they're gonna let circumstances dictate whether God can move or not the Word of God is not bound I'm not just talking about circumstances of where we're all in our homes and not able to gather here that during this period of time we've been in quarantine or however you whatever you want to say it stay at home water I'm not just talking about that I'm talking about in circumstances that are things that are not welcoming to that of the natural man circumstances as I said like Paul was in Paul was not in the wrong but even though Paul was not in the wrong and those who had accused him were but Paul said I didn't appeal to Caesar so that I could accuse my nation this is a heart that is full of the love of God this is what we want this kind of a life this to be a prisoner to be so tired in this manner is that what you want that's my heart's desire let's pray father Lord Jesus sometimes the Lord words it just just seemed to fail me Lord to capture these things Lord but yet Lord in my heart just so moved or God in looking upon Lord God the prison epistles but especially Lord as you had led me here in this of Philippians just seeing Lord God how that Paul Lord is expressing we see the expression this is not something that he's telling us do this do that no no this is an expression a life of a prisoner on display it was not Rome that we see we don't see Rome displayed in these verses of Scripture what we see is a display of a prisoner of Jesus Christ lord help us [Music] help us to be so so bound so yoked to the Spirit of God I think of how your profit would word it and Christ the mystery he would preach that in the same message at the times that he would preach perfect faith how can overcome and right before he preached that of Christ the mystery he had preached Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ and then kept drawing off of that inspiration I think of it your prophet would come back and he would refer to that message of Christ the mystery of God revealed as his seventh seal message a life over and over he would express it how it's a life that is yoked to the word not a life that you live yourself but Christ lives lord help us to yield help us Lord God we want to grow we want to continue to grow maturing Lord God becoming more yielded to where it's not about our opinions even in situations Lord that we could be absolutely right help us lord help us to have the right heart in those times it's very easy for our flesh for our feelings to be pulled in a manner as to try to prove our side of the point or to try to put ourself in a good light lord only in a do all we do in that manner it's only giving in to the flesh that's all it is I pray that you'll help us Lord God help us lord I pray from this that you spoke to us tonight that we might glean from this what God to not allow the circumstances to hinder your desire to work in Our Lives Lord even in the midst of this time that we've been in even in the midst of tests and trials that have been before it and if you tarry Lord in our lives tests and trials that will face if you tarry in this coming year until you come help us lord I pray help us or God at circumstances we will not allow circumstances to dictate but may we Lord look and say father what would you have me to do what's your purpose leave me Lord maybe Lord god there's someone rare right now maybe right there in the hold and a point Lord God that they maybe don't even feel Lord it seemed like maybe for a time that their Lord God that they've moved in a place where you've led them and you've opened the door but it's just in that time it's been like they seemed like all alone I pray God maybe they've taken courage for tonight and look back to you and realize Lord God when you open the door as you let them Lord into that door they're looking to you to guide them may they just wait on you Lord may they look to your Lord and ask Lord God that your purpose would be fulfilled in their life help us to die more to ourselves Lord that you might receive glory and honor Lord were not ignorant of the behind-the-scenes many times no doubt of how Paul himself would have different feelings things would come about but we don't read about that but we know it was still there the Lord God the same one who would write by inspiration and speak to us about mortifying the members of our body through the Spirit of Christ dwelling in us he knew that by experience of what it was like when he felt down when he felt discouraged he knew what it was to be able to look to you and say Lord I know you've not forsaken me lord help me give me strength in this moment Lord Oh Lord Jesus hopfully lord help us to just be that simple and remain that simple help us Lord God and being so yoked to you as a prisoner of Jesus Christ to wait upon you to look to you each situation we pray or the name of Jesus Christ we ask inaudible whoa [Music] impossible River you think one for also body need mountain you can turn God specialized in [Music] influenced our impossible [Music] 111 got in here you think garden Mountain [Music] God specializes [Music] and I believe there's so much we can learn from this the Spirit of God would want to teach us sometimes we look at situations things as I said that can be said this was done wrong this was said wrong times we look at the situation's and we're looking for things and how do I correct this Samuel how do I correct this they sent this wrong or they did this from sometimes we become vexed with trying to straighten out a situation when we should first of all pray and say God is this an opportunity that I need the love of God to temper my life a little more that's the first thing is being certain of God said Lord temper me out of this situation don't always look at it that it it's the other person well they're wrong don't always take that part but look at it closely look at it let God examine your heart in your life because God might allow that situation it can allow that to temper you to temper me to see just exactly what we're gonna do about it think of how that David when David walked out of the kingdom that day and a man spit on him and one of David's law young men to his sword and said shall I let that dog's head remain on him David said lay below the Lord told him to do that brother Adam tells us he'd just been talking to brother lavell this is the account he gives in Christ the mystery and here he is he said brother Vale came to him after a time and said how can you happen how can you let people talk about you how can you let him say those things about your brother branham Buddha Ram said not even thinking about what he had just said when they were eating lunch about David he said it came right out of my mouth he said let him alone the Lord told him to do that I'm talking about a readiness for readiness that is Yelp to the very nature and character of Christ or glory be to God this is their that's the kind of prisoners we want to be we want to be that surrendered lord help me to be sensitive mold me and shake one more time God in a river that you can call impossible God is mountains that you can turn door but my god special [Music] hey star impossible Annie [Music] one more time [Music] that you think are impossible got any mountain you cannot here's the good part but God specializes in things thought impossible [Music] one let go [Music] Godhead this one go Godhead his way [Music] god bless you tonight we're just gonna let you be dismissed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ thank God for His mercy thank God for his morning for his shape amen speaking to our hearts cycling a service like this and you know we realize it's not something that would just as it comes the Holy Spirit deals with our hearts but it doesn't stop tears just keep yielding to the Lord circumstances arise look to him say Lord within the midst of it let it be my bonds in Christ that are reflected let it be that ye hope that I'm yoked as a prisoner of Jesus Christ let it not be the circumstances that people remember about me you and I both know it that there's sometimes there's people you come in contact with you almost want to run the opposite way because there's nothing refreshing all they do is talk about their problems and their troubles and oh me and Allah and brothers sister if you find yourself in that regards to tonight I'm not putting you down I'm just telling you tonight there's a greater resource you can go to God and say Lord strengthen me in this moment Lord let the bounds of Christ be made manifest in my life but the gods gospel be furthered in my life when I'm weak then I'm strong amen glory be to God god bless you tonight dismissed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ oh and your night -
