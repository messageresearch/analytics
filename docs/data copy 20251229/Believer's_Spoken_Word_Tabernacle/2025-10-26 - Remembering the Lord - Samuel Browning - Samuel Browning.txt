[Applause] [Music] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you just love him this morning? So thankful for his mercy. &gt;&gt; That song such a has such meaning in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. To our lives. We're so thankful for God's grace this morning. And just want to invite you if you'd like to stand and u we'll go right into the word. So, so thankful to have each and every one of you here. Amen. God bless you and good to see some of you that were away. Good to see you're back home. Amen. It's always good to be together. &gt;&gt; I want to read very um familiar place of scripture that we would read from in that of communion. And uh I actually had a different way I was going to go with a thought and then yesterday morning real early the Lord just just changed it. So I believe that God is mindful of our needs. Don't you? I believe he is. And so I just we just want to draw from him because he's the one that can help us. Let's look here in the scripture 1 Corinthians 11. And I know it's a little bit of a scripture reading and maybe we'll just read these first few verses together and then we will uh have our seats and I'll finish reading. Amen. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread. And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me." After the same manner also he took the cup and when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me." Let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer. Lord Jesus, we love you, Lord. It's the greatest privilege of our life, Lord. &gt;&gt; To be able to serve you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, we we did not know who we were. We didn't know you, Lord. Father, sometimes through glimpses, Lord, that maybe wherever we started our journey at, oh God, you mean so much more to us this morning. Oh God, you're more than than life to us. Lord, &gt;&gt; you've given us life, Lord. &gt;&gt; You're our strength, Lord. Oh God, how we are so thankful that you found us, Lord, and you brought us to yourself. We so appreciate your mercies, Lord. I pray, God, may your blessing, Lord, just continue upon this service. May you come and just deliver the word to our hearts Lord. May our lives be Lord just encouraged Lord in your presence and may we see you Lord. &gt;&gt; Grant it Lord. Father if our vision Lord has become cloudy, may you come Lord this morning and may we see Lord just a fresh vision of you Lord. Oh God, would you just grace us Lord with your presence this morning in each of our lives and may you come Lord here in this service Lord and just Lord fulfill every single need and every request upon every heart, every Lord Jesus desire Lord that we would have in you. May you just come in a special way here this morning Lord. We give ourselves to you, Father, and ask that you would forgive us, Lord, of our shortcomings, Lord. And we pray, heavenly father, may your grace now just move among us in a special way in Jesus name. Amen. May God bless you as you're being seated. Paul would go on in verse 26 and say, "For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily, eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to himself, and not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chasened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world. You know, when I read those verses of scripture in 31 and 32, you see God's mercy that he has equipped us to be able to judge ourselves. And yet there's times that when you think of his faithfulness that where u for whatever reason maybe something has built up in our life and we don't want to deal with it and the enemy wants to put fear of when you if you would deal with that or shame but you know God Satan's always busy with trying to try to stifle that about our lives because it's because of his spirit in our life that allows us to be able to really judge ourselves correctly. And if we fail to to do that, God doesn't leave us. His presence would pull back from us. But God is going to see to it that every one of his children, every one of us are brought back in line and in harmony with his word, you know, and so he'll he'll bring correction our way. There's things, you know, that he can bring different permit. I'll say permit of different things. But when he permits those things, torments and other things like that, that's all for our good to bring us back in line in harmony with him because God made a way that there is nothing, no nothing anymore in our life that should reign above him. And he made a way through the shedding of his blood to where that even he would deal with so personally in our lives of even things that we maybe have never thought of or we are would ponder and wonder of how can I do this or why do I respond this way or why is this and God you know it's the mercy of God to even bring you to that place to realize that you're not your situations or whatever in your life are not irreparable &gt;&gt; because when when when when brother Bram tells when he redeemed us as the kinsman redeemer, he redeemed it all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so God, your situation or my situation, your complexes or my complexes or anything that you would deal with, all of those things, those become opportunities that God brings us to for his grace to step down in our life. And then it adds to your testimony of what God's overcoming grace that not only what he started in your life and how he moved down in your life, you surrendered to him, but then even in that to continue to surrender to his divine working in our life in order that his will can be done in our lives. I'm glad there's been many projects that I've started, I've I've got into, and I've realized I was way over my head. There's things that all of a sudden then you need, you know, you need to call on a professional. But I'm so grateful that God, he doesn't need to call on anyone else. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's not one of our lives, there's not one situation, I don't care where it's at, where he has to look to anywhere else. And neither do we. &gt;&gt; He is the allsufficient God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he in everything. You can say it in this way. And sure, we sometimes we we look and we have situations in our life and and and it does it brings us within that place of conviction. That is true. But I want you to understand that he within all of the attributes of who he is. He has everything covered for your life. &gt;&gt; And he manifest himself just like the seven compound redemptive names of Jehovah. Those were not just manifested when there wasn't a crisis. But as a matter of fact, that's when he manifested who he was was when there was a crisis. Was when there was a situation such as I don't feel I can go on or a situation when Israel was at their end in the middle of a battle. But God would step in and reveal himself to them. And he didn't just do that for them, but he did that for us. And how many times has he revealed himself in so many different ways to us in our lives? And that's his loving care over our lives. So how how what a precious thing to be able to come together here uh this morning. Paul goes on to say, "Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, terry for one another. It's considering one another and praying for one another." And Lord, don't let my brother or sister do anything that would be wrong. And Lord, help my brother. Help my sister. Lord, give them grace even as they would stand here. Lord, don't allow the enemy to torment them. Lord and trouble them because when sins have been confessed, they are put under the blood. &gt;&gt; And that's not just something we use lightly. But John would even write under the inspiration and say, "My little children, I write that you sin not." &gt;&gt; But if we sin, &gt;&gt; we have an advocate &gt;&gt; with the father. &gt;&gt; In other words, you're not left without a way back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He is our propituation. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the propitation of the entire world. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He's the all of it. That's why I think when brother Brandham said he could have wrote in his word. I was wounded for William Brham's transgressions. I was bruised for William Brandham's iniquities. He said, but I'm glad that he didn't write my name in there because I could have had a question. Is it me? The William Brandom he's talking about. But but he mentioned whosoever will. &gt;&gt; And when he wrote that in the word, it becomes so personal to you to where &gt;&gt; you see your name in the word. He was he was bruised for Brian Hannah's transgressions. He was wounded for Dave Crest's iniquities. He the chastisement of of his peace was was laid forth for Roseanne Campbell. It was it becomes personal because then you're reading the book and the book itself you become like the little woman down in Memphis. You begin to look in situations and say, "God, as Yosha, my woman, where's your prophet? &gt;&gt; You're a prayer answering God. And and this is who I am." You see, this is what it brings us. He's brought us into the very pages of the word. And so, we see his word as a love letter to our lives. And so when we want to just take this here just for a moment on remembering the Lord and and brother Vanom he he makes this um uh statement here which I think is so clear when we look at where Paul was dealing with the Corinthian church and no doubt this had been laid out about communion the early church they understood this but yet Paul being a church age messenger he's not just dealing with the truth but now God works works to bring what is the real substance and the heart and the motiv motive and the objective and how everything should be. You know, that's that's how God works in our life. God just doesn't want us uh to go through the motions of anything. But anytime that God moves with and deals with our life, he's wanting our heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's wanting our heart because when he can get get a get our heart and get our heart in line, let me just tell you the word, it has a free channel to come to pass &gt;&gt; because our heart, that's the whole thing. And that's why that constantly within our heart, we have to guard our heart and and constantly watching over that. And this is where Paul would write to the to the believing church in that time. And he and and he would deal with them because they were coming and and when it talked about the Lord's supper, those previous scriptures, they were coming there and they were they were eating as though a meal and taking the bread and eating it as though it it it just to be full and and drinking, you know, of the wine. And so they were they were drunk. And you can imagine the um how Satan loves to ridicule things. And you can imagine the posts that would have been on Instagram of the Corinthian church. And oh my, here this church is supposed to be so spiritual. Look at them coming out drunk and staggering and oh, but Satan, he he likes to do that, you know. But you know, God has a way that God comes to straighten things out to bring us right back in line. And you know if if God himself does not stop or unbelief or all of the ridicule doesn't hinder him then I pray God don't let us get focused on that but let us just focus on him. &gt;&gt; Let us be focused on what God thinks. And I mean even above your own thoughts of yourself say God let my thoughts be so saturated with your thoughts Lord. And brother Brandham picks this up and he picks it up in the discerning of the body of the Lord. And he says, "Now our eternal destination is not altogether determined by what we see and what we hear, but it's determined on what discernment we have of what we see and what we hear." He said Paul was not disputing with them for taking the communion. Their act was right, but their discernment was wrong. For taking the Lord's supper is the commandment of the Lord, but to take it unworthily, not discerning the body of the Lord, is where the wrong would lay. So, how the prophet and how Paul was bringing it is that they were failing to discern their lives according to the word. So they saw something that was laid out as as an ordinance that is to be followed just like water baptism, just like washing of feet. And they were they were doing that but failing to discern their lives according to the word of God. And so with it's beyond like what we see or what we uh hear. Discernment takes us beyond this realm. And you might say, well, if I'm looking at my own life, but you see it, discernment takes us to where we're allowing the word to examine our own heart, our own life, and just to comb through our lives. And so it's even on the approach that they would come because when we would discern or judge our lives and I don't believe that God wants us just to wait until you know a couple times a year or where it's just communion but I believe that's the real victory of our lives as believers and and and we're living in a day a time where uh we are bombarded like no other time before. We are living in a time where things work to so desensitize us there. You're living in a time where there is uh the pressure is greater now than it's ever been. &gt;&gt; That's not discounting what the other what the early church and those went through. But this is a greater hour. Let me just say it like this. The pressure is different now than what it was in the 70s. &gt;&gt; It's different than what it was in the 80s. It's it's the things have changed. &gt;&gt; Seasons have changed. Even seasons in the word. And so within that that discernment, Lord, I need discernment for this moment. I need discernment for this hour because I just don't want to be doing the right thing because I could do the right thing and do it in the wrong way. But I want to be I want to be found correct in your word. And I think there's no greater, you know, thing that we we all can fellowship on this. We all have been in those places and we feel pretty good and we should. God brings us along in our walk with him. But there's nothing like getting in his presence and then the word begins to move and to deal with our life and to discern our hearts. And you know what that is when that's taking place? Brother Bram says you're closer to the burning bush than what you think. He said when God begins to deal with your life and he said the word is coming so personal. He said that's not the throne of judgment way off. He said that's the throne of mercy right here. And it's God's spirit working out and dealing with our life and drawing us into places. And you know, the whole reason that God comes that way is not to shame us, not to make us feel bad, but God wants us to to to to be free and to live with not only uh uh I want to say with a conviction, but to live in real liberty of what he's called us. He does God God absolutely does not like when anything gets into his temple, one of his children, and is there and and and is is causing things to go array. He he he paid the price. We are his. We're bought with a price. We belong to him. He, as a matter of fact, the prophet says he resents anything taking over in his temple. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Now, they weren't discerning the body of the Lord. And the body of the Lord, well, the physical body, the corporal body, that that's that's been raised up to the throne. God was the body that God used to God created that body to come down in order to redeem us. And God took that body up as a memorial and it's there as a testament and seated there on the throne. And to know that within the body of the Lord that we're talking about is the mystical body of Jesus Christ. In other words, it is the spiritfilled children of God. that God where God has brought everyone of his children and what part we are in the body we can't be nobody else's part that's why that we can't live back in the feet back in the thighs even in the chest we can't even live back in the days of Pentecost &gt;&gt; we can't even live now we're not even in the eye age that that the eye time it's eagle time that's true but the last thing that was to enter the body is the intelligence &gt;&gt; so we so we must move within that and the only way the intelligence could come is because God had eyes upon the earth and instead of the eyes being divided he said if thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light. So if the whole body is to be full of light then it means that here God has built his body of believers down through the ages &gt;&gt; all the way through it's been the building and the assembling of the body of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's true. Many would walk right right past and overlook uh the body of the Lord because as far as in our flesh, we're no different from anybody else. We as I mean, we may dress different. We we according to God's word, we take those things off. But as far as uh having uh difficulties and and things that we deal with, we're we're no different than anyone else. We deal with that. We're not exempt from that. But what it is is that we have an access to a place that brings us to uh h an overcoming and an encouraging through those times and to lift us in in our lives to to manifest. We we his glory we we have an access to the grace of God or to the throne of God by the grace of God. And so, you know, when we consider this in our lives that really what Paul as he was bringing the the people to of this in this in this walk or in this moment, you know, we're looking at human v and human vessels. Our vessels, as Paul would describe it, are earthn vessels, &gt;&gt; frail, &gt;&gt; weak. Brother Rem tells us in perfect strength. He said, he says, "If we make it to heaven," he says, which I believe we will, he says, "We're going to stand among some of the weakest people that's ever been." &gt;&gt; Oh, it's it's our concept of weakness, cuz no one likes to be called weak, &gt;&gt; I mean, that's that's insulting, &gt;&gt; right? Um but you see weakness in God's thinking is so much greater &gt;&gt; than what it is in our thinking. In our thinking that's humiliation, &gt;&gt; but yet God allows that humiliation is actually the breaking down of our strength. That's why the prophet said many times we're too strong. &gt;&gt; That's defense. That's a defense mechanism. That's part of how we're and we have to understand that. That's something that when the Holy Spirit has come, he doesn't strip that out of us. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But what his coming has brought us to is to the realization is I was always a son of God. &gt;&gt; I was always a sheep. &gt;&gt; I've always been a one of his. &gt;&gt; That's why there's things that's been different. And then then then we can draw from him our shepherd as he will lead us into green pastures. He knows the nutrients we need and he's already laid the nutrients out in his word. David said he has prepared for me a table &gt;&gt; in the presence of mine enemies. &gt;&gt; That's good. That's right. &gt;&gt; We're coming to the table of the Lord. And as the people of God, we can say he is my Lord. &gt;&gt; He's my Lord. That that's just not something of a of a figure of speech, but he is my Lord. And we've been brought to the table of the Lord. He has prepared. What are you saying, brother Samuel? God has prepared what you and I have need of even for this moment, for this generation. When God sent his word into this generation, God sent a word that the overcomers, those who desire and have a longing not just to be part of status quo, not just to go along. And even when you feel like I I feel like giving up, I I can't do this or I can't go on another step. And then God steps in in that moment and brings us to a place and says, "Look, all I need for you to do is surrender your weakness. He doesn't he doesn't strongarm us &gt;&gt; because that only cause the strength to build up. &gt;&gt; He knows how to disarm us in his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that then what? Weakness can be surrendered. And when weakness is truly surrendered where we say, "Lord, I can't I can't do this. Lord, I'm not able. I Lord, I I need your strength." And that goes on in our life. God brings us to those times and then that's where he pours himself in &gt;&gt; and he'll use himself. &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel, why doesn't he do it all at once? Because character is not a gift. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's a victory. &gt;&gt; And he's interested in molding us, not overwhelming us. He's interesting in building us up. And this is why Paul would write or brother Brandon would pick this up and he says these Christians were taking communion and not living the life. And Christianity is an experience and a life. And he said these Christians was just living any kind of life and making a poor profession. And that's why Paul said many are are sick and weakly among you and many are sleep. You know, brother Brandham actually picks that scripture up and he actually says, "This is why sometimes God will take people home even prematurely because sometimes they've allowed things to go on and not deal with it." &gt;&gt; That just I I never ran across that until here this morning. That's not to bring fear in our lives. I mean, Brother Brandham showed us Brother Bram showed us that in the Hebrew series when he dealt with Saul, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Brother Brham brings that brother up. you're familiar with. He mentions it a few different times. Brother Ramsay, Brother Ramsey got so discouraged, Brother Brandon went in his garage where he worked as an automotive, Brother Ramsey. And he began to talk to him. He said, "I don't serve the Lord no more, Billy." &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; He'd become discouraged, &gt;&gt; right? You see, Satan, listen, this is where we we have to say, "God, give me the strength to turn my eyes to you." &gt;&gt; Cuz I tell you, when you look at when you look at flesh all the way across, when you look at flesh, listen, friends, our flesh disappoints one another. &gt;&gt; I don't even have to leave my home that there's no doubt that I've disappointed my wife. My wife's disappointed me. Likewise with the children. And then even here among the body of of believers, it's different when you know if you go from here and you go visit a church, you're not you're not when you visit, you don't see the weaknesses. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But when you get within a family and you get among you see that and God you say why does God permit that? God permits that to work out and to bring us to a place to say wait a minute. He's not saying that that a person isn't wrong. That's not it at all. God will allow us to see wrong and even to be wronged. &gt;&gt; Why would he allow that? Is because God is interested in bringing out that attribute in our life of even not only of that of forgiveness of where well I'm just to display forgiveness. No, it's even deeper than that. That God is working in our lives to bring us to that character and to that image for full adoption for the capstone to set down upon our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the capstone setting down upon our life, that's what we're being drawn. You see, there's a power that's drawing us up. &gt;&gt; That's why this message it it listen, there's realms below. The prophet said three realms below that are constantly trying to pull you down. &gt;&gt; We live here in the middle. Then there's three realms pulling you up, right? You have representation that's pulling you up. So this message that God has sent is not a message to pull you down. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a message to lift you up. It's a message to cause you to look up. It's a message of the revealing of Christ on character, Christ on life, Christ on nature. That's why the real opening of the book, the taking of the book. You want to know what it is? It's not It's not a symbol. It's Christ taking your life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's God taking a bride body. &gt;&gt; It's not words. It's not letters. It's not chapters. It's lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And where so many things tried to ride through your life and innocency and and then war came in and then death came in and then in a ride even of trying to be undercover and all of those things. But God in himself coming down in our life, he exposes the trail of the serpent. &gt;&gt; He exposes, you know what he does? He's interested in taking the cover off of Satan. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know what it does? It locks you and I in to him who is our absolute &gt;&gt; because he knows my children if they recognize this characteristic and he'll just take the cover off you'll see it for what it is. &gt;&gt; That's the same thing in our lives. That's what he's doing in our lives. &gt;&gt; He's got confidence that his children will always side with the word because we're a part of the word. That's right. &gt;&gt; So good. &gt;&gt; And so this is why that brother, you know, he says we who call ourselves Christians have no right to take the communion unless we are living above a reproach of the world. We have no right. The communion are for those who are living right as an example of Christianity. So remember Paul was dealing with them because their act of taking communion was right. But their discernment was wrong. &gt;&gt; The Catholic Church, they come and they call their sacraments. They come and they're taking with the hope they will be forgiven. &gt;&gt; That's not that's not what this is. &gt;&gt; We're not taking this with a hope. We come remembering what he has done. &gt;&gt; And and I'm not talking just back on Calvary, but we remember what he's done in us. &gt;&gt; We remember the lives that we once lived. &gt;&gt; And we no longer live them. We no longer desire them. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel, I feel pulled sometimes with certain desires. But here the discernment of the word says there's pulls and things within your flesh. But to show what's on the what's on the very throne of your heart is when you have fallen short quickly. It's oh God forgive me. &gt;&gt; What is that? It's the same spirit of God that brought him down in the garden. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you he's not coming down to your life. He's already dwelling there by the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. It brings discernment in our lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God in the highest. &gt;&gt; So it wasn't just something going through the motions. And so I want to just say this to you. You are a testimony &gt;&gt; as you're coming even through here. You're a testimony. You see, God would have different things to be done with Israel. Remember when they left the land of Egypt, he told them, "Keep the Passover. Let it be a memorial." When they crossed the the Jordan, he had them bring stones from that was in the Jordan and bring those stones and put them on land. Let me just tell you something. You and I were buried beneath death. &gt;&gt; Our lives were hidden, &gt;&gt; but God opened up the way and brought us out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And our lives are testimonies. &gt;&gt; Where were those stones set up at Gila? &gt;&gt; Not only have we died to self, but we've been circumcised from the things of the world. I don't want anything to do with the world. The tie, the yoke back to Egypt has been broken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not become a better person. I'm a new man. &gt;&gt; I'm a new creation by his working. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, I have testimonies, but I am a testimony. &gt;&gt; I am a witness. You are a witness. &gt;&gt; And you when you come, you're remembering what he has done for you. The prophet says, you know, he says, you don't want to make it just something common. He says, but remember that it was his grace and his mercy and that alone that gives you the only hope you have. No matter what you could ever do, there's nothing nowhere that can anyways come near what Christ did for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're a testimony. This is why Paul, think about this, standing in this wicked city of Corenth. &gt;&gt; And here they were. This this must have had to have been a word that was dropped within this moment. Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God. Be not deceived. Neither fornicators, idolattors, adulterers, effeminate, abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, covetous, drunkards, revilers, extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you. &gt;&gt; Then we we were there. &gt;&gt; Paul's letting them know that look where God brought you from. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And no doubt I wonder if some of them were setting in their mind and how the enemy can try to trouble in their mind and you know it was when God first got a hold of your life. Could could it really or is this something that from my past or or is could God really do it? And yet you know the reality is burning in your life and you look at it sometimes in your mind comes back to the vileeness of once you where you once lived but where you once lived &gt;&gt; was not who you were. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say, "How can you say that?" It's different now. &gt;&gt; It's different now. &gt;&gt; You're not just living a different life. You have no taste for those things. &gt;&gt; Those are the things that could get you off your pillow at night. Say, "Oh, God, if it hadn't been for your grace, &gt;&gt; where would my life have been, Lord? I may not even have been here. I wouldn't have known you. Oh, God. But you're washed, &gt;&gt; sanctified, justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; There's no remembrance of as far as desires that have lingered there. And that's so God has freed our lives from those things. And that's why the prophet said, "As long as you're trusting in what you do, you're not remembering what what he's done for you." Hallelujah. Let me let me just read as he places this here. He says, "If I can forget what I was and remember what he is, if I can remember Jesus, if I can remember him at the cross, if I can remember what he done for me, I can remember the hour that he washed away my sins. Give me the Holy Spirit to guide me. Then I'm lifted above everything that holds this earth. I'm lifted above every earthly thing into heavenly places in Christ Jesus where I can fellowship with him there in his presence forgetting what I ever was. &gt;&gt; Forgetting all my sins and everything because they're in the sea of forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; That's just something so special about the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Forgetting all my past, forgetting everything. And remember that he made me his own &gt;&gt; by his own death. He took my place and that had not a right to go nowhere but hell. He took my place and lifted me from hell. He went there for me and he lifted me up by his grace abundance until now. We are sons and daughters of God and we sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus ever rejoicing and remembering him who brought us safe this far and with pulsating faith in our souls pressing us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And by his grace will take me on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not you pressing. &gt;&gt; It's what's behind you. &gt;&gt; That's what's important. It's who's behind you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, heaven is behind you. &gt;&gt; God is behind you. You know why? You're a part of him. You're a part of his word. And he is the amen of his word. &gt;&gt; It's life in you. Oh, you may get down, but you can't keep resurrection power locked up. &gt;&gt; There's not a Roman seal big enough. There's not a situation too great. There's not an anxiety. There's not a depression. There's not no matter of failure that can keep a child of God back from their promises. &gt;&gt; He is the quickener. &gt;&gt; He is the resurrection power. Oh, glory be to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. We are the body of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. This is why that even in the scriptures when we think of this being the body of the Lord and Paul would you know refer to this of how this cup of blessing that we bless is it not the communion of the blood of Christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ for we being many are one bread and one body for we are all partakers of that one bread his life has come that was divided his his his he became sin who knew no sin. He the bread. Remember, he told them, "I am that bread that came down. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; I'm the true bread." True bread. You're a man. But they miss seeing one day what it was spoke of. The bread is life. &gt;&gt; I'm the lifegiver. &gt;&gt; I'm your sustainer. What I was back there in Egypt was only a type of of where it spoke of my coming that I would become the sustainer in your life. &gt;&gt; But though sometimes feelings can fail us, but he never does. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we feel the anointing so great and at other times we don't, but he is still right there. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll never leave you nor forsake you." Even when we have failed him, he doesn't fly off into eternity. The prophet said that that dove just goes up on just a little limb &gt;&gt; waiting on us to become a lamb again to welcome him back. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is he is Lord. I'm going to say he is Lord. And this is why that when we can see the scripture Paul said no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost. You are a testimony of what God has brought you from from all of your family tree, from all the strains. And there ain't no family tree no better than the other. &gt;&gt; I don't care what kind of home you came out of. It ain't good. We're not here to glorify family trees cuz you search very long, you're going to find every family tree was in a mess and we all needed God. Sometimes maybe those who might you look at and say, "My this was messed up and this is messed up." But I'll tell you what, God knows there's those that are looking and are longing and there's a desire for deliverance. &gt;&gt; But we all stood in need of redemption. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So you know when you look at it in your life, he now has become exalted in your spirit. That's right. &gt;&gt; He's been exalted above everything of the past. He's been exalted above every desire. I want you to understand you. This exalting doesn't stop. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that he had put all things under his feet. &gt;&gt; It didn't say it will be. He has already. &gt;&gt; Right. When Paul is asserting there the deity of Jesus Christ through the book of Hebrews, he firmly declares in the opening chapter who it was in the prophet who has spoke upholding all things by the word of his power that when he brought his only begotten into the world, he addressed the angels, thou shalt worship him. And Paul moves on into that chapter and speaks and says, we see not all things yet, &gt;&gt; but we see Jesus. You may not see everything that you're praying about now, but you see Jesus. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, he's the one that's going to bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; He's upholding all word, his word. Upholding it by the word of his power. Upholding means snatching away. He's He's the one that is coming and he's catching us away. It's a word that is catching you and I away. And you know what he's doing? He's given you and I a vision to be able to see the end that it's finished. &gt;&gt; But sometimes through this part of the journey, we can get discouraged. &gt;&gt; We can get weary. &gt;&gt; We can experience misjudgment, &gt;&gt; being misunderstood. And God knew that all along through this journey of coming back into what he had in the back part of his mind. and what God is calling you and I back to, he knew that throughout this time, just as much as we would need healing in our body, &gt;&gt; and he does that to encourage us, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's that's that's that's the evidence of the resurrection just as much as his presence comes by and it'll encourage us when you feel like you're at your last point. &gt;&gt; I can't go another step. and the enemy's on your shoulder and say, "Yeah, why? You really don't have a lot of oomph right now anyhow. &gt;&gt; Why don't you just wait and throw in the towel? I mean, look, look at all the trouble. Look at everything." And you look And you know what? Let me just tell you something. He's not lying. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; He's not lying. All right. &gt;&gt; When they came and they poked at Nehemiah and they said, "Huh, these walls, it's nothing but a pile of rubbish." &gt;&gt; They weren't lying. &gt;&gt; But it's how you're looking at it. &gt;&gt; This is why we need divine help. &gt;&gt; God knows and knew we would get discouraged. And this is why we need divine assistance. &gt;&gt; And God knows just how to encourage you and I. And he encourages you and I through the renewing of our vision. And even as we come into his presence and here we are setting and maybe it just seems like in the devil feels like he's got every channel blocked off. Man, I've got them. I I've got everything blocked off and you know I've got them feeling condemned because they're feeling this way and yet they feel justified for feeling this way. And Satan just feels like he's got everything within a web and tied up and he's moving in for the kill. But what he underestimates &gt;&gt; is the Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; he said, "I've got a rote in the palm of my hand. &gt;&gt; You're not in his mouth &gt;&gt; cuz he spews that others out, but you're written in his hands." &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're in the right hand and oh, the right hand, we feel his power. We feel the invigorating of his presence. And then there's other times here it's a left hand where God is working and we don't know what's happening. We don't know what's taking place and we're looking to God. Lord, Lord, do you still love me? Lord, am I am I called? And Lord, am I one of yours? And all of that. You say, why would that be? It's God breaking down our will. &gt;&gt; It's God peeling back the covers. It's God just taking You You want You want to talk about an example of one who's just letting things just deflect off of him? That's almighty God. You remember Bill Ram tells us in the message he said if they in Israel after the blood had been applied he said if one of them would have looked at that and said do you think do you think that that's going to work he said that would have been an insult &gt;&gt; to Jehovah and he said anytime when God has given us a word he said and then we question it it's an insult &gt;&gt; to Jehovah &gt;&gt; you think the enemy wouldn't have come oh well you've brought insults and you think God you think that keeps him at distance. God knows we are but flesh. &gt;&gt; I'm &gt;&gt; trying to get to my point here this morning. He knows we are but flesh. &gt;&gt; He's he brings us along and he understands that. I want you to think about it. If somebody gave you and I that kind of an insult, huh? What you saying? Call somebody else. Do you really think that this countertop do you really think? Do you really think? Do you really think anything? But not God. See, God did God does not argue. God doesn't argue. Oh, God, help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He stands there and he just peels back. He peels back one layer. He's peeling back another layer. And you know what it all is? He's uncovering you. &gt;&gt; He's uncovering me. Because those things that are covering over is actually what's causing the wrong expression out of our life. It's kind of like a a a corn that has a rock over it. It'll try to grow around that corn, &gt;&gt; but you got to move that rock. And see, you can't defeat the seed from coming forth. But what Satan wants to try to do is put those rocks and put covers and and then you're growing way out here. But God God in his mercy, he is mindful to remove what's hindering. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we need patience. &gt;&gt; Patience with one another &gt;&gt; part of the body. patience and oh God help me. Because you see what it is, we've been there. &gt;&gt; See, God brings us through things to also reflect in our own lives. We we are his victory. It's Christ. It's his word that's triumphant. Is always causing us to triumph. Let me just drop this here. I got a few more moments. The Bible says that here he is that a king shall reign in righteousness and princes shall rule in judgment. And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind. It wouldn't be that the wind would stop, but there's a place where we can get out of it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; A covert from the tempest, the howling and the swirling and the and the and all of that of the greatness of storms. There's there's a place he shall be as a covert as, look at this, rivers of water. one source but many streams, &gt;&gt; many rivers. &gt;&gt; This is why it's a many membered body. &gt;&gt; God doesn't have just one one one assembly, but they're outposts &gt;&gt; all around the world. But you know what? It's not it's not uh many different water sources, but it's waters of one river. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a voice of many waters. It's Christ that is working as rivers of water in a dry place. &gt;&gt; You ever been in a dry place? &gt;&gt; I have. &gt;&gt; Been in a dry time? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sure. &gt;&gt; The prophet, matter of fact, he says God will allow a dry season to come to test what our reaction is going to be. &gt;&gt; And listen, we can't we can't throw off on Abraham. We all been guilty. We We're trying to because you know what it is? We're trying to sometimes recreate &gt;&gt; past experiences &gt;&gt; and because we feel safe in past experiences &gt;&gt; and we feel like, oh, if I can just get back to that past experience. And really what God is saying is that was only a stopping point. It was just a station while on your journey. See, that's why the prophet tells us when he takes us through the revealing of Luther, Wesley, Pentecost, and he says, "The church of the living God is not called to a station in this hour." But we go back to stations where we felt comfort. Oh, how I felt the power of God. How I And that was a station. God is no less now, but it's how God is working now. where we need discernment in order to dispel discouragement. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Because if we're looking for and expecting the wrong thing, then it only adds to our discouragement because ah this is ah this isn't going listen. Don't feel lonely. John himself got his eye filmed over. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, here he come and says go ask him if he's the one or do we look for another. He had such a supernatural experience. He's the one who saw the light, heard the voice, but even in the midst when things weren't happening the way he thought they ought to be happening. &gt;&gt; How many times in our lives where things aren't happening the way that we thought? Amen. &gt;&gt; I just told my wife just yesterday we were fellowshipping was out driving a little bit just getting out and I said I've watched things God do things that I said it's brought me to a place now where I'm expecting God but I'm not looking for it to be done in a certain way. I said because God through everything through family through the church through every So what I've witnessed is it's just been God and only thing I can step back and say is he's sovereign. &gt;&gt; Yes. I said is that even in my ignorance, God had us to be in the right position to be able to see him. Brother Sam, you take any credit for that? None. None. Because even in our surrender, we're not even that big. &gt;&gt; We need his grace. &gt;&gt; We need his presence &gt;&gt; because it's in his presence where he dismisses fear. It's in his presence where he removes the intimidation of vulnerability. in his presence. And he might work service after service after service, but he's got an objective in his mind. He's not the author of frustration. He's got an objective in his mind. And he knows what he's working at in our life and in the lives of others, but it's us. And see how Satan will work on that with us. Because listen, let me just tell you something. You and I are built to be productive. Do you see how Satan has come in even in this hour and he's taken things? There's never been a higher time of depression, &gt;&gt; anxiety &gt;&gt; than any other time. But I also want you to understand is you have to also look at all of the things that are around us and you're being exposed to and bombarded with. &gt;&gt; And it's things that you look at and you see, you know, you know, you see young people. I I'm not Let me just tell you something right now. You'll never find from here me looking down on anybody. No matter what your situation is, I want to see everybody helped. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you something, friends. There's certain ways and certain things that I can pray about even with people in prayer lines because I've been through some of those places. I may not have been into the the depth that others have been through and things like that and experiencing anxiousness in that degree, but I've experienced it enough &gt;&gt; to where when I can stand in panic and things like that where I can stand in and my heart breathes for that just like God's done things in your life where you can pray for somebody like I could never enter in. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But you've been bombarded. &gt;&gt; Things are all around us. Right? &gt;&gt; I mean, you you see things, you see, oh, this one and and I understand there I understand there there's fake stuff. Oh, they're going here on vacation and this one's getting married and this and that. And you you think our young people don't feel that pressure and then and then it's and then we find the the part that oh, I'm just going to take a little break from coming in from work and I watch this little video on fishing or I watch this little and before you know it and then you find even like with young people because young people don't have that they're not in that place of discernment yet and then things just start rolling and you know what ends up happening? Let me tell you what all behind that because I'm not I'm not getting into the specifics of watching this or watching that. What I'm getting down to is is that everything that Satan is wanting to do is devalue. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? When you when I show I I didn't I think I showed you pictures of when I walked right next to where it used to say eagle in white lettering. That eagle writing in white lettering in quartz is no longer there. that hasn't been there for a long time. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because people chipped it out of there. &gt;&gt; Right now, what what I'm trying to say is when you consider that right there, even how that that would be done in that way, how that Satan wants to deface the gospel. &gt;&gt; He wants to deface and take away from the realities. He wants to devalue. So, let me just tell you something. When you see different ones that might be battling and listen, let me just tell you something. Through this congregation, you can't go by what you see out here. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Just because a person is smiling here doesn't mean there's not trouble down here. &gt;&gt; And they're not a Pharisee. They're not an actor. But let me just tell you something. As Paul Rder said, he said, "Ministries are good actors." So I'll just you could just put it on me that sometimes if you really seen the ball of nerves and where we were at and and different things and seeing what you know as I'm looking at it and my I don't see too much but you know just what what I feel like and I've been praying and looking to God and my only see you know here I just I know just scripture I know this part and then there's other times man where the whole outline together and what you don't you don't see the ball of nerves but you know what God does those things to bring us to trust him. Sure. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And then the enemy wants to tell you, "Brother Samuel's got it all together. He's cool and cool as a cucumber. &gt;&gt; My wish I could be like that." No. No. You don't want to be like me. You want to be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you, turn your eyes on him. &gt;&gt; Because the only thing that I'm trusting in is him. &gt;&gt; I'm trusting in him. I That's what I'm looking to. You say, "How can we be positive?" Because even in the times when negativity is all around and discouragement, it's because he is positive. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can I have just a moment? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to say he's our oasis. &gt;&gt; The prophet called our daily life as we go through, he said sometimes the deserts of life. the hot, the heat of trial, and the prophet says it's on those backside of the deserts where righteous men are molded. But yet those deserts can be hot and dry, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Man, you know, sometimes there's things that in the midst of deserts and so forth, sometimes you can start seeing things and what you're seeing is not is not real. &gt;&gt; Why? It's the conditions. It's not the person. It's conditions. And they start seeing miragages, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Start imagining things. It's a time for all of that to flourish. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I don't think Brother Dave really likes me. I don't think Sister Roseanne really likes me. I don't think Sister I don't think Sister Reed I don't think she really calls me. I don't even think she cuz she started calling me brother Sam and I'm not Sammy no more. You you you you you understand. Come on friends. I can come right down here on the carpet. I I'm preach I'm preaching right with you this morning. I'm preaching right with you. Sister Rita. Don't take that to heart. Sister Rosanne don't take it to heart. No. Don't it's an example. Okay. Don't imagine anything. But when it's dry it's easy. That's &gt;&gt; right. It's like even sometimes when we get hangry, don't look at nobody. Don't Don't There's people in here I won't even look at right now. Don't look at nobody. And you get to that place, you realize, wait, it ain't even that person. It's the conditions in their body. Their blood sugars dropping a certain way. And you might say, "Well, brother Samuel, the Holy Ghost." Yes, the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But the Holy Ghost also is not going to be the regulator of our blood sugar. That's right. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is not going to make us a peanut butter sandwich. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is not going to give us a bag of Jolly Ranchers. &gt;&gt; That's &gt;&gt; right. We have to do those things. &gt;&gt; We have to understand our own weaknesses. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? That's not being uh weak. It's being strong in the Lord. It's governing this temple &gt;&gt; and realizing I'm in a desert place. I'm in a dry land. I need nourishment. &gt;&gt; The prophet called this. He says it's like he says we're coming to take the communion. He says this is like it is this is what this is. We're representing as we come here of what he is to us. &gt;&gt; He said every time we come together &gt;&gt; as a body he's our oasis. Now, let me just tell you something. If you don't need refreshment, he's not going to be that. &gt;&gt; But we need refreshing. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, let me just let me just drop my heart to you. Even in times that I thought, man, I felt good. I felt this. But then God would bring a word right down and that word come through my life. Oh, deal with my heart. &gt;&gt; It was a time of refreshing. &gt;&gt; You know what it did? What the refreshing did is it reccalibrated my vision. &gt;&gt; It it dealt with taking Samuel's thoughts, which I thought, hey, this is lined up, man, where this is going. And God comes right down and he won't just say just tell us. But he tells us &gt;&gt; and you realize, oh, oh, forgive me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. And even to us that that's a refreshing of where he brings us to it's an oasis. And there's there's three things that the prophet talks about this oasis within these messages. And I'm just going to display those and then let me just let me just bring them up and we'll we'll close. It's for the wounded. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. Wounds, sure, we experience things externally. We experience things out there, &gt;&gt; but there's no wounds like the wounds that come in the house of your friends. &gt;&gt; And God, let me just tell you something. God God is mindful to deal with those wounds. He doesn't he doesn't diminish the other person, but what he does is it's because that that's not going to help. It'd be like it, you know, it'd be like your child showing up and they're talking about what's going on with work and then all of a sudden you just jump right in with them. That doesn't help because they don't even have direction on how do I deal with adversity? &gt;&gt; See, they it's a teachable moment. And so to even to walk through there because number one, we weren't even there. We we don't understand. Maybe there's something the way that they done. They don't even see what they've done. And you have to you're working with them. And that's that's how God God deals with our life. God just doesn't remember, he's not a doty grandfather. God just doesn't jump in. And a matter of fact, many times we find the things that we feel that we're right. You just stay in his presence a little while. &gt;&gt; There you go. And God allows you to reflect and you begin to realize, "Oh, I see how that person could have took that that way. &gt;&gt; God, forgive me. &gt;&gt; Lord, forgive me. I didn't I didn't see our intentions can be ever so good." &gt;&gt; Can be ever so good. But sometimes our intentions, those things can be so misunderstood because we're not allowing it to be fully guided. You say, "Brother Samuel, you mean God would allow mistakes and things?" I don't like making mistakes no more than you do. &gt;&gt; And I'm just telling you, it's not about a pride thing. I I don't want You don't like failing. You don't like failing people. It's like when there would things come up on a test and here I would be and I'd be walking around where they're taking the test in April, the big standardized test and I'd look, oh, and over the years you get to that spot. You're a how did I let how did I how did I overlook that? So, you know what you do? You take notes &gt;&gt; for the following year. &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to come back and do the same thing and expect a different result. That's insanity. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? I'm just bearing my heart with you this morning. We're we're in a place of oasis. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; I've been wounded. You've been wounded. But I'm not going to say that we just oh well, we just we just sit around. No, there's a way. There's a way God has a ministry to wounds because he doesn't want us to remain wounded because when we're wounded, we then become vulnerable to wound other people. &gt;&gt; My first dog that I had, Brock, he he's one of his his nails was I don't know what he did, biting or whatever. It runs in the family, I guess. And it came off. And he had just that quick sticking out. So I thought, I'm going to get clippers. I'll help him out. Brock was as gentle as a day is long. &gt;&gt; Those of you know you were there with him. But in that moment when I went to go for that thing, he he kind of snapped at me. My brother said, you know what my brother said? I said, dear, what do I do? He said, "Just put him in his cage." And he said, "When he when he's in there, he'll figure it all out. He'll he'll take care of it." Let me just tell you something. When there's wounds in my life and your life, it ain't been me that's figured it all out. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you what it's been is when we can just get into his presence &gt;&gt; and say, "Wait a minute, devil. I don't need your interpretations &gt;&gt; cuz you have you have caused me to misjudge and misrepresent things all down through my life &gt;&gt; and things that I felt that was exactly so real. &gt;&gt; But I don't need this because that's what's caused all of that and built that up my life. But Lord, help me to see. Lord, &gt;&gt; see what you're doing is you got to get like that prophet called that wound. He said that's like that wounded deer where where the enemy's tried to take chunks out. There might have been a lot of chunks. There might have been chunks through relationships, chunks through jobs, chunks through bosses, chunks through family, a lot of things, right? Even here. Well, so and so said this to me and so and so said did this to me. I'm not excusing anything. But what I am saying is is that here we are in a place in our humanity and God allows these things. And oh, how it should bring us to a place to say, God, how I need to stay under the blood. &gt;&gt; Because it's just like you get out from under the blood, you're like a person that ain't ate. &gt;&gt; It's true. The prophet told us in the message of shame. He said when you are out of God's presence, you become prickly like a cactus. He did not say you're no longer a son and daughter of God. He's letting you know the source of your strength is in his presence. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's in his presence where there's real memory. &gt;&gt; Because it's in his presence, and I'm talking about his presence that's come and changed your life. Listen, the prophet tells us, he said, it wasn't an emotion. It wasn't something like that. It wasn't that you shouted or you He said, "That's not what it is." He said, "But your remembrance has got to be deeper to where you remember his presence of what he's done for you, where he brought you from." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Sam, no, I'm not where so and so is. Don't look where so and so is. &gt;&gt; But remember where he brought you from. &gt;&gt; It's you're his testimony. Amen. &gt;&gt; If he can just get to that lifegiving source, the blood stops, the bleeding stops, &gt;&gt; misunderstood. Prophet picks this up with this oasis and he takes us to the well of Bellar Rohi. Oh, I don't know if I've pronounced that right, but he said here was Hagar. You see, brother happens to be able to pull that up and bring that as a type even to our life in that he said when things we've only been we've only done what we've been expected to do and asked to do. He said that's all Hagar did. And when Hagar did all of that, she couldn't understand why am I being put out of the camp? The prophet said she didn't. He said and that's why you know he says you don't understand why you've been you know there at the world and and among your job and among other places and why is there things that seems like you're being excluded why is there things that is coming around in that way the prophet said it's a misunderstanding you're being misjudged they because why of what is actually taking place in your life but then let's just be honest because it's very comfortable to leave it out there. &gt;&gt; But where Satan loves to bring it is misunderstandings in here. &gt;&gt; And let me just tell you what a mis a misunderstanding it's not about where one person is right and one person's wrong. That's not a misunderstanding. But a misunderstanding is like God said come and let's reason together &gt;&gt; because Satan thrives in misunderstandings. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandon says even he said when he saw different ones at times he said as he said I've seen people get in the flesh. He said I've seen that in their worship. He said but I never say nothing about it. He said, 'You know why? It's dangerous. He said, 'What I say is is God, they love you just like I do. &gt;&gt; They want to go just like I That's why the prophet never even called stuff out about speaking in tongues. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; My wife and I were just fellowshipping about this yesterday about even when brother Brandham, God revealed to him about Sister Shakarion that she was going to be passing away. I can't remember the exact tape, but when we started talking about it, I said, I remember the message where all of a sudden, probably you do too, that tongues ran rang out. And when they rang out in that message, it was forceful, but my she's going to be raised up. You know what brother Brandham did right in front of the microphone? He said, "Praise be to God. Thank you, Lord Jesus." I'm saying this, we had an example that before. I didn't listen, brother Brand. him up. But it shows us an example of where the prophet, what if he would have stood in the microphone and said, "That is false because God has showed this to me." What would that have done? &gt;&gt; You might as well fold the chairs up. &gt;&gt; Give them back their offering. &gt;&gt; Just Just give them back. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; It's done. There's nothing God's going to be able to do. But the prophet showed us what it means as a mature son of God when you know you're standing in the right. &gt;&gt; You still that becomes expressed through our compassion to others. Oh God, so work in these tabernacles. &gt;&gt; Work in our tabernacles, Lord. Work in my tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Work in me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Clear out more of Samuel, Lord. There's too much Samuel. It's okay. You can say amen to that. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll call your name out next. &gt;&gt; It's too much. I don't know about you, that that's where my mind I I look at those things. I reflect over things. I I look at situations and you see that. Look, even sometimes we think when sickness comes, Lord, is there something going on in my life? Sure, we examine our life, but many times being misunderstood and misjudged, that can be so hurtful. &gt;&gt; You think, I didn't even mean that. &gt;&gt; I wasn't even I wasn't saying that. There times I've had to learn my lesson. Why? There's many times I don't even text. I just call. &gt;&gt; You know why? Sometimes in text &gt;&gt; you don't see somebody's face even though a person knows me. &gt;&gt; But they don't see my face. &gt;&gt; They don't know tone. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; That's why there's a lot of things. It's just like even when I have the trustees meetings, I don't like texts. I like text to communicate or deacons and all the I like text to communicate as far as this is going to happen if such and such but I I why because it is being wise as a serpent and harmless as a dove. &gt;&gt; I know how Satan likes to get in on things. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; It's tone. &gt;&gt; We're not ignorant of his devices. &gt;&gt; And yet we can yet Satan can he all Satan wants to do is bring a misunderstanding. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's what And then he wants to do he starts building and then it's like, "Oh yeah, this makes sense. Oh, then you hear this little clip on the radio. Let me get my mortar. That makes sense. Let me get this. That makes sense." And for long there's a wall. Let me tell you, &gt;&gt; he's our oasis. Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you for this misunderstanding, he's our oasis. &gt;&gt; It's not about, you know, as far as everybody ironing everything out, but yes, the Bible does say, "Let us come. Let's reason together. Let's let's let's" because you know what in reality is? There's things, no doubt that we've been misunderstood, things we've said wrong, and things we've thought wrongly, and my this was said this way. That happens. &gt;&gt; I said that happens. &gt;&gt; It does. &gt;&gt; And that includes everybody. Even if there's somebody hiding in the baptism tank. Weary. Anybody ever get weary? &gt;&gt; I tell you one thing you get get you weary. Sometimes we can get weary. The Bible says this in the book of Galatians the last scripture says be not weary in welloing. You know, one of the biggest discouragements that can come is when you feel like you're pouring in and you see nothing coming back. And then the enemy can start to work on you and say, see, the enemy will kind of just turn it. He'll turn it in a way to say maybe something's wrong with you. And then if you're not careful, then if you've already come through those places, then the enemy wants to turn it as though there's something wrong with the other person. There's a reason the scripture said, "Be not weary in welloing." &gt;&gt; Another part of the scripture says, "For we shall reap if we faint not." &gt;&gt; I want to remind you, he giveth strength &gt;&gt; to the weak. &gt;&gt; I want to remind you, he's he gives encouragement to those that are faint. But Sam, you ever been faint? Oh yeah. Weary. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Remember, discernment is not always what you see, not always what you hear. &gt;&gt; But I I'm just trying to say to you, I'm not a superman. You're not you're we're not super people, but we have an oasis. &gt;&gt; And I can just share from my heart the things that we're I've grown weary. And sometimes, you know what the weary with the weariness of it is? is we think we're doing we think we're doing man what's right and we have we have everything laid out and God brings us to a place and says it's too much your strength &gt;&gt; you don't need to make anything happen you don't need to make anything happen it's just like bringing your children along in the Lord you're right there with them working with them and encourage them, listening to them. Every time when I've talked with Paul and and and I hope you understand when I when I bring these when I bring things up with my family, I'm not a perfect father. Far from it. Many mistakes, but many things I've learned from. But I can tell you one thing is that when I've talked with them and throughout the time, maybe this will help you, is that I never continued every conversation telling them they needed to be born again. &gt;&gt; I know where they're at. I know they need him, but I I needed to be a channel where they could have confidence. &gt;&gt; They could open because you know what? It isn't my words that's going to bring the birth. That's not what did it for them. Him. &gt;&gt; Because you see, that's why we don't want that's why God brings us even into this time and season to where we're not we're not focused on stations of but we recognize that it's and what I mean by stations is we're not looking for a certain thing to happen. And you you have to understand and I I'm over time. You have to understand even the season and the time that we're in. You'll find brother Brandham say a place back there and says I can take you to the day, the time, the hour. Right? How many have heard that? You heard that over the years. Okay. Now pair that with the Sister Bruce interview. I I don't know why that would be troubling, but brother Bam never says, "Oh yeah, Sister Bruce, I see you were at an altar one night. I see this happen." You know what he took her to? what she needed. She needed to stand on the word of God. &gt;&gt; Sister, he says, "Normally, your desires would be this way, but they're not that way anymore." What? What? What changed that? She said, "Christ," he said, "That's your answer." &gt;&gt; See, it's bringing it to because it's God coming and working in a sovereign way. &gt;&gt; I'm overtime. We're looking for an oasis. But I want to say to you, it's a place of refreshment. I I I I've just preached from that thought of and where the Lord just stopped me yesterday morning. It's our oasis. He's our place of refreshment. We're we're a hospital. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, we're a hospital. And in this hospital, we don't This hospital is not just a thirdf flooror hospital. It's emergency room. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of trauma. There's trauma areas. But you know what? There's a chief physician &gt;&gt; who's present to take care of every situation and every situation. He'll lead us right in victory, Lord. But this, but no, I'm right here with you. &gt;&gt; I already knew this, but I've already made a way for you to live and walk in victory. Oh, you might have to keep that area of your life covered with the blood every single day of your life, but I'm I'm letting you know that I am your sufficiency. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm letting you know I'm your all and all. And I'm letting you know greater am I within you &gt;&gt; than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; I'm letting you know you're more than a conqueror through me. &gt;&gt; I gave my life for you that you could live victorious. I shed my blood. I made a way possible that I'm your oasis. &gt;&gt; That when you are parched here, you have a place. You can be refreshed. You can be refreshed. You come out of here. You're re revorated. You know, my wife many times we we're flying somewhere and and you know, I guess it's just, you know, a sister's thing because I just think of get off the plane, I get my baggage, get my car, get checked in at the hotel, and then I'm already starting to look at places to eat. I'm hungry. I've been on coffee the whole and and and this is what she says each time. Well, honey, I just want to go to the room and I need to refresh a little. Refresh. But see, that's not that's the difference. I'm looking at check in, unload, get back in the car, go get something to eat, but I need to refresh, &gt;&gt; you know, from the trials, uh, traveling throughout the day. And I'm glad that God, as his bride, &gt;&gt; he's provided a place of refreshment. &gt;&gt; We can say, Lord, before I face tomorrow, I want to be refreshed today. before I try to approach that which is laying on my desk or on my computer or where that's at. Before I want to be refreshed before I go to meet, I want to be refreshed in your presence, Lord. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sister Judith, he's our oasis. &gt;&gt; He's our place of refreshment. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for that? &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love him. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Blessed be his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer. And maybe as we'll just even just go to the Lord in prayer and then pray for one another and then we'll get ready to just come through the line if the brothers want to go ahead and come. Um, Amen, brother Gomez. And brother Carlos, go ahead. Brother Richard has to leave for to attend to Sister Maria. And we're so thankful for what God's doing for Sister Maria. And man, it's just what a testimony how God is just bringing her right along. And so we want to just offer a word of prayer. What a privilege. I want to say it's such a privilege. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To not only serve the Lord, but it's a privilege to serve you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God could never have given me any higher honor than to be able to serve his people. &gt;&gt; He's faithful. &gt;&gt; And I want to say it to you like I would say to my own children as I would ask them, forgive dad if I responded in the wrong way. If I misjudged something, if I didn't listen and I jumped to it, forgive dad. I want to ask you, forgive me. And I don't want to just just just a casual just I don't want it to be something just blanket, but I mean it from my heart. And if there's something you'd feel like you'd need to come and talk to me, believe me, I won't be offended at all. I want to be I want everything to be reconciled. I won't want I don't want the enemy to have one little way in there, but I want you to know I love you. It's the greatest privilege that God has given to be able to pastor this assembly. We're going to make it. &gt;&gt; I said we're going to make it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Sam, you don't know all the failures, but you know what? You're still his child. &gt;&gt; You're still my brother. You're still my sister. One of these days we step the other side, that's gone. That's gone. But here in this oasis, it's a place to refresh. &gt;&gt; You got wounds, come to the oasis. &gt;&gt; You're weary, come to the oasis. Misunderstood, come to the oasis. &gt;&gt; And for us, I'm coming to the oasis. The refreshing God, give me grace. Help me to discern things the right way. &gt;&gt; Help me to catch things the right way. Help me, Lord. Help me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, how we love you, Lord Jesus. You're so merciful to us, Lord. Oh God, &gt;&gt; we remember Lord what you have done for us, you have made it all possible. As your prophet said, like when we come to this table, he says the table of the Lord, he's talking about us coming together in service and fellowship around the word. And he said that at your table, it's not a menu where you ask for an item and they say, "Oh, we're fresh out of it." But he says, "He's not fresh out of anything. You have what we have need of, Lord. You've not run out of anything on the menu. You've not run out of joy." As a matter of fact, the Bible says, "There's unsearchable riches. You're rich in mercy." Oh, God. Lord, we come to you this morning so thankful for what you've done, where you've brought us from, oh Lord, from all not only different walks of life, but we see what you've done in our lives, where you've brought us, Lord, from just walking about under the prince of power of the air, just out there. But Lord, God, you made a way &gt;&gt; that we could serve you. We could know you, we could live for you. That that's what it's all about, Lord. is to be of service to you. I want to say thank you and I want to say thank you Lord for every test and every trial. I want to say thank you for this oasis that Lord where I can we can look and thank you for the grace that Lord that I and that every individual might be able to reflect in our own lives. Oh God, Lord Jesus, how I thank you. Lord God, the your presence Lord and how you bring us Lord to these realities and to bring us in our lives to these places because you desire to do for us Lord. You desire to move Lord even in a in a deeper way in our lives. So I ask Lord that you would forgive us of our sins and our shortcomings. Forgive us Lord &gt;&gt; if we've offended Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I pray Lord you'd forgive me. Forgive every one of your children. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, for the misunderstandings, misjudgments, oh God, I pray in this oasis, Lord, of your presence, will you just move through, Lord, for every one of our hearts, Lord, through every womb, through every Lord, the weary, Lord. Oh God, would you just Lord just so encourage us Lord? Give us Lord a real refreshing Lord and just Lord our expectations that it would be in you Lord what it will ought to be for this season in this moment. Help us give us the wisdom Lord give us the wisdom and discernment Lord even in our approaches Lord. Oh God we need you Lord. Oh father, as you said, the sons of God are led by the spirit of God. That is a privilege, Lord. Oh Jesus, grant it. Lord, I pray, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, in the name of Jesus Christ, as we come, Lord, to partake of this bread and of this wine, Lord, representing your body that was broken for us and your blood that was shed for us. Lord, we are one worthy, Lord God. But you reached down your hand for us, Lord. Oh Lord God, you brought us, Lord Jesus, like we were, Lord, at times like the woman at the well. Nobody cared, Lord, but you cared, Lord. And I can't altogether say nobody cared. I had different ones around me. I know they had parents, but I think of other brothers, Lord, who took an interest in me. They would talk to me about things that they knew I was interested in. Oh God, you expressed your care through those lives. I never forget those brothers. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Father. Oh, God. I pray. We want to say thank you because just as you laid down your life as brothers and sisters, Lord, what a privilege and lives have been laid down for us that we can have this blessing that we have now. Lord, I pray God may you just bless the worshipper in such a special way. Lord, we love you and we thank you in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Maybe brother Gomez, just have you stand right here and then brother Carlos on over there. Why don't we have the musicians go ahead and come first and then that way you can come on up and play for us. Amen. musicians first.
