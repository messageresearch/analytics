god bless y'all so good to be with you today we're just really uh privileged to be with the bride of jesus christ again this morning we'll go to the lord here in a word of prayer in a moment but i just wanted to take a moment and greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ on behalf of my church and my pastor ray erickson and uh you know this this group of people they must be a praying group of people because uh you know i was studying and things yesterday for the service and i had a direction i wanted to go and the lord spoke to me about a different kind of a thought and well i'll just be real honest i'm like well that you know it wasn't what my opinion was so i just assumed it was my imagination that's how we do amen but as the lord just began to deal with deal with me and stuff and i got up this morning i looked i said well that's just not going to work i guess so i'm just going to try to mine the lord this morning that's what we that's what we want to do in our lives is just follow the leadership of the lord and i believe that's why you're here today amen so uh you just pray for this guy because i uh i don't know how this is actually gonna go so i'm going to take a a note from brother jewel foreign's playbook i'm just going to get in the helicopter and i'm going to start going up and somewhere in here when you start getting tired i'll just parachute out amen but god has ordained us to soar in heavenly places amen let's just bow our heads for word of prayer heavenly father i'm so grateful today to be here with this people lord that you've preserved our lives and you've delivered us from destruction father i i pray today that there'd be a call and a moving in the bride of christ here today to stand up and tackle the hold take a hold of the power that john and peter knew father today how we're needing soldiers how are we needing men and women of god with a backbone to endure hardness to soldiers and to stand and having done on this evil day to stand may they put on the whole armor of god even today as they've risen up out of their pews may they rise above the things of this world may they rise above the expectations that the enemy has placed upon them for for defeat for for for them to go down in flames but today there's a bride of christ that's been ordained to rise above the things of this world father i pray in jesus name you just bless the minister of the word help me now to move out of the way come and speak that which is needful to the lives and the hearts of these your dear children and father and all that's said and done we just pray you'd receive great glory and honor in our midst may you watch over the pastor today as he's out ministering may you help him to deliver the heart of god to the people that he's ministering to we thank you for the different gifts present here today even in this body we pray that you bless each one to the furtherance of your kingdom for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever we thank you and we give you the praise now in jesus christ's name amen god bless you the book of second kings this morning have you turn here into the second chapter thank you lord jesus second kings in the second chapter we're going to read verses 8 to 14. so i preached this a while back at the home church brother brian erickson he comes up to me afterwards and he says you know you used the same title for another sermon one time i said oh well that's embarrassing i said what did i preach about i said i don't remember i said well i guess you need to hear it again so i don't think i've used this but it was just it's interesting how god can take a text the word of god is amazing god you could he can take the same scripture and it just unfolds into a different thought all the time i thought you know it's amazing how god can take this and go so many different directions with this and so i believe god come to right where you're at today whatever your direction is god is not ignorant of your address or where you live you can go right there amen you can take the same scripture that men have read for thousands of years and it can make it personal to you today amen so that wasn't a warning that was an encouragement to you second kings in the second chapter we would read verse 8 to 14 here and hopefully my coffee kicks in here soon not too much um let's see here uh verse 14 it says so he departed from elisha and came to his master who said to him what said elisha to thee i'm sorry i went to the last verse see i told you i'm i'm a mess here verse eight you know what i'm in the wrong chapter i even bookmarked it well you pray for this old guy i told you i was a mess but i didn't realize there was a hot mess here and elijah took his elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters and they were divided hither in feather so that the two they too went over on dry ground and it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee before i be taken away from thee and elisha said i pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me and he said thou hast asked a hard thing you know i think god likes it sometimes when we ask hard things amen everybody asks him for easy things somebody's going to ask him for something impossible because god wants to show he does the impossible amen thou has asked me a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when i am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so and it came to pass as they still went on and talked to behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire imparted them both asunder and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and elisha saw and cried my father my father the chariot of israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and wrapped them in two pieces he took up also the mantle of elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of jordan and he took the mantle of elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is the lord god of elijah and when he also had smit in the waters they parted hither and thither and elisha went over may the lord bless the reading of his word and shall be seated this morning i'd like to take from my text or my thought this morning dressed for success i've been dressed for success amen we look at brother branham he he speaks about the adoption and of course throughout the series in his ministry he speaks about adoption and he mentions that there's a special robe that is given to a son when he's being recognized as a as an adopted son he makes different illusions to this robe and the scripture makes different illusions different places when we look at christ and his own transfiguration and his appearance and his reignment changes and he's glorified before his disciples and we see adoption in christ in the changing of his appearance even his identification as the son of god amen and we we look at this as a group of believers the scripture tells us that we also are going to be clothed in immortality with glorious bodies likened unto his own well that i feel better about that already because i know how confused this one was you just saw it amen man i just have a hard time getting out of bed amen but one day i'm gonna be clothed upon from on high with immortality i'm not gonna get mixed up in my words i'm not gonna have to worry about back pain and heartaches and discouragement and all this the stuff that this pest house carries i'm gonna have a glorious body likened unto his own amen the scripture says for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly desire i tell you what i'm earnestly desire and i desired it before but the older i get the more i earnestly desire it i really want it i'm really fed up with this one hey man i've got i've got all this stuff boiling in me from my ancestor and i'm just sick of it amen amen but i'm earnestly designed we are earnestly desiring amen earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but closed upon that mortality might be swallowed up in life amen so this idea it's an exhaustive subject i couldn't get to it all one service amen but this idea there's so many different illusions even throughout the scripture of garments you look at the garments of high priests and the blind bartimaeus and these different things and you know jesus tells a story about the wedding and we know about the wedding garment amen i believe we have a wedding garment today the holy ghost is a wedding garment for the believer that when the wedding supper comes we don't have to be ashamed and then there's not gonna be one fault in the believer amen when christ when god looks at us through the veil of the blood of christ he doesn't see your faults he doesn't see your mistakes he doesn't see your mishaps he doesn't see the things that you see you see things in you and sometimes you would disqualify yourself said i don't know how it's gonna be lord he's not looking at what you're looking at he's looking at the sea that's laying on the inside amen he has a desire to clothe that with immortality because it's his seat amen listen it's not you the person it's the attribute he placed in you the attribute in you is greater than your humanity it's greater than your misgivings it's greater than your flesh it's greater than your inability praise the lord somebody well you ought to feel pretty good about that amen that we're not going to be final wanting amen listen you can have a position in the church you can quote every quote and you can be gifted amen but only that wedding garment is going to count on that day he wants to see it represented there amen praise the lord somebody listen he haven't he even had a friend show up but the friend didn't have the garment on and was cast out amen so we want to make sure like queen esther we want to come before the king according to the commandment of the king what does he desire what is he looking for if he's looking for the holy ghost if he's looking for this message to be on display in our lives then the only thing that's going to matter to him is the token over our lives amen it's not enough to preach about a token it's not enough to say we believe in a token it must be on display in our lives it must adorn us we must adorn this gospel in our lives amen you know brotherhood tells this story we're familiar with it this boy he uh he come from the armor company there and he was coming back in a year to marry that girl we know that story and we we preach about that story and you know the people they made fun of this girl and you know brother bam talks about you know she couldn't even afford the dress i want you to understand this garment that we're talking about this this wedding garment you couldn't even afford to buy it if you wanted to see sometimes we try to pay the price sometimes we think we're going to buy our way in well you know there's many that will come to him in that day well i've done this and i've done that listen she couldn't even afford to buy the dress amen but brother braham says he was looking for virtue not clothes he had enough money to buy all the clothes was necessary he says god don't care how big your fancy things you have he owns everything in the world so he wants virtue he wants something that's real [Applause] listen don't ever take that for granted well i don't have this and i'm not that you know brother branham talks about this well i wish i was a billy graham i wish i could be an oral roberts and he said sometimes the devil just laughed at that and then but life is what makes the difference i mean don't ever take that for granted because the world will will wave every kind of a thing in front of you today it'll laugh and call you names and say listen we can provide you with the material you need to make a better looking dress but the only material that'll clothe you is this word amen he doesn't need anything that human instrumentality can offer amen we don't lack for the material tonight that's what the message has come for right amen and then it astounds me men they'll read this message they'll listen to the prophet and then they begin to look for other things why they're looking for something else listen i've got everything i need to make it into a wedding supper i've got everything i need for the garment amen this bride she has taken the material this word she has taken this message she has fashioned this garment she has made herself ready with what's been provided to her amen i believe that's what the bride's been provided amen brother bam said that that the scripture tells us amen the ministry of malachi fort brother graham said what was it his great hope he said that that god would allow me to take the clothes of this word and dress this bride with the clothes of this word now i want to ask you the question did he do it see this is the question it's not could he do it or will he do it did he already do it because if he already did there's nothing else for you to do he's provided everything that's why the prophet said when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost everything you need is in you even the rapture is already in you so we don't have to go look for we're not looking for him in the desert we're not looking for him in the bed chamber the kingdom is in you now by the holy ghost amen amen brother man preaches the sermon the seed shall not be heir with the shock is that listen did they separate is the question today amen they're not separating they've already separated amen the life has already left the shock and gone into the sea there's nothing left out there for you to find life amen i asked you the question they asked him at the grave that day when jesus got out of the grave why would you seek the living among the dead if there's no life in it then it's not worth nothing to you amen praise the lord somebody it's all in the seed now and what is the seed but the representation that the life that went in the ground has come back in its full maturity it's come back in the fullness of its power it's back in the fullness of its maturity amen it's identified by the seed amen the tear and the wheat were not identified till the seed come out amen you look at abram and this type of adoption and brother bram talks about how he nurse from el shadda el shaddai the breasted one because it looked like it looked like in the natural he was getting weaker all the time amen see you look at the natural you look at yourself i feel like i'm just i i'm getting weaker all the time well we are naturally speaking i mean once you hit 25 brother bram said you can eat all the right foods you can you can do all the right things you can run on the treadmill you can do all this but somewhere your body's on a decline somewhere how we'd like to stop that how we'd like to turn back the wheels of time and go back but listen you and i can't do that but we're getting a body one day and listen it's actually better this picture that was taken to you before the foundation of the world it wasn't taken when you were 18 it wasn't taken at your best it was taken before the foundation of the world you're actually going back you're getting something better man it looks like you're getting weaker but you're nursing from the blessed one else to die gaining strength all the time your body might be weak your your abilities might be weaker but your faith is waxing strong abraham's faith grew with an expectation as time went on he knew the promise would be fulfilled in his life amen amen god comes along brother talks about this god comes along says i'm the father of all creation elohim and now i'm going to take abram i'm going to make him a father of nations i'm going to put my own name into his name i'm going to breathe my own life into his name and place it there i'm going to place think about it i'm going to place my name in his name and i'm gonna place him and i'm gonna put my breath into him that's what paul says in the fourth chapter of the book of galatians he says a child when he's just a child he doesn't differ anything from a servant amen there's no identification the wheat looks just like the tears it looks the same amen we can look through seven church changes and sometimes we can scratch our head because it looks like there's so much carnality it looks like there's so much of man involved how could god bring this forth to pass but it wasn't their humanity it was the seed that was in them it was moving forward all the time and in this day in this hour you sitting here today in 2021 the seed is no longer just being carried it's been manifested amen brother brahm says this he said that he came to place abraham and he did it by changing his name he placed him why it was an identification to him amen paul says when that child becomes of age he's no longer a servant but he's a son and if a son he's an heir of god through christ amen today we are the sons of god behold now are we the sons of god it doesn't appear what we shall be but when he shall appear i believe he's appeared to us i believe christ has come by the message of the hour to give us an identification because who he is is who she is she is right now bone of his bone word of his word flesh of his flesh powers power she's the flesh of him and the spirit of him she is him the same word that spoke of this bridegroom it speaks of the bride today she's been identified as an heir of god and a joint heir with christ amen but the brahman says we've had churches churches we've had bride's brides listen everybody claims to be a bride or a church or something amen everybody makes claims but this is not a man making a claim this is not even a prophet making a claim this is god making a claim over you you didn't make this claim about you you didn't call brother bill you didn't call yourself the virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ he called you that amen is that right brother paul he didn't say oh you didn't sit here and i got you know what i wrote this book i said all these good things about myself everybody does that and then every every october and november we hear a bunch of politicians tell us how good they are hey man well we're gonna do this and we're gonna do that and the buck stops here except when it doesn't hey man oh they all can they can all pronounce their own virtue but this is something that god has said about you i didn't make this claim i didn't make this promise you didn't say this listen you're not obligated to fulfill it god spoke it god put it in your life brother brian god pronounce this it's god's it's it's his that he has to bring to pass amen listen a child don't raise himself can you imagine some child who live in arizona no god said the tudor god brought a church through church ages and what was it to do this was god think about this this bride that's sitting here today you are god's achievement you got to wake up in the morning look in the mirror after you get your coffee and pull all the sleep out of your eyes so you know what there's god's achievement some of you felt that way before you got saved you ought to feel that way once you do get saved amen praise the lord somebody oh my she's a dennis listen and i want you to understand this idea of identification because this this shows the maturity of the identification there is no identification of the child until they come of age and then so it shows the spirit of the age that we're and we're not just under justification under luther sanctification we've come to the maturity of the word amen he's placed his name in you listen he made the distinction that's why brother branham says i don't call you church i call you bride he made the distinction you didn't do i'm not calling myself bride the prophet my inspiration called me the bride i'm not just a bridesbridge you're not just another church another bride you're the bride of christ your missus jesus christ put his name in you you're the provided place of worship what makes you the provided place of worship he put his name in you like he did with abraham he placed you and he called you out seven church changes they didn't know who they were in the scripture but a ministry comes at the end time and places them and it places us we're not walking around presuming and probing and wondering but today we know who they are and who we are under the opening of the seals we know who we are god's not left one thing off today praise the lord somebody but the ramp says his reign talk about christ they're on the mount transfiguration it says his raiment shine like the sun a special robe a special anointing amen listen you've got a special anointing the rest of the world chases all these anointings wow we need this anointing we want the anointing hitler was anointed khrushchev was anointed but you've got a special anointing this is the anointing that come down from aaron's beard this is where god commanded the blessing even life forevermore amen he says when they looked up they saw him shining in the glory of god and the voice said this is my beloved son hear ye him he says oh my what god wants to do with the church tonight wants to do with an individual find somebody he says the holy spirit is searching to find men probably heard me say this before but i make i've made this statement the past said you know if you think about it satan's just imitating god they're doing the same thing hey man satan's looking to and fro is that right he's looking to and fro trying to find somebody to devour but the eyes of the lord are also looking to and fro he's looking for somebody whose heart is perfect toward him to show himself mighty why did god look for you why did god come to you it wasn't to leave you in defeat it wasn't abandoning you he wants to show himself mighty on your behalf that's his purpose he didn't come to show you failure and inability and weakness and fear he came to show you courage and ability and power [Applause] he says what god wants to do with the church what he wants to do with an individual find somebody the holy spirit is searching to find men he can take him out to a certain place speak to that person anoint them and give them something special great powers and gifts to work his will notice why to work his will and to do his will again he says he will put his rope of power upon you you adopt you to then by the the adoption give you power to work for him now brother van damme i'll just throw this out here he uses the idea of a mantle and a robe interchangeably amen but you i want you to think about this and we i didn't read all through the scripture but you're probably familiar with this story amen but he comes back he's got this mantle or this robe or whatever you want to call it it wasn't a flip-flop i guess but this this mantle that he's wearing and at this time there's a school the prophets in this school the prophets they are they're sitting there and they are looking and when elijah comes back they said that we're gonna go look for elijah notice the attitude of the school the prophets these were anointed men these are preachers they went to a certain seminary or something i don't know what these religious prophetic educated men when elijah leaves the scene what do they look to do they look to imitate or define elijah well you know i guess the spirit of god just carried we gotta go find elijah wherever our lives at we gotta go be where elijah's at and they missed that that wasn't about elijah anymore the anointing that had been on elijah was on elisha amen you've got people i'm not gonna get all this but you look at you look at your charismatic your pentecostal churches they've got people it's like this guy well praise the lord i'm i'm going here now i guess i don't have this in my notes so hold on pray for me like you've got this guy who's down in florida here a few years ago and he's preaching and he said that the lord called him he said two angels to him he said he sent william branham's angel he sent the money angel i don't know what that money angel's about i haven't found him yet amen but they found this look they're all claiming this anointing oh listen they don't want to accept the teaching william branham but they all want the ministry of it that's all come down they're one of the benefits but they don't want to have the accountability they don't have to stay with us saith the lord they said this school the prophets is no different they're looking around for elijah where's elijah we'll go find him and elijah told him there's no need for you to go luck right they compelled him to the bible said he was ashamed fine go live for him because well we couldn't find him i know you couldn't i told you you couldn't big ol i told you so man i tell you what you know i used to feel so bad about that you know people come up praise the lord people come up and this and that and stuff and you know you don't want to tell them i told you so but you did and i thought about well that's what they did in the bible i told you so well you can use that if you want listen paul dealt with that one time they go to loose off this boat and he and they're out there on the seat for 14 days they're about to drown and paul comes back said i told you you should not you should have listened to me when i said don't leave chris that's what he did i'm big oh i told you so listen i told you you should listen to me the first time but fear not the aim for the lord stood by me this night and he's told me that there'll be no loss of life on this well praise god for his mercy hey man it's interesting to me because we had a prophet come and tell us certain things in this day and people they want to leave the pattern of the word or the pattern of the message the thing that was sent to dress us they want to leave it and then when they leave it and everything falls apart you're just you're trying not to be like he told you so i told you so you know you got kids you know listen sometimes you got kids and you're trying to praise the lord and you're trying to get to them and they won't listen you gotta you gotta drive them at home brother graham said i told you that was gonna happen you're not doing me caddy or maybe you are partly maybe your motivation's a little a little skewed there but the reason is not to try to rub it in their face the reason is you're trying to say listen i told you for a reason i tried to warn you i'm trying to help you out listen elijah was just trying to save them a lot of time they're running around looking for elijah but listen praise the lord they were looking for the wrong thing why because elisha knew where elijah went he watched him the whole time he watched the ministry he saw the fulfillment he recognized what it was he didn't have to go find elijah he knew he wasn't going to find him anywhere on this earth because he saw him take it up [Music] but what i love about this is elisha asked the right question amen right you know many times in life i've just dropped this in here many times in life our situation that we're dealing with what we're trying to contend with or what we're trying to understand it's not a matter of us getting the right answer we're always trying to find the answers to our questions but we actually have the answer amen we have the answer to the devil's question amen the problem is not the answer we have the answer but are we asking the right question right amen sometimes we go well i'm just gonna like i said i'm just gonna be real i'm gonna fly up here a little bit now amen sometimes in my own life maybe you can relate to this sometimes you're looking for direction in your life and you're praying to god what should i do here where should i go there we're trying to find direction we're asking god should i do this or should i do that and i've learned this is what i'm getting to i've learned in my life to change the way i asked god questions god should i do this should i do that no god what do you want to do what is your purpose god help me to see the bigger picture because many times we're missing the bigger picture we see what we want to see we see what we envision we have our ideas and our goals and our opinions and we throw up to god we want him to spike it in the ground for us but what we're going to do is expand our question lord what are you trying to show me in all this whether i'm suffering whether i'm distressed whether i don't know which way to go it's not just a matter of direction but god what are you trying to show me in this what is god trying to teach me amen amen well i hope that's all right amen we whatever your question is today we have the answer amen there was an answer to their question they're looking for elijah elijah's gone elisha knew the answer amen we ask ourselves you know it's like people let give you an example in our a young man's life you know you you talk to young men they want to know what do i have to do to be successful in life that's not the question the question is what is success amen listen you can a success is not based on your bank account or your popularity or this see they ask the wrong questions well would i get it to be rich or famous or this or that no you're missing the point what is real success what is the real point of it all right amen they're asking us where's elijah at but elisha knew the secret the question wasn't where's elijah where is the god of elijah the god of elijah is the one that parts the waters the god of elijah had already come back and parted the water for him he didn't need to know where elijah went he had to know where the god of elijah was and let me say to you today just because william branham is gone just because the prophet is going off the scene god is still here today we don't have to ask wasn't going to come back and fly around the world and go on a tent and do this that's not important the important question is where is the god of this prophet [Applause] do we know where he's at i know where he's at he's the jordan of my life when i was bound for a lottery grade he made away from me i know what he's done in my life amen the right it's the right question it wasn't i mean that was that's my testimony as a center i was trying to do this i was trying to do that i couldn't figure out why does everything backfire it seems like no matter what i do i do what everybody else does but doesn't work for me that's because i wasn't like everybody else god corrects his own children he doesn't correct the other children of the world but he corrects us out god won't let me get away with one thing sometimes you go along man why why do i get stuck every time i try to get away with one thing god's right there why because he loves you might not seem like it might not feel like he loves you that's why listen no chastisement seems pleasant that's a notice that said oh praise god i'm getting a whooping today hallelujah god give me another let nobody does that we act all spiritual i'm just doing this for the yeah whatever i'm biblical nobody likes it when they get spanked but it's for your good amen praise the lord somebody brother i didn't come here get beat up today well listen i'm not trying to beat you up or anything i'm just saying listen if god correct i'm getting ahead of myself a little bit but if god corrects you that means he loves you it don't mean he hates you listen i don't go to other people's kids and and whip them and now i might feel like it sometimes but i don't go out there but i do it to my own and i don't do it to my own just because i'm mad at them or i want to work them over and let them know who the boss is i do it because i love them i don't want to grow up and be a misfit like i was when i grew up well praise the lord listen this mantle this this mantle of succession these prophets like today they're all they all want you praise the lord i'm i'm just gonna be myself i guess for a moment i was talking about sister mita branham the other day and i thought you know that poor woman think about the things she went through you know brother brandon come home and he's seen the house a mess and this and that listen she has can you imagine waking up and you get out of bed and you walk in the living room and you got people staying in the living room that you don't even know who they are i believe in the second amendment i'll just say that but i mean but seriously though i mean you just walk in and there's some woman there god has told me that i'm to be the manager over your husband's ministry and if not thus saith the lord he's gonna you gotta deal with this all day long why everybody wanna control the mantle hey man they want control and listen we've had it even this message amen let's not get quiet now we've had eighth day messengers and ninth gay messengers and a brother bear made a foundation for my ministry everybody wants to be the successor oh we want the gift of god we want william bran's ministry no you really don't you want your ministry to be vindicated because you want god to validate your opinion amen somebody listen when god spoke to elijah and he told me i want you to anoint the prophet elijah in my stand elijah wasn't looking for it right but he was there pawing the field straight doing daddy's work and god said i chose him he didn't choose me i chose elijah listen to the prophet of this day you didn't go looking for this message you weren't seeking after it god chose you and this thing that all these men these people they want to claim it we've got we're the successor of this ministry we've got this anointing we've got this mantle everything they wanted everything they're looking for all these sons of the prophet they're looking for god give it to you you're over here on the other side of the river saying what are you looking for it for it's right here and they're looking at you going really i don't know about that listen how do you know you're wearing the same clothing you're clothed with the same word amen it doesn't matter how it looks to the people it doesn't matter what it looks like to the theologian you've been clothed with the word and the anointing of this ministry there was such power in elijah's ministry that even when he was in the grave it brought a dead man back to life and i believe the message of this hour in this bride even if you go by way of the grave today if you were to go home and die today the ministry that you've been given will raise you it will raise your family it will raise the seven churches out of a grave of death and darkness he said how do you know brother because he's already resurrected us out of north denominationalism he's already resurrected us when we were dead in sins and trespasses up here today claimed to be some successor to the ministry of william branham but i do believe that the same spirit that was on that man that was in paul that was in these prophets it's here today with me and with you what to do the same thing you did there fulfill the will of god right amen amen god is bringing up people into perfection by the word of the lord brother says he didn't alter his robe to fit elisha he ordered elisha to fit the robe amen see everybody's trying to be this guy and all you've got all wrong you have to make sure you fit grow into the road amen that's what he does today he altered he says he alters the rope and he corrects himself not the robe to fit us sometimes we want to make the robe fit us but we can't do that we've got to be altered yourself for the robe it's god's robe and he made it perfect we've got he said he's got to bring us into that realm to make the robe fit us now for the sake of time i just want to skip down here to read this next part but in the same sermon he says this he says notice all these years as far as we know he's just had one baptism of the robe going over him amen but through the years god has molded the man's character into a place to where after his call after his call he would fit into the robe and be the servant of the lord amen amen so i i think this is important to us this is what we're looking at today we look at the promises of god we look at the church without spot or wrinkle we look at a catching away sometimes it looks like the garment isn't going to fit amen and men in the message have tried to make the garment fit well if you do this you do that well if you had rapturing faith there'd be a rapture that's not how it works i mean men have tried to produce a rapture they've tried to produce the move of god because they didn't have the character fit into the robe that's why they have to try to produce something it's they're trying to manufacture something that's why it doesn't work amen god fitted this robe of this bride amen when he made this robe he cut it to just the dimensions he was looking for amen he doesn't he listen he doesn't have to measure twice and cut once he knew the exact dimensions and he cut perfect the first time hey man i tell you what a lot better than me i cut three or four times then i got to start over and buy another thing and don't ask me to make a garment for you amen but i believe malachi forest provided a garment for us amen what was this ministry to do to dress the bride amen the father in adopting his son he places him in authority over the family business he has a robe and that robe is not fitted for that child at their in their youth it's fitted for them in their maturity that's why god couldn't send the message until this hour that's why he couldn't send a token until this hour there had to be a people that could receive it in its fullness so he grew them into this this this realm of maturity amen amen says this this at the end of the church age book resume of the ages because it makes this point i think sometimes we forget about this we we look at the other ages we just kind of well you know they they're whatever and this that no they were who they were supposed to be for their age and if we're not careful we discount them and you forget they're part of the adoption they're part of the resurrection as well yeah brother braham says this might make some wonder if we said that the lutherans didn't have the holy spirit because they taught basically justification it might make some wonder about the methodists etc he says no sir we're not saying that we're not talking about the individuals or the people what you realize now he's making the distinction here i want you to make this for yourself amen you you look at the age you're in amen you look at these people in their age he's talking about we're not he says we're not talking about the individuals or the people but the age he said luther had the spirit of god yeah hey man i thought i'd give you more amens on that well listen if god can give it to luther he can give it to you praise the lord somebody with his smoking and drinking and hating the jews god give it to him so he can give it to you praise the lord well first of all he says here but his age was not the age of full restoration by another outpouring like in the beginning it was the same with wesley booth knox whitfield brainerd jonathan edwards mueller etc surely they were full of the holy ghost yes they certainly were but the age in which they lived was not the age of restoration neither was any age but this last edge now he's telling you where you're at you're not coming into the age of restoration you are in the age of restoration now i'm making i'm laying this out for a point because we tend to put this stuff out somewhere but he's saying it's here now they actually had everything that you have they just didn't know it the potentials was laying in him the whole time but the potential is not just laying in you it's been expressed through an identification in the message listen you didn't know you were an eagle until you saw what an eagle looked like i didn't know eagles could soar that high we've seen one sword that high i didn't know an eagle could rise above that i didn't know an eagle could love its enemy like that we've seen one we've got a witness today you can fly that high you don't have to stay down here they didn't know but we know he says neither was any age but this age that's what he identifies this age as the age of complete blackout in apostasy this is the age of apostasy and this is the age of restoration amen it is the age of the finished cycle with this it's all over amen so all the potential is there but when the message came it's over there that's why there's nothing else to come it's finished amen praise the lord so they they have in them the same potentials brotherhood talks about it goes to the it was dr reed head that luther and dean said do we have the holy ghost said well potentially the potentials was always there amen luther is no less the son of god than you and i are but he just didn't have the full revelation of it like you and i do like we have today we have it today we have by divine vindication the perfect interpretation to this word amen god didn't give it in that asian it's fullness why because he couldn't right that's what isaiah 28 talks about it was here a little and there a little that what isaiah said it's lined up online it's precept upon precept here a little there a little amen listen it was the same thing i tie this into the adoption the promised land it was the same thing when israel come into the promised land to take their position there what did god say to them in deuteronomy 7. he said don't be afraid about these people he said the lord god is among you is he is he among us today he said a mighty and terrible god notice the lord that god will will put out those nations before thee little by little all right thou mayest not consume them at once lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee but the lord shall thy god shall deliver them unto thee thou shalt destroy them with a mighty destruction until they be destroyed brother bram says this he says god said i'm not this is in testimony 53 he says i'm not going to give it to you all at one time if i give it to you one time it says the whole land will be swept bare then the wild beast will multiply against you and will overcome you i'm just going to give it to you little by little as you're able to possess the land i'm just gonna drive them out and give it to you little by little now i think this is really important and it's noteworthy to me why didn't god just do it all at once like that because god ordained to give it to you little by little because that was the only way they could bear it amen think about that loser had the nature but he didn't have the revelation to have what you have today because god ordained something better for us that they without us should not be made perfect man you think about this uh well i don't mean to get political but i guess we're i'm in ohio i'll be okay we look at this foreign policy disaster that is afghanistan praise the lord brother amen some some of y'all gonna be running around yeah you know listen i wouldn't i'm i'm a christian first not a democratic republican amen but you look at this foreign it's a does that let's just call it it's a disaster it's an absolute disaster why looks and they went in there and they blew up people and they machine gunned them down and they rolled in tanks they flew jets and we've got the greatest military on the face of the earth but we couldn't possess the land hey man listen that's that's the american way of doing things we're just going to go in that carpet bomb everything into the stone age we'll show them listen you can't live in a land like that it's not fit to occupy listen when god called these people in this promised land he didn't just come in there to go lay at waste and wipe it out and bomb it with an atomic bomb he said no i want you to go there and possess the land you're not just there to destroy these guys you're there to occupy this land i want you to take the wilderness and make it blossom like a rose i want you to take something barren and make it live you say what are you getting god's not just trying to just feed our enemy today and blow them out of the sky right that's our american mindset we'll go in there we'll show that we'll blow them all up you can't live there afterwards god likes this land this land that we want to blow up he likes it he actually wants you to live there he wants your children to live there he wants your children's children to live there he doesn't want you to utterly destroy it he just wants you to drive out everything that doesn't belong to him hey man you say where are you going with this i'm going somewhere amen listen if we were called to inhabit listen they were called to inhabit houses they didn't build listen we're called to inhabit a building not made with human hands god's given us something amen amen and sometimes you gotta take it one step at a time right listen i i i'm just gonna not presume but i'm just gonna drop this in here i i would assume or i would say this god told them not to utterly take the land all at once because that was probably in their mind to do that amen listen guys now i know when you think you get in there you're just going to flip every table over and burn every bridge down and blow everything up but i actually i want you to know i'm not going to do it that way i'm gonna do it little by little he said the same thing through isaiah about revelation amen i want you to know i'm gonna do it little by little it might seem like it's just one step at a time and we as human beings sometimes we get discouraged because progress doesn't come in our own lives now talk about possessing your vessel now hey man let's talk about you for a moment we've talked about israel we've talked about abraham let's talk about you for a minute sometimes in our own lives we we look at the the slowness of progress and we say why why why am i still wrestling with this why do i solve this complex from when i was a child why do i still seem to wrestle with this because god's doing it a little bit at a time sometimes listen because god doesn't want to destroy the land he actually wants to live in it amen so he can't just wipe you out amen because listen when you receive the holy ghost you still have a nature man but man talk about honey said god didn't take that out when i got born again there's part of you that god likes he don't want to blow it up he likes that part of you so he says listen if i have to give it to you a little bit at a time that's how i'm going to give it to you because i don't want you to just obliterate that guy i like that guy he's my son he's my daughter amen well praise the lord is that all right listen when you when you make a claim to this promise it doesn't matter how long it takes amen if you speak to the mountain and it moves one grain of sand at a time that's still one more grain than the that move than there was yesterday it's like i always say if you can move in an inch you can move it all the way it's just a matter of time and patience i mean you can claim your deliverance today you can claim your loved ones today you can speak to your mountain today and even if it doesn't look like it's moving real fast remember god took seven church ages just to get you here god is not in a hurry in your life [Applause] we get in a hurry well god i got so much to do listen he's not sitting there sweating because the time's almost up listen saint's the one that's sweating he knows he's got a short time and he can't do anything about it god's not worried about the time it's in his hands [Applause] well praise the lord brother bram said you might not even be able to notice it moving so he say amen but it's moving why because god said so amen so listen we have to come we have to be patient with ourselves amen because god wants to have the right character amen for this adopted son this adopted daughter he wants to make sure they have his likeness and his character so he's going to take his time whether you like it or not and you probably don't amen we probably don't like it when god takes his time with our neighbor we're like man i wish god hurry up with this guy i wish god hurry up with the deacon or the pastor my brother my sister my husband listen god's taking his time just on you like he does anybody else well praise the lord listen i believe let me just i'm gonna make a statement here and this might not be popular but this is how i feel about people's approach to church you know uh people we we get in a place like these israelites we get in a big hurry amen we'll go and we'll go to church and we'll chase one ministry we'll chase another we'll go from special services to special services we'll go from revival to revival and i marvel because people that go to these things and they come out and all it was just so great it was amazing it was life-changing it was so dynamic and yet they lived the same kind of life they've always lived before i'm like life change was like the worst adjective to use there like it was almost life-changing it was borderline life-changing you say where you're going out with this i what i'm saying is this we can go and chase things and go after things but people's lives if they're not spiritually different they're no stronger than they were years ago something's wrong with the picture amen and i realize this is why i say this people that go with this expectation they want great sweeping changes in their life we expect this great sweeping change in our life because they don't have the patience for little changes amen we want god to which god's just going to come in and boom just flip it well he could do it that way but do you have the patience if he does it a little bit at a time amen see we despise the days of small things oh i can't wait for this preacher and i can't wait for this what about your pastor preach on the midweek we have the patience to come in and be changed a little bit at the time er see what we gotta we got to have everything set see it's like amazon we don't get in two days i ain't over internet listen god's not here to be a delivery boy hey man he'll give it to you when he's good ready i shall give it to you when you're good and ready you just think you're ready or not oh praise the lord well i told it's not pop it's true though people that go to church they're like junkies they're looking to get some high from a church but they forget the fruit grows with the valley hey man it's not the big great things it's the little things we leave undone it's that little bit of land that we just neglect it and it falls into disarray in our lives and we get so upset but i remind you that god is hidden in the simplicity of it amen see we want to come on our own like god just carpet bomb this thing in my life no listen maybe god wants to make a testimony out of that yes amen well praise the lord like i said we and listen well that's the truth anyhow amen we'll do that in church listen it's it's entertainment we come in here and we preach against the devil well the devil this and the devil that we'll just talk about in the church we all praise god we're going to show the devil we're gonna show him we'll call him every filthy name in the book we'll make fun of him and laugh at him and we sit there we try to blow up the devil like that and you all forget church people forgot the devil's not even your worst enemy all right [Music] oh praise the lord i'm going to preach to you now oh man i showed the devil this and the devil down hallelujah praise god i'm going to show him who we're going to show the devil listen you're the guy oh we don't shout about well you'll get quiet about that one yeah i'm gonna show me take that you pig headed off amen that's what you get for being so stubborn and indifferent y'all got no no we don't do that oh we'll show the devil we'll run him down we're going to preach against him we're going to show him this and we're bigger than the door listen he's defeated already right that's like kicking a gun when he's down that don't prove nothing that's not what god's trying to possess he wants this vessel and we don't get excited and we don't shout about us dying out daily because nobody likes dying daily we don't enjoy that we don't oh praise god i got to suffer word of god he's trying my character i've suffered like no we're the off scouring of all things none of us do that that's what we need oh we love running down everything else but ourselves you're your own biggest obstacle we make such a big deal out of this listen actually people i'll just say this i'm going to say this that people give the devil too much credit right you're actually glorifying him well you know i was driving 65 in the 55 and i got pulled over oh the devil no you did that hey man well praise the lord that's what brother brahman said who the devil made me do he said no he didn't you went out to him because if you got him here and got sealed he couldn't get to you you made the mistake you got carnal you got away from god and you paid the price you've got well praise the lord [Music] listen to zeal this hours not to sit here and run over the devil who's already defeated the zealous hour not just to sit here and trump it and be whatever we're just so great it's to repent right it's like the one thing nobody wants to do what is the lord everybody wants to blow up the devil man watch the size of this nuke you know it's like i've got this 50 caliber the car blows up yeah i'm a real man i don't take a real man although i would like to do that sometime i would like to try that once brother brian you're gonna have to help me out there seems really cool but listen that's not what makes a man a man's not based on the size of his his muscles and his arms it's the bags in his knees it's how much he can submit himself to god amen listen nobody wants to die after a while this has become entertainment showmanship right amen but it's submitting yourselves a little more to god each day can you submit yourself to god more today than you did yesterday amen it might not seem like much but if it's a little bit it's better than nothing yeah man praise the lord amen listen giving him premise that's true power it's not about how much you can do it's about how much you can surrender because a man that is fully submitted to god is omnipotent all right amen well president i told you it wasn't popular with the truth listen i'll just tell you do you know what the scripture says even the 70 went out the 70 that jesus sent out they'd come back and they rejoiced all the devils are subject unto us yeah we showed the devil and she said don't rejoice about that rejoice that your names are in the book of life and listen they couldn't even be blotted out listen they were rejoicing about the wrong thing oh we can show it no rejoice your names are in the book of life that's what's something to rejoice about listen they could do that in their names we blot out that wasn't special amen even the pharisees jesus said well your father's catholic that's not special in and of itself what's special is that god has for ordained you for this robe amen that's what makes you different amen well praise the lord listen what identifies you brethren talks about identification now i was identified with isaiah i was identified with noah when he went to the ark i was identified with uh with john there on the jordan river what identifies you with christ is your character because the character in you if you had lived back there you would have done the same thing they did that's how you're identified with him if they lived in your day they would that's why luther if he lived in this day he would have heard it he would have received it you have the same nature the same character that's your identification amen that's why jesus tells the jews he said listen you you garnish the tombs of the prophets but your fathers killed him where for your witnesses your witnesses that you do the deeds of your fires praise the lord well i'm about halfway through here [Laughter] brother brown says now we have a token in this day amen we've been given a token which is the anti-type of that type listen you're not you're not pointing towards something to be fulfilled you're the fulfillment of that natural token we've been given the supernatural supreme token all that foreshadowed has been given to this generation given this token now we have the holy ghost is our token and it is our identification that we have accepted the death of the lamb amen not only was jesus just a human life to come back on us it was god himself manifest in flesh that brought back upon us the adoption of sons that now we are sons and daughters of god that is the token hallelujah praise the lord so you've got to have the authority of a son to place the token over household amen praise the lord it's the our identification of the passover it's our identification that we have believed god and god has accepted how many is accepted in the beloved yes that's why he gave you a token it's your identification that christ your passover has identified you with him amen so character is the evidence that the robe fits for us today amen this is the hour when the character of christ is manifested in the bride amen he you you think about brother brandon features the choosing the bride how does he choose his bride does it choose her based on the size of the building or or her wealth or what he looks at her character so that means that god looked at this age and he looked at you in this age as a son or daughter of god and he saw something you said that's that's what i'm looking to marry right there i mean i'm not looking to marry some sort of a some sort of a floozy that runs around or some just some church or some whatever he's looking for a mature bride that looks to him and only him that's faithful to him that's what he's looking at his character right amen praise the lord brother says we've been invited it's quite an invitation now we've been invited to be shaped into his character it's quite an invitation isn't it right listen if if you handed me an invitation paul hands me this invitation sorry henry this invitation says i have invited you to suffer for my namesake i wouldn't he'll be real honest with you this is all right i probably wouldn't be real excited praise god hold on we get to suffer for his name in the natural we would look at this invitation and say i'm going to click on there i'm not going we we don't value the importance of invitation because this is what i want you understand not everybody's been invited to this all right i don't know if i really want to go listen not everybody's invited it's just a special people the fact that you've been invited means you're special he doesn't invite he only invites family he's kind of like that i guess he just wants his children there that's who he invites amen listen it's i love how brother daryl ward put this years ago he said if i come up here on the platform i put a stack of gold up here on one side and said here's your sufferings and your trials over here which one would you pitch i'd be real honest with you i probably picked the gold well let me just say that let me rephrase this if i put a bunch of if i put a stack of gold up here on this platform and i offered it to you all we probably wouldn't have to really question the invitation so much you would come up here and grab as much school as you could carry and i wouldn't blame you i would too i mean i'm not saying there's anything wrong with the goal but what i'm saying is but this over here is worth more than the gold that's going to perish because your faith is going to be trotted by fire it's going to withstand the trial the trying of your face it's worth more than gold we've been given invitations worth more than all the gold in the world it's worth more than bitcoin or ethereum or whatever else trials sufferings the reproach yeah it's worth more than gold cause not everybody's invited to deal with it well it sure doesn't feel like it's worth more than gold does it listen if it felt like it was with more than gold everybody would want it all right yeah you know brother brand preaches about birth pains but you know what else he talks about growing pains we had growing pains he said suffering for his namesake is growing pains of his grace suffering for his words growing pains of his grace just remember it's the grace of god has been given to you man so many times we look at the growing pains and we we we get so despondent and upset about it and god's actually trying to do something for us we don't realize it all right i had a brother come to me a while back and this brother he uh he's got a real complex a guilt complex every everything he does he feels guilty he stops going to church this that he's just he's up and down all the time his conscious bo he does i tell you what i mean we'll talk about sincere this brother he's just so sincere he's way more sincere than i am i just be real honest this guy he just he's just he's the guy every little thing he does he compares himself and he's like i'm just not good enough i'm thinking you never were right neither was i i had nothing to do with it right maybe some maybe this is for somebody i guess but his conscience bothers him so much and i began to i began to talk to him one day i said i said you realize that not everybody deals with that right you sit there and you feel condemned and you feel beat up and your conscience bothers you and and you you don't feel like you're listen i said the world doesn't feel that way about god amen the world doesn't sit there and feel bad that they offended god with their blasphemy and their heresy and their heart they don't feel bad about it i said i want you to think about this the very thing in your life that you let condemn you is actually meant to bless you and you don't even realize it the fact you have a conscience the fact that you want to serve god you want to be right with god and you feel bad about it that's not meant to condemn you it's actually a blessing and you don't even realize it all right amen see we have to be careful we don't look at blessings as an evidence amen because i'm talking about growth and i'm talking about spiritual growth now i use this analogy as the home church here a while back i said to give an example about growing i said when i was actually just talking this morning about it when i talked about my height which as you can notice is is less than um average it's just no there's just no nice way to say this i'm vertically challenged [Laughter] my god i have a 13 year old son in the back and he lets me know all the time dad i'm going to be taller than you and i'm like that doesn't mean a thing everybody's taller than me that's not an achievement listen when i was 17 18 years old i got to 5 foot 9 and i stopped that was not my choice it was not my decision i would have six one or two you know be humble still but i would have chosen to go a little bit further but this is the this is the lot i was given praise the lord five foot nine with shoes on god didn't ask me if i wanted to be six foot tall right or i would have told him sure but i stopped growing at a certain spot and i made this point i said you know a remarkable thing happened i got to be about 24 25 years old i said something amazing happened i started growing again the problem was i wasn't growing this way it's grown this way it's been a fight ever since there's there's my son again you know he sits there and he you get a pumpkin pie or something kiss the season sister eats this whole pumpkin pie thin is a rail and then there's me i look at a donut i gained five pounds you say what's this guy do with anything listen i didn't ask for this i never asked for this in my life this is what i got okay somewhere that's a blessing i haven't figured out quite where yet but somehow that's meant for my good i started growing again but i grew the wrong way amen sometimes churches grow sometimes people grow but they grow the wrong direction instead of growing in the stature of christ we begin to grow in affluence we're going to grow in popularity we begin to grow in in our ability or all our church and our achievement you're growing the wrong way you're not getting taller you're just getting fatter take it from me i know hey man we've got to be careful when we look at our spiritual growth we're not just looking at the blessing the blessing is not an evidence of maturity some definite evidence you got good tastes and donuts that's all that is well praise the lord amen the character that he's looking to clothe our spiritual stature is not based on the amount of blessings we have it's based on the character that we have amen in christ amen our maturity amen the character is the thing he's going to clothe amen are we still seeing souls say do we do we pray for one another these are you know this is basic stuff well do we do it because most churches don't pray for your pastor pray for one another pray pray for soul are we giving christ the preeminence see what kind of a character are we presenting to him to clothe amen i'm not looking to wear an inflated sense of self-importance i'm not looking to be an elite group or i'm right and the rest of the world's wrong but this scripture says to be closed with humility amen god resists the prophecy of grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time the scripture says in colossians 3 put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness long-suffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any even as christ forgave you so also do ye and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness amen listen we can have faith through mountains we can know mysteries but if we lack charity it profits us nothing god is looking at our character he's looking at us as sons and daughters of god he's not inquiring how well we understand the message intellectually he's not looking at how gifted we are god's not gonna ask us how loud we shouted or if we jumped high see we compare ourselves with ourselves that's not what god's looking at god's not asking brother alex did you preach the house down that day or this that no he's looking to see what kind of character we have that's what he's looking at amen brother bram says this is as you fall in love with god fall in love with god with all your heart and when you do that you'll fall in love with every member of your church and every member of everybody else's church with all your heart amen see god's not god's love is not like our human love amen i was thinking of the scripture this morning i believe it's in the 114th psalm the bible says let the righteous smite me it shall be a kindness amen we look at the hardships the difficulty of our christian life and it it like i said we we let it we let it bother us so much amen the love of god what you think about this just first thing the love of god can seem so cruel to a man amen you're like brother i know what you're talking about listen we it was it was not even 100 years ago 80 years ago there was a group of jews that lived in germany lived in eastern and western europe and these people were brutalized and they were murdered families were separated putting gas chambers experimented on treat all kinds of horrible treatment torture ungodly untoward things just the most wicked vile things happen to these people so brutal and human it was the tender hand of jehovah well there's a quote we don't use every day that was the tender hand of jehovah bringing the people to the promise it looks so cruel looks so brutal and vicious sometimes god will put you in a place in your life and it looks so it looks so despondent you might feel like you're further away from god than you've ever felt in your life well praise the lord for the rest of that saint in the third exit is that same tender hand it's leading us to the tree of life the bible says the song of solomon set me as a seal upon that heart a seal upon that arm for love is strong as death there's a jealousy that's as cruel or severe in the hebrew it's as severe as the grave listen god is a jealous god he's jealous over you yes amen he's so jealous over you amen that's why he won't allow you to go to your own devices i remember when i first got saved i was reading smith wigglesworth's memoirs and you know all it's interesting me there's another man a great anointing ministry people always wanted his a man told his anointing that would have a ministry like his but you know what his own words were about it he said everybody looks at this ministry they see the gift of god they see the blessings what they don't see is that god has broken me over and over and over again to get me this place a thousand times he's broken me to get me here you think about brother brandon this man what he went through to have this mess it's all we wish we had his anointing no you really don't you're not willing to drink from this cup all right not talking about you i'm talking about people hey man it looked cruel what he went through that was his own testament god has broken me amen bill's worth over and over and over again sometimes it feels like we spend our whole time in the potter's wheel we're wondering are we ever going to get off the wheel it's just spinning around everywhere man i'm getting dizzy i need to take some pills or something over and over and over he's just mashing it down oh we get oh man it's looking pretty good smash it seems cruel almost doesn't it what's the pure honestly the crew to jeremiah when he was in that pit right it looked cruel to isaiah i look cruel these men look cruel to moses god why why have you even treated his people we mistake the kindness of god for cruelty many times amen it seems so cruel to us because god's jealous over you is why amen his love is not how much you're blessed it's not the the bright skies or the stormy clouds that's not his love what is his love the proof of his love is what in your election i mean i know he loves me he elected you praise the lord amen i want to remind you this today god did not elect you because you believe in him the devil's believing tremble god did not elect you because you believe in him god elected you because he believes in you god puts something in you that even when you don't believe it anymore god believes in you god looks at your life from before the foundation of the world god looks at you where you're at today and he sees the real you he's not discouraged he's not upset he's not ringing his hands he looks at you and he sees a masterpiece where others see trouble where you see chaos where you see discouragement he says there's somebody i can trust with my power amen you gotta be kidding me the proof of his love is an election amen think about this all these prophets they coveted with elijah had they coveted what he had but god didn't give it to any of them he gave it to one amen you're one in a million today amen you're a chosen vessel you might not have an easy life god did not ordain you to an easy life he ordained you to eternal life in order to chase one thing he ordained you to plant you and settle and establish and make you steadfast in the position that he has called you too hey man like i said didn't call you didn't easily listen you you might be going through the worst trial of your life i don't know who where everybody's at amen but you you might just i don't know what your week was like i know where i spent the last part of my week was under my house the geniuses who built my house decided to put a crawl space in there that's about two inches wider than i am there's that weight thing again man it's always coming back to bible at least i'm short enough man i don't know how see you know what there's a praise god here's the blessing i was short enough to fit in there now i finally come back i'm here in church getting the revelation hey man as i sat under my house and i watched the water gush out like the rock in the wilderness i sat there and i thought what a blessing listen i i make like you know what we get so worked that's not a big deal you can fix plumbing oh i sort of can plumbing can be fixed but some of us are going through real trials you you might have lost loved ones you might listen you might have gone through the worst trial your life you might have went to work this week and beat your head against the wall and you might have wondered why you're even still on this earth but i want to remind you listen the proof of his love is in your election you're here today and you've heard the word and you've accepted it you believe with all your heart that's god's love to you don't ever forsake that that's worth more than gold it's worth more than fame it's worth it more than anything you can come up with or esteem amen that's what i'm getting at earlier amen we god give us a position god give you a position to give me a position not to compete with each other's position that's what brother bam talks about in the adoption series ephraim wants manassas land and they want this and that see where we get in troubles we compare ourselves with ourselves that's right amen well it's just me i guess you know you see elon musk here with all this money well i could have done that yeah sure whatever well i wish i could do this i wish you could achieve listen god give you a position because he wants you to fulfill that position he don't need you to fulfill mine and he sure don't want me to do yours and i don't want your job by the way you can keep it i got enough on my hands amen listen the scripture says they that compare themselves with themselves they're not wise amen god gave you your position god give you your land for one purpose for you to cultivate your position you call you cultivate the police the piece of ground that god gave you you sanctify you present your vessels as a vessel of honor to him amen amen i speak about this frequently but i want to remind you again matthew 25 jesus talks about the talents he gave one man too and gave one man five you get the same commendation amen he's not looking at how much you make he's looking at did you multiply what i gave you if it's two talents if it's five you get the same commendation see we compare ourselves with each other well i wish i was so probably nobody wishes they were me but i wish i was so and so i wish i was that but it's not wise amen i like how i heard somebody put this the problem when we do that is we always we always compare our worst outtakes to somebody else's highlight reel we see the highlights of their life we see the outtakes in the bloopers like oh man i i can't measure up you're looking at two completely different things you're comparing yourself with somebody else god listen if you want to compare yourself to somebody compare yourself to who you used to be [Applause] that'll take we're talking about success that'll tell you whether you're successful amen amen i'm not what i want to be i'm not what i ought to be but thank god i'm not what i used to be can i get a witness in here today i think we ought to thank god for just a moment i'm not what i used to be i know what i used to look like i know what i used to wrestle with am i where i want to be not a hundred percent but thank god i know he's brought me this far thank god i know god still deal with me he's not forsaking me if god's still dealing with you you ought to praise god he don't deal with just anybody amen i can look back to see what i used to be i can see where i want to be praise god i'm not what i used to be like do you want to compare yourself i'm not what i used to be well hopefully you're not i guess that's a good question today i want you to take a moment examine yourselves compare yourself to what you used to be are you are you greater are you spiritually are you stronger somewhere are you gaining ground amen because god ordained us to live in a land of milk and honey amen god believes in you yes that's the truth i know that sounds whatever but it's true amen he he doesn't well i guess he believes everybody's gonna do what they're supposed to do but god put confidence in the seed in you he planted that seed with confidence that would bring forth zoe life amen you know if we've been blessed in our life we had somebody somewhere that looked in our lives they saw something in us nobody else saw maybe it was a mom or a dad or teacher or whatever pastor amen the world looks at us and they go by and they don't see anything but the bride sees something there's something special about the bride elect she's got a different character than the rest of people the peaceful people in the world amen god looked at your life at your worst god looked at your life at your worst and he saw the very best in you when you couldn't see it when nobody else could see the best god saw the very best in your life he said you know what this ground it looks barren it looks fruitless but there's potential laying there if he begins to work that clay a little bit and he begins to water that soil there's a seed laying there says you know what it can bring forth things that nobody else is even aware of is there see we sell ourselves sure listen god paid a great price for you hey man it's proof for you is in the elect because he doesn't just give his robe to anybody it's a special class of people a special people they're under a super sign they're super church amen well don't look like a super church this is the superst church that was ever super amen praise the lord you believe that listen i'm not saying this to be all fuzzy wuzzy and stuff but i really believe that amen all right we get discouraged because we we forget that god has actually put something in your life that makes you different yes amen you couldn't be who you are and you couldn't do what you did today if god wasn't in your midst doing it amen as you stand to your feet god bless you today okay i'm just gonna parachute out i should put my parachute on first you got a song for us today who's saying oh where's the lord brian hey buddy how you doing about that 50 cow we'll we'll talk later you love the lord wherever you're at today whatever you're going through god sees something in your life that's special i hope you see it in yourself i hope you hope you can look at your neighbor look at your neighbor today hope you can see something by faith i hope you can see something special in that one we're not here just to blow this land up and just that we're gonna to cultivate something that's what man was put on here in the first place to take that ground and detent to it amen that's a whole nother sermon i think we're done with me for today but we're here to we're we're here to leave something behind greater than what we come into the only thing we're taking out of this life is our character do you believe that let's bow our heads heavenly father i just pray that you take this broke up thought today this this simple message i pray to help people to have a greater understanding of their position and your desire for them to fulfill that position in their life lord no one can take my place and i can't take anyone else's place lord i i pray you just help each one of us to be faithful to the position that you've called us to may we labor and support one another in our efforts to further this kingdom of god in our lives in our homes
