We just want to just invite you here into the scripture here this evening. Amen. Let's turn to Galatians chapter 5. So, thank you for Amen. song service here tonight, the worship. Amen. And what a wonderful atmosphere. And Amen. I just so appreciate seeing each one of you. And Amen. God bless you for your sacrifice. And because it certainly is a [clears throat] it's not very much compared to what he did, but yet there's many times that in our lives it it is a sacrifice. But I know that it can go without a show of hands. There's never been one sacrifice that we've ever made for the things of God. But what the dividends have been so much greater. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is so true. &gt;&gt; And uh so many times how we the sacrifice is actually just really a lot of times going beyond our feelings and circumstances. But you know what? There's no better place than we could be &gt;&gt; than to be in the house of God &gt;&gt; and be with brothers and sisters of like precious faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just go to the Lord here in prayer tonight. And uh we're not in prayer but right into the scriptures in Galatians 5. And I want to just read these few verses. For brethren, ye have been called unto liberty. only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that you be not consumed one of another. And this I say then, walk in the spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, and these are contrary the one to the other, so that you cannot do the things that you would. But if you be led of the spirit, &gt;&gt; you're not under the law. Amen. May God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated. I'd like to just um continue to speak on this thought on liberty to serve. And we want to just look back here and with this of liberty and that is before us. And I want to just go through a few scriptures here tonight and and looking at that of just liberty and then getting into our scripture here. Paul says, "Now the Lord is that spirit. And where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." Now, I certainly believe that there is a place we want the house of God to be a place of liberty, a place that where that lives can experience the very liberating power of the Lord Jesus Christ. But we recognize that within that the whole objective is for what I just mentioned that hearts would be able to really experience in their own personal life a real liberty. Not just something that lifts off of us when we come together because many times as we can get in the presence of God and the presence of one another. And we all understand this as as children of God that things can lift from off of our life. clouds can be broken back. And yet we also realize as the prophet would tell us that many times that there's things that even lives can enjoy the liberty or the joy that would be present. Brother Bram tells us even where we could enjoy even the word as it's being given. But if if it doesn't go down to the inner man, then that's really not the liberty that God wants for us. So the real the gospel is to bring about a real liberty that sons and daughters of God might be made manifest. So as he said, where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. And I certainly believe that that's for that's for in our soul. But we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord. And that that word liberty that is used there true liberty is living as we ought to and not as we please. &gt;&gt; That's real liberty. That's that's the real defining of the word that Paul would use there. And Jesus would say it like this to the Jews which believed on him. If you continue in my word, then you are my disciples indeed. So they had believed on him. But to continue on and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free. So to know is is relationship with him. They answered and said, "We be Abraham's seed, and we were never in bondage to any man. And how sayest thou, ye shall be made free?" Jesus answered them and said unto them, "Whosoever committh sin, or is a practitioner from that of the desire, is the servant of sin, and the servant abideth not in the house forever, but the son abideth forever. If the son therefore shall make you free, you shall be free indeed. Now to think how Jesus would write this and we we quote this um you know very uh much and and I I think we understand what we're saying when they say well the truth shall set you free. And you look at this word make, it's a creation. Because in in what God comes to do is not just simply clean up the man and then just, you know, just simply just step inside, but God wants to completely bring a transformation in that to where the old man dies. The old ways die, the old nature dies. There's a complete surrender to where now the very seed of God, Christ's own life, come and unites with that seed of God that's on the inside. And then that's where it brings forth a new creation. And so when we look at this this freedom that God would bring, only God can bring this. And God is the one who leads us and draws us into this place of a real freedom. Paul would write of this in Galatians 5:1. Standf fast, therefore, in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free. So Paul's letting them know this this is a a battle that you are engaged in there. Even as he was writing to the Galatian church, there was them of of false brethren, Judaizers that were coming in that were, you know, not dis they were disanoling the very full work of Christ. This is why the prophet would say he's in the church age book. I love how he says it. He says that salvation is not Jesus plus works. It is Jesus and Jesus alone. &gt;&gt; He said because if you truly experience salvation then works will follow. &gt;&gt; So then you can't help because it's what begins to come out of your life. No more than a than a you have to tell a sheep to produce wool. You don't have to do that. It comes out of their life. And so God, that's exactly what the Holy Spirit comes to do is to release a son and daughter of God that is there on the inside. Now when you think of this with this liberty as we were reading here in the scripture we we understand that a liberty that God would bring to our life and when Paul would write of this in the book of Galatians that we've been called unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another. Let me just say it like this. There is no desire within a bornagain believer's life for the world. &gt;&gt; Now I didn't say the flesh but yet at the same time it is whatever is there on the throne of our heart. When when that has passed away from our life there is no longer a desire for the things of the world. As a matter of fact it would actually haunt you. There's no doubt throughout this room that many of you probably from what God has brought you out of or even of things that you never had even experienced in your own life and you have a dream or a nightmare that you are uh in a situation or doing something that maybe God brought you out of or something you never was in and then you wake up and you're trying to actually think and come to yourself because it seems so real and it grips you and say, "Oh God, I I trust Lord that that's not been something Lord and and you're trying to come to yourself. Why? Because within your heart the desire alone is to please God. &gt;&gt; He's he's become the very love of your life. There is no longer a hold for the things of the world. Brother Brandham would say it like this. Let me just preface this quote that I'll display. He speaks of how that there is no other mediator between God and man. and we're freely pardoned and forgiven. God don't even know we ever sinned. Our sins were put in the sea of forgetfulness, never to be remembered no more. We can't do that in ourselves. We are finite. He's infinite and and our finite. We can still remember because we're not big enough. But he is so great that he even forgets that we ever did sin. We are sons and daughters in his presence. And all things that he was, we are. He become my sin that I might become his righteousness. He become your sin. He might be that you might become his righteousness. See, God can't see no sin in you as long as your confession is in Jesus Christ. And brother Ram goes on to say, "Someone some time ago said, if I believed a thing like that, would I ever turn the steam on? I'd paint the town red. I'd go to every dance hall. I'd get so drunk and everything else because and brother Bram says why you're already secured in Christ. What difference does it make? See, the desire would no longer be there. &gt;&gt; It it it wouldn't matter because in reality, I can do what I want to do. &gt;&gt; And all things Paul said, are lawful unto me, &gt;&gt; right? I'm not I'm not held by, oh, I I I I I can't do this. But it is a love affair. I don't want to do those things. &gt;&gt; I don't want to do those things. The things that that I that I used to do, I HAVE NO DESIRE TO DO THOSE THINGS. AND IT ISN'T JUST NOT DOING THOSE THINGS OF THAT of the attributes of unbelief. But the the very thing that THE WORD OF GOD HAS BECOME MY DELIGHT. NOW, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT WHEN I SAY DELIGHT, THAT IS JUST THE PRINT to study the print. THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. I'm talking about also hearing the word of God and the desire to submit to the very person of Jesus Christ, his character. So this is where there comes a real liberty within our lives. So when we see this, brother Ramy goes on to say that shows you haven't got it. If the love of God ever struck your heart in the tenderness of Jesus Christ, you would be so in love with him, the world would be dead as your sin. That's how you know you have the Holy Spirit. Not because you could scream, shout, speak in tongues, whatever it is, but when sin becomes dead and you're alive in Jesus Christ. Oh, love of God, how rich, how pure. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham many different times would talk about the dove and the crow and how that both of them Noah released both of them out the window of the ark. The crow was able to go and light down and feed and feed and feed. But the dove could not feed on dedicarion. &gt;&gt; You know why? It wasn't just well because it's not the pallet. She does not have anything within her to be able to digest that. &gt;&gt; Brother B said when that dove would light down and he dramatizes it. If she would light down upon something and maybe to light down oo she just it backs right away from it. It it's something about it she's not meant to digest that because even a dove as you with having the spirit of God in your life. There's things where you no doubt have lit down upon things. But when the spirit of God is in your life, you cannot remain there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHY? THE SPIRIT OF GOD, the life of God is a keeper. It's an anchor. It's a hold. It's a seal. You can't lay light light down upon it because it is something within you that is not built to digest that. This is why brother Ram says, "I don't care how long you've been in church. If you get turned loose in the world and you can still go out and do the things you once did and enjoy it, it shows you've never come to God. It doesn't matter if a person's been in church 30 years, 40 years, 50 years, and I'm talking about right around the message. If they're able to go out and do the things that they once did, and there's no problem with it whatsoever, they're able to go right out. Something's wrong. They never came to God. Might have come to justification. Might have even come to sanctification. But I want you to remember sanctification is a very dangerous place to stay because the Bible tells us when the unclean spirit is gone out. It it is not cast out. The prophet said it's not cast out. It goes out on its own accord &gt;&gt; and it goes out and it walks. And then if that vessel is never filled, it returns back to that house with seven other devils. And the scripture says the last estate of that man is worse than the first. The prophet tells us what makes it the worst is it becomes a religious spirit. &gt;&gt; NOT GOING BACK OUT in the world and necessarily doing this and doing that, but it becomes even religious. And yet it all of those things that once dwelt there made it do this and made it do that can return right back. This is why that just staying within sanctification is dangerous. You must go on to the new birth. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? The prophet said in future home if we stay, he said there will be those that have come just in justification and sanctification and will wind up in hell because they rejected the Holy Ghost. You know what the Holy Spirit is? It's liberty. DO WE NOT experience liberty with justification? We do. We experience a measure of it. We experience a measure of liberty with sanctification where the want to is taken out of our life. But the real depth of liberty is where that of the Holy Spirit COMES INTO OUR LIFE AND fully in the measure to release a son and daughter of God TO WHERE THE VERY DESIRE OF THE WORLD HAS PASSED AWAY AND it is Christ and the life has been changed because the nature on the inside has been changed. &gt;&gt; And that's what we live by is that's what we go by. We don't live by, oh, I felt this, or I remember when this experience happened to me. We don't, YOU CAN'T LIVE BY THAT. That's not the word. You, your experience must come back to the word. That's real liberty. Heavens and earth will pass away, but my word shall never fail. Now notice when we look at this here in the scripture because even you know sister Bruce when brother Brandham interviewed her and he picks this up in the masterpiece that he walks out and preaches right after the interview. Brother Brandham I have so many things that I know that's wrong and yet a real godly woman. &gt;&gt; Now we understand sister Bruce went running out on the streets. &gt;&gt; We understand what kind of a life that she was living. Brother Ram said a real godly woman. But yet there is THINGS ABOUT HER LIFE NOW watch this that she's looking at. I know there's a little bit of a a um a a dispensation and a time in there because even in the tabernacle there were those thinking in ' 65 a year later. Oh brother, why don't brother Brandham preach on the Holy Ghost? And brother Brandham said I am preaching on the Holy Ghost. Satan's Eden 1965. He said here's what it is. It's the person of Christ in you that's quickened to every word for this age. AND HE SAID, "DON'T WATCH IT IN DEMONSTRATION. &gt;&gt; Watch it in action." &gt;&gt; Because it can demonstrate in the house of God, but it's how it's lived out here. &gt;&gt; That's what matters. Because there's all sorts of things that that can demonstrations and where the spirit of God can get on it. BUT WHEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD has really CHANGED THAT LIFE, IT changes that nature to such a place to where that life actually becomes a submissive servant to the word of God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Ram, it says, Brother Brandham, I have so many things that I know that's wrong and a real godly woman. But I said, look, sister, you don't look at yourself. You just what your desire is and what you try to do. If you really love the Lord, you try to serve him with all your heart and then all your mistakes is hid in the blood of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; He made a way. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You try TO SERVE HIM WITH ALL YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; OH MY. WITH everything within you, you're desiring. Yet there's things that we can see even within our life as we're submitting to the Lord. Not making excuses for it. If we And that's a different thing. If we're making excuses, we're in trouble right there. But to understand how we can submit these things to the Lord and really place it there before God and say, "God, help me." It's incredible as you walk ON WITH GOD. THERE'S things that you will actually as a believer when even you've been born of the spirit of God, you begin to see things in your life. You'll see things that God has now brought you to a point of reckoning in your life that is actually character molding time. It's things where God is molding us and shaping us. As a matter of fact, uh you know, I'll just say it from my own heart. I have not I have not found out of my own life that since God has changed my life and working with my life that I feel like in some way that I am a bigger person or whatever now as a matter of fact I feel more incapable in my own self THAN I EVER DID. I'LL TELL YOU I REMEMBER WHEN GOD FIRST you know everything dropped to be a pastor I that scared me to death. Let me just tell you something. Even here right now, after 23 YEARS LATER, I STILL I FEEL MORE INCAPABLE of doing WHAT HE'S ASKED ME TO DO than I ever have. &gt;&gt; I'm not just saying that. I I'm saying beyond re in reality, THERE'S THINGS THAT GOD will even begin to look and bring us TO IN OUR LIFE. AND YOU KNOW, GOD COULD HAVE SO FLOODED ALL THIS RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING, BUT GOD IS BRINGING US TO A PLACE THE CLOSER THAT WE GET. REMEMBER, these are not just quotes. These are not just statements. THESE ARE NOT JUST SHOUTING STATEMENTS, but they're more as the bride nears him, she becomes more like him. &gt;&gt; SO THOSE DEAL WITH WITH CHARACTER, DEALS WITH HIS LIFE BEING ON display the closer we get to HIM. YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T BE GETTING CLOSER TO him and becoming more obstinate, more stubborn, uh, you know, and we that just can't be that because it shows we're not actually getting closer, we're actually getting further from where we need to be. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; So now when you see this grace itself, remember as we were looking at this last week that how that even within this that grace itself is what God has done for you and works is what you and I do in appreciation. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Ram says, "If I never preached another service, I'm saved." &gt;&gt; If brother Ryan NEVER LED SONGS AGAIN, HE'S SAVED. THAT is even an extra even beyond and I don't want to just limit it to preaching or singing but I'm talking about beyond our life. THAT'S WHY BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS I WANT TO DO SOMETHING BEYOND MY DUTY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He said my duty is to preach funerals. My duty IS TO BUT I WANT TO DO SOMETHING BEYOND &gt;&gt; my duty. Right? &gt;&gt; That's something that burns within our hearts for for the the kingdom of Christ, for the kingdom of God. And so it's an appreciation of the grace that's been showed to us. Brother Ram would say it like this and you know in that same quote out of the Hebrew series regarding Sister Mey as his wife. He said, "Acepting her as my wife, that's what love done for her. But what she does is in appreciation of that she's a nice woman, stays home, takes care of the children, and lives a good true life. That's not because we're not married. We are married. But she does that in appreciations. If she running downtown every day, took in every tent store, up and down the streets, never washed the dishes or anything. We are still married. When I took my vow, that settles it. She's my wife. As long as there's life in us, she's my wife. That's her vow. But what appreciation she does for that. She stays home, takes care of the children, and tries to be a real wife. He said, "Now I could run out and be gone all the time gading about over the country. Let her have starve or anything else and let the children go without something to eat. We're still married. If she even divorces me, still married. Long as there's life in my body, I took that vow till death we separate, we're still married. But yet, I would make a poor excuse of a husband and she'd make a poor excuse as a wife. So if we love one another, we stick together and pull the load &gt;&gt; together. &gt;&gt; Then we don't do it because well, we're not married. And it's NOT JUST, WELL, WE'RE MARRIED, BUT IT IS OUT OF THAT OF being married and that love that brings forth the works or an appreciation for what has been done. And so we understand that even within all that my how Satan would love and would love to attack that and and love to try to draw about feelings and even as seasons of life will change even how we minister to one another as husband and wife. There's things that will will change and we realize how we must be sensitive. It's just like in the needs in this hour that we're in. It's ways that God, remember the prophet would be so clear to state it like this, THAT GOD NEVER CHANGES HIS NATURE, BUT HE SAID GOD BECOMES TO THAT generation in order to make himself known to those people. &gt;&gt; SO GOD KNOWS where you and I are at. He knows even how to reach even as we look at with the young people and things. So we're not trying to apply models from you know 10 even 15 20 years ago but we're looking to the wisdom of God. How do we catch even right now with THE DIVINE NATURE OF GOD? HOW DO WE how do we become to this generation? So God had a reason for saving me a purpose and I am to fulfill that purpose. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now notice, watch how brother Brandham or not brother Brandham, but watch how the amplified will will will go into this here on this scripture we read for our text. He said, "For you, brethren, were indeed called to freedom. Only do not let your freedom be an incentive to your flesh, an opportunity or excuse for selfishness." Got quiet. But through love you should serve one another. &gt;&gt; So you mean that a person can be called to liberty and be totally free and liberated in their soul as a son and daughter of God. But liberty could be used the wrong way. &gt;&gt; Could there be a misuse? could to be a misperception of applying this. I'm free. I'm free. I don't I don't have to obey nobody. I'm free. Now, listen. Let me just say it like this. If a person truly is at liberty in their soul, they will heed the leadership &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit. THEY BECAUSE THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST on the inside will recognize his word at all times. &gt;&gt; That that is a real real sign of where the spirit of God would move down within a life. And yet there's things within our lives that let me just give you this example. The prophet walks in to his house. You're familiar with this. And here, you know, people have been back and forth through the house all day. Brother Bram dramatized it in different times of how there was people walking through. I got a word from the Lord. Yay. I say I got a word from the Lord for you and if you don't listen to me, God's going to take the airplane out of the air and all all kinds of nonsense. &gt;&gt; And like brother Ram said, he said, "Look, God speaks to me. If he's got a word, &gt;&gt; I'm on speaking terms with him. &gt;&gt; He'll let me know." &gt;&gt; But you THINK ALL OF THIS WAS GOING THROUGH THE HOUSE DEALING WITH, YOU SEE WHAT IS IT? SPIRITS, dealing with nervous spirits, all those things was in the den room. ALL THE AND THE HOUSE WAS JUST SUCH AN UPHEAVAL. And here, you know, Sister Meaty trying, you know, had even got dinner on yet. And my, you know, you can know what that is as a husband. Your your wife will say, "I don't even know what I'm going to do for dinner tonight." I mean, peanut butter and jelly could seem like a stretch. you know baloney could seem BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S JUST EVEN THE CARES OF LIFE AND EVEN has times change I mean with with the the children change pressures change hormones change A LOT OF THINGS CHANGE TO WHERE ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT be might BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS MUCH PRESSURE AND YET NOW in this season of life we can handle about this much pressure &gt;&gt; and yet God understands and God ministers to us and God helps us even as husbands to be able to minister to our wives in those times of need. &gt;&gt; Even even as brothers, you go through seasons and changes of life as well. But brother Brandham, I love how he says it like this. He says, when all this was going on, all the turmoil, he said, I was tired. &gt;&gt; He says this, I was tired. He said, 'But I asked, Lord, what would you have me be in this moment? &gt;&gt; So, he just didn't walk in there and say, "Hey, come on. This is enough. You I mean, YOU ALL KNOW YOU know this is a bunch of nonsense. You know this is nothing but devils that was going through here and demons and things like that." No, no, no, no. The way remember the atmosphere, it isn't that the devils and the demons and all the But you got to change. Remember the prophet said, "Change the atmosphere. AND SO AS A SON OF GOD, BROTHER RAM SAID, YOU KNOW, HE SAID, I took that. He said, these were my children. This was my wife. This is a man who has a relationship WITH GOD WHO'S STANDING RIGHT there in his home and taking dominion over the atmosphere. And he puts on an apron. And what God has led him to do in that situation, he's praying for her while he's washing dishes. He's talking to her ABOUT A DRESS DOWN THERE. NONE OF THESE things in themselves seem spiritual, but he HAS ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME A CONDUIT FOR THE PEACE OF GOD TO MOVE DOWN IN his home. DID HE HAVE TO DO THAT? NO. &gt;&gt; He could have had an occasion to the flesh and said, "I'm out of here. &gt;&gt; I've been the one in there all day long." All right. &gt;&gt; You see, IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, WE HAVE ALL OF THIS LIST OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING all day long. And I I certainly believe there needs to be we have to understand one another. And understanding one another doesn't mean your way or the other person's way. &gt;&gt; Understanding means where we sit down, as the prophet said IN ' 64, TALK TO ONE ANOTHER. TRY TO UNDERSTAND one another. You can't you can't understand when this is going. &gt;&gt; Oh, there you go. IF THIS IS FLAPPING, THERE'S NO UNDERSTANDING GOING. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; But in order to understand, we've got to have this and this has got to be &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IN REALITY, I know this is very simple, but just so that we have to have this on record cuz the world doesn't understand this. In the beginning, God made them male and female. He made them different in the WAY THAT THEY LOOK AT THINGS AND THEY THINK ABOUT THINGS. My Lord, I remember when my wife and I FIRST GOT MARRIED, I mean, I wish that revelation would have been right there all along to understand that. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? GOD had to take A DUMMY LIKE ME AND BRING ME THROUGH SOME of those channels to say, "YOU KNOW WHAT? SHUT up a minute and just listen to her." I know some of you wives are like, "That's going to be the NEXT YOUTUBE SHORT RIGHT THERE." SURE IS THE WORLD. [cheering] [applause] But I'm not finished. I'M NOT FINISHED. THERE'S ANOTHER SHORT [laughter] AND IT MIGHT be longer. BUT IT WAS ALSO FOR HER then to be able to hear my heart and then to be able to talk through these things, try to come to a place of understanding. And so it takes like a giving and a giving and a working together because you can never work together when it's all one-sided. &gt;&gt; See, unity, as we've been dealing with this for weeks, unity is not that everybody sees it according to how you see it. &gt;&gt; But unity is is where WE BEGIN TO TRY TO ENTER IN ON HOW MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE IS SEEING IT. AND I'LL BE HONEST with you, when brother says that quote, I usually I usually kind of chuckle at that when I've done the marriage banquetss and things like that. in here. I think it might have been just last year, the year before. I did three marriage banquetss within one year. And I look at that and this year must be the youth thing. I don't know. But you know, when you look at it, I I I think of it each time when brother Ram SAYS, "TALK TO HER, UNDERSTAND HER." AND I AND I TOLD I've said it like this. I SAID, "UNDERSTANDING DOES NOT MEAN THAT it makes sense to me." &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; Cuz if you're expecting that, &gt;&gt; you got the wrong objective. &gt;&gt; But understanding is listening. There you go. &gt;&gt; It's being able to listen and to hear and to be able to work through that. Now, Brother Brand didn't have to do that. You know, IN REALITY, YOU AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT. NOW, LISTEN, FRIENDS. LISTEN. I understand that there's things that within our life that sometimes our background, our molding, our shaping. THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE WERE NOT EVEN INSTRUCTED IN. There are certain things that even as I'm sitting down with those that maybe are coming to that place of engagement and they do that and I've done this over the years. I'll sit down and I have I have a criteria of things THAT I WILL SIT DOWN and go through with them. There's like 10 particular bullet POINTS THAT I'LL WORK through with them on how to minister to one another within marriage and the real secret within that and how to come along with that. You say what what's that from? That's from experience. And to BE ABLE TO COME THROUGH THAT and to work through those things in order to take away the mystery, the confusion and to be able to look at those things that IT IS MARRIAGE ITSELF IS A MINISTRY ONE TO ANOTHER. DO YOU REALIZE CHRIST, our bridegroom, our husband, he notices and takes knowledge that we are the weaker vessel &gt;&gt; and he ministers to our needs according to the WEAKER VESSEL. HE SUBJECTS HIMSELF OVER and over and over again TO MINISTER TO YOU AND I. HE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE PRAYERS that are offered up and the things that we're praying about and he is bringing our attention to in our life and he ministers to these things and these needs IN OUR LIFE. DOES HE HAVE TO DO THAT? LISTEN, JESUS HIMSELF COULD SAY, "I AM NOT FOOLING WITH NONE OF THAT TRIVIAL STUFF. I'M JUST GOING TO SPEAK ON AND PREACH THE DEEP MYSTERIES. &gt;&gt; He could do that. &gt;&gt; But the mysteries were meant to be lived &gt;&gt; in simplicity. &gt;&gt; Because let me tell you, just to speak and to preach mysteries, the devil can run wild. But when it gets down to application in our lives, &gt;&gt; when it gets down to where it begins to expose and to draw out to where the rubber meets the road and the character, YOU SEE, THAT'S WHERE THE CHALLENGE, AS I SAID BEFORE, THE REAL HARDSHIP AMONG WHEN OUR LIVES AS BELIEVERS IS NOT WITH THE DOCTRINE, BUT THE REAL the real where it comes TO DEATH IS DYING TO OURSELVES AND the very character of Jesus Christ being molded and shaped in our lives. &gt;&gt; That's where the real challenge is. &gt;&gt; Now, think of this an opportunity or excuse for selfishness. The prophet could have done that as we said. So, there actually could be a misuse or a misrepresentation of liberty. Let's look at another portion in the word. Paul, Paul, Paul or Peter would write, "Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, whether it be to the king as supreme, or unto governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do well." Peter knew that whoever's in power, they didn't get there on their own. Right. &gt;&gt; God allows GOD ALLOWS THIS ONE TO COME INTO POWER AND TAKES this one down. Don't matter if it's voting, rig voting, whatever it is. &gt;&gt; It don't matter. God is going to be and whom God as Daniel wrote is who it is to be. &gt;&gt; SO NOW WITHIN this Peter is the same one who also wrote when they said who should we obey man or God? Same man who spoke that in the book of Acts. BUT NOW NOTICE AS THIS application as it would come down because it's a different scenario. This is why WE HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO APPLY the word and to apply the correct word to the right situation. &gt;&gt; For so is the will of God that with welloing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men. as free and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, &gt;&gt; but as the servants of God, honor all men, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king. Isn't that incredible? As free, we are free. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN GOD WHEN THAT HE WHO THE son hath made free is free indeed. Right. &gt;&gt; SO NOW PAUL PETER WOULD WRITE THIS that as free and not using your liberty as a cloak of maliciousness but as THE SERVANTS OF GOD. SO AS PETER IS WRITING THIS that there can be a seeded malice &gt;&gt; that can actually then conveniently use the word of God to say I don't have to obey that. Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; See, it's dealing with motive and objective. And see the spirit of God dealing with this right here because Paul Peter is writing Paul to do there were those who were servants still. They had masters and and these things were TAKING PLACE. SO NOW THEY, you know, Peter is reminding them, you do not, you do not use your liberty as a cloak of malicees. Like I've always had something against that brother. Really? Since when? Well, since seventh period high school. &gt;&gt; You'd be surprised. &gt;&gt; You'd be surprised sometimes the things that that that that get carried for years &gt;&gt; instead of relinguish them. WHAT GOOD HAS IT DONE TO CARRY ANYTHING? WELL, THEY THEY SAID THIS YEARS AGO. THEY SAID THIS AND THE PERSON HAS NO IDEA. AND EVEN IF THEY DO, [screaming] &gt;&gt; it's not hindering them. It's hindering you &gt;&gt; and it's actually causing you to act out &gt;&gt; and it's a power that's there. You see, this is why the spirit of God brings us to certain things to deal with things in our life. Well, I'm free. I, you know, I'm free. I don't have to listen to any man. No man's going to tell me what to do. WELL, IT SHOULDN'T BE MAN. It should be the word that we're hearing. And the word is more than the letter. The word is THE VERY PERSON AND character of Jesus Christ. CUZ THERE CAN EVEN BE SITUATIONS that we can look at that it may not BE A SCRIPTURE JUMPING OUT OR OR A QUOTE RIGHT AWAY, BUT there is a way that WE ARE TO APPROACH every situation, and that is with the character of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear. Not only to the good and gentle, that's the easy ones, but to the froward as well. Right. &gt;&gt; So you mean to the bosses that are forward, be good and gentle, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. For this is thankworthy if a man for conscience toward God endure grief suffering wrongfully. Now that doesn't mean walking by that boss or brother. That's using liberty for an occasion to the flesh. &gt;&gt; I know it's very simple, &gt;&gt; but yet at the very at the very principles of things of well I I have a right for this. And remember the prophet takes us lamb and the dove. He takes us through all of this. We have rights. But remember what he said. When we think we have a right, the dove takes its flight. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; Even in our action, it's when we think the dove takes its flight. That's so good. &gt;&gt; So then when we look at this here, for what glory is it when you be buffeted for your faults, you shall take it patiently? I mean, when you've done wrong and the boss says something, you're like, "Ah, sorry about that, man. I I messed up." But if you do well and suffer for it, you take it patiently. This is acceptable with God. For even here unto you were you called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, who did no sin, NEITHER WAS GUILE found in his mouth. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT HE WAS saying here was what was here. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; This is the very same thing FROM ABOVE. NOW YOU know when we look at this in the scriptures here, this is why even when you consider brother Brandham, he comes to this uh the place where he had hunted squirrels before and he led that infidel to the Lord. How many remember that? &gt;&gt; And he takes him, you know, about the apple tree. Brother Brandham pulls in there cuz the man passed away about a year after that brother Brandham was able to lead him to the Lord. and they pull in there and because brother Brandon had been up there being able to do some work and things like that and so there was a way to get around so he didn't have to drive through the field. He had drove that way the previous time when he was there and and here comes out this this little lady this little sister which was the husband's wife and she comes out and is raking him over the coals. &gt;&gt; She was giving him what FOR YOU YOUNG PEOPLE JUST THINK YOU CAN DO WHATEVER you want to do. you think you can run us old people over? And brother Brown was trying to tell her, he said, "Sister," he said, "I I I I didn't mean anything by it. I'm sorry. I I I I maybe I should have just come when your husband was around. I I I because he's the one that I I've talked to and I Well, you just think you can do whatever and you have no rights to be on this land. And he said, "But but your husband, he he actually he's the one that gave me rights." And she SAID, "WELL, YOU'RE NOT COMING UP THIS LAND." HE SAID, "BUT IF I DRIVE IN THE FIELD over there," he said, "the car's going to get stuck." Boy, she would just going on and on as Brother Ram ties it and and goes into it and talks about it and finally says, "I'm just a minister." He said, "I I'm sorry." He said, "That I've that I that I've done this." He said, "I'm ashamed of myself." He said, "I I'm sorry I DISTURBED YOU. I WOULDN'T have done it for nothing in the world. And all you young people just think you can run right over us." And he said, 'N no doubt there's been many that's done that in this neighborhood, but sister, we're Christians. I and I'm just I don't live here. I'm just working here. She said, you're a reverend. He said, "Yes, ma'am." "What' you say your name was?" "My name is Brandham." "Are you brother Brandham?" "Yes, &gt;&gt; forgive me." Brother Brandham says her chin start quivering. She said, "Forgive me. I'm a backsliden Methodist. I'm ashamed of the way I acted. God bless you, sister. Go back to church. Won't you serve the Lord Jesus? &gt;&gt; Brother Bam SAID, "SEE, IF YOU JUMPED OUT THERE AND STARTED FUSSING AT HER &gt;&gt; AND TELLING HER SHE DIDN'T HAVE A RIGHT AND SO FORTH," he said, "See, just a few words of love went down to the heart." &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Let's get people inside the veil." &gt;&gt; That's how we conquer, he says, is by love. SO JUST A FEW WORDS of love. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam did not take an occasion to the flesh. &gt;&gt; This is where the scripture deals with the conformity to the image of Jesus Christ. For whom he did forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. And to THINK THIS IS WHAT this conforming is not not something this very word it's not something that is just what is on the outside or the outward form but it actually deals with the substance of character and the only thing that can produce this character is the very life of Jesus Christ that comes by the new birth and the prophet says it's a mess anyway it comes but what kind of life does it produce? It produces servant life to humble yourself and deny yourself. That's the kind OF LIFE. IT MAKES A SERVANT out of you. It takes the starch out of you. It makes an image molding a new life, a new creation. OH, YOU MIGHT BE ALL MESSED UP WHEN YOU GET UP, but you're born again. And no matter where you are, it makes a new life. It brings a new image life. IT MAKES A SERVANT OUT OF YOU. you want to serve them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus wanted us to serve one another. Love one another as we serve one another. We serve him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Ram goes on to tell us the very next quote. He said, "It's only the sick that demand attention." &gt;&gt; Those that he says that as they would constantly needing attention and you know uh making a show and going about things, he said they need attention. They need the attention of the spirit of Christ by way of the new birth. &gt;&gt; See, THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST IN us will not cause a scene. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; That is so good. &gt;&gt; This is where it produces a real a real servant life in our lives. Now, I want you to think of this particular thing right here. this scripture. Look not every man on his own things &gt;&gt; or we could say be selfabsorbed &gt;&gt; but every man also on the things of others. Now sometimes I understand even in the natural parts of life a person could be in this kind of a frame and yet not even be spiritfilled. They just have a tendency to I want to help this. I want to help this. I want to do this. But this is talking about with the life of Christ on the inside. It's talking about more than helping just somebody build a shed. But however, maybe you're helping build that shed to be able to have fellowship and to help that brother along. Maybe you're helping to do something in order to win them to Christ. But yet within this, it's not to be self-absorbed. And yet sometimes depending on how that our makeup is and the way things could go, we can become so self-absorbed. And like the picture depicts it right there very clearly. Here you have the young man on one side and he's in his own world. &gt;&gt; Totally oblivious to a person having a troubled world. &gt;&gt; So good. You know, brother Brandham brings this into this place of how that Jesus never lived for himself. &gt;&gt; He lived for others. And brother Brandham deals with this on that day on Calvary and how that eternal life itself is living for others. Right &gt;&gt; now when we understand this this is we we understand and I I don't think I would have to say this but this is deeper than just giving fruit baskets to somebody &gt;&gt; it's deeper than just you know going and you know shoveling somebody's driveway. ALL THOSE THINGS ARE ARE GOOD AND I'M NOT dismissing those. But what we're saying is is that it's not works that gain us entrance or I've done this or I I've helped out here. That's not it. Remember, brother Ram tells us in the adoption series, he said the hybrid can outwork the thoroughbred any day. &gt;&gt; SO IT'S NOT ABOUT outworking this eternal life of living for others. It yes is ministering to others with and under the leadership of eternal life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's seeing value. It's living beyond our self. Living beyond just, you know, well, I punched in and I've I fulfilled my duty and punched in and we punch out. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; SO NOW LOOK AT THIS. YOU KNOW, BROTHER BRANDON brings this out, you know, because he goes into this depth of this. He says, "Now you know that living for others," he said, "when you receive that eternal life, that day in your life, you don't live for yourself no more. You live for others." He said, "Someone asked me, he said, "How can you stand to let anybody call you such bad names? You don't live for yourself. You live for others that you might redeem that man. You become sons." And he said, "The trouble of it is THE CHURCH HAS FORGOT they were sons. You're a son. You're taking Christ's place. You're a son. So don't live for yourself, live for others. &gt;&gt; See the life that we live, the the consistency. Let me tell you, even when among your family, remember brother tells us in the token, he said, "Let them see it in you. It it'll take an effect. Let them see it in you. It will take an effect." &gt;&gt; Right? It's seeing that life that that life on display, that consistency. It doesn't matter. Let me just say this to you. We in ourselves, I I believe that we can so go through and and I believe friends in studying the word of God, BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE a life that's on display. Right. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE GREATEST IMPACT and influence on the lives of our family on OUR CHILDREN IS THE DISPLAY of token life. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; NOT HOW MANY QUOTES WE KNOW YET. I BELIEVE IN GIVING OURSELVES TO THE WORD. IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW MANY SCRIPTURES WE KNOW YET. I BELIEVE IN GETTING INTO THE WORD OF GOD. BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE A LIFE THAT'S THERE BECAUSE THE LETTER [screaming] KLETH BUT THE SPIRIT GIVETH LIFE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN A MAN IS AT REST, LISTEN TO ME. WHEN A MAN IS AT REST WITH GOD, HE DOES NOT RELY upon anything &gt;&gt; but the Lord. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT WORKING TO TRY TO PROVE HIMSELF. OH MY, I HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T done this in a while and I got to I got to lay hands on this one or I got to I got to go preach this or I got to GO DO THIS. HE'S NOT RESTING ON ANY OF THOSE WORKS. I'M TALKING ABOUT A MAN THAT IS AT REST IS IN A POSITION TO BE ONE FOR A CHANNEL OF ATMOSPHERE change to come in his life &gt;&gt; IN HIS HOME TO INFLUENCE OTHERS CUZ YOU'RE AT REST in your life and in your walk. That's a relationship with God. &gt;&gt; That is so good. Beautiful. &gt;&gt; That's what God's called us to. That's why for every every husband, every every every man is to be at a rest in his life and his walk and standing because as the children even come along, they're going to go through brother Bram had it right in his own home. HE SAID THEY FIRST HAVE THOSE ADOLESCENT YEARS. &gt;&gt; And he said it like this in THE BEGINNING OF INDICTMENT. YOU'VE GOT TO suffer with them. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Okay. Suffer with not kill them. Suffer with them. &gt;&gt; That's right. BUT YOU HAVE TO IN DOING THAT BECAUSE WHY? IT'S A SEASON. &gt;&gt; IT'S A TIME. IT'S A NURTURING. IT'S A WALKING WITH THEM. IT'S A COMING AND KEEPING THEM IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND LETTING CHRIST BE THE CENTER THERE even in your life and in your home. NOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM GOES ON TO SAY IT like this. He says, "WELL, BROTHER BRANDHAM, I can live for this brother cuz he sure is a nice man. Yeah, &gt;&gt; BUT THAT AIN'T IT. &gt;&gt; LIVE FOR THAT MAN who hates you. &gt;&gt; For that person would kill you if they could. &gt;&gt; That's what they did to him. They killed him and he died that he might save them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You mean God would would would would call us to that. That's what the spirit of Christ will produce in our lives. Yes. &gt;&gt; This is not what we have to produce. This is what the spirit of Christ calls us to. &gt;&gt; It's something that he brings us to this place of death to self to where the reflection becomes in our heart. What more could I have done? What more could I do? Lord, help me to try to understand cuz a brother or sister even the responses sometimes that can be coming. It's not even really what's wrong. It's things that's underneath. Right? &gt;&gt; It's things that's underneath the clouds. &gt;&gt; But notice brother Ram says Christ himself so completely surrendered his life to God. He gave himself as a public servant to the people. He gave his life freely. He didn't have to do it. He didn't He didn't begrudgingly do it. He didn't say, "Now you, brethren, you ought to think a whole lot of me because I come to die for you." &gt;&gt; He never said a word about it. He died anyhow because it was God in him and it's God in you. It's God in me that makes us look at others. It's God in us. Let me just run through a few scriptures here. The scripture tells us in the in there right down to the bottom verse 10 of Galatians 6. As we therefore have opportunity, let us good do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith. Paul would go on and write in Hebrews 6:10, "God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which you have showed toward his name, in that you ministered to the saints and do minister." I would say that here we are in this hour, if there was ever an age and ever a time that would have to battle being self-absorbed. &gt;&gt; Now, let me just say this to you. Moses became selfabsorbed in the work of the Lord and he neglected to circumcise &gt;&gt; his child. So a person can be I'm so absorbed within the things of God and their family is left. Their family is just well where have you been? Their family is left. Well, I've been doing the work of the Lord. I think from my wife. What about of the times that many times I can I can get maybe a call will come in here or a text. Brother Sam, you do got you have a few moments, you know, I'm I'm closing out of here and I'm I'm departing at a certain time and I I I can call at that time or or this and sometimes calling and then leaving all the way out of here. And I'm not begrudging this. I want you to understand something. But even when that has happened, the thing that I want to do, because a lot of times for our dinner, it's usually late and I can let her know, honey, just go ahead, y'all go ahead and eat. Put mine in the microwave. She knows then what's taking place. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; You say, "BROTHER SAMUEL, DO YOU HAVE TO DO THAT?" NO. But neither do I want her worrying. Neither do I want the rest of of the evening to be in that place where a tenseness or what not that she's ever going to get mad at me and throw tomatoes and whatever more. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING? IT'S A CARE. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; IT'S JUST SIMPLE CARE. IT'S NOT BECOMING SO ABSORBED. BUT LISTEN, WHAT IF my security was my ministry? &gt;&gt; Here we go. What if all that I was was my ministry? What a sad thing that would be. &gt;&gt; That'd be like having a nice looking suit. It's actually no character on the inside of it then. But but if IT'S SO SELF-ABSORBED BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT A PERSON is basing everything on. This is THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE. THIS IS WHO YOU ARE. LISTEN, MY GIFT is not who I am. I am not Oh, I know some been different ones. Oh, brother Samuel a minister and THIS AND THAT. I'M NOT. THAT'S NOT ME. MY GIFT IS NOT ME. &gt;&gt; If my gift is me, that is shallow Christianity. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT KNOWN BY OUR GIFT &gt;&gt; OR GIFTS IN OUR LIFE, SINGING, WHATEVER. WHAT WE ARE KNOWN BY IS THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST IN OUR LIFE AND OUR REST IS IN HE has made me free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then we become channels &gt;&gt; that he can move through. Because if crisis arise and I'm not having a good day, things aren't going just exactly right and I feel like things are in haywire. I want to ask you to raise your hand. But everybody has those kind of days where you feel like everything's just been a a haven, man, just coming from all all sides and all angles. But yet here you are called to come in as a priest into your home. Here you are as a as a sister, as a brother, and you come in. Here you are sitting right here tonight, even even in this place and and in the house of God and all of the battles and things of life and where all of this HAS COME TO. AND YET YOU HAVE A CHOICE RIGHT HERE TONIGHT. YOU HAD A CHOICE THAT YOU COULD SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? I have worked all day. I think I'll just sit home and stream. &gt;&gt; I'm so tired. I think I'll just I need to sit in the lazy boy and listen to brother Samuel. But what if we needed your amen right here? &gt;&gt; SEE IT ACTUALLY COMING TO THE HOUSE OF GOD. THE PROPHET SAYS, "YOU bring your strength &gt;&gt; AND YOU STRENGTHEN OTHERS." &gt;&gt; PAUL WROTE IT JUST LIKE THIS WHEN HE SAID in the scriptures, I'm just going to skip on down here. Paul wrote it within this manner when he said to you and I that let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works. DO YOU REALIZE JUST THE CON JUST THE CONSTANCY? I'm not begging for a crowd to preach to. &gt;&gt; I preach to crowds. What I'm ministering to is sons AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. I'M TRYING I'M TRYING WITH EVERYTHING WITHIN ME TO GIVE MYSELF TO GOD THAT WE CAN GET READY TO GET OUT OF HERE. AND LET ME TELL YOU, YOU'VE GOT TO BE WANTING TO GET OUT OF HERE. GOD AIN'T GOING TO COME TO YOUR HOME, PULL YOU OUT OF YOUR HOME, AND TAKE YOU INTO RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING IN YOUR HEART THAT YOU LONG AND ARE LIVING FOR HIS COMING. &gt;&gt; THAT'S TRUE. &gt;&gt; AND PART OF THAT IS A SACRIFICE THAT WE make in assembling ourselves together. &gt;&gt; God don't come and hog tie us out and bring us all in here together, BUT THIS IS A SACRIFICE RIGHT HERE TONIGHT. A SACRIFICE THAT IS made to come to the house of God. And then even when YOU GET HERE, IT'S A sacrifice to go beyond how YOU FEEL. IT'S A SACRIFICE TO raise your hands. IT'S A SACRIFICE. YES. SOMETIMES IT JUST, MAN, IT'S SO EASY. IT'S LIKE THE SONG LEADER. HE GETS UP AND SAYS ONLY. AND BOOM, MAN. IT JUST EXPLODES LIKE THAT. THAT WAS NOT THE PIANO. THAT WAS NOT THE SONG LEADER. IT'S JUST YOU CAME EXPECTING. AND THEN THERE'S OTHER TIMES THERE MIGHT BE THIS ONE DOWN AND THIS ONE, YOU KNOW, IS UP AND THIS ONE'S DOWN. BUT WHAT DO WE DO? WE COME TOGETHER AND THOSE THAT ARE UP, WE COME TO UNITE OUR FAITH TOGETHER AND STRENGTH THAT CHRIST HIMSELF MIGHT COME AND MINISTER to our needs. I wonder, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; if we walk away from a service, well, that was just for, you know, justification. &gt;&gt; You might want to pay attention because you might need justification. Right. &gt;&gt; And then again, there's also times WHERE GOD WILL DEAL WITH THINGS within a service THAT NECESSARILY MAYBE THE BULK OF THAT SERVICE was not even for maybe the bulk of that congregation THAT'S THERE. AND GOD MIGHT HAVE focused on just one need within that congregation. Can you all get behind that and say, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT GOING TO USE THIS FOR AN occasion to the flesh to JUST SIT HERE AND FALL ASLEEP AND LET MY MIND JUST WANDER. BUT I'M GOING TO GET IN AND I'M GOING TO PULL ON THE GIFT OF GOD BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE BORN AGAIN. I KNOW WHERE GOD TOOK ME FROM. I KNOW THE LIBERTY THAT HE'S BROUGHT IN MY LIFE. AND IF THERE'S ONE SITTING HERE TONIGHT OR TOMORROW MORNING OR WHENEVER THAT HAS NOT EXPERIENCED THAT, BOY, I WANT THEM TO EXPERIENCE WHAT I'VE EXPERIENCED. BE A PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER THAN YOUR OWN LITTLE WORLD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Say amen. &gt;&gt; OUT ON ME. HELP ME, LORD JESUS. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; No wonder. No wonder. Let me close on this point here. It just moved down through many of these. Paul would write about how that even in his own life of how that he said, "I've offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith." &gt;&gt; His whole life was spent to help somebody else along the way. &gt;&gt; Paul would also write, "We are helpers of your joy." We're helping your joy. How many you remember in the scripture in the book of acts Dorcas Tabatha same person brother actually refers to sister Bruce as the Dorcas of old and Dorcas she made these coats all of these things for people you don't know Dorcas as Dorcas I tell you what Dorcas was Dorcas was the one when everybody fellowshipped she had the for that's not what Dorcas was known as. DORCAS, I TELL YOU WHAT, SHE WAS SUCH A SPIRITUAL WOMAN, SHE COULD TIE THINGS TOGETHER BACK AND FORTH. That's not what it says. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you know what Dorcas did? She recognized her part in the body. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Her part, it was something that moved in her heart to do things for others. You know, friends, I think what would be such a blessing is if we didn't have to ask, but even we could say, "What can I do?" &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; What can I do? &gt;&gt; What can I do to help? I've had my I've had my own boys come to me here. They they see me saying, "Dad, what can I help to make it easier on you? &gt;&gt; Is there something I can do for you, Dad? There's something I can I can I can take? Is there something that that that can be done?" Now, I'm just saying, can't we just ask God that, Lord? Is there something that's beyond just my own little &gt;&gt; sphere? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is there something more that I can do? It may not be something that would seem so spiritual, but yet if it has to do for the body of Christ, &gt;&gt; even when it comes to making sure sidewalks are cleared, I come over here at at times and well, I'm over here through the week. I come on here at different times. See, see the brother just going right there, right on the right on the lawnmower, taking care of the different things. &gt;&gt; Just just simple simple things. Simple things. But you know what? I'm glad the grass is cut, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I'm glad it is. I'm glad that, you know, things get get taken care of. I'm glad of that. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for those things. I know they're not really spiritual, &gt;&gt; but they still have a great impact. But and that's not for everybody, you know, showing up with shovels because we don't want to be a bunch of state workers where we're all leaning on shovels either, you [laughter] know. So, we don't want to, you know, you have to get a West Virginia driver's license to do that. But, you know, you you you you want to be able to say, Lord, what would you have me do? &gt;&gt; WHAT DID PAUL SAY? LORD, what would you have me do? &gt;&gt; And I want to do something beyond my duty. &gt;&gt; We want to do something beyond our duty. &gt;&gt; You love him. My my thank you, father. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads. Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Father, help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord, I I don't want to take even a moment that this would pass pass me by, pass this congregation by, Lord. But to ask you, Lord God, for your mercy. I there's many things, Lord, that even you've drawn my attention to, Lord, even over the time. and things that Lord that even that I hadn't even considered and looked at. But Father, you've not only drawn my attention to me. You've drawn it to my attention, but how you've corrected me. And I'm so grateful for that, Lord. Oh God, how it it always just saddens my heart when I can see, Lord, that some way along that I failed you. I've let you down. And how how could that be? But I thank Lord of the Scriptures where you always always take it. For what you've done unto the least of these, &gt;&gt; my brethren, you've done it unto me, Lord. Help us, every one of us. Lord, we're living in an age. We are living in an age that is is self-absorbed. We're living in an age, Lord, that Lord God, we see everything is about me and self and I. This this is an anointing we realize that's around us. But Father, we've received a kingdom that cannot be moved. So I pray Lord that you would you would help us Lord tonight. There's no way Lord that even Lord in a service like this that we could even go through many different examples and things Lord I have many Lord much more laying here before me but yet Father I know we only have so much time. So Lord, I'm asking that you would so help us Lord to take take in the word and to really to ask you Lord help me what you're what you're speaking about. Lord I servant life and Lord I that's my heart's desire. Help me Lord. How can I be a help &gt;&gt; to your people Lord? How can I Lord be a help to my brothers and to my sisters Lord Jesus may you Lord lead me and guide me. Lord God, help us, Lord. I pray in our lives, Lord, with even in our homes, Lord, as husbands and wives and Lord God, with our children, Lord, among our young people, Lord, help us, Father. I thank dear God, that Lord Jesus, even as we're standing right here, there's many, Lord, that have went on went on home to be with you, Lord God. Even some of the very beginnings of this assembly as they labored many Lord God as they even opened their homes they did the things that Lord that you led them to do in that time and Father how that you Lord so worked through that Lord God to minister to others to disciple along the way Lord sometimes with discipling a new believer. It's something, Lord, that's not always something that's overnight. As a matter of fact, when we can think back to our own life and every one of our lives are so different, but to remember Lord that there were hearts who took us under their wings and they would just just speak about speak about you. Cuz there's many things, Lord, sometimes in terminology that even new converts do not understand. But Lord God, they've understood the presence of God that has so dealt with their life to bring conviction. Help us, Lord, in our lives that Lord, we can bring Jesus on the scene. Lord God to be a help Lord to someone else along the way maybe Lord as a brother Lord to a brother a family to a family to be an encouragement Lord help us and Lord when I read that as your prophet said I was tired when he talked about that situation going on in his home my I don't know how many times Lord I preached from that quote but it was last year about August when I was getting ready for a banquet And I was reading back over that quote and my goodness, it's like it jumped off the page at me. I already had it right in my outline, but that jumped right off the page. I was tired. He was wore out. But the question, I love the question. Lord, what would you have me be in this moment? Oh God, help us. &gt;&gt; We want to know, Lord, that's how we look to you. What would you have us be in this moment, Lord God? We have, Lord, the jobs. We have all these things that we have to attend to. My goodness, it seems like, Lord, sometimes it's just things just pouring in left and right. But God, help us. &gt;&gt; Would you help us, Lord? Give us the strength that we need. Lord, help us as we have opportunity. Lord, help us to be able to minister to one another. For who is my neighbor? One that I see in need. Maybe they're in need of a kind word and encouragement. If we could do that toward all men and especially as Paul said to those of the household of faith, help us, Lord. This is the kind of this is the kind of people that we want to be. those Lord, like the prophet said, we can't wait to get in here and fellowship with our brothers and sisters. Oh, I know, Lord. We're every one of us, Lord, we're there's pockets of us that's alike, pockets that's different, and everything else, but you didn't want us to all be alike. But father, it's through all of this that you manifest your glory, showing the love of God that it the love of God in our [music] heart. The love for the brotherhood is greater, is greater than oursel. Help us, Lord. Lord Jesus, I've got my hands up, Lord. I ask you, Lord, God, help me, Lord. Lord, for truly, Lord God, when we would look at this an occasion to the flesh, an opportunity sometimes, Lord, just even in ourselves, Lord God, we may not even see it in that way. But here tonight, help us, Lord. Help us. May we not, Lord, give love based on who deserves it. Because if that was the case, we'd have never got it because we never deserved it. But Lord Jesus, many times, Lord God, I know that projecting of love, we can look and say, "Well, this this this life needs change. They need this and they need that. But let's project the love of God. Let's speak to them in love. Get them in the place and the prince of God where God can do something for them. Cuz if there's anything to ever be done in their life, it'll take God to do it. Help us, Lord. [music] Forgive us, Lord. Forgive me. Forgive us, Lord. I pray of these, Lord, and times, Lord, where we have fallen short. But help us to be sensitive. Help us to be mindful. We love you and we thank you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Go ahead. Little [singing] is much. If God is in it, labor [singing] not for wealth, for fame. You can [singing and music] win it if you go in Jesus name. Oh, [singing] little is [music] much God is in it. Save her [singing] now full of glor [music] if you go in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Yes Lord now right there a word for all to do.

[music and singing] If you go in Jesus and when the cost [music] flicked here [singing] is ended and [music] our race on earth is &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. We will sing [music] if we are faithful. [singing] Welcome home. [music] My child will die [music and singing] as much if God is in it. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Never [music] for well for flame never [singing] [music] [singing] [music] if God is labor [music and singing] not for well there's a crown you win [music and singing] in Jesus name. So [music and singing] let us go in Jesus name. [music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's stand if we could. You got another one on your heart. Flow through me. Yeah. Let's sing that.
