you as we want to go into the word here this morning John chapter 4 I'd like to start with here and just want to reiterate the announcement that they made here we had to change the midweek service we changed we had prayer meeting already scheduled for Tuesday but we went ahead and moved to Thursday into Tuesday so we'll have a midweek service at 7:00 on Tuesday this week brother Brian already announced that here so third that will not have a service here on Thursday and if I have to do that again even in the future I'll make sure I let because I know some of you get your work schedule set around that and we'll try to get that out to you one of the things that's very difficult at times to try to get someone in even on a Thursday night in the midweek for them driving so that was posted we posted it I don't think it's been sent out yet by the email but we had already forwarded it so it's on the bulletin board as well everybody got that Tuesday night we're gonna have the have midweek service on Tuesday night at 7 o'clock here so also remember brother Carlos and prayer the Lord has certainly been very good been very mindful of our brother and just just brought him right through that and he's just had a little bit of soreness and different things right now so let's just let's keep him in prayer the Lord will just just continue to strengthen him so let's look here in John chapter 4 verse 19 and then once we want to rehear just a few scriptures beginning in verse 19 the woman saith unto him sir I perceived that thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him amen now I want you to think of this here just for a moment let me just pause with you here just a moment discus there's little drops here notice what he says in verse 23 the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him this is God dwelling with his creation in his creation and that God dwelling in the man is perfect worship but in perfect worship the Lord Jesus the Bible says he went to church it says as was his custom so the person says well we are the church we are the tavern of God I agree with that but the Tabernacles of God will assemble themselves with the Saints of God amen verse 24 God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth not just with spirit not with not good enough in the woman said unto him I know that Messiah cometh which is called Christ there was no question with her I know Messiah is coming which is called Christ when he is come he will tell us all things Jesus said unto her I that speak unto thee am he Amen god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I want to just look here just a few moments here in the scriptures and to look at the thought on the light of God and true worshipers I I find this to be when we look at it here in the scriptures Jesus is identifying because the question that she's asking where should we worship she's you know she's asking do we you know our fathers say here in Samaria and here you know here as the Jews they say in Jerusalem and Jesus is letting her know there is a transition that is coming to where that that that not only is coming but is present because he is the representation of this true rep of this true worship and that is that it's not just going to be going yep to Jerusalem every so often for a feast to worship but it will but it is coming to a place to where that within this that Wars think of this you know there were many and you know this if you don't know it as a Bible reader I'll just touch on it a moment but just to refer for all of us there were many who would go up to Jerusalem even and they would go in different feasts and they would go in different times but if you'll notice that even many times when they were going the Book of Isaiah the Lord spoke through Isaiah and Isaiah 1 and he even let them know that your offerings your sacrifice they have become a stench in my nostrils and he Godin and does not call them his feast at that time even though they are the Feast of the Lord but he says your feast because they don't resemble the character of the one who gave them because the feast were not just things to just to be done but there was an expression even though the worshiper they were worshipping those who were truly entering into those fees were worshipping by divine revelation by life that was given in that time where they would offer up the lamb and in each one of the of the seasons you know from the barley sheaf to the wheat sheaf and on and on and all of that was where they were moved in obedience and there was light that was given to them that they would come and they would offer that up but here the Lord Jesus is is letting it be known that you know even as we look at worship itself many people today let me just take a step back many people today with you had talked to him on today they will say well I'm going to worship today and they go to church and they're so you know you you you know somewhere there's some sort of a affiliation you know or maybe there were some that you know saying well we went to worship yesterday or whatever more but you see where where it has come to where that people look at worship as just going to church and we we understand that this worship in itself is much deeper than just coming to church because you can come to church and not be a worshiper you can come here and not worship God whatsoever because to worship God listen you we worship according to the revelation of who he is and who he is revealing himself to us personally and you can only walk by the revelation that God has revealed to you so you never want to try to be like somebody else you simply want to walk with that which God is making known to you and as you walk in that God will open more to you you see when we we look at it that see that worship itself it was made to be of an expression we find in the beginning you find you find two that came in the process of time the Bible tells us you find Abel you find Cain both of them had a sacrifice and both of them came to worship but as they came to worship what was the difference is there was a difference in their offering one was offering by the works of his hands and it was beautiful they he didn't offer spotted fruit this was not rotten fruit where flies were blowing around it this was beautiful he picked out the best you see it's the works of his own hands but to understand that it is man in himself cannot save himself the scripture is very clear salvation is of the Lord and here we find Abel coming and Abel's coming with a lamb notice this this revelation drops to Abel you you can't explain this did Abel figure this out it was not able mind that he was bringing what Abel had received is a revelation from his Heavenly Father that it was blood that took them out it'll be blood to bring them back in and here God showed Abel what the appropriate offering is I want you to think of this now there were many many many other animals he could have offered up I hope you see what I'm saying now because you you recognize he offers a lamb and there's no way that you can explain this but Abel is there and he has being a child of God God is obligated to reveal himself to his children because without that Abel would have continued to stumble in the darkness of his daddy and mommy's teaching that it was fruit that took you out but you see now God comes on the come on God has an obligation that runs far deeper than what had him and Eve did they were doing their best or what we could say his parents and they were trying to cover things around but you see God had an obligation that went so much farther because Abel belonged to God and I say it like this there's no way when God has got ahold of your life when God fills you with the Holy Ghost when this word becomes write to you truth to you eagle food when you step back to it and even consider where you are and why you're here it is not something you can explain it is a mystery but let me tell you what that mystery is it is God's obligation to you and I as his children by being a part of his word we were not searching for him he came seeking for us we could not make a way but he became the way this is the worship that Jesus is introducing that how God is desire to come and dwell inside of man like he was back in the beginning in the Garden of Eden here here in in the setting as we look at it if we can move just a moment to Luke chapter 4 verse 17 here Jesus is standing here in the temple in Luke 4:17 and there was delivered unto Him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written let me just say it to you like this I do not beg the Bible does not record it but I do not believe that Jesus is the one who stood up and said let me have that scroll you see everything is divinely arranged by God they might have had the scripture reading picked out with Forrest with Isaiah we're going to read out of Isaiah and you know what God allowed that God sometimes will allow your plans and allow you to come into a place where you think it's your plans but God said nope this is just where I had ordained to meet you see Mary had her plans to wash that day she had her plans to go get water with the angel the Lord knew the route she was about her every day activities sounds like the rapture doughnut she was about her everyday activities and right there here the Gabriel appears to her and begins to speak to her see God comes and as brother man tells us God comes in unusual ways in unexpected times but he always comes so here when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord now you know when I begin to look at this this scripture and how that it just just so dropped in my heart with some things we were already looking at that the scripture noticed in the previous verse it says one of the manifestations of this will be the recovering of sight to the blind now we know when we read the scriptures when the Lord Jesus was here upon earth there were many who were blind that were healed there were even those who did not even have eyes in their eye sockets and he spat on the ground he put he brought forth of that and put it upon the eyes and said go wash so there was much that within the time of his ministry that there was a lot of healing in the natural now let me just say it like this I got on the study yesterday and my just loved to preach it this morning but I'm not going to but but if you look at it brother bad I'm just you know dealing with the fault if you touching in on your Kable app go blind and you begin to read those statements on going blind you use catch the Spirit of God beginning to deal with people who are going blind matter of fact one case multiple cases actually where the Spirit of God picks up that you're losing your sight because of a demon called diabetes and diabetes has wanted to take your sight in one case brother BAM stands up and he says now what it is he says the Lord healed you about diabetes before but he says now that diabetes has come back to want to try to take your eyesight he said but I cursed that devil in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you are not going to go blind demon then he picks it up you know where your eyes the flattened cataracts have come about aids but you know one thing about it it did not matter if there was a disease it did not matter if there was no macular degeneration and then no matter the Spirit of God addressed every bit of that with the eyes that there was nothing can stand in the presence of God you know why because in this hour this is an hour were they I serve of God speaking in the spiritual would come upon the sons and daughters of God to where where we had been blinded by traditions or where there was only so much life that we could see it was at God's desire that full life would come within this hour that's his promise now do you think about this even when you look at the prophets the prophets themselves were reflectors they were likes they were reflectors they were only reflecting that true light that was to come God would take a hold of their lives look how God would take a hold of the prophets life God would so overcome their lives to where it would actually be a divine expression that would come through their lives not just he would even so move through their lives like Elijah wouldn't lay his body upon the body of that child because God had took over his body and that child would be raised back to life again what an announcement of the Holy Ghost to take over the body of Jesus Christ prophets were reflectors there was glimpses of light there was someone in this profit some within this profit the light that they were given remember the light that they were given was not a light that they themselves were born with but they were they were a part of God and God would speak to their hearts draw them and remember what they would speak now listen to me now what they would speak would actually be light and remember they would be tried how do how was the light that they spoke how was it trying it was tried by the Urim and Thummim if what they spoke did not light up the word that was already given then if it did not do that there was no light in them so the proof of light being in them would be that it would dovetail with the word now to think of their the fall that came about in the beginning you know where Adam and Eve would walk in the cool of the day and you know this reality in Genesis one of what God in the beginning he made man a spirit man not a flesh man that was the God put him in flesh there later but he first made him a spirit man after the image and the likeness of Almighty God and as we read the past couple of weeks he gave that man dominion he gave him dominion over all all that was beneath him he gave him dominion over that of the cria over that of the creation and here God has entrusted that in with man and his wife and then to find that you know within it when the fall itself come we we understand how that the enemy he came to Eve and he begin to present to Eve in Genesis 3 the serpent a more subtle beast than any other beast of the field and so we find here he begins to present what would be known like as light you know God's keeping something from you and he presents light but the light that he presented was not actually light it was darkness but it had the appearance of light but it wasn't it was darkness it brought about the fall and it actually removed man from actually living in the authority as the son and daughter of God from that point on but the Lord but here Almighty God said I will make a way back and brother bran would tell us like this sin blinded every fiber in his body in his mind in his heart but I'm glad that God knows how to remove the blindness aren't you he knows how to remove the blindness and he don't remove the blindness just with teaching he doesn't remove it just by word but he removes blindness by divine expression of light himself now watch this when we look at this because darkness you know when you think about it darkness itself and we look at blindness blindness is actually the lack of light perception there's many different degrees where you know people can be considered legally blind but there's certain things that they can have certain restrictions there's certain measures that they can see in certain things that they can but we recognize that that this this blindness that struck Humanity this blindness that here where man was intended to be a ruler he was intended to have dominion he was intended to have authority but now living in in there in the realm of perfect love there was no fear there there was no doubt there there was no unbelief there so to see where man was now now here it comes to a place that God's desire is to remove that blindness that is falling upon man you know if you stay in the dark long enough you go blind you realize that if you're in total darkness long enough you can go blind and to think about it you know when we looked at it with blindness here there was already the su in was shyness there in that natural sunlight that God's given us a beautiful day today that Sun was still shining that Sun was still declaring itself now you look at this that Sun that's out there this morning the Sun the Moon the Stars Psalms 148 records in that the Sun though you didn't hear it this morning it's singing praise the Lord you didn't hear the moon last night but the moon is singing his praises you didn't hear the stars yet the stars are singing his praises you know what that tells us about worship worship itself is where the creation gueules in position and does what the creator has called it to do so if it would be that way for the sun for the moon for the stars which are part of god's bible and are actually representative of our life as sons and daughters of god what honor to be has sons and daughters of God when we are back in position and where we are dwelling in Christ where we need to be then we get back to Genesis 1 again where the man has dominion or glory because you see the sons of God the sons of God were not giving light as they ought to give light you know you are known as the stars of God in the book of Isaiah 14 it deals with how Lucifer thou art ascended above the stars of God which are the Messiah's brothers amen then though God remember has he told joke where were you when the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy amen not to think of this it was like you know in the beginning you know where God here where light itself would illuminate within the hearts of the children your Bible tells us in first John chapter 1 verse 5 this is the message we have heard of him and declare to you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all amen now notice here is prophecy that is coming regarding this light that is coming back to the earth and I was a afore t25 thus saith thus saith God the Lord he that created the heavens and stretched them out he that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath and bread a breath unto the other the people upon it and spirit to them that walk therein and the Lord have called thee in righteousness and will hold thy hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light for the Gentiles to open the blind eyes this is more than just natural seeing because you can have natural eyesight that's 20/20 or whatever you want to say but you can be blind as a bat spiritually and if you had a choice if I had a choice of what kind of blindness if I had to say I gotta make a choice about a blindness I would rather be naturally blind although that would be hard there would be things I would have to make amends to get around I would rather be naturally blind than to be spiritually blind you realize people can look right at the word and they're looking right at life and be blind why it's the angle they're looking at it so you've got to look at light in the right angle or else you can go blind instead of looking at the light in the right way the light to show you on the right pathway let me just stay here this morning and give me a covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison and then that sent in darkness out of the prison house now here it here is what's the amazement he's not going to go down to a maximum-security prison this is not going down to the local jail house this is not the kind of prison there was a greater prison that man was in than than the Correctional Facility out here out there there was a prison he was born into this prison and he can't get out of that prison but God provided a way by himself that he himself becomes the Covenant he himself bringing his life to that of the Gentiles to open up the blind eyes you see you've got to have your eyes open before you can ever see where you're going amen to bring out prisoners out of a prison house and them that set in darkness out of the prison house now remember there were Pharisees there in John eight they were quick to tell Jesus we never been in bondage to any man now remember Jesus called these guys righteous I don't want to just be righteous out here he called a righteous but we want a righteousness that exceeded a righteousness that is from within the heart and when that righteousness is from within the heart it will permeate all other areas in our life now watch this here in Isaiah 49 five and now saith the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant to bring Jacob again to him though Israel be not gathered yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord and my god shall be my strength now some of these you realize is breaking back and forth even talking on the Israel's were gathering and he said it is a light thing that thou should us be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved of Israel I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles that thou may us be my salvation unto the end of the earth now these are prophecy this is God's Word this was prophecy that light was going to come into the world not natural light natural light was already here but it's got to come spiritual light into the world so how this is already it's already unnoted it's prophecy of the light that is coming now here we find in Luke chapter 2 we find a man by the name of Simeon here he is you know simians just the Bible refers to him as being a just and a devout man he was waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him Simeon was a spirit lead man he was acquainted with God you see exam Ian was he was walking in tune with God as much as God had revealed Simeon was looking at things in the word and you could sit down with Simeon and say he must have had a real good understanding know what he had was faith there was a faith that was operating within his life that Simeon beau could look at something and you know it's been like maybe a shadow that's on the wall and you have that shadow way out here and you look at that shadow and you can have cement Simeon do you see what that is no but I believe it Simmons said no I don't stand it but I believe it he didn't under he wasn't about his understanding but you see the holy spirit it was welcome and he made a visitation to Simeon he was waiting on this promise now notice Simeon is directed out of his office he comes to the place where they are bringing the Lord Jesus the baby here they are to have him you know concise on the eighth day and he comes out of his office led by the Spirit of God he picks him up there in his arms and he says in verse 34 my eyes have seen thy salvation which thou has prepared before the face of all people a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel now notice what's happened it has moved from where it was prophecy now it is identifying here is what Isaiah was talking about so what was it it's the same spirit of God as we talked about earlier with Abel it is God he is committed to his word and his subjects that are upon this earth it is God who is revealing himself and making his Advent himself known to his children now when we look at this word lighten that I don't want to take a lot of time with it but the word lighten itself is revelation this word here it's to be revealed its manifestation it's coming appearing it's it's laying bare or making naked a disclosure of truth instruction it's used of events by which things or states of persons hitherto withdrawn from view are made visible to all manifestation and appearance saw a light to lighten the Gentiles so now this revelation that is breaking forth now when we look at this the light of this divine revelation we know that even though it was spoke here in the Old Testament but there has to be a way in thinking that this light would actually come back into man and bringing man back to the condition that he was there in Genesis 1 now here when we look in gen John chapter 1 and just to read here just from a little bit in John chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men so you have the word you have the life you have the light what are they they're all the same it's God God is light there is no life outside of God amen so here John reaches back under divine inspiration and he brings out the condensation of God of how that God would come dance in here in the beginning the Word was with God the Word was God and here we find that here God the unfolding of God how that that light in here God speaks and the light there if forming God moving right there within that light coming down and it begins to bring about creation the planets the Stars all those things setting in their place and God moves upon the earth this place where you and I call home and which God deals with as far as in Redemption this will be even where we will dwell in the millennium and in the future hold so to think of how that God would move down within this time and he will bring light upon this earth here John is recording all of that that this one is the very light giver himself the light that lighteth every man verse five the light shine ahthe in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not amen the darkness cannot comprehend it there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe very important part here he was not that light John was not the light but was sent to bear witness of that light you got to see John right or you go blind amen he's only a reflection of the true light amen so here here it's showing God's the way God works in order to reveal and make known this true light that is coming upon earth God sends a forerunner to announce this light and to bear witness of the light that's coming up remember now John bore witness of the light that was coming but when that light came the light itself came down and it stepped inside of a body Oh glory be to God oh my that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth what do we find we find here the light of God is we will read here in just a few moments you find the light of God just as God he set forth man that man would be made up in a system of Tabernacles or as far as dwelling places you know brother Samson was was was highlighting that a little bit here on Thursday night we are made up we are three room house there right everybody in here you may have a lot of more houses or rooms in your house but you only live in three rooms you eat in the kitchen then you go to the living room parlor whatever you want to call it your family room you sat down and you talked but then you go to the bread bedroom to rest and in the bedroom is where life itself begins so there is man himself his body spirit soul now to look of how that the light of God that would move down here remember now as we look at this in John chapter 1 here the Bible it picks up on where John's see if Jesus in verse 29 coming unto Him and he said behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world this is he of whom I said after me come up a man which is preferred before me for he was before me now who we talking about are we talking about this or are we talking about who's on the inside because if we're talking about this he was before me this was not before John come on now Elizabeth conceived before but who it was that was behind it that's different for he was before me and I knew him not but that he should be made manifest to Israel therefore am I come baptizing with water Omaha we could preach here for days you see John John knew he's coming but John what are you gonna do I'm gonna do what he has told me to do John how many people John baptized and one after another after another after another after another after another here one day goes by one week one month a year goes by what's John doing there baptizing where you see John and all he's down there baptized said where do you see John he's down there baptizing you know what he lived by the expression of that revelation and he waited there it showed he was waiting brother faith declares itself with the heart that'll wait on God I wonder how many had rose in the time and said I'm the Messiah but there was something within John they might have been miracles that they did but there was something in John that just said don't move you say how would he know that the same way that you know it and man it is by divine revelation it's something within your heart that just takes hold even when you can't explain it you say man this is life [Applause] so what do you do keep on baptizing looks like it's getting awful close for the Samuel do you think all the cash in my 401k no I think you ought to get ready for work tomorrow just be found doing what you would be doing Oh to be to God if you're making an apple pie call me up and I'll come over and do what I do and I knew him not but that he should be made manifest to Israel there for him I come baptizing with water and John bear record saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode on him and I knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost here is gone here what we find God has remember pitch this tent in there's a tabernacle a body that God has prepared for himself just as it was in the beginning Adam steps straight from the hand of God but in Redemption it was not to where God could just speak and then a body would come out just and be created but remember the fall had come by the woman so now he must come through and by the woman but he never borrowed anything of Mary except just the womb amen it was no blood his blood was not Jew nor Gentile and then it is the creative blood of God and here God is coming down what we read right here God is coming down to claim his tabernacle God is saying listen to me now when the Holy Ghost coming here upon this tabernacle of the Lord Jesus it is God laying claim this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased or pleased to dwell in he is laying claim he is making redemption claims and saying my word has made this body and now I'm coming to redeem it it is his word that has made up the body of Jesus Christ now I'm talking about spiritual the sons and daughters of God that go to make up the bride of Jesus Christ just as Eve was taken out of Adam surely is the bride of Jesus Christ not taken out of a church she's taken out of the sign of Christ himself [Music] Oh glory be to God he comes into the world is filled with darkness now they still got Sun they there's still Sun their crops are growing still the sunlight still the moonlight still the Stars but it's a world filled with darkness darkness is upon the earth yet it's bright as it is out here today so you realize we're not talking about a natural darkness we're talking about spiritual darkness paul records and in ephesians 6 it's a spiritual darkness of this day hey man paul records in another place this present evil darkness so if light listen to me now if light true light is the person of Jesus Christ God Himself then darkness is also a person darkness we're not talking about natural darkness we're talking about demonic demons darkness said covered over unbelief doubt that brought blinding and this darkness that is over mankind you see this term that we use and then in the New Testament darkness it means it is something that holds sway over man's life where people desire to be I want to be free of this and I want to be free of that how many people you know I've spoke with people they want to be free of drugs I don't want to do this and I don't want to do that I don't want to do this and you know the reality of it is when they say I don't want to do it it has to be a deliverance come to them and listen friends let me just say right now the devil has no power if you expose him and you repent and you say I do not want this devil around in my life he has to free it's not the preacher who praise him off of you you have to release it down at byc in that camp there was a lot of demonic expression we labored with right there right there praying for many of them right there I'm looking at him and praying I'm giving him instructions and speaking to him and speaking the Word of God over you know the peace of God the blood of Jesus Christ and encourage you what else is there is there something down there in their life I'm telling you right now you witness that people can stay in that condition until they expose that devil that's in their lapid brother when that word when it comes and they expose that Satan is helpless that's why he makes a fuss the way he does and people squirming and everything else that demon is afraid of light it knows that light has chased it it has chased it it has pressed it I tell you Satan has no power if you can just expose it watch this here there have been glimpses of light no watch'n John 3:16 for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that who so believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned so this this verse of scripture even a person that is not in him because you can't get in him without him baptizing you into himself not talking about this water I'm talking about the Holy Ghost a person can believe they can have the gospel preached to them they can believe unto salvation and they are saved are you with me but as you understand that as well when they come just for that place they can also fall right off as well there's no security are you hearing me now there's no seal there's no security hey man amen amen but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God and this is the condemnation nauseous in verse 19 that light is come into the world and Men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil aren't you glad that there was something beneath your your darkness a man that were light would come over shower it exposes the darkness but there's something beneath that darkness like there was in Genesis one don't you see Genesis one is a story of redemption it's a story of the new birth the earth was without form and void and darkness covered the face of the deep amen but God said let there be light in the Spirit of God begin to move that word the Spirit of God there Ruach it means he begin to lock his wings he began to brood over that earth and who like a dove it's cooing over that earth to what bring forth and push away that darkness for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God let me read this ones he out of the amplified batter Bible John 3:24 every wrongdoer hates loathes detest the light and will not come out into the light but shrinks from it lest his works his deeds his activities his conduct be exposed and reproved I don't know about you but when I need corrected I want to be corrected now this guy this guy this kind of want to be corrected this guy thinks too much of himself be honest with yourself now but this guy on the inside snow hey that correction is coming from my father and if I get corrected down here I won't be so layoff target out there it wants to be corrected there's times we need to be told you're all there's times we need correction you give your children spankings right maybe we need to do use this mic y'all still believe that's the Word of God right spare the rod spoil the child and what does what does Solomon say by the Spirit of God that you take the correction what this correction do real correction is to drive the foolishness out of the heart aren't you glad that God says I know right where the problems that this guy feels the sting but God's dealing with the heart why he can drive the foolishness away then what our life it reflects the correction in godly discipline oh I don't know it's going to be a family service but this is a family book and we are children of God aren't we Omaha notices in verse 21 but he who practices truth who does what is right comes out into the light so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are let's look at this woman that we just read about in John 6 there's no way in the world that we would identify her has one who was practicing right we would look at her and say she's full of darkness and she was but down beneath there was a little representation that little representation that she had there she read what would word was given to her and she was able to say by the understanding of the word Messiah is coming and when he does come not maybe this little woman have faith are you with me she had faith yet she's still living in that condition you don't do away with that faith that faith will bring you on out Jesus didn't walk up to her and say you ain't got nothing he didn't say that she already had faith to believe that Messiah is coming you know what she meant she was abiding in that promise but now it's more like it's coming she's walking in that light if anybody's life anybody didn't want to be exposed she'd have been it but light exposed her life you got five husbands and the one you're living with now not even yours did it run her away no sir oh come on now Mary not one of us would sit there you know as far as our flats just Omaha Oh glory our flesh when we're being exposed but the inside man takes up there's something greater here you know Jesus are doing the light is pressing back the darkness to reach that daughter of God that's down there on the inside there's clouds of darkness about her life he's reaching down by light to break those clouds away so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are brought in with God divinely prompted done with God's help in dependence upon him Oh Gloria think about this here here's the Lord Jesus in John 8 verse 12 he spake to them and he said I am the light of the world there's no other man could say that before I am the light of the world nice not talking about natural sunlight he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness simple words but one instruction he that followeth you've got to follow him and if you follow him you shall not walk in darkness as you follow him darkness flees as long notice but you shall have the light of Life as long as I am in the world I am the light of the world I'll tell you Jesus Christ is still the light of the world he men he steal the light of the world that same light that has come into the heart of the believer and lights up the life of the believer he is our light notice in John 11 9 jesus answered jesus answered and said are there not twelve hours in the day If any man walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there's no light in him how many had night lights in your house some folks saying you're brave enough raise your hand some of you may not have night lights in your house but you've got maybe even if you pull your blinds you've got a little bit of light that will come around from the street lights stars it'll kind of come around that you know the only where you pulled that blind down it'll come around there or maybe your curtains some of it will come right through it so when you get up in the middle of the night then it's pitch black it's really not pitch black I know sometimes you get used to where things are okay Threepio paste is here to the forward the bed's right here go to the right and everything you've got everything subconsciously beginning your keys and let me rearrange your bedroom set and then you walk blindfolded into that room all the lights are off you will find yourself what in the world what's going on here something's all allocator why because you or me do not have light in ourselves to be able to light our natural pathway no more than we have liked in ourselves spiritual light to lighten our spiritual pathway we need his light without his light its stumbling it's guessing it's confusion but when light is calm here lights things up because there's no light in him now I want you to think of this here within our lives how God will lay down this little representation because we are made to be dependent on a light source you know you're just like if you're outside you got to work on your car at night or change the oil or whatever more you'll see them with the lights on the garage right somebody's not pulled up you know pull it in there and they're you know they're without lights what are you doing change your all how do you know you're getting right think now don't you need like nah I don't need a light just turn turn that phone I turn that flashlight off I've got it if it was your car I guarantee you'd be saying stop you're in working on my car without light that's the same way in our lives spiritually you're not working on my life without light it's got to be the lights of the world of God the Holy Ghost that comes down to work on our lives amen a man is not preaching his thoughts he's preaching by the divine inspiration of the light of God to do on it spells darkness that would want to encroach on our life uncertain sound he said now we just found out that your body is full like x-ray proves that the x-ray does not have any light of its own it's your light that it uses you're born with four rays after a while say 2025 one ray goes out and 35 another or 40 another one goes out or this encouraging in there and finally when you get pass about 65 you're living on your last ray every time you take an x-ray picture you're tearing them Ray's down that's the reason you don't have no more you stick these kids feet in their machines because it's just tearing the Rays right out of their little body and that's cosmic light that's in you that you're made up of full of light cells that's cosmic light but God is a different light but yet he's light I think that picture there's a great proof of what I'm fixing to say that God is light and when we were walking in the light of God as sons of God God is not cosmic light but God's light operated through the cosmic light of Our Bodies Ourselves we were absolutely at one time real genuine sons of God but when the fall came cosmic light yes but God is a different light God's desire is that these cosmic lights would be so pushed to where it's supremely eternal light God's light that's shining through Jesus told him in John let me just skip here John 12:46 I am come a light into the world but whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness I want you to catch this word believeth on me not in me you see just believing on him darkness starts to press away Matthew 4:16 we'll pick that up in just a moment Matthew 4:16 here is the promise of Isaiah we read earlier coming to pass the people which sat in darkness saw a great light and to them which set in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up they were already had sunlight but he was in promise su in life this is promise s Oh in light the word had been spoken about this coming light but remember God's Way of recovering sight to the blind opening up blind eyes was that God Himself would make himself visible through man God revealed what Adam was in Christ Enoch had only heard about it are you with me Enoch had only heard about it from his great-grandpa Adam but he never saw it in display but Enoch had faith in what he heard and Enoch let that word so work in his life till one day that light that was working in his life has quickening power lifted him from these mortal realms why he believed that word but now his sons and daughters of God to see this expression it would take more than just word it had to be the expression of light himself how many were sitting in darkness the woman at the well she was sitting in darkness right hey she a she was a believer but she was still sitting in darkness Legion was sitting in darkness many of them were in darkness and a lights from up here's Peter Andrew Philip Nathanael on and on and on they were doing about their normal lives the light sprung up right where it was looking at the word and they could say ah this is him the one who Moses spoke off this is the one this is the one the Prophet spoke of light was springing up what did that light do when that light was made manifest to them not just in their midst but to them it led them and they started following that light did they understand everything they did not but they started walking in that light is that right they were following it but you had others who were religious that they looked run out and said we see Jesus said because you say you see now your sin remaineth they knew he was a man come from God they knew that Nicodemus testified of what we know now what a man come from God they seen the miracles that were done they seen the witness God was with Christ he was in Christ performing his word they saw it you say what was it about their lives darkness that's why Jesus said be careful that the light in you be not darkness they had light but it was darkness that darkness that was in them Jesus records it when he stands there with Peter and Peter takes off the high priests ear he puts the ear back on and Jesus said now is the hour at hand for them and the power of darkness moving in you that's the book of Matthew what was moving them the power of darkness yet religious but yet the power of darkness held sway they couldn't recognize the very one but they quoted about read about and said they believed in and yet the power of darkness was upon their lives and they crucified the very lord of glory Paul said had the princes of this world knew they would not have crucified but they were blinded relented for our sake let me just try to bring this down to a spot to leave you with something here Ephesians 5:8 Paul expresses it like this for ye were sometimes darkness not you were in darkness you were darkness you were but now are ye light in the Lord not just you're in the light you are the light amen at one time you were darkness but now are you light in the Lord Amen there was a pot that was already there within you what needed what was needed it was needed for the great divine energy the light of God to move upon your life and press back that darkness now watch this here Colossians 1 verse 12 giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in night who made this possible did you know did me know but our Father well how did I file for make it possible God is a spirit but God created a body he became one of us very men and he stepped down within that body he paid the price he said the blood there was a debt a lien against you and I and he paid that debt he provided what was needed that you and I might become partakers of the inheritance of the saints and light you realize this inheritance already belong to you and I you don't inherit something that don't belong to you if I take off this if I take this jacket and give it to you didn't inherited you didn't belong to you I gave it to you but if you let me use this check it and I wear this jacket and then I take it back off and I give it to you he had already belonged to you our inheritance belong to us but the darkness that we were under we could not be partakers of it there had to be one that would be able to put his hands on a holy God and a sinful man there was a chasm that was there that separated God and man but here God became man that's why there is no other mediator than the man Christ Jesus put his hand upon our lives and here a hand a hand from the holy God and it joins us together in a union in a harmony in a oneness he provided the way I won't you just can I have just a few more moments I want you to just leave you with this and zero in on this now he from his his side was opened up out of his side went the water blood there was a spirit all three of them go together to make the birth birthing a son and daughter of God fully into what God intended them to be see the water it's a preaching of the word that lets you know you're a sinner and there's one who died for you he paid the price there's got to come that conviction you repent and you walk into the waters of mantis to be identified with your sacrifice then I'm identifying with the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus he is my sacrifice then his working in the life it cleanses that life up now God can do this very quickly it's not the same with everybody but yet it is the same amen all the time to live all that's in the hands of God are you with me but it's all in God's hands and God is moving listen to me now it's God moving himself forward in your life you hear me you might think I'm off my rocker but I'm not who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sin the notice he delivered us from the power of darkness and translated us into the kingdom of his dear son yet I'm in the same body you're in the same body so this deliverance it's a breaking of that power of darkness in our life but translating is where that part it moves into the expression the full expression as a son and daughter of God starts out small but it gets there let me read something to you everybody with me I want you to pay attention remember when a man is saved like this button here what brother I'm slumping about just like that button that button becomes eternal life in your heart when he's saved that's God as you're able to push out all the roots of bitterness then God begins to spread in you then you become a son of God so you see it isn't so much listen to me now in one way of a type it's moving from the outer court to the inner court to the holiest of holies it is a progression but what is that it's actually God as we're yielding it's him moving moving spreading out spreading out spreading out spreading out so a person can be saved and have that little white button in their life and have all kinds of habits you're with me what has to happen has to let that light grow in their life understand what I'm saying now so when the devil tries to point to you and say how you didn't have no experience with this and this and that you realize that what he starts he finishes no glory be to God look at this as you're able to push out all the roots of bitterness but some how do I get out the roots of bitterness by identifying it just just saying yes to the word amen that's the truth Lord giving yourself to a made man that's right what's happening little more little more little more pretty soon is just not this little speck on this desk right here pretty soon you might have this it's this now remember every inch of ground you gain the devil's going to try to take it back hello somebody hello he's going to try to take it back what do you got to do keep your eyes on the source of line and allow him to continue to spread his life then God begins to spread in you then you become a son of God he goes on to talk about how man was made to be a God go down to the next paragraph it says what happened what happened because he disbelieved God's Word it sent him right back out to shift for himself God's trying to bring him back and when you have faith and accept him my brother just let that little light begin to grow out that little light begins to move in there said I believe he's a son of God I believe he's my righteousness I'll take him as my savior right there little button what about the black button no it's too big too big this little button right here or maybe that little button right there brush him to its little but it's gone but it's John let him spread out in your life like he spread out through the prophets like he spread out they can start like this accepting him as savior well brother Samuel they got a lot of habits on their lap did you clean yourself up Oh sir its Christ in us who cleans us up well I'm gonna stop doing this and I'm gonna quit doing that I'm gonna stop clicking on these sites and I'm gonna need ain't gonna do that you need to let him push through your life just let that little light begin to grow out taking all the roots of doubt and bitterness and yielding yourself to the Spirit then you begin to become a son of God a daughter of God begin to grow in the grace of God the Holy Spirit begins to build his kingdom within you it's not doing he's making a son and daughter again can I read a couple more quotes hallo this brother ran just goes right through this on and on how to treat some of these to you when a man saved that much of him is good that's the little light that comes in to make you quit doing what's wrong that little light yep because it's God light it's not self-made light it's touch spreading out in that life well I got a saint to find myself I gotta clean myself up you're right you we do need to be cleaned up yes sir gotta be cleaned up gotta be sanctified because he'll never feel a dirty cop but he who called you he is also the Saint the fire now if you can take all the malice and envy and strife and unbelief out that little button light of the light and power of God will keep growing growing growing growing crowding out unbelief now sisters just hold tight brothers have you ever come to a spot where you look around and say is there any more room for furniture here by now to get in the living room we've got to crawl over chairs I'm not saying about my house but you understand you put so much if we take this right here we take these pews right now I've got places to walk up here but brother Joy's you and I are lifting these pews up here and eventually we get this place filled with pews up here there won't be no more room for me to walk around now at first you take that first pew put it up here I can still come over here but then you'd get another pew and you put it right there you see my encroachment gets shorter then you grab another Pew put it right up there what are you doing you're trying to eliminate my movement so as we allow the Spirit of God to grow in our life what does it do it it's crowding out unbelief furniture that was once part not of the designer of the Almighty God but that begins to pass from our life see so many times people are so we're looking at something as though my lord I'll never have any problems I don't gotta fight one battle whatsoever oh no you gotta fight battles there is a growing out of this working of this life within you but listen if you've got just this much God in your life you've got that eternal life part welling there you need to allow him to push out how you understand what I'm saying you got this much right here you can take the promise greater receive that's in me than he that's in the world over the Samuel I've not been fully born-again yet I'm not fully got the baptism of the Holy Ghost but you've got that little white button that is the Holy Spirit there to work out in your life you've got a greater is He that is in you he's not asking you to do it on your own I am come in the world as a light that whosoever believeth on me shall not abide in darkness and you don't do it listen what he says you don't do it by exportations of bodily exercise I'm gonna get me a mat and I'm gonna set on this mat and I'm gonna put my fingers in a certain way and I'm going to do this and I'm no longer we're not talking about mind over matter if that was needed if all we needed was a mat then God would have become a mat come on somebody we didn't need a mat what I'm gonna practice I'm gonna do this the problem is I that's the problem when I does it I fail you can do it what happened to be the little white button in your life allowing the Holy Spirit to move out in your life so you don't do it behind exportations of bodily exercise my boy this time I'm going to live heavy I'm gonna do more do a set of Philemon then we'll get heavier on you do a set of three and then I'll do a set of one and no you do it by sanctified consecrated life that the Holy Spirit moves through you hate to ask for more time but can I have a few more moments you say how do I do it by sanctified consecrated life if I'm desiring the Lord to sanctify and moving to this area in my life first of all the victory comes where you say Lord I want you to live in that door that's already the victory where you were inviting him in to live in that door in your life you're inviting him to come into that room of your life he comes up and knocks on you say go ahead Lord you can move right in there now you say well how do I do about sanctified consecrated life because already you are aligning yourself with the truth sanctify them Father through thy word thy Word is truth truth is not a doctrine it's the person the word is not a doctrine it's the person so how do I do it in your heart you align with God God deals with your heart Lord cleanse me Lord your promise is you are my Saint afire you're my cleanser you're the one who removes from my life you see what you're doing you're not presenting your works you are acknowledging who's in you you're acknowledging who's in you now if I probably ask brother Richard back there right now now picking on brother Richard but he probably couldn't even see that button right but you know what the effects of it the more that this button starts growing by the time of that button gets thrown out like this literature I see it I see that button well how does he now see it because one started out like this grows it grows till eventually when he looks up here it's like I don't see Samuel no more all I see is one big white button what's happened God taking over 30 man what do I do let him take over sanctified consecrated life be in the house of God when it's time read the Word of God pray have fellowship with him put forth that effort put forth those things because he is our sanctified let's close Lord Jesus Lord you are the light of the world you are still the light of the world you've come into this world that we lived in what I still remember but how many can join and fellowship with me well I remember when you came into my world my world was a mess a mess bored even myself oh yeah I had sit around the light of God the message that you sent to us the promises that were given in this day I said around it but Lord that light never was moving in me or my world it was a world of darkness darkness held sway in my life what it doesn't matter if a person goes out and does all these sorts of things or they just sit around in religious it still darkness unless there's light that comes in there it cannot be just light of the mind the Lord it's got to be the light of God I remember that ward that'll like this started little white button that started in my life you got ahold of my life that day well there were still things in my life yeah the Lord you begin to move you kept moving in my life you know order when I look back on it now maybe this would be help to somebody I didn't even make habits a focus you were the focus and Lord God by the grace of God you removed those things from my life I didn't remove you did that little white button they begin to grow all my prayer life did not start out like like it is right now and nothing but I still want more of you the Lord he was growing you were teaching me even in the reading of your word praying over in Lord or maybe there's someone here this morning or God hearts that they've had a little white button Lord like a white button start in their life maybe they've got Lord somewhat discouraged and yet there's something Lord God that they realize there's no going back no no I know I know what has come into my life but the desire Lord God here this morning is they would be ready to equip themselves knowing that God that little white button it'll press out in their life if they will allow it to grow you don't take over and take over and take over and take over your prophet would type it also in the message the Messiah as Joshua coming into the land and taking over [Music] lord I pray God here this morning in my life and then the life Lord no doubt of many others we can say Lord [Music] I'm still growing I want you to continue to move in my life [Music] continue to spread forth your power in my
