to yes I learn to defend yes Lord Jesus praise the Lord amen say Amen to that amen we we are what we are by the grace of God Amen and it's truly his word that has made us what we are it's brought out of our Lives what he knew lay there the whole time and through all the tests and trials you know there's really there's no other way that we could be molded more In His Image than through the tests and trials that he permits us to go through the the hearing of the word the ministry of the word is so important to our lives it it brings God brings birth he brings Deliverance he'll bring healing and he'll bring encouragement you know sometimes when we walk in here we would love to be where we walk out of here the trial's gone but instead we walk in and God just encourages and said hey before the foundation of the world you were in my mind your your destiny is certain right and it and it helps us to get our eyes just to look to him that through the midst of it amen amen that's that that to me is what's so precious I found that true very many times how that God just take maybe a text and uh I've watched him do it and it just come right down and I think my I I know it this is my this is my moment right here this is God speaking to my heart the child didn't go away but he gave me strength Amen to go through it because when it all comes when it all comes out at the end of it it's going to be more of him and less of us and really there could be no other way and so amen we sing that song with a real revelation there amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord is't it amen we um I'm going to let you have your seats here just for a moment because we have a uh special guest he was here last weekend and uh then we had to wait for everything to kind of get lined up and good to also to have um Chuck and Joanne here with us as well uh brother joshu's parents and um so we are so thankful amen for little Steven amen as God has [Applause] given so we want to uh just dedicate him to the Lord here just at this time and we know that that's that's exactly what the Lord had given us in his word to do remember when the disciples you know they they were bringing the little children and the disciples don't don't don't bother don't trouble and and Jesus would take that and even express of what it must be like for us to enter into the kingdom of God and the kingdom of heaven and so he would speak of that and say suffer them not to come unto me for such amen is the kingdom amen so we uh we realize that what we are doing God has entrusted that life to us uh and God knew all of these things how he could so he would order and bring everything and our paths across and God so ordered that and I always go back to that moment of where with Samson and uh and his his father uh manoah and his wife when they asked the Lord uh you show us what we must do on how to raise this child because God knows the order that he has for our lives and you know we we realize that we and ourselves we have a part to play even as parents to do our part that what God would give us as as uh the wisdom and the knowledge but I'm glad he gives it and then he's the one that directs it he's the one that sees them all the way through if we just do just do our part to look to him then God himself will continue to watch over that life just like Moses was watched over in denal is that right he was watched over until it came to that moment for that purpose and and so I think of that's what a wonderful thing it is to be able to come and to just uh dedicate the life that God has given and dedicate it back to him and with that dedication it's a real expression that Lord I I completely am committed to raising this child in the admonition of the Lord I'm committed to that lord it's it's very important so we just want to um take this opportunity and we'd like to dedicate little Steven I've only saw him by picture but I've heard that he's just a miniature joshu no shock right so maybe if we can play that song sister Susanna bring them in maybe Paul sing a course of that and man the Andersons if you like come on up [Music] all to [Music] Jes man is he a cutie can I hold him oh man you you're going to have to really get you oh no no now now I'm seeing joshu it's okay let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord is my brother and sisters stand here Lord with a life a precious life that you have given to them Lord now they stand here Lord with a consecration in their hearts and lives Lord to place him back into your hands and that you would just Lord lead and guide them Lord through every step of the way Lord and I pray that God may your hand always rest upon little Steven's life keeping his heart Lord tender toward you and father that Lord when he would come into that moment and that that time that age oh God that his heart being tender Lord would just be so fully given over to you and that you would take him on Lord I pray Lord you know what you have and the purpose Lord for this child and we just ask God that as you were Lord over that little Arc that Moses mother constructed God May the angels of God encamp around his life Lord at all times we pray God May the Holy Spirit Lord the angel of the lord always be near for that Lord that is your promise Lord that the angel of the Lord encampeth around about them that fear thee Lord and love thee father we ask Lord God that you would just continue to bless brother joshu and sister Sharon Lord Lord God I thinkk of the Andersons Lord they Lord as they stand here Lord and father what a real meaning they have Lord to brother joshu I know and also to sister Sharon I pray you would bless them as well oh God lord we just Lord commit little Steven his life back into your hands now and we want to say thank you Lord thank you Father in the name of Jesus Christ amen I'll tell you look at that he is all [Music] content well I tell you he is a QD make sure you show him where my office is at oh he gets a little bigger we'll find out what kind of candy he likes hey amen let's just stand and uh I want to go right into the scriptures if you would turn to Ruth chapter 3 and I have kind of a lengthy portion of reading here this morning that I want to read from and just to kind of just draw as a background for what we will uh look into here I want to go to you to Ruth chapter 3 and verse one Amen in verse one of Ruth 3 it says then Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall I not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee and now is not Boaz of our Kindred with whose maidens thou was behold he went with barley tonight in the threshing floor wash thyself now want you to notice these verses we'll pick them up here in a little bit wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy reignment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking and it shall be when he lith down that thou shalt Mark the place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what Thou shalt do and she said unto her all that thou sayest unto me I will do that's my desire Lord sir and she went down unto the floor did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her and when baz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the Heap of corn this is speaking of the fullness of Christ and she came softly and and uncovered his feet and laid her down and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who are thou and she answered I am Ruth thine handmade spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art a near Kinsman and and he said blessed be thou of the Lord my daughter for thou has showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning in as much as thou follow us not the young men whether poor or Rich and now my my daughter fear not I will do to thee all that thou requirest for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman and now it is true that I am thy near Kinsman how be it there is a Kinsman nearer than i t this night and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform unto thee the part of a Kinsman well let him do the kinsman's part but if he will not do the part of a Kinsman to thee then will I do the part of a kins to thee as the Lord liveth lie down unto the morning and verse 14 and she lay at his feet until the morning and she rose up before one could know another and he said let it not be known that a woman came into the floor amen may the Lord just add the blessing to the reading of the word you may have your seats if you would also turn uh to the Book of Revelations and I'd like to read out of Revelations chapter 3 I just want to read this just for a a background and a context of what we will speak on here this morning we know we're living in the lady oan age we know that these were churches in Asia Minor but God used the characteristics that was there and it became prophecy for the ages that would come which is known as that of the the fullness of the Gentiles or the the seven Church ages where remember the Jews they rejected the Messiah and when they rejected him remember that that was all in the plan of God that then he himself would turn and take a bride from the Gentiles for his name's sake it was all in God's plan but God could not make them reject him but they were blinded Paul picks this up in the Book of Romans they were blinded for our sake so it wasn't anything that we were better people as a matter of fact we you know the scriptures are very clear we were just heathen we we you know we we were just that way but we had no promise of covenants or anything like that Paul deals with that but all the way through the Old Testament God had laid all of this in little parts that was through there and you know the Jews they knew this but you see they didn't the understanding did not break upon them for this for certain scriptures that would pertain to you and I because we were hidden in Christ just as Eve when she was hidden in Adam that's right is that right and just as Joseph was rejected of his Brethren during that time of rejection remember he was given a gentile bride and when the Gentile bride was placed into the palace then his Brethren came and that's when he made himself known to his Brethren that's all a type of Christ speaking of how Christ himself would take unto himself a people for his name's sake and then there is a returning remember Paul tells us this in Romans there'll be a returning back to the Jews but we the Gentile bride will not be on the scene she will be taken in Rapture Before He makes himself known to the Jews is that right they receive their two witnesses Revelations 11 that that of the spirit of Elijah and Moses that will Point them to the law to the prophet pH and through that as they're as they're making known what the prophets and law were speaking of it will Point them away from The Keeping of traditions to the true atonement is everybody with me which is Christ that's who we're pointed to you've not been pointed to a church because a church cannot atone for you but we have been pointed to Jesus Christ and so that's where they'll be called from all of the rituals and traditions and they'll be pointed to him and it will be the same message of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that they will be anointed to speak to the Jews and as the Jews themselves are sealed away he'll slip away from the wedding supper where we're at he'll slip away come down make himself known to his Brethren He makes himself known then then there's a slipping back up and then we return with him in Revelations 19 and you know they the 144 they seal their testimony give their life but then then Here Comes Armageddon then after Armageddon this is then when the Millennium sets in then from the Millennium into the new home future home what a future we have to look forward to so we're living in this hour and it's important to know where we're living you know it's like we you and I have both been in places sometimes you can have a map and you need to know okay where am I right now you know when someone says I you know you've had people that called you and said I'm lost you say where are you I don't know oh boy we're in trouble so it's always helpful to find a point of origin where you at we we know where you need to get to but do you know where you're at and that's where the word of God it always comes to let us see where we are aten now let me just say this very clearly to you the word will never reveal a downward path to you it doesn't matter if you or I have stumbled or we fail it'll never reveal a downward path but the word of God will always reveal an upward path is that right so now let's read here in in in the lady oan Church age in in verse 14 and unto the angel of the Church of the lady oans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou are neither cold nor hot I would that thou W cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked the the key is they don't know it and the reason they don't know it God is present and this message this what I'm reading becomes the very unction of what all the message is it's a preparation to come out of the systems of man it's to is to break away all the veils and the obscurities because when we can see Christ for who he really is and recognize that that he who was is here right right now and then it brings us to being conscious of God and when we're conscious of God then we can become conscious of our own lives this is a sad state that I'm reading here because this is an age that is enriched with theology is enriched with religion enriched with tradition enriched with uh uh churches enriched with with all of that but yet when it all comes down to it at the end of the day the holy spirit is saying you you're not aware but Thou Art wretched miserable poor blind and naked right in other words what is this they're not covered with the true Garment of the word and that Garment of the word is his spirit is his blood that takes away any trace of the first birth it's where the New Birth has set into our life man cannot produce that it's a sovereign Act of almighty God where our faith accepts what he has already done and provided for us notice I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire never was a character like him that thou mayest be rich in white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see now watch this as many as I love he didn't say as many as love me as many as I love where does his love stem from Clear from the foundation of the world Revelations 13:8 said he was the lamb slain from the foundation of the world Isaiah being a prophet is caught up to see and hear what God has already spoken this is why Isaiah could speak as though in Isaiah 53 it's already happened he was wounded right it's not something that you know he will be no no he was so he's already seeing it it's a finished work before there was ever a devil before there was ever any unbelief the lamb had already spoke before any situation before any condition before no matter what we would have been entwined in the lamb was already slain from the mind of God hallelujah notice in verse in verse 19 so as many as I love this is this is his love being expressed I rebuke and chasen and be zelus therefore and repent aren't you thankful for the love of God behold I stand stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into to him and will suck with him and he with me remember here he is outside of the church the church that claims to be worshiping him loving him and yet he's been put out of the church because he is the word it's his presence it's his life it's his nature he's been put out so here he is standing and he's moving upon the hearts of individuals that's why this our walk with God is an individual Affair yes it is to him that overcometh oh my this is where we want to go to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne in my domain even as I also overcome and am sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith un to the churches brother Brian switch it over for me please there we go this is what I'd like to speak to you here this morning on this thought taking that from Ruth and then coming here into Revelations and I'd like to speak on this this morning on from his feet to his throne and I I don't mean to interrupt here but I just want to admonish you about the parking lot uh you know next Sunday we won't be meeting here we'll be meeting at the Heritage Presbyterian Church Fellowship Hall all of that has been s out in the email we also we'll have service and then we'll have a fellowship dinner uh following uh the service there and uh also I ask you just to um check um check your email your Instagram you know to Facebook um also there'll be texts that will go out and I I'm not going to try to send everybody a text but it's just kind of like what we did the other day because I'm sure I'll leave somebody out I I but it what what helps is that I can hit just a few and I just tell you keep passing it on and if we duplicate it or whatever more you know um well we I think it'd be better to duplicate it than not to get it at all so uh we want to I want to um just remind you of that right there just be on the lookout and Lord willing just um keep that in prayer tomorrow is where they should start tomorrow and and uh Tuesday and um so then we hopefully have pictures next Sunday we'll try to keep you updated with pictures and things and all that's going on there but I I'm just I want to say I'm thankful to the Lord I really am I I got to thinking a little bit of what brother uh David when he was uh ministering here one I tell you um that was wonderful when brother Isaac was here on Sunday that was wonderful and um God just knows what he's doing in season God has everything lined up you know and um then when Brother David when he was you know speaking of that because God not only providing for a spiritually which is the most important thing but you know what God has has made the provision his word if we put him first he said I'll take care of everything else and I'm I'm thankful to God that that's that's exactly what what he has been doing uh so if you would like to help out with your check book you can open it up and we'll but we would like to continue you know you if you as you continue to give just write on the envelope uh you know that it's going towards the project and um then we'll kind of go from there also um my Uncle Bobby um we got we had been praying for him and we went there a couple times this week and then yesterday uh not yesterday um Friday at midday I took a break from here and ran over there and we went in and and we just had prayer with him once again just just speaking to the family and uh just um standing there with him at that point in time they were actually going to move him even to a further um intensive of care which was more or less for the ne neurological part uh because the amount of seizures he was having but you know I got a text yesterday that when my aunt got there in the morning they already were moving him out of intensive care completely said I got here his eyes was open and you know and and so he's he's got he has the paralysis there on the right side from that stroke broke and uh so you just keep him in prayer and um I'm just certainly you know uh just been praying for God's mercy uh you know upon it and just been able to talk to him and just Express you know my heart Express the gospel and so we just I asked you just continue to keep in prayer that to me was a great thing of What the Lord Has Done because they they recognized that they said this was the prayers that turned this around and so I just ask if you would continue I know we all have needs and if you would continue to keep him in prayer amen the number one thing that my desire is is sure I want to see him well but the one thing that my desire is is Lord that soul and that's where when I got the news last Friday evening and I got away in my room down at the men's meeting that's what I prayed I said God I'm asking you for your mercies for that life so if you would just I know you have been praying and I just wanted to give you an update on that and um but let's let's look at this here a little bit here this morning on from his feet to his throne because knowing there's always a place and a beginning of where that we uh will start from Even in our journey and serving the lord and um I want you to see that um as we go through this here and we're looking at it um when we look at this promise that we have it says to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne this this is the promise that the mother of the sons of Zebedee asked about and the Lord Jesus said at that time he says well I I can't do that it's already given right it's already been given where from the mind of God and so but but then he's asked the question can uh can you drink the cup that I I drink and be baptized with with that which I am baptized with we can he said you you shall be indeed so to recognize that all the way down through the ages there's been a bride that's being built all the way down through the ages to to walk with God and is an absolute reflection of the word of God and I'm just going to say it like this every age has a promise to it and it's an A and that promise and that word is to the Overcomer now there's no way to overcome unless you have battles right and the first battle is really our own will and you know what that battle it continues to go down we us continuing to lay down our own will but thank God for the holy spirit that comes in our life that gives us a greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world that gives us a strength to continue to lay our lives down at his feet and so we recognize I want you to notice how brother Bram says this here he says in reference to this this particular uh uh uh scripture he says there will not be one person who will set in the Throne of the Lord Jesus Christ unless he has been living that word now watch watch how he says this your prayers your fastings your repentances no matter what you present to God that's what's key no matter what you or I present to God none of that will gain you the privilege of sitting in that Throne it will only be granted only to the word bride wow now he says as the Throne of the king is shared with the king the queen because she is United to him how how are we United to Christ who is the word how do we become United is it merely just us carrying the Bible is it merely no because this can this is almost like false teeth you can take it out and put it down but there's got to come a real uniting and the only way there can be a real uniting is the Bible tells us is by the Holy Spirit which it says in the Book of John that there are three that agree in the earth water blood and spirit and the and then there are three that are one the Father the word and the spirit so in order to be a part of the word we must have the word in US it must be the holy spirit inside of us so you know what that does it takes it away from my efforts of going through the fields and gleaning to where now his life inside of me and it's him bringing forth himself through my lifeall it's no longer your works or my works now you know as I was speaking to a person here just just uh uh uh this past week and and you know they they made a statement to me and said oh yeah I I realize you know you you really don't have to go to church I said no no no no I said that's not what I'm saying I said what I'm saying as I said is that this is the scripture forsake not to assemble ourselves together as the manner of some I said but going to church will not save you right right it won't save you Judas was in church it didn't save him is that right but going to church it has its part but what is the reason that was my question them what's the reason why do you go to church what's the purpose behind it the real purpose behind it should be because his grace has been expressed to my life and in devotion and appreciation of that Grace this is why I do what I do because I just want to love him more I want to draw closer to him it's an appreciation not out of us trying to obtain merits or stars on a calendar where we get to the other side and we're standing there and he says you know what you got 15 gold stars you only got 10 gold stars we cannot work our way into the kingdom of God is that right Cain tried that he couldn't work his way in had a beautiful offering but God refused it because it was the works of his own hands so the only thing can be accepted is what he has provided and there's a people there's a bride of Christ upon this Earth that just like Esther where the rest of the women that went through and they said we'll take this and we'll take that and what no we don't want that we'll take this what you know they they went around and they selected just certain attributes that they wanted it's much like the religious world of this day all they want is oh I I just want an attribute well you can't get married to someone just because you're like one attribute you have to fall in love with them their entire character it's not enough to say well I'm going to marry I'm not going no no not the other attributes I just want to marry the attribute of Grace he can't do that it's it's when we stand here in Union it's because I I want to fully marry and give myself to him who is the word and that's who's standing in our midst that's who has revealed himself in this hour is the word himself and this is the prophecy of this hour Hallelujah God has declared a bridegroom call through the word to call upon the hearts of a people that he for ordained from the foundation of the world let him that ha an ear hear what the Spirit sayith to the churches this is the hour let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has comeu because she's United to him so only they who are of that word even as he is of that word will share that Throne right now as we look at this here I want to just say it in this way God builds from the feed up think of where Ruth was instructed to go no she was not instructed to go lay down at his midsection do do not go lay down above his head because it can't be you above the word that's that's good but there's a reason all of the signification of the approach yeah right remember in order for this inheritance to come which is there resting in the inheritance of a Limon there's got to be the right approach that would release this through that of the Kinsman and she can't just come any old way you see this is how the word is it's not it's not something we just it's just a shot in the dark there's a Precision amen God is so he wants you and I to know the way so clearly that he lays it out he makes it so clear and let me just tell you something the clarity of his way is not five steps to be a happier Grump the five steps to be a better you that's not it he reveals himself he said I am the way the truth and the life and he made a promise today that I will show thee show thee reveal uncover to thee the path of Life how does he do it by revealing himself I am your way where you can't see a way out of your life or your first birth or the situation you're in or how am I going to make it through this trial I am your way I am the path out that's so good God builds from the feet up but remember Nebuchadnezzar's Vision this was the Gentile it was topped down it was all it was it was it was there from the gold and come all the way down through all of the parts of of the arms of silver medial persan and then down through the his belly and his thighs of brass and then legs of iron and his feet part of iron and part of clay notice such such carefulness has been given to the head but the feet which is a foundation which is what matters but that iron that iron notice how it it goes through that of the feet we understand that that that's a eastern and western hemisphere we saw that we didn't I wasn't alive then but to see the two big toes of Eisenhower and kusf at the UN we see where we're at we're not wondering where are we at right now are we in the ankle or are we in the upper part of the foot we're down to the toes right now but in these toes right here remember this this iron and Clay how did that get that iron clay brother BR when labor on that that's from that interm Maring and breaking apart the strength and and what a what a feebleness it is of clay and and iron it can't hold together it can't bind together it's a it's you don't lay a foundation that way that's why Jesus said do not build upon sand right but build upon the rock because storms no matter who we are we're not exempt from storms storms are going to come right just because we are believers and and and and as we stand professing to be the Bride of Jesus Christ we're not exempt from trials we're not exempt from suffering as a matter of fact there is suffering that is to come our way but remember there's got to be something that's greater there than our resolved in our DNA there's got to be an anchor a rock a revelation that when all hell is turned loose against you there's something on the inside that holds you you say what is that that's a real Firm Foundation like Paul said I have laid the foundation that Foundation is Jesus Christ God laid it by descending down paying the price and establishing it that you and I might become him you know the Lord Jesus he mentioned the same anointing that was a member the disciples hey these disciples they weren't Gentiles but they were under the anointing see the spirit the spirit that gets around let me just say this to you we're not you it's no such thing as saying well I tell you the spirits don't bother me no we're we we're listen they're all around they're all around we can feel the influence of the angels of God that are here but let me just tell you something all of those demon Spirits have been released that was there sealed up in Revelations 9 right is that right they they've been released and then here we're standing in in a time in an hour where even those disciples begin to well who's going to be the chief one and who's going to be the head and who's going to be the top guy and who's that Spirit was all around they weren't Gentiles but that Spirit was there that's where it goes to show you and I that here we are living in Christ but oh this is why Paul could say if you live in the spirit walk in the spirit because why all of these evil spirits are all around that would want to pull you this way and pull you that way but walk in the spirit come on friends we've had to stand there and say God forgive me for that elevated thought forgive me for this for forgive me Lord for the entertaining that wrong thought or you know man might be a little bit better here or it might need God brings us to that place to real wait a minute those are spirits that are trying to get around the Bible tells us clearly before honor is humility am amen and this all begins with the right approach and I want you to notice this in Isaiah chapter 6 The Bible says in the hour that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it the seraphim each one had six wings with Twain he covered his face and with Twain he covered his feet and with Twain he did fly and one cried to another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory now I want you to notice this how brother BR would go over this over and over taking this because this is the approach think of it in this hour Uzziah Isaiah had been looking to Uzziah and Uzziah had started off as a great man the Bible tells us he strengthened himself he God gave him many victories and many battles but he got to a place to where when he felt like he could do whatever he wanted to do and it didn't matter he even come to a place that he was going to step in to a calling that God had not had for his life that's right and you see he was going to he was going to offer up what the priests were called to author and notice with Isaiah when Isaiah saw this of how that this departure and then he was smitten with Leprosy well you know the leprosy itself was only became a sign of the condition of his heart you see many times this is why things that become visible outwardly are only manifestations of what is going on inwardly that's why a person can have cancer and all of a sudden they begin to see symptoms showing up here and yet it can be there right there in their body for a period of time why then the outside begins to show it up let me just say it like this if that will take place with cancer if that'll take place with these other things how much more will it take place when the spirit of God has steep into the control tower of the heart of man and the Judgment seat is back in the heart of man how much greater is it to see Christ himself coming more into view into view into view like Solomon told the bride he said it is a day I see thee as a day that is shining brighter and brighter and brighter and brigher amen it was reverence notice coming in when Isaiah he was looking at Uzziah and now when the when the churches have made their decisions and and men have made their decisions and we don't need that no more and our schools have told us we don't need that well I'm telling you we still need Jesus amen and the Bible said he still the same yesterday today and forever God never entrusted it to man that man would try to figure it out that's why there was the message like we looked at in the Book of Judges every man did what was right in his own sight well I reckon this I figure this I I I you know I believe God does this and I think no no we don't have to wonder God's word has been set before us and the Bible said let every man's word be a lie and let God's word be the truth amen so if there's anything that speaks contrary to the word of God it's not of God it's a false spirit I don't care if it takes a quote out of the message of the hour and said well you know that only pertained to brother brandom and brandom Tabernacle that's not the spirit of [Music] God that's the [Music] truth reverence humility and action notice here's the covering remember Ruth has been instructed by Naomi how to approach him that's true you wash yourself anoint yourself and put put your best garment on it's an approach see this is the covering because remember Ruth is not coming with wrongful intentions right her motives are pure amen this is where the spirit of God draws upon this is what's important with every promise of God from the Holy Spirit to on and on and on is what are the motives and objectives what's the reason remember Simon the Sorcerer wanted the Holy Ghost but he didn't want it for the right reason he wanted it so that he might profit and what did Peter discernment by the spirit of God said bitterness has filled your soul he was wanting it for the advancement of Simon but God's not here to advance any man's Kingdom the holy spirit is given that the kingdom of God might be Advanced through our lives so notice this approach here you know here that that sheriam you know covered his face reverence that's the first approach then covering his feet with humility then he can go into action and you see what God was doing was showing Isaiah how he prepares his servants and how a prepared servant must be reverent humble and in action the prophet says if you uncover your face if you uncover your feet your action isn't going to do no good because you're stirred wrong now let's look at the woman at the well here she stands cuz this same same approach has been all the way through scriptures I'm just going to take a couple examples when she stands here coming to the well little does she know her life what she's long for she's going to find her answer or if I can say it this way the answer is finding her she's buried beneath being married multiple times she's buried beneath darkness and Blackness and void but there's a seed down there Hallelujah there's something down there that the Pharisees and nobody else would give her the time of day but yet for her when the word begins to approach her and said go find your H go bring your husband and she said I have no husband and the word said your confession is true see she's coming she's getting her confession she didn't pull back and said wait a minute wait wait wait wait you're not touching my life that way I'll just take a little bit of Grace I don't want that don't be dealing in my life no but what happened when the word spoke to her then she confessed what the word had said was true and then in reverence she says sir I perceive thou art a prophet see him manifesting himself had brought forth those wings to cover her faith her face in reverence Hallelujah glory and as he begins to speak to her life and minister to her heart she says in humility now here she is covering her feet saying I know that when Messiah cometh he will tell us these things she had a question in her life notice she had come to a place of reverence to ask the word the questions about her life let me tell you something you can ask everybody on Facebook you can put all them kind I don't know what the thing is now they call them survey monkeys that's what the things they used to make us do you could put a survey out about your life and you'll get a million different responses but if you'll just get in the presence of God the Bible is true Jeremiah 29 I know the plans that I have laid for you to bring you to an expected end glory be to God we don't have to stumble our way through life spiritually or naturally we can walk with God that gives me real Comfort I know when Messiah cometh he'll tell us these things that's humility and soon as he made the statement I'm he no resistance she went into action those wings that covered those feet and now the other set of wings begin to put her in action she was put into action by the word not only uncovering her life confession had come and now the humility of what God himself was revealing to her it put her in action to wear her testimony think about it friends she lived a life that would been secluding and trying to hide this and hide that and hide this and cover this up but notice that this is why I chose it was more than a natural event there was a super natural happening that took place in her life and the supernatural accompanied her life that when she testified there was something behind her voice that said come see a man amen hallelujah she went into action yes is that right am well now we find the same thing with Ruth Ruth comes in reverence yes she washes herself you and I have provision you see have provision to wash ourselves by the water but how do I wash Myself by just standing under the word that's what it is just simply standing under the word just saying Lord I present myself Lord I Give Myself washing no this is what she had to do it wasn't when you get to B house he's going to do this but you have access to this wash thyself and anoint thyself and put on the right garment no you can go through scripture any any time it came time for someone to appear in their moment Joseph was taken out of prison cleaned up shaved and a new garment put on him before Esther went into the king the Bible said she didn't take anything but what hagy the king's Chamberlain required Esther said I'm not going to choose from the value menu of what character attributes that I want I want all of a hezus because remember vashy had rejected him and he put her away is that right but here is Esther and Esther said you know what the king likes you know what the king likes well the king loves uh the washing of Water by the word the king likes the anointment with those oils that'll take all the stench out of your past and and the King loves when we walk in with the garments that he has provided not what you brought in but what he has provided for you you understand in every one of these events it's not us doing it it's us taking what he has provided that's where Ruth is at and Ruth herself here's what she says this reverence of coming in her approach to move within that way and then she says all that all that you've said to do that's what I'm going to do that's humility right you know what that means Ruth yeah I think I know what it means I know I know it's going to mean a lot I know it can be very disgraceful cuz women don't go down into that threshing floor right true but she wasn't going down in there for an affair and they didn't have an affair down there she was going down there to make a claim on him as her Kinsman I can't get into this today but she did not go down there with a victim mentality that's oh things have happened to me this is oh so bad I mean if you don't do that I don't know that's not she wouldn't have got nowhere you see we don't get anywhere if we go as though it's somebody else's fault and I'm in this situation because of this and I'm in God don't move it all on that we've got to recognize we need his grace in all things she went there to make a claim on him you're a near Kinsman you're the one that can take me from the weary fields of G meaning and bring Rest In My Soul you're the one that can tie me back into my inheritance you're the one that can raise up seed to my dead husband that can raise up to the inheritance of the lemon that's who you are that's who I know you to be and that's why I'm here Ruth are you here for an anointing I'm not here for an anointing are you here for a gift I'm not here for a gift I just want you amen yes and she went down the Bible says into the floor and did according to her mother-in-law there was action yes you see every decision Ruth made a decision and there we could read in chapter one but Ruth kept on making decisions every day every moment was a time of decision right you know I think of brother Aon when you were praying and I was hearing it back there there are times that no doubt Ruth said man I've back's tired from me I mean she was thankful for the handfuls of purpose she was thankful for what she was gleaning but remember she had to beat that out she didn't put it in a machine and it did it for her right she had to do that that was all testing the Bible said whosoever cometh to God must be tested and tried she would being intested not only with that but with the young men and there she was being tested and God allowed that period of testing let me just tell you something God's not afraid of his word being tested he's not afraid of it because you know why his word Can't Fail now you or I may have failed and you know you may have made a start and then you drop off and but you see if you're part of the word the word will find you and bring you right back to where you fell off and there is a repentance and saying Lord I'm ready to go on because you recognize what repentance is is to recognize that you didn't lead me astray I got off in my own way and Grace is given to bring us back and keep moving us on because the word cannot be defeated amen thanks be to God so every decision we make should lead us or Draw us closer to him that's what that's what when the prophet would speak this of of Ruth that that he talks about how that God is looking for individuals that would be dedicated making a clean cut consecration for themselves and and looking to him and Ruth being asked to do something that would be so disgraceful but she was willing because she had made her decision let me just say this going to Calvary was not all of a sudden an event that just happened it started out daily little by little so good was one Calvary after another Cal that's right you know why because that's where you and I would be brought to Hallelujah even on our way from the feet to the throne is Calvary to another Calvary to what is the c dying to ourselves so so there in the Garden of Eden was was where the word was leading him to where here the promises was coming to that point of that Apex of where he himself would surrender his life as the Lamb of God that the spirit of God might be poured out upon you and I it was leading him to that place it was a place of real Sur surrender in humility she was told put these garments on you cover yourself up not don't take things off cover yourself up you see that's why brother BR says in this day he says how contrary to the day we're living in when they want to take things off they don't want the word they don't want they I don't want this I don't want that on my life God don't now God just looks on the heart he does you're exactly right he looks on the heart and the Heart what he sees is that's why he can look in the heart and the heart says I really don't want to do this but when the heart can say yes Lord amen yes Lord that's that you see when the heart that's the real battle the battle's not here there is a Battle Ground of the mind but the real where the real battle is that needs to be stopped is right there in the heart then it'll come then everything else it'll take care of itself and the things start taking place you don't have to pluck the leaves off your old leaves fall off and new leaves come forth why because it's beginning at the feet amen is so good oh my we want to we want to cover ourselves we want to Mark what he's done for us notice not at his feet not at his head but at his feet that spoke of an unworthiness that we would be able to lay down there and die to ourselves that's good and then begin to take orders from the word laying down our will to take up his will that's that's that's what the grace of God is given to us because notice when it speaks of him being the Lamb of God in Isaiah 53 it said as a lamb who is Led dumb before her shearers not his it showed that he where she was in him then he would be in her it would be Christ in you the hope of glory and us as the Lambs as the Sheep of God yield building our lives and things are being shaved off of Our Lives that's so good yes oh my willing to Mark the place right so this uncovering the uncovering of his feet what that speaks of is is an act of total submission see remember this is an Eastern book yeah that's good good point it's an Eastern book what that meant was it's an act of total submission yeah when she comes remember she says who is there I'm Ruth thine handmaid I'm thy servant that's what laying at the feet that this is what it also symbolized is that in the it was understood in the role of a servant to lay at your Master's feet and be ready for any command of the master so when when Naomi told her lay down at his feet she was telling Ruth come to him in a totally humble submissive way that's beautiful yes sir is that right yep now think about this when she moved there in the floor there was nobody else there right I'm not talking about there were other men but here she comes into the threshing floor you know what she's doing she is exposing herself to disgrace you let me let me tell you you think of the thoughts that wasn't going through her mind already hey look you already know you don't got a bad a good track record you're a moabit need I remind you how your family of the moabites came about need I remind you there's a curse you think she didn't have them thoughts oh brother Samuel that's not possible you can read in the book of Philippians and Paul himself will address to you and I that the Mind battles he had to overcome I have learned to forget those things which are behind me in other words I'm I'm not letting that image of seeing Steven and hearing what he said I'm not going to let I'm not going to let the enemy use that to torment me any longer I've learned to take God's grace and accept it not because I'm worthy but because he said so let me tell you you and I we could go through and do a million pentanes you could crawl your knees till they bleed and it'll never satisfy but by faith you can accept what he's already done for you he paid for your past present and future sins you have to accept it and apply it to your life if I can say it like this he's already forgiven you you have to take his forgiveness and forgive yourself by the power of his [Applause] forgiveness this is where she exposed herself and this is why that the real Church of the Living God has exposed herself to the prophet said to public persecution by taking God at his word we have come to him that is the word oh I see you're one of them Christian believer disciple of Christ no no no you're a fanatic fanatic when can we get so when when can we get so overboard about Jesus I understand there's been some nuts that's had a big Kool-Aid bowl and put Kool-Aid and let's all sing Kumbaya and drink Kool-Aid there's always been nuts that's right that's good come on Friends there's always been nuts around that ain't what I'm talking about I'm talking about a real Unity with the word of God when God touches your life and begin to deal with your life I'm only preaching from my experience but when he got a hold of my life I couldn't get enough of him I still can't get enough of him there's times like you would pray that my flesh will say I don't feel like getting up I don't even really feel like going maybe I'm in the midst of a trial I don't feel like going but there's something in me that knows if I can just get in his presence if I can just get to the threshing floor he will separate me from me hallah because my feelings is not me my real reality is I'm a part of him I've always been a part of him and it's the spirit of God the word that draws me closer flesh profited nothing Hallelujah but the spirit giveth life so you see when we look at this here she had to come she had to Mark the place she had to crawl up in the secret of the night and mark the place and then baz sitting by the a full heap of corn not a not a little Heap this was the fullness the fullness of Christ once again the full manifestation of Jesus Christ in him dwelleth all the godhead bodily is that right the full heap of corn not just a portion the Bible promised us in Joel chapter 2 that that the threshing floors would overflow we're not living in the time of barely enough we don't got barely enough there's more than enough sometimes we might feel like I don't know I can make the next step but you've got more than [Applause] enough greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world so we have to mark marking that place marking the place and here comes in humility that marking of the place it deals deals with where he laid down that talking about Calvary where he laid down I that's where it comes to where he laid his life down what he did for you and I just as I was talking to someone the other day and I mentioned I was talking some things and I said you know good people I said but if goodness is all that was required Calvary was not needed Nicodemus was a good man but he needed he needed to meet Jesus Christ there had to be a Calvary where the sin debt would be settled once and for all because every one of us were born with sexual polluted blood but God came down and created both cell and blood cell he didn't borrow an egg from Mary what would you have God do in another act but God didn't borrow from the human race but he's the great Creator he created a body for for himself he created a tabernacle that he might come down and shed his blood and then through his life come back in and mow his image in our lives you know what he did the highest of highest this is one who was higher than the head of gold the king of glory said I'm going to come down among my subjects I want the fellowship that I had with my thoughts before the foundation of the world there's got to be a way made back I am that way and he who was higher than the highest Hallelujah came down and took upon the lowest of lows where a footwash flunky was even above him he didn't even have a bed to lay his head is that right he showed real humility what was he doing marking the place hallu this is why no one can truly really look at Calvary and come out with a stuffed shirt when you come up with Calvary when you really look at and I know sometimes remember it's like that picture that man was looking at it in museum and he was looking at that picture and he looked at the curator and he said I don't see nothing the cator said no no you're looking at it wrong well how am I looking at it wrong he said you got to get down on your knees and look up and when he got down on his knees and looked up oh it struck him he saw it you see the Holy Spirit he's the one not a man he's the one who directs you and I so we might look at it in the right angle to recognize it's no goodness that you or I could ever do it's not what I could do listen even in my walk with God right now I'm not presenting my Works to him but it's his righteousness living out through our lives amen I love him I want to serve him I want to I want to be a better Soldier I want to be a better Christian I want to love him more is that right yes sir but as it starts with humility yes that's what Jesus said and I want to can kind of turn this here where Jesus when he said except you be converted and come as a little child God always builds I'm kind of moving here a little bit because of my time God builds from the feet up remember our thought from his feet to his throne that is so it's a journey yes it is every one of us it has to start with a real genuine birth that comes by faith in the word of God are you hearing me there there're in no other way it's like this prayer lines don't give it altars don't give it hands don't give it it's faith that releases the promise of God because if it's based on man or man's hand then it can fall away come on friends everything is by faith it ain't about how forceful the men oh that Minister really pray it doesn't matter he could pray underneath his breath right one time I was at the camp and the Youth Camp I still had one more service to preach and I I called brother Daniel Andy I said look you ask what the need is and I'm going to pray but I'm going to pray in my heart because I got one more service to go and I have no voice right now matter of fact that last voice and that last service I had a pile of those essential oil cough drops that somebody gave me you know the essential oils stand on one foot and it work I'm just EAS you know I I but those those actual those those those those I think those those cough drops actually helped me I kept on popping one in I just kind of took a teaching service but my point was this I didn't even pray out loud it ain't about how forceful we all look at we're all different I mean and not everybody preaches like me I Don't Preach like everybody else I don't want to preach like nobody else I just want to be what God has made me otherwise we're an impersonator and a hypocrite it don't matter about how loud it is but God hears Faith yes amen he couldn't hear blind bmus he didn't hear his voice it was faith it was not that woman's touch he felt it was a faith touch Hallelujah you hear me friends you see how how things want to take us away from what the real appropriated way is it's why the word comes is to build the spirit of God is to build our faith in the word it's a finished work what we have to do is accept it amen that's right glory be to God Amen Oh My Brother Sam you against prayer lines you know better than that I'm not against prayer lines I'm just trying to tell you that the only thing that will give you what you need is faith if you don't come through the prayer line with faith that's good that's good so it's all it's humility God builds from the way up brother BR says just get get humble and get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourselves before God so I want you to watch how we're I'm turning this here because we look at God working in our life in this stature of a perfect man all of these attributes well I don't know where there's my there's my thing all of these attributes Peter has already said God has already given us these see you know what these are these are like the clothes in your suitcase they're already in the seed it isn't oh I got to get Faith and then the next got to get the next one I got to get the next one I got oh now I've fallen off no no no no that that's that's error that's so that's error yeah this is where this is there it's Christ in us we come under the word for our day we are birthed by the word of God and then this is why the prophet said if you try to do this without being born again what does he say it's like trying to put black bird or peacock feathers and a black bird right you don't need to if you're a peacock peacock feathers come out right sister Mercy you remember about peacocks where you always us to live she can tell you about them so we're talking about some not mean-spirited peacocks here but these you know the these These are in us and you know what we don't just sit around drinking coffee and eating a donut and thinking you know what this a good morning for temperance no it's usually Temperance is selfcontrol it's when it requires situations right that maybe that tongue wants to get a little loose our feeling wants to go in a certain way but remember the overcoming route is from his feet to his throne that's so good it's always in this place remember where the Bible tells us the last scripture we read for our text she was instructed to lay at his feet right until the morning breaks lay at his feet that's how God builds his church he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church when you look at this of Moses think of how the prophet spoke of this here think of how that God would build his church how does God build his church by his word how did God when this pedestal the prophet would pick this out this pedestal and he would say before God put the image he first had a pedestal it had four layers Abraham Faith that's good is that right Isaac love next one Jacob he said anybody read Jacob's life got to believe in God's grace then the next pedestal that's on top is Joseph Perfection that's what God built his church on he built it on himself so it's word on top of word on top of word on top of word on top of word on top of word what is it going from his feet to the throne I'm not going backwards brother Joy we're not going downwards the word you say well I I'm looking at this in my life life but if you look at it through the word you'll not be looking down on yourself you'll see what the word is not pointing you to look down but you're taking a true inventory of your life and saying God that's the Mark I that's what I'm called to that's what I'm going to rise to Lord go God forgive me Lord give me Grace to rise to that because the word is never pulling you down the word never pulls you down the word is always drawing you up right the call the call come up hi come up hither come up a little higher a word bride she's received what he has given to her she's not taken not taking what she wants what she feels she's a word bride she's been made up from the feet Hallelujah where the ground where it went in the ground at the Nia Council then came back a little Sprout that just shall live by faith what was the basis Faith then it went from Faith moved on up into sanctification is that right moving on up into sanctification then moving on up you know into the baptism of the Holy Ghost there that's what we have there with the the mouth right Aza street right come on the gifts being restored back but but you know what the the bride is not just to be a mouth so God help me not just to be a mouth help me to have some ears here too is that right because they that have ears remember God gave an eye and the Bible said if thine eye be single then thy whole body shall be full of light huah and God provided an eye in this day a seer in this day a prophet in this day according to his word for what for light to come into the body amen because there is a time of unity but it would be a word that would call her to his feet in total submission not you better do this if you don't do this no the bride is not moved are you hearing me the bride is not moved by National Force right that's Israel are you with me that's Israel you better do this you better do that that we can take a lesson with that in our families too but it's moved that didn't well that's a separate thing me I could preach that cuz I don't want somebody to take that so Loosey good but the bride is moved by spiritual unction is that right can I have just a couple more minutes let me finish this thought here so we want to go on to Perfection this is very important from his feet because in our lives as we read this scripture where Paul is adonic let me just read it leave the prin let us leaving the prin of the doctrines of Christ let us go on to Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and this will we do if God permit in other words as it's necessary we're going to text these things but in order to go on to Perfection where God is calling us into position it's going to take a word that brings us into position okay we've had our start there's been repentance there's a baptism there's you know that of a resurrection of that yeah but we got to go on into Perfection so in going on into Perfection are you hearing me now God wants to remove us from being so wrapped up in our status of where we are am I Son of God am I a daughter of God do I have the Holy Spirit do I not see Satan's desire is to keep us wrapped in that when God's calling us to go on to Perfection you say well how do I know okay look at what you were before the word was applied to your life and look at what you are now the prophet said what were your desires before what are your desires now see that's what you're looking at your desires you you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you you you you you repented all that has went together what has that done that's been because his Spirit like that of Naomi speaking to Ruth has drawed up on your heart and brought us to that place right his presence it wasn't Peter going out and passing out P pamphlets about hey this is what you need to do he preached the word and as he preached the word the spirit of God was there to back it up and the spirit of God being there stirred up the hearts and said hey I want that you want what you want to be a preach know I want that that that what's being presented what was it it was Christ that was being presented Hallelujah stepen presented it to religious people and the Bible said they acted like dogs they nashed on him with their teeth is that right so with this of repentance sure every day we die daily right the Holy Spirit directs with things in our lives and we have to say Lord forgive me if if it's a real real true repentance is not do well God you understand no it's where remember with depth Lord just really pouring our hearts out before him and I wanted to say it in this way this is how let me read this quote to you this when you think of Our Lives God picking us up like clay out of the Potter's field anybody ever work with Clay when you were in school okay man I like when my kids they got Play-Doh I love that stuff now I didn't eat it little Aaron I didn't need it I'll be on that but you know you work with clay and I I'm no I'm no artist I don't even attempt to be that but uh I remember we'd have to work with it in school it wouldn't play though but you know they they'd have so much and they cut cut you off and then you could make something you know of course you we weren't working on a potter's wheel they actually had those places in some Dusky high school but I I didn't take that that depth of art because simply stick figures was Advanced for me but my point is is that uh that piece of clay it's taken with a purpose to become a vessel that's good and remember God has chosen you and I to be a vessel and he takes a hold of our life and he picks us up out of the clay all clay this is no different from anybody else and he picks us up out of that out of all out of the clay that's there and then he begins to mold us and put us on his will and work in us you know and they'll pound it and they're this and man it's it can be kind of rough but then as he starts working with it it's all coming to a place with a purpose in mind yeah that's good that this vessel would serve a purpose see God doesn't make a vessel like we did for our parents and we put our name on it what year we made it and then they put it on their night shelf over there oh Aaron made that when he was this oh a't that you know a't that PR dust it off Ain that one look at that and then they go back in memory that go God didn't listen let me tell you something God didn't call you to put you on a shelf God hasn't done what he's done in your life to put you on a shelf your experience is not something he's given you in your life to be on a Shelf right amen but you're called to be in service amen Now watch how the prophet brings this here God's choosing go to where I've got it highlighted there where it says his choosing is of his own he makes vessels unto honor and dishonor he says then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to His Image in their walk see from born of his Spirit now now it's time to walk hold my finger remember when they were just learning to walk we had to hold our finger and sometimes they fall and hey hey hey move that move that sharp edge right pretty soon you clear everything clear all is there any furniture in our house no no furniture is safe is there any electricity we can you no no none of it say right see God don't remove all the sharp tables no you don't remove all the sharp tables God don't put what I don't know what the name of that baby first or whatever it is putting star foam around edges and do but neither is God careless that's he's right there with us that's am like the prophet when he talked about Billy Paul walking into the kitchen and wanting a and wanting a bottle when after his mama had died he said Billy took off walking and he said you know he said he said we have one of them rugs that just sweep right from underneath you and he said I was right there by Billy and he said his foot caught that rug and he said up when his feet he said but I was there to grab him so he didn't fall how many times God has been there and he will be there to grab us hallelujah he rep reproves with all longsuffering and gentleness and mercy he chastens with nail scarred hands sometimes this Potter must take the vessel he's working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he desires true I don't know about you but these these These are portions of quotes and just so inspired to my heart the other night after we left the service and every every time I've read this quote I look at that and think because sometimes in our minds we can look back on it and we think so is he taking the whole vessel and just completely smashing the whole vessel after after he's already my life I've been born of his Spirit no that's not what the prophet is saying there are some areas of our life to where God has to take us down to the feet and he says within this right here as he's building he's working remember he's building from that foundation stone on the inside and God has to work with things in our life and sometimes break it down to a place that he can build it to where he wants but you know what I'm in his hands I'm on his will amen he's in my life I'm in him he's working in my life he's there molding and shaping my character and he permits the test and trials to shape me and to mold me and to bring me just exactly to where he would have me to be and where he has you to be yes sir every work that God does he works from the foundation yeah it's just like in our lives remember when brother Boaz was here and he was ministering on that that sometimes we we we we don't real why am I why is this coming out why is this almost like this comes by and that's the reaction it's not about other people no that's right oh come on now come on not about other people it's like why what what is that that's what we need to say Lord help me you see that's why God allows that God doesn't allow when things like that happen am I the only one no when God allows things like that to happen you know what that's all about it's us coming to a place either are we going to say Lord this or that but remember the only way to get anywhere with God the way up is down lord show me is there a complex built back in my life what is this Lord why why does this keep coming why is this response coming like it is Lord then we're getting in a place coming to his feet and if we can uncover his feet and just lay ourselves down and say Lord I want the word to so come into that area Lord Lord you're in my life Lord you know what's there Lord it isn't that things aren't glisten friends it isn't that we're ever going to get to a place that oh this don't bother us this don't bother us we're Overcomers it isn't that you're ever going to get to a place of you don't have a bad thought or this it isn't that at all but the overcoming is being able to quickly recognize it and recognize he that's in you has already overcome that thing when a thought of lust wants to go through then recognize quickly as God brings you to that my brother recognize that God in you has already overcome that thing that's overcoming yes it that's standing there with our lives prior or before his feet you love him we want to be laid I want to be laid at his disposal don't you I want to be laid like Ruth was I don't care I don't care what nobody says I don't care what my workers say I don't care what anybody says I I want to be one with him I I want to walk with him that's I I don't care about nothing else it's him is that right let me read this last quote to you here but the BR says I'll probably he's talkinging about Mary Magdalene he said I'll probably never be able to stand where she stood but one of these days I'm going to preach my last sermon my last drop of persperation will fall off my face last time tears will ever dim my eyes I'm going to stand in his presence and say I want to come up I I don't want a palace I don't want nothing great I just want to crawl up to his precious feet and Pat them a little and kiss them once and then turn away it would pay me for everything I've ever done we never get away from his feet in that it's the humility and submission to him and from his feet EET Here Comes sit with me in my Throne little bride for you are worthy you are my masterpiece that's been shaped out and honing through heartbreaks through trials through decisions even through decisions of your own sometimes that's got you there but my word cannot be defeated Grace has proven sufficient you are standing as an overcomer you are my bride you've always been my bride you were on my mind before the foundation of the world and I came down to rescue you and to take you unto myself and to bring that Victory back to you that you might come back into your rightful position you are my bride my beloved my queen step to the position that's been prepared for you from before the foundation of the world you love him oh let's stand when Lazarus was raised from the dead brother Joey the next chapter you find him he's at the Lord jesus' feet when the maniac we only know Legion that one his name I don't know what his name is but one of these days I'm going to meet him we're going to meet him amen but you know what brother Brian right after he was at the feet he was at the feet right there's where you found him he was right at his feet Mary magaline that's what brother bram's referring to in this quote Mary magaline Jesus had come into the house of Simon they didn't wash his feet they didn't anoint him but she looked over and saw him there something be to stir in her heart go do him a service she went she took from all of her lip living bought that anointment that ointment she walked through there oh my can you imagine the gasps and all of the talking mean you it weren't even words maybe that even had to be said it was just you just felt it I know we're in living in a big age of feelings but you know you just it was real it wasn't her imagination cuz no doubt she heard the gasps remember because they even said in their heart remember what was said in the heart speaks louder than what's said right here and Jesus caught what was in their heart if he knew what manner of man woman was touching him he would have nothing to do with her but the word knew what was beneath yes he did and she came she laid down everything sister Rosanne like that song you sing The Alabaster Box she laid down her entire life at his feet she didn't know how she was going to wash his feet but God provided what he was moving upon on her heart to do she dried his feet with her [Music] hair God supplied what he was moving in her heart to do you know what God moves and draws us in our hearts it's very important don't don't don't push it away but it's very important to act upon that pulsation as God deals with your heart maybe it's on repentance maybe it's on really fully surrendering your life maybe it's in a place of Lord there's some things that maybe in the midst of a test of a trial and molding and you realize this is there's some hard things that's really pressing it's a moment he'll Supply what's needed just move upon that pulsation just get to him get in his presence don't worry about who you are what you've done no Mary Magdalene came to him and when it was all said and done he said daughter thy faith thy faith thy [Music] faith hath saved thee see they he was all around individuals that works it's got to be touched and works and all th faith has saved thee go and S no more she received deliverance from Seven demons right there Prophet tells us all of those those Seven Devils that she had around her life you know what it was it was accumulation of things from even when she was young hurts and things had mounted up and it became it became like Caverns places for them to move into but in the presence of the word himself she was able to lay everything down and you know what she never picked up that lifestyle again you know why because she had been separated from it by the word I say oh God this morning may his grace just move down in such a way brother br asked a question like this brother brandham I can't give over completely to Jesus do I have an evil spirit and brother Brown will answer and say I don't believe you have an evil spirit but I believe it's an evil spirit that's anointing your thinking to try and make you think you can't and he said here's how you need to approach it he said Just Surrender yourself that way as a woman woman who has fought all of her life to keep her virtue and then she surrenders it to the man of her dreams her husband he said this is the way you surrendered all that I am all my mind all my thoughts look at this it's just very simple Lord my thinking my all that I am I want to give it to you my life I give as a life of service take me Lord and use me just as I am amen that is not just a slide it's not just a quote but I'll tell you this right now I believe this with all my heart if your heart is longing for a place and a moment of surrender I've tried it doesn't matter what you've tried but if we can just have faith in what the word has made a way for us then if you can take that that simple place of statement and say what has been directed to say Lord take all of my thinking I I want to say it right now I know my life has been changed I know what God has done for me but you know what Lord take all my thinking right here aresh take all my thinking all that I am I want to give it all to you I I want to surrender Lord more of my life I I want to surrender Lord More Of Me Lord when brother Brandon would preach perfect strength perfect weakness he said this Tabernacle needs a fresh killing and he said I need one with it what was he talking about from the feet to his throne when he would say while the Tabernacle is having a Revival I want to have one I want more of the Holy Ghost that'll make me more of a servant like he is notice what the request was not that I could do this or do this or do that no no I want to be more of a servant he said I want to be more humble more of a servant that's what I want I want more Lord amen amen let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father times Lord where in moments like these Lord how precious it is Lord as you would speak to our hearts Lord in these tender hidden passages of your word Lord like one Lord God who not only to coming coming to Behold a drama but Lord to recognize that there's a backstage pass to it Lord that's what Solomon spoke to the bride when he would address her and say oh my Dove let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice thou that are in the secret of the stairs Lord Jesus and we're not only Lord in these hidden passages but the real reality of it is is when Lord God we can recognize that we're a part of it Lord we've always been a part of it I pray Heavenly Father Lord I'm asking that right here this morning across this audience Lord there are needs Among Us hearts Lord that father in different stages in their walk with you but God as you spoke to us this morning every moment is a decision a decision Lord to keep moving Lord that decision Lord oh God Lord that would draw us and lead us Lord to that place to uncover your feet and to lay down lay our self lay our will down and and take orders from the word Lord father I don't want to be my own ruler Lord because frankly Lord I really wasn't my own ruler I was under the rule of The Prince and power of the air as Paul spoke to us in Ephesians 2 but the mercy of God came on the scene and Lord we have been quickened the light shined Lord down in our life we were like one of those Pond lies that was buried down deep in the bottom of the pond and the light begin to penetrate Lord and we begin to rise upward upward upward upward upward upward Lord until we're above the pond Lord Jesus I realize Lord no matter where we would be at in our walk with you we are in that place Lord of continual molding and shaping if there's one Lord that's here that doesn't know you in that way that God their heart Lord has been stirred and Lord Jesus even as those words that I put up there at the very end that Lord that Lord God may you just breathe into their hearts Lord just to be able to express that Lord for even that of Salvation Lord for that Lord that real surrendering Lord of their life that Lord I want to turn my life over I I don't want to keep it Lord I don't want to hold on to it because as you said in your word if I if I keep my life I'll lose it but if I'm willing to lose it surrender it then I'll find it Lord granted Lord Jesus I pray this morning Lord hallu may we lord God take up our cross daily Lord some of your children Lord standing here Lord God maybe Lord in the thick and the heat of a trial Lord there a Temptation Lord that's come their way and father I pray that [Music] God that as their heart Lord just being warned by the great rays of the S so n Lord that's where you met the Hebrew children you didn't abandon them but when they got in that fiery furnace Lord you met them right there Lord Jesus I pray father right here this morning for lives and hearts Lord that may be Lord right in the midst of decisions Lord right in the midst of Trials or tests and things that's going on Lord in their life and wondering how what will I do here what will be the next decision what would be the outcome oh God I pray right now father Lord Jesus we're not the Potter we're the clay you're the Great Master Potter Lord we want to submit we want to submit Lord Our lives our hearts to you Lord lead me Lord God maybe Lord we need to be carried right now because like that little picture on the footprints of the sands of time there went from two Footprints or two sets to one when the author when it looked back and said why was there only one and it was spoke at that time on the times that you could not walk or carry yourself I carried you oh Hallelujah Lord God I know you've carried me Lord at times Lord maybe there's someone here this morning lord they're in need of being carried Lord maybe their Spirits a little low Lord or a little weak Lord but I pray that God that you would sweep by Lord God and may they Lord just putting their hand in your hand saying Lord I just want to submit Lord I want to surrender I want to just Trust You Lord walking through this Lord that out of it Lord out of my life would come more of you Lord less of me Lord give me the grace Lord in this trial give me the grace that's needed Lord God grant it Lord for Lord truly soon and very soon we're going to be caught away from this world we've got a promise Lord he that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I am overcome and sit down with my father in his throne Lord Jesus you are the representative our mediator that is there on our behalf there's not two not three but Lord God there's one that sat upon the throne you came down created your own body to come and dwell in in order to pay the price and then Lord God you lifted your own body back up from the grave it it sets there on The Mercy Seat of God as a [Music] memorial when Steven was being stoned he never said he saw one standing on the over here and there was another one over here he said I saw the Son of God standing on the right hand meaning the power and authority for as you said all power and authority and Heaven and Earth is given into my hand Lord Jesus [Music] here we are Lord we're being summonsed if our eyesight has been Lord looking downward here we are we've been summons to look upward Lord grant it Lord this morning Lord God may we just receive may we
