unto me let us go to the house of the lord amen amen why because when we come to the house of the lord there's life there's happiness there's joy amen praise the lord if you have your scriptures and you would turn with me we're going to turn to second kings chapter 18 we'll dive into the scripture here we're just blessed to be here we thank the the pastor for another opportunity to come and speak with you all this morning we just feel like we're a privileged people that we could speak to the bride of christ again we could speak to kings we could speak to the world's renown and we wouldn't feel as special as we feel this morning being able to speak to god's people and his bride i believe we're his bride this morning amen before we read the scriptures let's just turn to him and go to him in prayer dear gracious heavenly father lord we just come before you today lord with humble hearts we just thank you for another opportunity that we can come together as christians as your bride and to gather ourselves together lord we just are so thankful lord there's been recent times where many have not been able to gather themselves together they haven't been able to come to one church in person there's many still today that cannot come together and join arm in arm and hand in hand and be able to serve the lord together in one locality lord so we just thank you for that opportunity we just ask that you would be with us this morning that you would just bless it and you would bless your people we ask in jesus name amen amen amen you're my interpreter today all right well i get one of the best interpreters then amen if we would turn over to second kings chapter 18 i'll read a uh i'll read a couple of verses here and then i'll have you be seated um i'm going to do quite a bit of reading there's a story that takes three chapters long story is about a man named hezekiah and many of us know the story about hezekiah brother branham speaks of him as a man of faith he was a great man of god and brother branham said that his prayer changed the very plan of god brother branham uses him as an example the prophetic point on an example of what prayer can do in your life when you have troubles come your way brother branham says prayer changes things the scripture says that uh the prayer of a righteous man not a little bit but your prayer my prayer can change the mind of almighty god amen that's a pretty incredible thought this story here is not so well known for being but it happened when hezekiah was still young amen second kings 18 i'll read verses one through seven and then i'll have you seated and it came to pass in the third year of hoshia the son of elka the king of israel that hezekiah the son of ahaz king of judah began to reign twenty and five years old was he and he began to reign and he reigned 29 years in jerusalem his mother's name was also abby the daughter of zechariah and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to all that david his father did he removed the hype places and break down the images and cut down the groves and break in pieces the brazen serpent that moses had made for unto those days the children of israel did burn incense to it and he and called it he trusted in the lord god of israel so that after him was none like him among all the kings of judah nor any that were before him for he claimed unto the lord and departed not from following him but kept his commandments which the lord commanded moses and the lord was with him and he prospered whether so ever he went forth and he rebelled against the king of assyria and served him not would you like to read it in french sure what israel is amen may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated we will continue reading here just so we can get a background to the story so if you have your scriptures and you'd like to follow along with us we're going to hop to verse 22. but and and this is a servant of the king of assyria comes to jerusalem jerusalem and he says but if you say to me we trust in the lord our god notre dame is not that he whose high priest places whose alters hezekiah taketh away and said to judah in jerusalem you shall worship before this altar in jerusalem now therefore i pray thee now give me pledges give pledges to my lord the king of assyria faith and i will deliver 2 000 horses if thou be able to on my part to set writers on them so here's the servant of another king they're an enemy saying i will give you 2 000 horses if you have enough writers to put on them 24. he says how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master servants and put that i trust in egypt for chariots and horsemen and i now come up without the lord against this place to destroy it eddie saying hear the word of the great king the king of assyria thus saith the king let not hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord saying the lord will surely deliver us and this shitty shall not be delivered into the hands of hezekiah for thus saith the king of assyria his fig tree and drink ye everyone hit the waters of his sister until i come and take you into a land like your own land he says hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of assyria the nation until delivered have they delivered samaria out of my hand you see the boasting that he's doing no one can stand against the king of the series and hezekiah sent messengers unto the prophet of the age and isaiah said unto them yes thus shall you say unto your master thus saith the lord be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard about with which the servants of the king of assyria have been blasphemed behold i will send a blast upon him jeremiah and he shall hear a rumor and shall return into his own land and i will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land verse 32 verses therefore thus saith the lord concerning the king of assyria he shall not come into this city nor shoot to save it for my own sake and for my servant david's sake yeah and it came to pass that night that the angel of the lord went out and he smote in the camp of the assyrians 104 in 5 000. and when they arose early in the morning that the devil is really boasting what is it that's going to perform i foreign buildings collapsing out of nowhere all of these things that are happening in the world today it's the devil boasting there's no way that you can overcome yeah pam where could you piss franco don't listen to your pastor pastor when he says with the lord you can overcome god don't listen to your parents when they try to train you in the way of them isn't it interesting he promised a land like their land imagined if he was going to take them to a land like their i'm going to take you to a land where you can be happy what he wanted is you to stay put and then one day i'm going to come and i'm going to get you hey and i'm but things get worse and worse amen amen so how do we combat these false boasts of the devil the boasts with faith there's nothing that we can do within ourselves but we must have faith in god when you develop our fought on you when the numbers are are too high when there's too many with the enemy faith is not something that we just put on la force faith isn't something it's not some hope so experience but but faith is something that we firmly believe on absolute the scripture says in hebrews that faith is a substance between something's not seen it's an evidence it's an evidence before the results certain evidence hallelujah hallelujah amen isn't it great that god can give us something more something tangible we can hold it like a sheep doesn't manufacture wool coma coma thank you he doesn't have to pray to the lord in prepar lord this morning when i wake up it is please help me to to to bring forth walls i don't want hair i want wool no no the sheep isn't worried it goes on its day just like it does every day oh it contributes on some eggs it's just eating grass oh it continues to remain some water continued inside it doesn't bring forth fear it doesn't bring forth regrets it brings forth faith and faith grows stronger this is like a muscle the force come and miscreate the more you use faith uh the prison the stronger it gets the truth and your faith you can overcome bigger things and bigger things become true and bigger things it's one day it's a water that's the same fate set memphis change your body into a younger body and we're going to step one of these days from this body if we want to put fear in today's terms anxiety oh it's such a big thing in today's world sorry anxiety is such a big thing in today's world everyone's suffering from anxiety fear is a spirit and society is a spirit alongside this it's that you said you said then it's free amen amen believe that this morning but we see that even in the human nature humankind is not as strong as they once were why because of all of this hybrid food of course the two says and then satan has done the same thing to the believer in ladies what has he done he's made we don't have to face the fierce uh uh uh romans that they had to back in the bible days to say we didn't have the persecution in the dark ages but if we just make things easy where we can sit in church please pay our tithes shake the preacher's hand and off we go hey we've done our religious duties for the week alone is amen amen that's lady ocean we think we're rich we think we have all these things we're naked we're blind we saw my friend he says now isn't it strange just like it is now he was talking about the disciples and how they got on the boat with jesus and they had a testimony service services and services of all these great things they have just seen jesus do the tuskegee zone visas refer okay and they're on the water and he says as we're coming down to the end isn't it strange new lesson in petite maladies or a little s trouble strike the home watch what happens it's all gone to pieces all hope is gone when the is preaching me happy i can say hallelujah hallelujah i can say praise the lord but when correction comes yeah when correction comes we should still shout hallelujah hallelujah amen amen we praise the lord for his correction paragraph 115. he says trouble set in and they forgot that the very one they were talking about the person the very creator was in the boat with them those storms start to rise oh we've got great revival meetings we get in our car and we start going to another place he's still in the boat with you today and it doesn't matter how high those waves get it's coming out it doesn't matter how much that boat is tossing again but the same jesus christ that was with brother branham get that right now this in those meetings that was in the burning bush with moses jesus christ but memphis is with us today so why are we afraid and we're afraid how we're going to provide us we're afraid how we're going to uh keep our health free we are sons and daughters of some defeats they defeat the druid hey man that ought to make us happy oh it reminds me of that story a man came to buy slaves uh he's looking at all of those slaves no it's the same message but what makes us happy because we can identify with the scripture with the message and we know that we are a child amen enthusiasm it's god in you that's what enthusiasm is the second enthusiasm amen we're talking about false boasts there's many many examples we could take throughout the scriptures on how satan wants to boast have you ever played basketball or soccer basketball oh i'm so good [Music] no because we have the all-star on our team amen but we don't have to boast because we are sure where we stay we don't have to try to convince other people we know what we're doing now about convacular zones the secondary physical because we are on god's side that's gonna sound decorated amen amen but one time there was a little ruddy fellow man julia van nom i pretty much and he had built up strong faith in god in grant foreign and he was a young man named david davido and when we think of david we think of such a great man a component that vidcom and gotham a a man that was had so much faith in the lord a man that had overcome so many things but i don't want you to think of david like that i want you to go back with me before all of that happened david was just like you and i let's say he's 12 14 years old and he's doing chores for his daddy sometimes we limit our our kids our siblings all the children here's david 12 14 years old watching his father's sheep by himself uh so what happens every time a trial comes in so many times we're saying oh lord take this from me and the lord is saying i am giving you an opportunity to grow we're trying to refuse that opportunity instead of looking at that trial that's an opportunity to grow close so here's young little david and john david do we have any kids here 12 14 years old got some young ones in the 12 14 years old and what did he do did he pull out his iphone and whoa text his dad see it's done sephini no but he sprung into action but when that when that we're not promised when david's father's promised that's stolen by the enemy no no what we need to do is together as a family are talking for me with childlike faith we need to claim the promises for our parents as many times as a church we see these problems with other people in the church we think that's their problem but when we need me we need some little david's zombies they'll get down on their knees and they'll go to bat they keep on living they will fight hey amen amen he had a right to go get that chef amen amen so what seemed to be just another monday morning normal doing chores for his daddy it was just another normal day but what he didn't realize at the time was he was about to have a trial he was about ready to have an opportunity to grow his faith a man amen he didn't look at the symptom but he looked at the promise brother branham said but you see faith knows no failure hallelujah yes i think i need to say that again that faith knows no failure [Applause] hallelujah amen praise the lord praise the lord it says it's anchored okay it stays right there no matter what anything said bro i don't care if the doctor says this is an incurable disease or are we listening to thus saith the lord praise the lord i'll i'll side with us in the supernatural mastodon let's see what the doctor amen we've got friends that live in oklahoma their last name is green uh lord north green and they were atheists probably six or seven years ago and they come into the message and they don't know anything and they had smoked a female they've done drugs oh they drank a zombie and this sister's colon was destroyed and she came to the pastor down there the pastor said here's my situation did i get my situation what do i do and he says well you pray you give the lord your need uh [Music] she didn't take any surgery she had no scar there they didn't even replace her cola oh but they went through a surgery that the doctor didn't know about perfectly healthy amen so david turned a trial into an experience with the lord experience maybe we're going through trials today maybe financial troubles maybe troubles with our health maybe maybe the devil's just trying to steal your joy but that was just the part of what's wrong i think every single one of us can remember when we were first saved we've is some little davis second of all how many people do you get little david you're sorry i'm gonna fight for what's rightfully and the devil can't steal my joy because it is my problem it's not his amen praise the lord so we need to have a showdown with the devil right now [Music] so here's david and he has two experiences with the lord experience and then we get to samuel chav chapter 17. and there comes this big giant voila how big his armor he's had two experiences with the lord amen amen the scripture says that david encouraged himself in the lord he knew how to write himself this giant comes out twice every day saying i despise and what's notable is saul was head and shoulders above all the other israelites but he was scared he should have been the leader of the leader goliath would have been the smallest to saul than any of the others but he didn't have the same experiences those experiences that david had was preparing him for this day those trials that david had seen in the past getting him ready for this big child that was coming david had an experience that he could point back to hey he said two weeks ago in some youth meetings i had an experienced so what is this giant now it is satan is trying to just get you to destroy yourself in your own boasting for 40 days saying choose you a man one on one here we go he starts making his boasts and those words fell on the wrong ears that day because those words fell on the ears of a believer says that suits say i have already had an experience because are you an expert and this trial will be no different why because my anger is the same hallelujah and nothing is going to change so choose you this day so david says why are you all cowering down this uncircumcised philistine has no rights we have the right lucifer we are the children so then david goes and saul calls him up oh you're too small to fight he overcame by the word of his testimony well you better wear my armor you see saul was afraid it fear loves company so many times as believers we hear these testimonies of other believers oh i've got such and such a problem i praise the on you see what saul is doing there do you want to tell you that affair because of his lack of faith he's trying to impose that on david i cause there's some mob the foreign so you better try this twelve step program that i tried it wonders it here's saul way up here head and shoulders above everybody so you know what was he thinking of course that armor is not going to fit david david said i haven't proved definitely i don't have experience with some 12-step program i have an experience with the lord experience and my confidence is in him not in some armor but my confidence is in the lord david goes out hey david italy he picks up five smooth stones of faith take it from here on out okay from uh apache dc no david had more to do daffy dave plus affair the lord could move mountains he said uh he's put us here in the last stage for a reason what hands does god have but yours what hands does he have what feet does god have but yours what no no david was enthusiastic he knew what he had in his sleep more importantly he knew he who he had in his heart and he went out with enthusiasm and he gave god everything that he could give him and he went out there and swung that is as hard as he could and once it left the sling once david had no more control that is when the lord can say but we must give god everything we'll give him all of our prayers they're trying to give their everything done why am i because they're they're king basically scored a three-pointer amen but when we see someone get saved that should create a revival but people give me more give me uh hallelujah amen the creator of heaven and earth is living in us that's a reason to shout selectively that's a reason to give him praise the least we could do is raise our hands say glory to god amen hallelujah amen we need to give god our everything right then when it gets beyond us then the lord can take it because she didn't save some of the perfume perfume for later but she bought or uh too angry brother branham says that's the way you've got to come to him he says give him all the praise pour out all the glory on him lay everything down hallelujah he says that's why we can't have revival because you're stingy with it he said you want to share some of your glory with something else go out miss jones you know she wears these kind of clothes or she does this or she does this or if this is she says yeah you're too stingy with it you want to share your glory with something else wow wow because we're trying to save some of the glory for something else we're trying to save some of our praise for something else no we need to pour out all of our prayers amen amen praise the lord yes that's a good quote praise god oh you pharisee you walk along and you want to pattern after somebody else yeah he says no wonder jesus can't break through this nation on a revival but our eyes should be on the lord amen so we're going to hop back to second kings real quick and hopefully i won't be much longer eighteen and four i wanna bring your attention to this verse number four it says and he removed the high praise places and break down the images and cut the groves and break in pieces the brazen serpent that moses had made that brazen serpent that was over in numbers 21. that same serpent that that that gave them victory they gave them freedom they gave them life and the scriptures saying he was in the will of the lord when he broke it down i think that's just shows the denominational spirit that they were fighting back then amen and we see throughout the seven churches the the the the messenger to that age would grab a scripture and he would run with it and they would have a revival with it and then they'd denominate around the brazen serpent is so antichrist they try to take brother branham they put him in the place of god and by doing so they make him antichrists oh took him off the field oh uh denomination but he removed the denominational barriers amen verse 22. but if you say unto me this is the the servant of the king of assyria speaking uh is that not he whose high places and whose altars hezekiah have taken away and hath said to judah in jerusalem ye shall worship before this altar in jerusalem isn't he the same guy that tore down all of these other things okay try to make him look like he's made a mistake over here trying to create all these liberal and conservatives you know amen so wait wait so isn't this your pastor that tore down the the oneness is the if you don't believe the return ministry like i believe it you're not going in the rapture now therefore i pray thee go ahead chris i give pledges to my lord the king of assyria and i will deliver thee 2 000 horses if thou be able to set rioters on them false promises those horses aren't going to be theirs those horses are going to be the same horses that carry them back into captivity captivity that's what the devil does he'll show you the glamour iv glamour but he won't show you what's on the inside i'll show you the end story i'll just take a little drink oh you'll have a good time verse 25 verses am i now come up without the lord against this place to destroy it can you see that snake for the lord said unto me go against this land and destroy it let's put that in today's terms it's the lord's will that you're lost yeah you can be safe but you're not bright you see the trick of the devil i've got the word of the lord look at this quote you said there might be one out of this city and one out of that city and you live in the same city as your pastor uh but watch how it changes from the word of the lord to the king of the syrian stood and cried with a loud voice in the jew's language he's speaking the same language as the jews do he seems to be as one of them saying hear the word of the great king the king of assyria he starts off with the word of the lord no we must stick with the words let hezekiah make you trust in the lord saying the lord will surely deliver us and this city shall not be delivered of assyria any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his hand or his land out of the hand of the king of assyria look young people did god hold this so and so that went astray youth group he was so on fire for god yeah he claimed to have the holy ghost but the the the the holding power of the lord didn't help him how's it going they're going to be lying to you so the next time the devil comes to boast a claim listen to the where are all these other gods whose songs second kings 196. dysnoxis so they bring this to the prophet of the age of prophet and isaiah says unto them thus shall you say to your master thus saith the lord be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard with which the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed behold i will send a blast upon him he shall hear a rumor it shall return to his own land and i will cause him to fall by his own sword the word blast means a wind or it means a spirit with heavy breathing it's a common and it's uh as a souffle a spirit of heavy breathing and he's not even going to shoot an arrow at this city i want to tell you church please if you think we suffer from anxiety and fear and depression and the child of god gets down on his knees and that demon comes running back to hell satan did you hear that's what you want he goes what you did quoi that can't be right oh no shane's bounding them down oh we had them handcuffed they couldn't raise their hand because we had them handsome before the beginning and they open up their spiritual ears and they start hearing this they're probably trying to give them to you because they don't want them that's right they were cursed to the lord back then and they're still cursed but what are you going to do with that box oh i hate snakes i'll just i'll just leave it in a closet to do you said no no no no no i ain't signing that page because i've been passing this you can take those devils and you can send it back and when that comes back to satan because he's scared he's running out of time what do we have we have to look forward because time is running out experiences we're going to live eternally because i don't leave right there anymore what promise does the devil have promised he's got hell waiting for him on the other side oh praise the lord but that blast is going to hit satan harder than it hits us hallelujah hallelujah when he thought he had you coin what a disappointment for the devil oh this is deception why because the children of israel had a promise amen 1933 prophet says by the way that he came by the same shall he return amen and shall not come into this city saith the lord the promise of the lord he told me to apply the token on you and your house and they cannot be lost why because it's your inheritance amen it's your right it's your promise amen so he departed and went and returned and dwelt in nineveh 36 king of assyria hello yes go ahead 37 and it came to pass hello that his two sons whatever however there was not one israelite soldier israel not one soldier from judah that had to lift a sword against the king why because they had a promise from the lord that i will fight your battle because when it looked like there was no possible way god made a way when you're standing on the walls of jericho looking out against those assyrian armies of soldiers and in one night god killed 185 000. overnight just like that if he could do that for them back then how much more would god do that for us when he sees his little bride out here struggling against the things we have to struggle with and he didn't want to live in paradise by himself but he wants a bride to live with the spoken word is the original seed paragraph 447. he says but in every generation every revival brings forth some prophet of god amen amen a prophet is a preacher a prophet predicate a true preacher on the word and they bring forth a revival that gathers the elect of that generation hallelujah amen yes sir so we believe that we're living in a revival only a revival but we're living in the greatest revival of all time a revival that we can see ourselves in the world a revival because we can see that the rapture is coming and i believe in this revival it won't just be a revival because the sick were healed there won't be a revival because the blind can see before i don't believe it'll be a revival just because the dead walk is where you don't need healing from sickness where you don't need your blinded eyes to be old but i believe it will be in this revival where we will see our theophany body do you know that song i don't think my theophany is calling out to me do you know that song i don't think so no no there's i've got the chorus here and i don't have much voice left but i want to sing this song i don't know if you guys have heard it it goes like this i'll read you the words it says one day i'm gonna take a step to play yeah if you can play it let's play it because this is what's got me excited brother brandon thought the rapture was coming in his age that was 50 years ago 60 years ago we are that much closer to seeing artheophany because one of these mornings we're going to be going throughout our day and sometime i believe between six and nine [Music] i'm gonna hear a knock wait what is that [Music] it'll be calling my name i'm gonna see a loved one walk through that door no all we're going to have to do is take
