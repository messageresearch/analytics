applause for [Applause] everyone so we're gonna go on to the test so as you could see up there I split it into two parts because it was two different classes between the kindergarten class class and the preschool class for the kindergarten class I had them do all 14 questions and then for the preschool class I only had them answer five questions and then do the Lord's prayer prayer and um Ephesians 4:32 so they all did very well I've seen a lot of improvement so I'm really proud of all of them but we have some that did exceptional today so we want to give them awards for that so I'm going to start with the preschool class so for the preschool class we did five questions and the one who got four out of five was Bri star choa so not only did she do get four out of five for the questions but she also did the Lord's Prayer and Ephesians 4:32 completely so if you could give her a round of applause for that and coming in second place for three out of five there was a tie between three people so it was Joe yoan and David so so we're going to do Ephesians 4:32 for a tiebreaker between them so I'm going to give them the mic and see how it goes [Music] fire Ephesians 432 and be kind and compassionate to one another forgiving just as in Christ God forgive you so it's going to go the second place prize will go to Joe so for my kindergarten class they also did very well very proud of them so for the first place there's also a tie we um between Jason Gad and Dave so if you can give them a round of applause so they had to answer out of 14 questions and they got 11 out of 14 right so that's really good yes and before I go to um give them to recite I want to also mention happiness and blessing who did also very well they got a 10 out of 14 so if you can give them CL for that okay so we're going to do a tie breaker to um break the tie between them three we're going to do the books of the Bible but we're only going to do do the new test I mean the Old Testament since they haven't really had time to memorize all of it Genesis Exodus Leviticus Deuteronomy Joshua [Music] judges rof first and second Samuel first and second Kings first and second chronicles Ezra [Music] nehemia Esther [Music] Genesis Exodus i f aiss Leviticus March numbers May I mean not May Genesis Exodus that's all okay so first place is going to go to Jason by default where's Jason and then second place will'll go [Music] to God and for third place it's going to go to Dave so everybody please clap for Dave so they all did very well so if you could clap for them and this is my Sunday school class okay if you guys can walk down and get your presents before you go to your seat okay sorry before you go to your seat come back up sorry before you go to your seat I have participation Awards I have some awards here so for most improved I'm going to give it to Dave because I've seen a big Improvement throughout this past year he's been talking more he's been interacting with the class and he really knows a lot of what's happening in Sunday school so if you could give him a round of applause for another most improved I'm going to give it to happiness mavinga and then for

sankai I'm GNA give a good attitude award because he always has the best attitude in class okay thank you that's all thank you have your seats so next class is going to be um Sharon's class if she can come up quickly God bless you all and good job to everyone who participated during the year for Sunday school um I'm going to start out with some um awards for this class so I have an award for um excellent participation and that award I'm going to give to miss [Music] shakina we also have an award for great efforts um for trying his best and always working hard and that award I'm going to give to Glory manishi um I have a good character or Christian character award that I'm going to give to someone here um he's always been a good helper always ready to help when I ask him with a good attitude and help those around him I'm going to give that award to step mazita um for the test that we did today we um had 46 questions um out of the 46 questions um we had the top two who tied um they Min they missed only 10 questions out of the 46 so we have for first place a tie between Moses and Dan but since I only have one prize we're going to have to break the tie between the two um followed and they're actually followed very closely by Solomon also who was right behind just one point down from that so so for to break the tie we're going to have to do the 12 sons of Jacob in order from the first until the last the one who gets it gets the prize for first place Ruben wuben Simeon [Music] Levi Gad Joseph [Music] Benjamin um um Reuben Simeon Levi Dan Gad Joseph Benjamin okay we have neither so books of the Bible to break the tie books of the Bible Genesis X this Leviticus numers Deuteronomy Joshua Judges and second time first second Kings Chronicles Ecclesiastes e Daniel Maha um zah hegi Zar Malachi Matthew Luke John acts and Romans 1 Second Corinthians Galatians Ephesians Philippians Colossians 1 second Thessalonians 1 second pan Hebrews James first Peter second

Ephesians philippin um cians first and second T Tans first and second Timothy Titus carians um Hebrew James first first and second Peter first and second and third John Jude Revelation all right that was very close both of you guys did well very well Den did Miss a couple so first place is going to go to [Applause] Moses um for Moses we have a gift of a tablet here and iPad for kids thank you and for second place we have an apple a smart watch for kids for Dan and then and third place we have Solomon and the rest of you guys good job I'm going to pass out their um your prizes before you go sit down thank you very [Applause] much all right thank you very much you guys can get your prizes and have a seat all right so last but not least I'm going to call the seniors to come forward so for the senior class um I like to say good job to each and every one of you um it's definitely the toughest class because this is the age where sometimes they think they're too coold to be in Sunday school but um they're still here and I appreciate them a lot there's some who um still give their best in class and I would like to start by giving participation awards for those who really love participating in class um so the first one is going to go participation is going to go to goodness lubaki followed by Anna mavinga followed by buim oh and also uh n maishi oh well I have your award and then um it's probably over there uh for the next one we have good effort award so that is just for somebody who um definitely gives a little bit extra effort they may not always know the right answers they may not always um do all the homework but they definitely are trying to do their best and that award goes to chance maishi and then the last um award we're gonna call is the Christian character and attitude award this award I think we added recently with the teachers um because sometimes we realize that Sunday school is not really just about the brain about knowing the books of the Bible about knowing but it's also your attitude in class it's also your way that you treat your peers around you and this um award is going to go to Deborah chiango uh throughout the year we had a test um it was about roughly 90 questions um it was about five-page test it was a lot to memorize throughout the year uh I think they're going to project it and I'm going to to get the test um while she hands out the test I just want to say um for me it was a huge experience teaching to you or I should say learning from you because I learned a lot from you um I never went to Sunday school so it's a huge experience for me to learn by you and um I want to to thank you for um being patience with me and also thank the parents for bringing them um I want to encourage you again like I said on um on Thanksgiving um to take the time to talk to your kids they're great they have um an amazing potential and talent but I think we can all improve that um if you take the time to talk to them chat with them maybe play a game or something and start to get to know them better um they're great I'm very proud of all of them um some do better but sometimes um that has a lot to do with the work of the parents at home so um encourage that and congratulations uh so as we said the test um composed of about 90 questions about everything we learned throughout the year uh but before I give the results um I would like um couple students to say because they did learn the seven Messengers The Seven Church ages and also the seven uh virtues or the seven steps of the pyramid so that's what we're going to start with recitals for this class because they're a little bit older so that's where we're going to start and then right after we're going to give the results of the test so I'm going to start with Joshua and go down that way um for the seven messages it's uh Paul um irius um then it's Martin then it's Columba uh after Columba it's Luther Wesley then it's brother grantom and for the Seven

came in so fifth up oh sorry the third person up so in third place um we're not doing third place but we had goodness um lubaki and first and second place is a tie between brother and sister we have faith in Joshua they both came right around 93% they did very well they answered all the most of the questions so they missed each about just five questions so there was no either way easier way to break it but the fastest one to do the books of the Bible is going to take the first prize which is a 7 55 gift card to Foot Locker and you can get shoes of your choice second place we'll get the $50
