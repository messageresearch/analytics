christ's name darling knowledge is requested amen amen you may be seated may god bless you as i greet you all in the name of the lord jesus christ so the good news yeah the bond uh the mutable family thank the lord jesus for a new life in their family so sister greg gracia at the baby on a wednesday night last week and uh the baby and the mother and the father the people sabbath they are all in good shape and we thank the lord for that amen and i want also to thank you for your prayers meeting on finances and uh i think uh your prayer really did support us because it was not very easy to yeah i think one of the tape i played it here last uh last sunday but i think they did cut it off where i did not ask to cut off and uh if a brother you can project the last portion of the service when a pastor neville was speaking [Music] because just after when i finished to preach probably this is where they cut it off better man i want just a two minute from our pastor neville to hear his comment what he said he is the one who asked that those tape not to be made public this go is god bless [Music] [Applause] you know the as children of god they come up from the jail we must be also the head because the bride and the bridegroom are one basketball let's take advantage of this time let's see let's spend some time before god assuming on youtube you know i was thinking lord what's going on with us in this message then you're questioning about my recommendation i can read brady right now to pay you forward now oh that brother i didn't know god has blessed him so much benitez when he was talking about the intelligence that was just the first meeting the palestinian and i think we played the second service last wednesday yeah i did ask him that i want to place those tape also at our congregation and we agree that as soon as we play them in some mountain uk or she talking laser bonjour to keep them private they delegate the bottom line i want to highlight here is he told me you never said certain things in our church in my decade the certain shows are not regressive it's true some of the concepts i never mentioned them it's a very question the concept but as you will see the rest of the services over there i spoke on uh entrepreneurship japanese which is very very important yeah very much important and i also spoke on many concepts of taxation concept attacks uh because most of the people in america basketball could join america they complain always that would they pay a lot of taxes which is true he'll say completely but another category of people not a categorization they don't pay taxes in a paper the taxes and uh one of the big concepts i developed over there throughout the remaining of the meetings developed to show you that most of the entrepreneurs they don't pay taxes over why i saw some of i used the red mark but it was not coming clear let me try this dizzy this was the biggest concept that's a daily program concept i developed is they are the first category is the premier category is the w two people say something the first the first box in the premiere what people are struggling they don't make enough with their w-2 jeans but here you see people are making still receiving w2 but man they make enough i said that they make enough money for that but here they don't make enough money the got to rename it but this category here the best the biggest concept i developed was w-2 people the premier league playground junkie most of them they receive a schedule which they call schedule k1 a la prepar day when they pay you then you can pay they deduct always social security it is unless joe larson de la security social they deduct medicare he's on level our sunday medicare social security is six point two percent social security support some point up to a certain maximum uh up how much is this maximum of us equally maximum day oh but you do a lot of payroll i think it's up to 137 or 140 000. when you reach this they don't deduct 6.2 percent anymore calvo touches 6. security social but the average salary is not 100 000. it's uh nationwide it's about 60 000. and the medicare they deduct 145 percent medicare is a lever and [Music] which becomes six point six seven oh seven point sixty five second set for some point and the employer has to match it that means we contribute 15.3 percent everyone of the w to people to pay social security [Music] this one is somebody who work eight to five regular job here you are maybe in the management function you make a little bit more but you are still on w-2 w2 management here you have a little business it seems available affair but here is the box of people who invest they see sesame investigation the investors the son is investigating i can give you a simple example you have money let's say you buy a complex building it was a stay in complex department maybe hundred or two hundred apartment people are hunting you have used your money or you have borrowed somebody's money to invest uh that money that is coming to you there is no w-2 in your body is that clear yes there is no w-2 yeah many many people yeah who are they don't pay social security they pay palace secretaries they don't pay medicare pay by medicare because people complain all the time or they deduct a lot of taxes they just complain to your company when you file your income tax return they refund you the federal withholding a gun who will the disability and you are also funding the people who don't have medical insurance evolution on parliament medical this is the logical that's a logic so my point as i preach over there was trying to tell the people to move from this w-2s to come this is where trump is a trump and people say if trump doesn't pay enough taxes malaysian just get trump they pay publicly tax those people they have financial advisors is on the channel they can say they finance they tell them what to do this is the security affair to minimize their taxes so my ideal was money who are making the law to help those people on w2 they are the people who are here say something is only business so therefore hello this concept of w-2 will never die it's a concept of the dublin because every investor must get shark investors when they invest they have to find some employees in order for you to move from this category to come here [Music] it takes a big intelligence intelligence it's not the only form of income exempted from social security and medicare exempted a social security medicare for example you have a little money on your saving for example at the end of the year they give you a form called 1099. this interest rate that interest you finally to pay taxes on the interest there is no social security deduction right in your parlor deductions there is no same thing with your 1099 div for dividend you receive dividends same thing for your 1099-b this is for the brokerage account the commission account not really when you trade the stock you trade bitcoin you trade money that's a public junkie from the trading the bitcoin somebody they buy the for example the japanese yen to convert them in american dollars this is people doing a lot of things they are investing in many kinds of categories only jenkins versus shows money so when you will listen to the probably the tape whenever i will have the opportunity to play them i don't know when you and those people in the congress they are all on the side they say junkies lawmakers are on the side they junkie funny they protect their investment with less taxes and then they pass all the taxes who is paying for social security it's not a trump it's you and i okay people are secretary so senator trump said and let me tell you with the social security you are paying listen you may die before you retire where is the money going where is the medicare money going that's not the medicare value so that was the concept that's italian concept but um i think we had uh several services after that yeah we don't need to stay brother happy with our w-2 job yeah you are making money working for somebody with like keep in mind i'm learning to have my own opportunity a traditional opportunity to be an entrepreneur entrepreneurship most of the people who are in the last box what it's not the people who went with a college degree but university no no maybe people who have college degrees universities most of them are here they're essentially business maybe a lawyer my says medical doctor my main doctor they can have their own practice if they have a valuable property they have their own business it's only a proper affair but they work maybe more hours to maintain them so the business owns them your business but the idea is even if you have a business usability affair every somebody you hire people to do it and you just take your k1 this is the type of business people who own the business and they don't do any work for the business but this category of investor here category it doesn't need a degree in upper beijing the diplomatic universities you can take a training nine months to be maybe a plumber information hvac electrician you create your own business who create water pop affair it's your company about the company you can sleep with a dummy when the money is coming in brother we have to open our mind towards this you start we only started somewhere here you you work for the purpose of learning the job objective this is personally what i have done you learn japan one day make your own schedule and nobody forcing you for mandatory over time personally you schedule your vacation whenever you want i think i had a lot of quotes supporting all of this especially for our young fellow especially and also parent let us direct our children toward the last box [Music] african parent african we want to push our children toward more money on w2 college college college university but the college is not for everybody foreign but investment is for everybody my last investors muslim to protest that's why you see american parents for american their children their zamfam 18 years old boy my digital adage 19 is never because they grow up with their mind here basket gandhi's available today they have a certain profession his own certain profession and they can't get married earlier i wanted to be a lawyer and you go 18 19 20. his left district event enjoy his k-1 and he know his job he connects he can build his family it becomes stressful for me brother this is a revolution if you don't understand the american mentality it's a capitalism company capitalism they want to please immigrants with a social benefit but they think twice four percent therefore the house that where the governor put you in belong to whom one of the investors lend the investor sir you fully you fill the apartment [Music] for his good k1 without taxes and you are happy he's happy so this morning uh i took a few times because i know brother ben doesn't preach longer so and i want to thank you again for your prayer for those meetings the last two services i had a lot of questions and uh i think uh i had also a off session when they took me to lunch as you you'll see uh in session with a lot of questions and answers avec de question reports sometimes it depends on the attitude of the people what they want to pull up so let us stand as we welcome brother ben schamel to the platform [Music] [Music] i i was lost [Music] i [Music] my my [Music] [Music] is [Music] first [Music] praise god praise god praise god [Music] praise god praise god praise god [Music] praise god praise god [Music] amen amen are we here to praise the lord amen we're just happy to be with you again this morning we just thank brother faustin for the opportunity to come and preach to god's children we don't take these opportunities lightly opportunity i believe all ministers can agree with this that it's a big burden on a person and we know that everything that we preach so we always want to be careful that we stay exactly with the word exactly with what the message says exactly they feel an urgency that if this was my last time to preach so we appreciate the opportunity to be here opportunity it's been a while since i've been here yes traveling around quite quite a bit yeah if you have your scriptures and you would turn with me we'll read our our uh scriptures from the book of daniel yes we'll take our text from chapter 3 starting with verse 8. and it's talking about the three hebrew children in this scripture and i'll go ahead and i'll read verses eight through fifteen the scripture says wherefore at that time certain chaldeans came near and accused the jews and they spake unto the king nebuchadnezzar o king live forever thou o king has made a decree that every man should hear the sound of the cornet flu the harp the suckbutt sultry and dolcmer and all kinds of music shall fall down and worship the golden image and whoso fail it falleth not down to in worship that he shall be cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace and there are certain jews whom thou has set over the affairs of the province of babylon shadrach meshach and abednego these men o king have not regarded thee they serve not thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up then nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring shadrach meshach and abednego and they brought these men before the king nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true o shadrach meshach and abednego do not ye serve my gods nor worship the golden image which i have set up now if you be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the cornet flute harp suckbutt sultry and dokmer and all kinds of music ye fall down and worship the image which i have made well but if you worship not ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of the burning fiery furnace and who is that god that should deliver you out of my hands lord we are just so thankful for that we just asked that you would be with this service the speaker might be able to get himself out of the way [Music] lord that we can hear directly from the throne of god this morning as we say many times we know that we can gather together we can fellowship one with another landed the lord if you're not here it's all in vain so lord we just ask that you would come down in this service right now that you would have full preeminence in the services lord you know the needs of the people we just asked that you would lead guide and direct us this morning amen amen amen you may be seated amen so if we were to take a text out of this scripture i believe that this story we all learn it in sunday school and texts it's a very amazing story and i believe that this story is specifically in the scripture specific modern executive not only for them back there but it's so we can look in the scriptures i don't believe that we take the scripture and we place it in some other day but we take the scriptures and we apply it to our hearts and that doesn't mean to have a pitchfork religion because we know the crumbs from jesus's table gave the woman the healing that she was looking for uh uh loaf of bread but just a crumb a teeny tiny piece it's just is enough to give you physical healing and that's why satan that john the baptist didn't eat some wild red pepper exposes who the devil is diablo brother branham said that there are two books in the bible more than any other book bible and we can see that it's it's such a a gray area they're trying to mix up everything and we had a prophet come here to show now our morals are so if i was to take a a text out of this scripture it would be knowing exactly where you stand the problem is today is we've got too many it's not i was listening to a message and it's about ready to eat but the we believe that if we take our eyes off of what the scripture says you see how when you when you get off just a little bit in the beginning by the time you get a mile down the road you're way way up that's right brother brandon talks about shooting his rifle and if he's off just a slight by the time it hits the target way off along there's many preachers inside the message oh if you break down what this word really means but it's gone to really study but they you grow we would listen to tapes every uh wednesday and sunday night we would listen to tapes and sunday morning they would do a little exhortation on the on the tapes my family my family and my uncle's family are the only children out of that entire church still serving the lord and then when they start getting older and they start getting exposed to the world they don't know where the foundation of the faith was built is so if you don't know why you believe brother branham if god gives you a revelation it's based on his word then you see it in his word if the world didn't give it to you the world can't take it away they go in one day and get an x-ray is it's because we're living in the supernatural the past unless you're natural we don't base our our faith off of five senses but we base it off the sixth sense which is faith in so we could see in this story of these three hebrew children they knew exactly where they were standing with god [Applause] that can do so we thank god for holy ghost-filled pastors is but i can guarantee you one thing measure guarantee that when my dad would come home with his belt i deserved that it wasn't because he wanted to hurt there's a we built a church in in houston texas houston texas huge baptist church many many many members and in dealing with some of their uh higher-ups the young people can come and they can have their little concerts they've got light shows inside the sanctuaries [Music] they have songs that'll get you all pumped up and you jump up and down says and unto the angel of the church of the ladies right says i know thy works that thou art neither cold or hot get your name i would out of my mouth can we see what's happening in the in our culture right now because you say that i am rich we have never seen so much prosperity prosperity like we have in the world today where children can post videos on tick-tock videos that all these little children running around funky let's and they don't even know and the prophet of our age even a member of the prophet you would preach against those things you would warn him and say this could destroy your ministry that you're ready and they don't that in christ's time wasn't very far off but here we are two thousand years later in the catholic church it's the thing farthest away from the truth and we see the same thing happening in the message we must study [Applause] and we see the same thing happening in the message you have two extremes extreme we're walking a tight rope you know someone travel and we must keep perfect balance because on one side ignoring the revelation of today in ephesians the the scripture talks about it oh god will reveal himself but how is he going to reveal you're ignoring the reveals himself trying to put brother branham the you must keep balance when they started baptizing in brother branham's name he took himself off the scene but yeah he told brother perry green may idea for peregrine [Applause] oh but you can't preach against all these things when people see you dressed modestly in the store offensive to them but they say it's offensive because of conviction something that can help them out of that [Music] praise oh if you're democrat or you're republican republican i mean people are sending death threats to one another because you believe a little bit different politically well they're trying to divide the the whites and the blacks it's a shame i know people in the message claiming that brother branham was a racist so you can't deviate to the right none of this has been in my notes i'm sorry yes we believe do you see that so here we are yeah we've got the three hebrew boys we're now presented with a choice the king is said i i heard [Music] you three are not bowing [Music] where he says he says and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands oh unbeknownst to him not knowing to him he just challenged to a true believer he is challenging the healing power of christ he's going to take god at his word and say lord you gave me a promise because who is that we are not careful to answer thee in we're not going to try to make you feel good serve praise the lord glad you our god who we serve is able to deliver us [Music] burning fiery furnace did you oh praise the lord but amen if not messi no be it known unto the o king that we will not serve thy god [Applause] it doesn't matter if we get sick we serve a god that will heal us he decides not to mercilessly known oh satan oh we're not going to bow down oh praise the lord well that didn't really make the king very happy i'm sure you can i mean he's got a little bit of a god complex complex the superiority as king they said a royal crown upon history everybody does as he commands them to do hello so when someone is honest with him it tells him how it really is it doesn't make him very happy same thing happens with the devil he's so used to and therefore we will overcome the king commands them to make that fiery furnace the one that would already burn someone to death he gets angry and he says make that thing seven times hotter first church fifth church age hotter than j hotter there is he dismissed them to get the most great warriors is it seems that they have control of their life too much for the greatest [Applause] oh it's so fantastic the warriors were killed the bonds that they were in turned away but it did not touch the balloon [Music] [Applause] we meet god in the midst of the fight but we're we're afraid of of tribulation we're afraid you want to get closer to god you want to build your faith this is [Music] hallelujah all of us were [Applause] i'm going to just jump to this is this is a little off topic but it just came to my heart there was a wise man that told me one time he said if you're struggling with things of the world he said you must have a holy ghost experience experience that is greater than the outside worldly experience the experience of demand and that's our problem as many times we don't have that experience with the holy ghost or at least we don't have an experience with the holy ghost is greater than the experience greater than that experience experience so until you get an experience with the holy ghost that is greater than your experience with the world experiences have a problem he was talking about how um jacob emilia and you would say if any one of us break our words so shall we be and see what you say and he said on the cross how jesus came down when he died christ broke him in half [Music] body and spirit and now his body is up sitting on the throne portion of the deal your portion is the holy ghost under and we'll leave that there there's your villain where do we find god in the midst of the fire amen do we believe that if we were to hop over into um joshua yes we see an amazing story here you know historic stella excellence dc uh joshua 10. and there was a king that came to joshua and he said joshua i've got a problem he said i've got five other kings each one of those kings is bigger than isis but i have five kings coming against it would you help me so joshua goes to the lord and he says lord should we go down and fight with them in verse 8 chapter 10 of joshua and the lord said unto joshua he said fear them not. for i have delivered them into thine hands i just love the way that christ says things but he says i have already deleted so now joshua has the promise it's already done all he has to do is play his part believe the word of god did you he says for i have delivered them into thy name there shall not a man of them stand before thee there's [Applause] whatever problem comes your way so then i like what the scripture says after receiving the promise joshua didn't say yeah okay i've got a promise we can go to battle with but the scripture says that joshua went down immediately and went down to battle with it and i just think it's pretty amazing that god didn't just leave joshua by himself but he sent hailstones out of heaven [Music] killed more of the enemies but because joshua had a promise in verse 8. joshua was fighting fighting a combatant and i [Applause] you have bartimaeus and there's jesus of nazareth walking down the road and he says jesus jesus jesus thou son of david have mercy on so i ask you now we read these scriptures about joshua and we think oh there's no way but what is greater stopping the sun in the sky we're stopping the son of god in his trust because you have a need which one was more supernatural praise the lord but joshua knew exactly where he stood me god gave him a promise all he had to do was stand on that problem and there's scriptures that say electricity repent be baptized for the remissions of your sins and then the other scripture says in this promise foreign brother branham preached why christ screaming and yelling you guys can't get too excited people already think you're so spiritual what happens if you come up to the altar oh but you're a preacher oh no you don't you if you come up here to repent if they were to get a ticket for the world cup they would fly all the way across the country across the world [Music] [Applause] right we have nothing to be ashamed of [Applause] [Applause] going down he the son of god he said go your way for your faith saves you edicano hallelujah hallelujah your faith saves you that was enough desperation [Applause] let me i don't see nothing yet when jesus said thy faith has saved them that was enough we can think of was it uh what was that blind man's name in brother branham's meetings [Applause] when brother john ryan comes up through the prayer lines brother random says you're healed everybody it seems that nothing has and you know what he quit caring about what other people say hey he starts selling newspapers hey extra extra read all about it and then he gets up just like any other day he's just to come to todd rojo he sits in the barber chair and they're poking a little bit of fun at him [Applause] [Applause] you go [Applause] [Music] he was just half halfway shaved [Applause] oh he didn't care what people thought about it [Applause] he just [Music] god loved you so much he's above everything to choose but he loved you so much but he didn't want to live in paradise all by himself and brother vincent when you get a bride don't you want to give her everything you can ask forever so imagine the pressure at the bottom have you guys ever gone swimming and tried to see how deep you can die [Music] imagine the pressure from the pressure on the bottom of that pipe is less than what god wants to fill you with the holy ghost amen so he also said you see that if you go to hell guess he was alone the holy ghost on display blatantly denying it then this promise is for me hallelujah hallelujah it's just that simple i'll try to wrap it up with one more of it i'm sure brother foss and some of these other brothers know yeah sometimes you get so many things built up that trying to fit it in one message it can be very difficult there's just too much to talk about like that song says if the oceans were full of ink [Music] and all the skies were full of parchments it still couldn't contain it so then you're trying to cram the pasta into an hour i'm not a long-winded preacher so i can preach that pretty easy all right wisdom versus faith [Music] if you could type that in sister i want you guys to read this word foreign which is the holy spirit in the church there it is well sure right there in the the holy spirit in the church the santa speed only gliese i like this part he says satan be careful hallelujah hallelujah that's enough to make a methodist shout out you can lock my brother paul in prison oh you could give my my my sister a heart problem it doesn't you better be careful we've already received the promise that there's going to be a bribery because there's going to be a generation basketball generation that isn't going to take death as an answer and i believe that it is this generation we're not going to have to taste death oh you [Applause] and the world can't take [Applause] just because we're here on earth it doesn't change who we really are and the devil always likes to come and say oh yeah you think you know who you are you've done [Applause] let's look in this book of all my sins and shortcomings because according to the word of god that when i confess my sins because you confess me they are put into the bleach and those sins he's the guy that tries to trick you into doing something and then he calls the cops but when you turn back into the law books mekong and we're both standing he was the one who did it so you want to keep talking about our pastors he doesn't want to talk about that because we're just taking god at his word and that settles it is [Music] filled with the holy spirit and when that happens satan be careful praise god job had it happened one time and i'll close with this job everybody was against job oh they loved him when he was prosperous oh you don't let prosperity he only only makes it on a prosperity but as soon as things start to go wrong the thing that was closest to him i told him just curse god and die it is just that there was something something rose up with inside of jokes just say let my redeemer live we don't have to put this off for another generation hopefully something was said to encourage you baby [Applause] amen amen do you appreciate the brother ben who's that person of heaven thank you to every young people like this who have what they come to see in this uh generation that's it generation serving the lord says being faithful a confident it's grace it's a big grace stay tuned around the glass this young man is very very humble their house their amazon it's always open one time i had the privilege to go to the ranch in arkansas like i was like somebody the way they treat you and i believe even the young people who went to the camp i think they the boy they rent a special house for that was the case the way they always treat the people very very wonderful family twin family premieres and this young band they say how many knows that uh he fly a private jet convince of killer volleyback he has a private jet injet prive and from time to time say by the first time can we go to arkansas i'm gonna fly you around and this is what he does most of the sunday he's working here saturday night he take his private jet he goes to meet the family over there and they come back sunday night for work on mondays [Music] but when it comes to the word of god they stand they have uh they stand they have like the
