amen amen so this morning uh we have a graduation ceremony taking place right now at reg [Music] University uh that's why we didn't see brother CHS and sister Grace kalala and uh hope went to the graduation ceremony it uh sister patience also yes yes uh Grace kalala Grace kalala is uh one of our children here uh I have received Grace kalala here when she was I think four years old uh to complete her bachelor in nursing uh it should be really an opportunity for me to be there and support but unfortunately raes is a Jesuit school this is where I graduated also uh they have to do it on Sunday so we want to thank God for the big achievement for sister Grace and also this Friday uh there will be graduation for Hope l [Music] she's graduating with a bachelor in [Applause] accounting uh we thank God for them and we pray for them for the biggest [Music] Milestone the coming milestone uh for them to be graduated to go to heaven uh I think in 19 2014 I preach a sermon on graduation uh the thing that we look at the nature in order to graduate you have to put a lot of effort and when you go to the ceremony they give some with some graduate with honor some without honor but where we are going we will have a big graduation ceremony and you want to be there with the greatest distinction that has ever existed and there is no graduation if you get 99% we have to be 100% with the word let's be the name of the amen amen uh and also I would like to announce that next Sunday after church God willing I want to have a meeting with the Sunday School teachers and the parent who have children going to Sunday School uh because we realize that uh our children we have to prepare them also for the greatest graduation and taking the children just to school to church it's good thing but it's not all the pressure in this country is so big that if there is no effort on the family side and the church side we will be sorry to raise those children in the church many will tell you I'm just home because of the age once I turn 18 nobody can tell me anything I used to teach Sunday school when I used to go to another church here most of the kids that were in my class when I asked about today the majority have been in prison many became mothers without being married this country America don't take it as granted you can feed your children clothe them but the biggest reward is to take them to Heaven sir and if as parents we are negligent that's the reason why brother Bram said it's not children who are delinquent it's the parent in order for the children to come to Sunday school for example it takes the effort of you parents if you parent you are negligent you give priority only to your job you are going to be disappointed I you remember one of the day I played the video here uh of what was taking place in Congress here in America about Tik Tok I don't know if many have gone back to listen to that debate it's very very all our kids they know the problem here the children with interaction with Public Schools they know more than us parents and this is the truth don't count on them when they come with their stuff they they can speak a language here myself and most of the parents we will not understand it they know what I'm saying is true sister is that true sister is it true your African parents they are limited in knowledge so it will require us as the church to prepare also to have also a counter [Music] attack the devil is not playing even from the very very little age they have put in place a curriculum with even the cartoons you see they put the children they are teach teaching them things that we don't understand preparing their little mind to become lesbians and gays telling them in the cartoon you have to choose your own gender later on but as parent we are busy put the cartoon leave the child and you do other stuff he's learning it's a seed plant the seed when they are little so that when they grow up they will challenge their own parents so the parent who think like Sunday school is not relevant uh just pay attention now brother Bram was telling us I want to read a portion of that the blessing Prophet parag 33 brother was talking back then on how our children are victim they are victim of this environment they are victim of this educational socalled educational system you take them to school they spend more than 8 hours without you with teacher with perverted teachers I don't want to use the appropriate word welcome Papa I was thinking like I will introduce you to but you were here the other day God bless you brother Bram said par 33 toward the middle to see this young women coming this young women weeping life before them they are at the Cross Road Cross Road means you don't know if you should go left right or continue or backward they are a victim of circumstances the decision they are making in this country about school about what what what make those children victim do you realize old men when we were boys our boys no has got 10 times the temptation that we had when I was a young boy I did not have a phone there was no whatsappapp there was no Tik Tok all the thing did not exist but those children today in the days of William Bram Temptation was 10 times from then to now it can be 100 times and as parents we don't know sister do you realize that your daughter as 10 time the Temptation you had when you was a girl what will her daughter have if we don't do something for Our Generation here what they are going to be it will be shame after shame on the family and on the church we want to do our part but we need their participation of parents sometimes you see Sunday school children not present for maybe three four five session they give their homework they don't do and parent you expect them to be better tomorrow let me close up that page so we will speak more God willing next Sunday and I would like the Sunday school teacher also to prepare some material based on the experience interaction with the children the kind of music those children you see here what they know and the type of dances you will be amazed the type of language keep the Lang so let me stop here so uh speaking about uh the July meetings uh we are going to have as we said already from July 3rd to July 7 uh meeting with a special guests uh there will be about four speakers and uh I think I want to give them a theme they will be talking about will be on the bride Revival at the end of Gentile dispensation because brother bam said at the end of every dispensation it should be Revival and Revival is not to bring new people in the church Revival is to revive those you have already those who don't have oil in the lamp to go look for it that's really the program we have and uh we have also uh on the Church website uh the registration that started last uh Tuesday uh for people who going to participate for the banquet only uh young people from age 17 up and we will also join married couple from 1 to 10 years old of marriage brother said most of the marriages breaks within the first 10 years so to register I think we said for the banquet because it's outside single will pay $50 for the meal that will be served and the couple will pay $80 because it's two people and uh whatever will be paid I think the difference will be added by the church uh and the registration will end by the end of this month May 31st uh last time we saw people coming last minute we don't want to accept it this time and mainly we do it for our local church so don't wait pass the delay ask for exemption because we need to pay the hotel and tell them the number ahead of time yes so two weeks ago I have asked for volunteers who want to help in different capacities so there are some people who have requested and the those others like uh they wait last minute but we cannot wait yeah so we will have the we will need help with uh this uh commissions uh I will ask the people want to work for a special commission uh to gathers and choose the one will be in charge themselves but uh for cleaning we have a brother Junior mavinga uh and he is saying by the way that those who want to help with a cleaning they can see him after church and uh for food I think it was sister Solange and sister patience uh and for the general coordination we will have brother Maita assisted by Brother Emmanuel Chima and uh they will also look for option for lodging and Transportation uh I'm going to ask you if you have a home available that you can host a guest uh please let the commission know uh we want to give more priority for people coming far away not the people living in America compared to those coming overseas amen amen so that's all we have I think the rest of the commission you can start already uh get prepared and organized don't wait always the last minute so once again this morning we have uh the visit of Pastor uh Gideon who came with uh his wife sister any mama can you stand once [Applause] again so there will be also with us this coming Wednesday God willing before they continue their Journey so let us stand as we welcome Pastor Gideon to the platform and they [Music] sing [Music] yeah I am TI and so

to3 we are going to speak for a little while about the calb uh inheritance we're going to read the word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the Lord commanded Moses and the children of Israel did and they divided the land then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gil gilat and Caleb the son of jeanet and the K kite said unto him thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in the Kadesh barer 40 40 years old old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from the kadish Bania to spy out of the land and I brought him words against again as it was in my heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the hearts of the people melt but I will followed the Lord of my God amen and Moses swear unto that day saying surely the land whereon thy feet have troen shall be thine inheritance and thy children forever because thou has wh followed the Lord my God and now behold the Lord has kept me alive and he said these 40 and five years have even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses verse 12 now therefore give me this mountain wherefore whereof the Lord spake in this day for thou heardest in that day in how the anakim were there and there the city were great and fenced if so be the Lord will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said and Joshua blessed him and gave him Caleb the son of Jean he abon for inheritance may the Lord bless his word you may be seated we trust the prayers that has been given to us for the meeting of tonight this morning text is speaking of the the dividing of the [Music] land dividing the country among the children of Israel that equals to adoption and as the prophet says that the Book of Joshua is like the the Book of Joshua in the Old Testament in the book of Ephesian in the New Testament I really love this test text verse six Cale saw that Joshua was uh dividing the land and came to him and said you know what the Lord said about me and you amen amen [Music] Cale knew what was said about him and that was said about Joshua amen amen if you notice Caleb doesn't tell Joshua give me a mountain but he just said give me this mountain he knows his [Music] he could identify his inheritance amen amen said this in the message our position in Christ 50 he said now in his church you are positionally seated in Heavenly places in Jesus Christ he said

somewhere why now here amen amen and it will announce you amen amen I pray that God calls you and anoint you he will anoint you for a certain service amen amen for no whatever service you need the anointing God has to anoint you for a certain service for certain things to [Music] do it will not be laying on hands on the [Music] elders it will be the laying of hands on the for the almighty God himself to put a Ministry in you it's not just to preach the word no matter what you do for God it's a Ministry he will put a new robe on you and set you out as an example amen amen God will anoint

out in his example when God anoints you you're not a hidden person God has to [Music] expose as an example am you need the anointing this morning for whatsoever you about to do amen when God anoints you and set you out as an example said all the demons out of your torment will not upset you when God anoints you don't be afraid the anointing protect when God elevates you the same anointing that elevates you will protect you all the demons will never torment you am amen oh God to my that each of us receive this blessing am amen am amen may God anoint you for a service for whatsoever you want

talking here about Joshua and amen what does that mean for us the spoken word is Original Seed he said Joshua represent the leader of the end time that has been promised amen amen the messenger of the hand time that was Joshua you Cale we represent the faithful believer amen are we together as I'm speaking of Joshua I'm speaking of William when I'm speaking of Cale I'm speaking of you and I we together Cale is a faithful believer that's cling to the message but notice C could see in the message what has been said about Joshua and what has been said about himself are we together most of the time we are more interested to know about what has been said about Joshua which is good but we have to know what has been said about us that is why is telling J you know what God said about me about you are we together God did not just spoke about josua he also spoke about Cale amen yes my brothers and sisters that is why Cale said give me this m am he knows his he knows his position amen amen he

went over into the promised land Promised Land amen Keb is a True Believer do we have believer here this morning amen but what represent the land that has been divided said in invisible union he said God has separated us amen and gave us a new country new land a new message for this day are we together Joshua is the prophet C is you and I is the church and the country the land is the message are we together in the message amen and jhua amen and the land has to be divided hallelujah amen I want to say this Revelation 10 verse 1 this is Joshua territory a el of Malachi 4 Revelation 107 said the seventh seal paragraph 384 he said we are now at the age of the ego am amen 's [Music] age where the whole Revelation has to be given now apocalypse compare that with Revelation chapter 10 verse 1 to 7 are we together we'll see here in Revelation in Revelation verse 10 [Music] 1 that in the days of the sing of the seventh angel amen amen then was to finish all the mysteries of God I cannot do it you cannot do it it's to him to reveal the Mysteries amen that is his own territory in the land that is his sh in the land am amen when the angel come with the open book amen he has to find on Earth the seventh angel throughout the ages the angel was crying sh who's worthy to take the book and to break the seals nobody in heaven nobody on the earth nobody under the Earth the Redemption of the whole Humanity depends on that book John started crying because nobody was in heaven no no on the earth no under the Earth to take the book not even to look at it amen the book that Adam lost hallelu amen now the seven The Voice told John don't cry amen because the Lamb of the child of Judah has been found worthy to take the book and to break the seals when he's taking the book and it started coming down the first verse the seventh angels has to be on the earth at that coming because the one has to receive the book are we together he receives the book he breaks the seals he Reveals All the Mysteries that has been hidden throughout the ages I'm taking one mystery the de of Jesus Christ in the baptism while throughout the ages people were baptized in the name of the Father and Son and Holy Ghost when William Bram com he said noce Jesus said baptized in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost he didn't say in the name of the father in the name of the son in the name of the Holy Spirit as if there were three names he said notice when Jesus said in the name of the father son and the Holy Ghost the name is in singular and that the great scholar didn't see it the name is in singular means the name of the father it's the same name for the son the same name for the Holy Spirit he said Father and Son and Holy Ghost it's not names it's are titles amen the name it's what Peter will reveal in act chapter 2 when they receive the Holy Spirit he said bapti them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's the name of the father it's the name of the son it's the name of the holy spirit amen and Jesus when he was on the earth Jesus said I came in my father's name I came bearing my father amen when he reveal all these Mysteries that was his territory that was his share in the land when he reveal all them things and he finish all these Revelations Amen in the message what is the attraction on the mountain paragraph 52 and he said and the God in heaven promise the evening time will have evening lights three years ago this mystery was prophecy what time is it sir what time is it sir it's Revelation 1 1017 amen he said but now it's history passed the promise is fulfilled what time is it sir and what is the attraction fulfilling his word amen amen now when it's been fulfilled it was the of end time when that was fulfilled amen now we're going to CB territory the true let's read chapter 10 verse 8 to 11 1 to 7 it's the seventh angel now Revelation 108 to1 the Bible says the voice that I heard from Heaven spake unto me saying go take the little book which was open in the hands of the angel which standed upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it eat it and it shall be that belly bitter it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and John said and I took the book out of the Angel hands and I he it up and he was in my mouth sweet as honey as soon as I my belly was bitter verse 11 and they said unto me that must prophesy again before many peop nations Kongs and Kings amen now when seven Angel got to the end of his ministry before leaving the scene The Voice told John go quickly take the book out of the hands of the Angel amen because the angel has not to leave the Earth with the book he doesn't have to go with the book somebody's with me go to the angel take the book eat the book and eat it up said joh represent every man and every woman that believe this word John represent every girls and boys that believe this word if you believe the message of the Angel John represent you am I speaking to John this morning am I speaking to John this morning go to the angel be with me don't lose me go to the take the book and heat it up today the book is no longer at the end in the end of the seven Angel John has taken up the book and the The Voice didn't tell John just contemplate the book but heit it up the book that we speaking the book of redemption it's not just bunch of papers it's a deity it's Christ himself are we together the book that is coming down it's not bunch of papers it's Christ himself is the coming down to dwell in the church even after the departure of the prophets where he went he won't need the de are we together we are like Elijah in Elijah when the cross the the Jordan Elijah had to go to Elijah had to stay on Earth are we together Elijah is is the church in the end time Elijah didn't have to leave the Earth with the mle because the mental have to to part the Jordan in heaven there's no Jordan to open El should stay on the earth if he doesn't have the mle he will die on the other side to cross the children you need the mental that is why he cried my father my father when El was he dropped the mantle amen amen because was El that will need a m if I die tonight the same Field of Fire will not go with me will stay on the earth he has to stay with the church be in each and every one of you because you have Jordan to cross as the pastor was saying you the one have temptation to overcome where Elijah went he doesn't have any Temptation the book will not serve the mental will not happen the pill of fire will not happen where he went there's no Tri there's no temptation we we have temptation to over am that is why the voice told John the voice is tell go to the angel take the book swallow the book eat it up don't just look at the book I always want to say the book that John took was not another book was the same book that Elijah had the the book that had gave to the seven angel it the very same book that John is taking and the same book the same deity has to have the same effect am amen the same book the same theal of Elijah the same mental that El had the same message has to produce the same effect now listen and the voice told John take the book swallow and prophesy again I don't know in English why you in French there are two things they didn't say prophesy in French they didn't say prophesize again or a new there's a difference in French to prophesy a new that you you're saying you prophesying the second time but you saying another thing by prophesying again it's the same prophecy John doesn't have the same [Music] message he has to prophesy again the same message that is why once Elijah left the SE said you are The Messer of the same message when you are messenger of the same message the same message is followed by the same kind of Life the same works and has to be confirmed by the same pill of fire are we together prophesy again now listen said prophesy it also means testify amen John doesn't eat the book to stay in his local church when you eat the book you have to prophesy again to many nations to many Nation many people many tongues given to the kings are we together you have to testify testify of this message in your way of place of work in your environment you have to testify you have to speak of this message amen you don't swallow the book to stay quiet when take the

God without inheritance what good will we do to you to be a son and daughter of God without you don't know what belongs to you you don't know your position you have nothing to do in Christ there's no jobless everybody got to do something even in this church you we don't have to have everybody got to do something yes my brothers and sisters now listen I always said we have brought a lot of people to have the Holy Spirits we have a lot of people that have the Holy Spirit maybe two or three uh trustees two or three are deacons one or two preaching and others they have the Holy Spirit but they don't do anything no no they have to do something that's why one day God will speak to you and he will anoint you for service he will anoint you for something he will anoint you for you have to do

have means you have money nobody's humble when he's not in a position of strength if you're a great uh fighter and with the little man he wants to beat you up and you said I'm humble usually you are afraid are we together somebody has Muses he's telling you I want to beat you and then you saying I'm humble it's when you're going to have big muscles in front of a little one then they will know you humble when you are in a position of strength that's what Joseph did he was governor in Egypt this brother did Bad Thing to him he was in a position to Kill Them All to avenge himself to put them in prison in that time in a position of strength that he will forgive are we together he had all the means to put them in prison without judgment without trial who will judge Joseph it's when you in that position of strength then people will know you humble before Temptation that's when we know you you're a Christian before Temptation that's when we know you're Christian amen yes my brothers John had to swallow the book the church has to take the book it has to take the de have to Veil theity to testify prophesy again to prophesy again to many people am Amen to many tongues amen let people know Christ by you when you have the book you're not quiet the book excites you amen and pushes you to speak to somebody it pushes you to testify amen amen even to avoid somebody at the church because this is your inheritance amen amen yes my brother and sisters you got to have your inheritance in the message yes my brother and sisters this is the truth you have to know who you are if you don't know who you are you have no fa I'm speaking uh preaching the message perfect Faith paragraph 64 he's speaking of Jesus Christ now listen how he's going to conclude he said Jesus had Faith with his power how did he he said I cannot do nothing in myself why he relied upon what he was are we together he RI in knowing that he was the word even before Lazar he remembered it was written of him he was the life and Resurrection now he's standing before death he remembered is the life and the resurrection that anoint him and he said Lazarus come out because he was conscious death cannot resist before life and Resurrection most of the time even when we fall before Temptation it's because we forgot who we we we we are before the greatest temptation just put your your chest out remember who you are amen amen it gives you Victory you walk on Temptation amen amen a Son of God am amen yes my brother and sisters he trusted he had faith in God he know what he was the word he had faith in God who made him the word amen amen he was God the word and he was in him and that gave him even Jesus needed Faith but his faith came from the knowledge of who he was am amen because he understood his position am amen if you don't know your position in the land you won't have any faith you know the position of Joshua what about your position said you know what God Said about me and you but what has been said about you he understood his position he knew what he was because the scripture had said he was this amen and paragraph 68 said now now the only thing you have to do then the only thing how many the only thing that you have to do then is have faith in where you are to have faith in who you are a son of God I love to say this way Jesus said I'm a Son of God and when he said that the phes took the stones he wanted to Stone him out it's not true but today we say we Son of God it doesn't uh irritate or upset the devil nobody Stones us there's a problem somewhere when Jesus when Jesus said I'm a son of he didn't say I'm God he said I'm a Son of God the devil got mad he wanted to Stone him he said why are you stoning me why wrong did I do but today we say we Son of God he doesn't upset the devil no demon is upset nobody's stoning us we saying why we saying the same thing as Jesus there's a problem somewhere I don't know if you noticing it as me that we have a problem we have to fix it the phes said because you are a man you making yourself God therefore Son of God but we when we say we're Son of God we don't know who we are demon that we don't know what we talking about that is why they don't even get mad I'm a Son of God I'm a Son of God the devil look at you now he just repeating scriptures there's nothing there that is why they [Music] quiet but the day we see as Jesus was saying with a profound Revelation with a deep conviction because in reality let me tell you God doesn't have 50 Sons he doesn't have 600 Sons the Bible says the only begotten son God only had one son is the only son you become son when the son comes in you when the son divid himself and get in you that's when you become son you don't you're not Son by yourself that's why we don't have to upset the devil because we make ourselves son without having the son in us because when the son is in us the Bible says I said you are God amen amen amen amen you are Gods if we have that deep Revelation and we identify ourselves to that the world will change things will change even our lives will change we will have victories and we go from Victory to Victory amen yes my brothers and sister this is the exact truth the only thing you got to do is to have faith in who you are let me say it this way you can have faith in brother BR amen amen that can help you until a certain level when you in front of a tri in front of Temptation in front of a problem you have to have faith in who you are let me repeat this you can have all the faith in one brother but when you of a real trial real problem the god of gram will not Happ you he has to become your own God are we together if it doesn't become your own God you are speaking of the god of is he won't help you and we are in the time where as the pastor the devil doesn't play around as we play he just boosting his power when he's going up we are distracted let us come up amen amen let us know what God said about us are we together [Music] God will not judge you for what he did with William Bram no no he will not judge you or for what he asked abam to do he will judge you for what he asked you to do we my yes my brothers and sisters amen amen oh oh John eat the book swallow the book prophesy again amen amen testify again amen amen said the only thing you can do is to have faith in who you are have faith in what the word says you are amen have faith in that amen amen in what the word says you are says Jesus had faith in the word of God that said what he was that is why he could say it's written of me what is written of you then that is what Caleb said to Joshua you know what God says about me Cale was a courageous believer he started by himself he didn't start by what God said about Joshua he said you know what God said about me and about you first about me amen the Believers today they afraid to say that oh my friends and oh my brothers and sisters oh oh my beloved paragraph 167 now you see Jesus knew what he was that's why he had Faith 77 and he's saying this in the message perfect Faith perfect Faith then it's not faith in somebody else the perfect faith it's the faith in who you [Music] are Faith could produce when he knew what he was when you know who you are your faith will produce amen amen yes my brother and sisters your faith will produce you will be anointed by your own deity before trial before Temptation you remember what has been said about you and that anoints you am amen that anoints you and produce results change situation amen knowing who you are gives you faith that is why I took this text you know you know what God said about me and about you amen amen amen amen yes my brother and sister when you know who you are your faith can produce whatever that's when God said everything you shall ask when you know who you are you're not just repeating scriptures you know you tell who you are you speak who you you know who you are you know exactly who you are am just repeating scriptures we saw on Friday that Joseph and Mary they were thinking that Jesus was with them because it's written where two or three are gathered I'm among them say brave people sincere people they can walk without Jesus without noticing it just repeating scriptures it's true that the scriptures said way two or three but Jesus was not there with them amen therefore you got to know who you are what is your position in the message the day the church will understand am the prophet will not be in history it's a history it's a reality the message will continue to live yes my brother and sister amen the church did not understand this position yet am amen I want you to know who you are said in the M of Jesus Christ the same yesterday to Forever uh February uh February 5th 61 says you got to know your position first do are we together I said 16 you have to know your position first not the position of the pastor your position the pastor has his position amen everybody got to have his own position are we together first you have to we have left people coming to the message we don't even know what they're doing in the message they not even interested to know what is the position what God is expecting from them

the message am amen now listen to second king now it was elishah after the departure of the Prophet the church that took the mentor the same Mentor that crossed the the Jordan and then he's going back to Jericho when they passed by with El are we together now he's going alone because I got to let you walk alone are we together are we together they went together with Elijah across the Jordan but when Elijah is coming back he's coming back alone are we together listen way my heart is broken and the people of Jericho when the sons of the Prophet which were View at Jero saw they said the spirit of Elijah does rest on Elijah and they came to meet him and bow thems to the ground before him are we together and the people of Jericho they saw Elijah walking with Elijah and SE Elijah coming by and they said the spirit that was upon Elijah is on Elisha but us our modern version was will be like this people that knew Elijah when they see us they say all the books message books that elij had all the tapes the pictures El Elisha has the pictures the tap he has all the the tapes they don't have to recognize us byes they have to recognize by the spirit that was on William yes my brothers and sisters it breaks my heart for people to know that you believe the message you have to show them the book El didn't show them the spirit of Elijah the Divine love that he had humility that he had sincerity that he had the power of God that went along with him we're not even humble once we have a little bit of means we became proud and then we show the picture I don't know if somebody is understanding suffering or sharing my suffering my pain they didn't say to Jero Elijah has all the pictures of Elijah no my brothers what testimony do we have they only can recognize Us by pictures you bring up the book sh you see who are you you show your pictures we are from this that wasn't the case for Elijah when Elijah went Elijah got J he didn't ask where is Elijah he said where is the god of Elijah he wanted to experience the same God let him become my own God because from now on I have to walk by myself when he crossed the Jordan people that knew the ministry of of Elijah they looked no the very same spirit that was upon Elijah is on these people the Bible says and they went bow thems said the message the man called from God 858 84 and 85 he said notice now that man that was just a little man young man he's speaking of Elijah I'm speaking of the church I'm speaking of I speaking of John that took the book God made his name Immortal all the prophet that stood around watching him had to bow to his feet because he had the power of God upon him not because he had not because he had pictures those things are good and they have good places but the B because he had the power of Elijah and the spirit of God rested upon him5 said the has come God will bring forth the world to bow down to the feet of men and women that cross the Jordan because you only cross the Jordan with Elijah you only cross the Jordan with the spirit of Elijah the hour has come let this hour be there amen amen since 58 that hour is still coming the hour has to come amen amen said and they they
