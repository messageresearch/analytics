receive it and accept it foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] I existed should I go and pray for the baby while brother Barnum is here brother sister forever cannot do it all right the pastor cannot do it all but you are here for his purpose and the Holy Spirit has to come to you too amen and that sister was trying to manage a sexual return friend they said not to do it but finally I know you know the story finally she prayed was not on the platform when he came to the platform he mentioned that there was the thing to be done so that's the reason why when you come to foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] uh because this name platini is one of the biggest soccer player in France he made our day yes so last Wednesday we could not have a service yeah because of uh there's no this is the season City and I believe that each one of you had a wonderful service at home is that right how many edit services the rest of the people what do we do uh let me ask the children because they will tell you always the truth what about the Solomon did you have a service Wednesday at home sometimes before Shekinah look at me don't look at anywhere regardless when we have no service I believe we should always uh every service so after this morning service I will uh have a quick meeting with uh the people I send a text message to uh yeah so we have uh another trouble here with uh water it was a problem the repetition thank you musicians [Music] so I believe finally we are gonna get a new [Music] how do you call it a new way a new line with a new pipes yo just to solve it once forever because all the pipes I believe they are really old and they get uh a lot of trouble um and this morning I saw the people who came they do are they gonna start the work yes they will start this week okay um it's a lot of work thank God it's not anybody's fault but we need the money yeah this time you know I'm always shy but uh yeah I think that they are gonna charge us just for the material about eight thousand dollars between eight and ten thousand that's the outside people we need to do it in the next area and in addition to this hey um what's your place uh we have a big water bill in Grand Factory manual how much do you think Emmanuel convenient thousand the other day the other year they charged us about ten thousand and they splitted in two remember foreign that was the first one but the recent one we don't know yet usually usually we try to cover all of this but if it's a very very excessive I believe I have to um amen amen amen so uh I know we don't want to do this uh regularly but there are situations that happen we have no control we cannot push but it's what it is this is what is gonna bring blessing when you do it with a pure hot it will effective appear I know there are many people who are doing a lot of sacrifices may God bless them but you need to be also part of those blessings amen amen or sometimes you wonder a lot of situations why maybe God is not moving they both the situation but it's the way you treat that God sometimes you see complicated situations amen amen so uh Brother Richard and uh brother Matthew are in Belize if you can remember them in prayer foreign you don't know the culture you don't know the people you don't know the spirits but they have to depend on our prayers you have separation up here of them in prayer until God willing they will be back yes a couple weeks ago I married a couple here in the sanctuary you are not I think they are Indians so India they get contact with our sister Rachel is they wanted to get married if they say Maria but they don't they did not have money to pay the preacher yeah that was the ceremony ceremony the man was 24 years old my favorite cartoon and the girl who was 21. foreign that was it okay too and I look at the young people what make it so complicated yes hello hello very easy you don't need a complicated stuff the show's complicated but what you need is God failure to guide you and they really they think that uh push me to do the services it was because the past okay when I asked them few questions because this day you cannot marry people don't know like that um you have to make sure the man is a real man and the woman is a real woman and number two you know I don't know however there are County License is available the parents were okay and when I checked they never get married they were never married before and I asked them did you live together we don't even know each other yet those people they shallah they get married without touching one another sunset and you call them denominations as with the Revelation look at the struggle in regardless if you cannot leave the message God will have somebody somewhere to be a witness yes amen and it was the first time they kissed one another here so brother we don't need always to spend a lot of money for marriages because after marriage there is a life there is a life after marriage sometimes we go depth after death depth after death and after the funds are on the the death and death they are praying if you have a lot of money that's fine but if you cannot just leave the correct way find a nice person with a inborn person and you can even have the wedding ceremony at your own time amen amen so really I encourage the young people what advice do you give to a couple who plan to get married foreign [Music] [Music] desirable they are not the trees be flexible that's why you flexible if you try to be tough tough tough tough decisions it will be like the monkey who missed details so you you are gonna extend the thing for no reason I'm saying it with all my friends okay when I see pictures like this image comes and say and I think about my people she passed the mission I see I say maybe we did not preach right and the girl also you don't need to turn people down all the time worry about it and move on we cannot for no valid reason refuse bless and guide each one of you amen amen yeah when his brother doc came and said I have a couple they want to get married but they don't have money to pay the preacher last question talk with them the bottom line is to verify if there is no prior vowel's principles in some instances if a girl is under age even 17 years old but they can still get married with parent permission do you know that is do you know that yeah because when you go to the county to get your license they take they check your age on the ID loves passes yes permission I think my girl is mature is and then the pastor can do the services I don't say that uh marry them at 8 17 if they are not mature but this is to give you an idea that form 18 on you can um yes we we so we are going to turn the service for the preaching of the word as we stand we are going to have a brother this morning as uh we bring him to the platform [Music] changing me and changing you please wait for bad [Music] word of God [Music] foreign [Music] oh God word of God [Music] changing me can't change

overthrone the city that which thou has spoken verse 22 Refugee has the Escape dinner [Music] for I cannot do anything to that become better amen the name of the city was called amen amen if we're

pedestrians floated down busy streets others used kayaks or surfboards Statewide as Roe it's remain impassable some are still under evacuation California California is under a lot of shaking uh nuclear weapon that Russia wants to use uh in this war the Poseidon underwater drone is also known as statistics and in the United States as Canyon essentially a very large nuclear-powered autonomous torpedo armed with a nuclear warhead the drones are focused on damaging a critical component of the enemy's economy in coastal areas and inflicting unacceptable damage on the territory of a country by

done forever you see [Music] you better be getting right all of us amen amen foreign [Music] people are presuming [Music] [Music] this is a good position but now I've accepted with that kind of Faith you can pronounce it you can confessions condemns me in this spot it's like your trees that you have to make it right aside I believe God will speak to somebody today to wake him up foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] the person who can receive the message progress the science has advanced secretary which is the sign you know not showing us [Music] since the science has advanced Legends people are talking one language common language with the internet this is Twitter Facebook I don't know why it's blinding the spiritual eyes of Believers to watch over the world in such a way we have become prisoner of that science they learn the destruction [Applause] [Applause] foreign real assistant the king took the tools as a Manifesto and he started using it for his party just at the time that he was about to take him [Applause] he started writing many many taken with him it's why people are distracted so whenever what Jesus said this what people said peace upon the Earth peace and safety on the Years everybody at the same level [Music] the message of the devil under them when people will say peace it's something that comes in the unexpected how can I imagine just we are distracted uh I want to speak about everything that got taught in a very brief way foreign he says [Music] the world is feeling it the newspaper is Pentagon and I've heard that in Pentagon I don't know but they say that they don't know what to do and that's true that you just have ballistic missiles there's no way to stop it they don't know what to do about it and they won't know they will not know because they have rejected the word in your life there's nothing left but judgment Pentagon doesn't know what to do oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] this afternoon [Music] and too much a little bit too much sip of it especially drugs are allow everywhere and punch a button and that will send the entire world out of his orbit says to the scriptures [Music] but all these things that we have seen have happened this week lost in Reno come celesti when a meaning like this in this take place uh prepared are you with me beloved just follow me I won't be long when a meeting like this in this place happened people are concerned when people are unconcerned of the things of God it's a sign that shows that it's very near it's a sign that shows that the Rapture can take place something can happen now beloved let me examine myself examine yourself what interest are we giving to the things of God yes yes when a preacher is Anointed by the Holy Ghost yeah and Stefan before the people he says where the problem is [Music] so lack of interest of things it's a sign came out that shows something can happen either the Rapture or the end of the world what is the interest that we're really giving to God I understood prayer come was a press better when I preached even if he has to condemn me I didn't come to preaching I came to preach to us all of us please that we give more value to the the money that than the things of God basket when sometimes I come to church on Wednesday it's almost demand our church is only full on Sunday let us not fulfill the scripture about on the wrong side foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] you are do you want to tell us that God will show this world God is rich in mercies cannot destroy the world God will destroyed anyhow in the middle let me continue with this quote [Applause] the airport that's indicating that the things is and to see a little group that are gathering here that is warning you amen amen who is feeling that there's something inside of them that are warning them if you don't feel it this morning by the grace of God ask God to give you that thing says because this is a very dangerous uh space Zone that we reaching in wow some great theology might come to the city uh have a great lot of things you can come to the city and pronounce things correctly that's not what the church name is I'm just the way you know me says [Applause] I want to say paragraph 15. I don't want to read it foreign to me because in India there's not a lot of walls just walls sometimes the birds are they put the nest on the on the birds and people noticed two days before all the birds started Living leaving the nests even the beasts animals they started leaving the walls and being where there's no walls around why even the forecast didn't announce it but by something that is called instant birds or animals they don't have souls they just have the instantly they understood [Applause] [Music] people couldn't notice it foreign [Applause] see that there's a danger around us says you see Le petites only has instant person yeah he has no soul away from the world just by instance to keep them from being killed 40 how much more legally how the church yes oncoming judgments to pull itself out from all around the old hunts if you have to stand in the middle of persecution for the Redemption during night come again God and won this bird yeah also warns his people today that many people are living those great big cultures come on and make the stand with the children of God they will call them Fanatics they call them Fanatics whatever they wish to massage [Music] it's the great message for which God sent the prophet is getting the bread ready to have faith to go to the Rapture just look at that series God will inspire brother Obed to speak about the decision to make a decision about the church about what kind of life I have to live who's a life worker you notice despise other they didn't even show up certification okay it's a question the question that God because the things just watch the series he really insisted on the repentance today people don't like when they preach about repentance when they preach about Mysteries but when they have to touch sanctification you see everybody quiet it shows that there's something you see it shows that there's something under there you have to yeah [Music] you are a son of God of God When God says that you lack interest straightened [Music] a California preaching preach the message by taking the parable of my future spoke about it in this message in the 10 uh virgins all of them were virgins I'm a virgin Girl music I don't listen to the music of the world I don't steal if it's the only ghost in you that are producing them but if it's not the Holy Ghost producing them yeah good habits has to be produced by the Holy Ghost if it's not God who producers it's just your moral education or civic education that would not take you to heaven you need to be assured okay I have God producing the work that I do without that because when the scientists used to be the Holy Ghost this morning yes yeah [Applause] this is yours after preaching about the decision repentance now look what brother Ben preached the Samsung taking the scripture of Samson telling us Samson the top of the church some sort of preparations something took was trapped with uh Blended eyes [Music] the person is dead secular what is this you will just contend himself by being a good member of the church and then he stops there forever says I rather be blind physically blind get detravagirl spiritual than being a spiritually spiritually because if you are spiritually blinded sentence the Holy Spirit you feel like he's always speaks you'll be surprised spiritually blinded amen amen I'm watching the time don't worry legless the church it's like Samson blinded eyes there's a Grace for you yeah there's a Grace for me oh god of mercy no matter how my eyes become blind if you don't manifest the lack of interest if today I can come [Applause] [Music] no more to see people coming 30 minutes in late very different starting by the one preaching Legends the church it's a place of Correction the lack of Interest this thing really is interesting people shows proof that these things are coming near amen what is the condition of our souls this morning getting ready foreign I feel uh free to talk amen amen when I see the report that the pastor gave here in the church about the finance how we are in this building because we've got to pay for it and I felt like us as a church we are trying to do something yes God will bless us for what we're doing we we should have done more foreign [Music] this is not a blessing for us God will bless them and then he's saying the tight money was put to pay the deficit because we wouldn't be able to pay the house when the pastor Rafael came he had to say like this is when he has been said [Music] obey your leaders the rulers so that they cannot work uh that really touched my attention you know as we are here amen friends is it the truth I was watching so that we can obey the word the pastor the pastor Andrew he's doing a great job sometimes to pray overnight to bring all the requests of each and everywhere [Music] sometimes he has to stand there all night praying oh God but after that the tenth of the what you have to give to God is the one who's ready from all his own pocket to give it to us certainly sure it's a good thing but let the church understand what I'm saying in between us it's not always a good blessing for us I believe if we decide where the Burnham says once you have something one tenth it's not your money just give it to them don't necessarily now the building here it's not just a hundred dollars we can put it we make the job easy for the pastors foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] those things are new there will be a spirit of Pride that will start rising up a little bit spirit [Music] [Music] [Applause] rebuke latitude the attitude give here that comes after rebuke up service I should watch what kind of attitude you have after the rebuke Medina [Music] absolutely [Music] [Applause] [Music] rising up in his life when the bride came that call myself developer fast he started doing things they was not supposed to do like he was free to do whatever he wants I prayed God answered no I lived the word afterwards he went to take the the the burning okay [Music] [Applause] [Music] God will send you down don't you do it no I would do it anymore I don't have any sins this is not your place foreign [Applause] if you start saying [Music] like this I won't preach no more I won't work no more in the church they won't see me no more brother said yes just start by the lack of Interest comes on top of it at the end God will humble you salvation [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] where we became uh talkative may God help us amen amen are you with me [Music] this message before that is let me lyrics every time the messenger came he led to zoo he was always rejected by the church go back to this and find out throughout the age there never was a time that God ever sent a message in any age but why did you rejected to truth my friend what about you my brothers when the message came forward [Music] surely it does and we grow and grow row row rest and I revealed and call Lucky and Petty that the little remain that is coming up the seed from oh them or bless his name we are at the end that's right judgments you can look at and see the end writing every time every time the messenger that was went forth broken Grace and deliverance but God's message there has always been a message for the Judgment before the Judgment Noah had Deliverance had Deliverance [Applause] he was a message of Deliverance the people turn it down it's mercy and deliverance and the people turn it [Applause] [Applause] [Music] amen amen [Applause] how many salvation doesn't look the person next to you it's yourself and God amen amen the family the Lord the wife of love always she loves things of the world despise the message to come out of the world I just imagine maybe the Lord maybe the wife of Lord as the husband's living why people will say Fred brought me the devil can write somebody next to you just to uh distract you a remarkable look the wife of lots of them by force yeah the condition was when God to take you out of the world if you already confess if you already left the world don't look behind you amen amen even if the Devil comes in your mind don't look back Mela found the Lord by the wife of Lord she was walking all the celebrity name it was she was it was given to her all the beauties things of the world that was back there this world will really be this really America will be great do you really think God will destroy this place in the world really God will destroy [Applause] in the church [Music] [Music] [Applause] came out today people they are disappearing people

Let It Be and just be unjust still [Music] which is filthy says sweet Uncle Let It Be filthy still hey there is a Sanctified let it be holy still amen amen don't sleep when you sleep you're dragging me down [Music] you are the Church of God we are children of God we came to listen to give us instructions so that we shouldn't be at the rest of the world amen amen [Music] [Music] let it be holy still we're gonna get to a certain time oh where men even if the word of God is preached if it didn't make a good decision start getting worse in the same thing over and over [Music] they don't take communion is to get the people ready for the Rapture man but Japanese Spirit God can inspired the prayer meeting we don't show interest Deputy God can say Santa said communion the people they spend four to five years they don't take communion Let It Be filthy yes holy continues is starting very in a bad way how many pools I'm in the church God is giving you the opportunity today just take these
