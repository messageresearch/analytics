same time and so sure glad to hear that brother Mitch has got out as well and and so we're just thankful for God's grace Upon Our Lives let's look here in the Book of Revelations the uh second chapter and um we're going to uh we're going to do a lot of reading tonight um um this is a part that I've been wanting to get to for a long time and and um uh when you're talking about the tree of life and the tree of death and and um but uh amen it's so good I I I probably won't have too much to add to it and uh uh we might uh stop for a comment occasionally but if there's ever anybody who who um uh have questions uh on on these Wednesday nights especially when we're doing these kind of teachings raise your hand and ask amen if you if you got any kind of questions at all and um and so we will um uh we I know that we'll all enjoy it let's look here at at Revelations 2 and 6 um let's see let's let's let's go down to the sth verse and he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the church Church es to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the Paradise in the midst of the paradise of God Amen let's go to the Lord in prayer father we just want to thank you today for your blessings upon Our Lives thank you for the power of your holy spirit that you have given us and I I just pray Lord that you would be with every one of us tonight Lord you see the the needs that are here Lord you you see um those that are still recouping from that sickness just asking Lord that your Holy Spirit Will Will just uh be with them and encourage them Lord I just pray father that you'll be with brother Mitch and so glad that he and sister Denise are out of the hospitals Lord just thanking you for that and just asking that you would help them to recover Lord we're as we read tonight the church age book we just ask that your blessings would be here your spirit would sanction it and we'll just give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen you can be seated tonight um so if on your in your church age book um we're going to read here at um 97 and um so uh those that brought you Church age book amen U 97 we will we will start to read and and um brother brandom is going going to deal with the the uh tree of life and the tree of um death the knowledge of Good and Evil and so um as a preface to this um we everything about um of course we know that the Bible is a book of redemption and Revelation is the Book of Revelations is just is is really magnifying the end product of redemption and and what God has done to to bring the church into that rapturing condition and I think we all know that every human being um was in need of redemption and and that we were all born in sin yet there was one that was not born in sin amen because he was virgin birth so amen there's something about that virgin birth the Virgin birth had to come amen because we were all born in uh through sex and so um and and you know you it it makes you wonder why I remember as a kid wondering why I would have to be born again Nicodemus even asked that he says how can I be born again how can I go back and enter into my mama's womb the second time and so Jesus was saying no you've been the first birth wasn't the right birth amen so the second birth is what is going to correct the first birth and so um so we were born sexual amen which is of death and disease and and sorrows and so but Jesus did not have to be born again why because he came the spoken word uh the way that he was supposed to so amen so the reason why the scripture says there in in in 1 Peter 3 and and um 20 uh or 1 and 23 I believe it is that um amen being born not of sexual seed but of Incorruptible seed Eternal seed by the word of God which is by the word that is preached to us so as we as we read this along through here I want us to keep um those those things in our mind because um and we're going to find out that the Tree of Life in the beginning um amen and and matters of fact I don't think brother brandham is is actually going to deal with that at the very beginning so what we might do let's let's look here at Genesis the um the third um the let's just look at it here at the um uh the 2 chapter and the eth verse and then we'll get it started here it says and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed out of the ground the Lord God uh out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the site and good for food so I just want you to look there out of the ground everybody say out of the ground and if you're marking it amen you can just Mark that out of the ground every tree is good for food and uh Pleasant to the sight then he goes and says the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil so he's talking every ground out of the tree or out of the garden every tree out of the the ground was good for food but then the Lord also had some other trees in there now amen um and go to the 16th verse and the Lord commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest eat freely but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it but in the day that thou eat eatest their R Thou shalt surely die then you go on down to the third verse or the third chapter and the first verse now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he the serpent the one that was more subtle than any Beast now that word subtle is is um he's had a lot of knowledge he's crafty he's he's very smart he can communicate he can talk and so uh and he said the serpent yay hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree in the garden and the woman said unto this serpent she's talking to him we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God ha said You shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest you die and the serpent said this is that Beast under the woman ye shall not surely die for God doth know that in the days that you eat thereof then your eyes will be open and you shall be as God's knowing good now let's go to our church age book and we'll just we we'll get started here amen now brother brandham is going to he's he's the the scripture we opened up in in Revelations 2 and 7 um he he's reading he's reading there to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God he said this is the future reward and this is this this is the um second paragraph of 97 uh uh this is a future reward to all Overcomers of all ages when the last call to battle has been sounded and when our arm armors have been laid down then we will rest in the paradise of God and our portion shall be the tree of life forever the tree of life isn't that a beautiful figure of speech it is mentioned three times in the Book of Genesis and three times in the Book of Revelation in all six places it is the same tree and symbolizes the same thing so now for you kids so brother brandham is letting us know that this is not a natural tree all of the trees that were in the ground all them that were planted is good for food it was good to look at amen you can eat of every one of those trees but there's also the tree of life and the tree of death so so these are not these are going to be a figured of speech this is this is something that is going to be held a mystery of course until um these last days when the Lord reveals to us what was taking place now brother brandom is fixing to show us what this tree of life was he says now what is the Tree of Life well first of all we would have to know what the tree itself stands for in numbers 24 and 6 as balum described Israel he said there were trees of lion allows uh which the Lord hath planted trees throughout the scripture refers to persons as in Psalms 1 thus the Tree of Life must be the person of life and that is Jesus now in the Garden of Eden there were two trees standing in the midst of it one was the tree of life and the other was the tree of knowledge of good of evil and evil and man was to live by the tree of life but he was not to touch the other tree or he would die but man did partake of the other tree and and when he did Death entered into him by sin and he was separated from God now back to the tree there in in Eden that tree was the source of Life uh which was the source of life was Jesus in John chapter 6-8 Jesus sets himself forth as the source of eternal life he called himself the bread from Heaven he spoke of himself and and that if any if a man ate of him he would never die he proclaimed that he knew Abraham and that before Abraham he was he prophesied that he himself would give them Living Waters that if any man drink he would never thirst again but would live eternally he showed himself as The Great I Am he is the bread of life The Well of Life The Eternal one the Tree of Life he was back there in Eden in the midst of the garden even as he will be in the midst of the paradise of God now this doesn't mean that that Jesus you say well I thought Jesus was only 33 years old that he had a time that he was born and then he had a time that he ended and that is correct he wasn't back there in his physical form in the body of Jesus he but he he was in the he was that logos which was the spirit of God Amen so he was there in word form right amen now now if we want to stop right there for a moment and let's just cheat and go we're going to we're going to try to make it all the way to 107 tonight okay but let's go to the 106 real quickly and then we'll we'll catch um that this might be something for you young ones uh 106 and we're going to do 1 2 3 the third paragraph it says now right here someone is going to ask me the question did God tell Eve uh to watch out for the serpent or the serpent would seduce her now listen God didn't have to say one thing about what would happen he just get the point of the story he simply gave the word he said not to partake of knowledge but partake of life life was the the word of God death was anything that was that wasn't the word of God she allowed one word to be changed and right then Satan had her God could have said don't pick more fruit off the trees than you can eat Satan could say look that is quite right you see if you pick too much it will rot but here is a method for preserving the fruit and yet at the same time you can pick all you want so you see you can have your way and God's way at the same time the devil would have had a right there he that is guilty of one point of the law has broke the whole law don't fool with that word that is exactly what happened in the Ephesian Church age uh before it ran out in um in 170 ad so what did that tree produce the tree of knowledge produced death Cain killed his brother Abel the wicked killed the righteous now so let's go back to the other so as we deal with these two trees now we're going to see amen one is the life of God which is the word of God the other is the life is death which is Satan coming against the word of God so you're going to have in the garden we have two figurative speeches amen we've got two spirits that are at work in the Garden of Eden that is that is trying to find its way and to keep those two people in the Garden of Eden amen so we got one we got two spirits that are that are trying to attract that are trying to pull amen we have the word of God that man is to live by and then we've got Satan trying to substitute it amen y'all understand that now all right so let's let's go on down to um let's see here uh are we in one let's see we're in 98 and we're at the second paragraph now so some have the idea that the two trees in the garden were just two more trees liken to the rest of those that God had placed there but careful students know that this is not so when John the Baptist cried that the ax was laid to the root of the all trees he was not talking of Simply natural trees but spiritual principles in 1 John 5:11 it records this is the record that God hath given us eternal life and this life is in his son Jesus in John 5:4 ye will not come to me that you might have life thus the record God's word States plainly and clearly that life eternal life is in the sun it is in no other place 1 John 5:12 he that hath the son hath life he that hath not the Son of God hath not life since the record cannot change and taken from or added there unto then the record stands that the life is in the Sun and since this is so the tree in the garden has to be Jesus all right if the tree of life is a person then the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is a person also it can't be otherwise thus the righteous one and the wicked one stood side by side there in the midst of the Garden of Eden Ezekiel 2813a th Satan has been in Eden the Garden of God so now here we've got it the stage is set we've got we've got the eternal life that is God then we've got the spirit of Satan amen that has that has came into God's garden and is trying to sub subdue uh uh what God has started and I think brother Bram is I think you're going to uh en enjoy this and even you young people now any anyone have any questions so far any questions as we go just throw them out there and and then we can make it a group a group setting if we need to you kids are we all right amen all right okay so let's go uh let's just continue on now here is where we received the true revelation of the serpent seed here is what really happened in the Garden of Eden the word said that Eve was beguiled by the serpent she was actually seduced by the serpent it it says in in Genesis 3 And1 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made this Beast was so close to a human being and yet was pure animal that he could talk or he could reason and talk he was an upright creature and was somewhat in between a chimpanzee and a man but closer to a man he was so close to being human that his seed could and did mingle with that of the woman and cause her to conceive when this happened God cursed the serpent he changed every bone in in the Serpent's body so that he uh so that he had to crawl like a snake and S and science uh can try all it wants to it won't find the missing link God saw to that man is smart he can see an association of man uh with animal and he tries to prove it out of evolution tion there isn't any Evolution but man and animal did mingle that's one of the mysteries of God that has remained hidden but is here but is here it is revealed it happened right back there in the midst of Eden when Eve turned away from life to accept death amen so so now are are are we are we catching the picture here now we've got all of the we've got all of the the um the trees in the garden I mean here's here's here's all of the trees and uh and and it's just beautiful trees everywhere you've got all the all these fruit trees everywhere but in the midst of the garden God's giving a warning now you're going to have life in the midst there's going to be life and there's going to be death I'm want just going to put it as persons here all right so that you can see it there's going to be two spirits there's going to be life and death you can partake of life that's my words you can stand there and my spirit will be there with you right amen but there's also I'm letting you know there is an evil one out there that is going to try to take you away from my word and he will seduce you why was this amen because Adam Adam was the son of God Adam and Eve was the son of God ad Adam was God's man on Earth all right amen if you wanted to get anything done this man and his wife had the authority of the earth now Satan has already has already been kicked out of heaven before this even taken place this is this is this has already been taken place so now God is letting them know now listen there's an evil Vil one there's an evil one among you and you've got to be careful don't make make sure you choose life and not knowledge right all right so you've got to choose life over knowledge because Satan is going to try Satan's trying to get into mankind he has seen that what God done God created him a body and God is now living his life he was going to live his life here on Earth now Satan's already according to Isaiah the 14th chapter Isaiah he's already saying I want to exalt my Throne I want to be as God I want to have a Dominion the only problem is Satan's a created being Satan cannot create so Satan can't so he's looking he sees what God has done he sees that God created a body of his own nature of his own self amen and and he and he gave that man a wife and he knew he had already heard to multiply and to replenish the Earth so now Satan is going to try to get in here and and to take advantage of Eve so now here's where we're at he's going to try to take advantage of Eve the only he can't create himself in Eve he can't do it but if he can find another animal amen now this is and if you they in your you kids in school I'm sure you've already got there to where they're saying there is a missing link between animal the the panzee and Humanity there is that Missing Link it's it's it's there you've got the chimpanzee that's really smart but then you've got but there used to be a beast that could and did uh uh talk like a man Walk Like a Man communicate like a man and that that a Satan came in and and anointed him to do what he' done to Eve now any any questions here uh before we go any further anything else you want to add to and uh feel feel free to do so so so here we go Satan is competing with God God knows it but man's own free moral agency man can choose one way the other he's either going to choose what God tells him to do or he's going to listen to another voice and God's saying I want you to listen to me I want you to listen all right amen now let's see um uh let's let's go back and read one more time there at the last the last CH uh the the 98 and the last paragraph here is where we receive the true revelation of the serpent seed here is what really happened in the in the Garden of Eden the word says Eve was beguiled by the serpent she was actually seduced by the serpent it says in in Genesis 3:1 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made so now the devil has is now entered into that serpent amen he's now that serpent is not a snake it's not a snake he's a beast amen he was the top the scripture says he's the top of all all the cattle of the field all the Beast of the field he was the top there was no one there was no one any higher than the human being and God now Satan has anointed him and he is he's talking perversely to her and trying to uh uh to to to break the word of the Lord now let's just go on this Beast was so close to human and yet pure animal that he could reason and talk he was an upright creature and was somewhat in between a chimpanzee and a man but closer to a man he was so close to human that his seed could and did mingle with that of the woman and cause her to conceive when this happened God cursed the serpent he changed every bone in the Serpent's body so that he had to crawl like a snake science can try all it wants to and it won't find the missing link God saw to that man is smart he can see an association of man uh of man with animal and he tries to prove it out of EV Evolution there isn't any Evolution but man and animal did mingle that's one of the Mysteries that God has remained hidden uh but here it is revealed it happened right back there in the midst of the Eden when Eve turned away from life to accept death now what God said to them in the garden uh notice what God said to them in the garden Genesis 3:15 I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thine head head and thou shalt bruise his heel if we give credit to the word the woman did have a seed then the serpent must have surely a seed also if the seed of the woman was a male child apart from the man then the seed of the serpent will have to be in the same pattern that in that is another male must be born apart from human male instrumentality uh there is no student who does not know that the seed of the woman was the Christ can you can you say Amen to that amen no student who does not know that the seed of the woman was Christ who came by the instrumentality of God apart from Human intercourse it is just as well known that the predicted bruising of the Serpent's head was in actuality a prophecy concerning what Christ would accomplish against Satan at the cross there at the cross Christ was bruised uh Christ would would bruise the head of the of Satan while Satan would bruise the heel of the Lord this portion of the scripture is the revelation of how the literal seed of the serpent was sown in in the earth even as we have the account in Luke 1: 26-35 wherein it set forth the exact account of how the serpent or the seed of the woman came into physical manifestation apart from the instrumentality of the human male in the sixth month of the Angel G Gabriel or in the sixth month the angel Gabriel sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espouse to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hell Thou Art highly favored and the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women when she saw him she was trouble at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this thing be seeing I know not a man in other words I'm not married and the angel said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also the holy thing which was born of thee shall be called the Son of God now as the seed of the woman was literally God producing himself in a human flesh so the seed of the serpent is literal is the literal way that Satan found his uh found he was able to open the door to himself into the human race it was impossible for Satan for he is only a created spirit being to reproduce himself in the manner which God reproduced himself self so the Genesis account tells how he produced his seed and introduced or interjected himself into the human race also recall that Satan is called the serpent it is his seed or injection into the human race that we are speaking of now before Adam ever had a carnal knowledge of Eve the serpent had the knowledge ahead of him now watch that the serpent had the knowledge ahead of him all right and that one born of it was Cain Cain was uh born of begotten of that Wicked one 1 John 34 uh 3:12 the holy spirit in John could not even uh could not in one place call Adam the wicked one uh for that is what he would be if heaed Cain and in another place called Adam the son of God which he was by creation Luke 33 Luke 3:38 Cain turned out in the character of like his father a bringer of death a murderer his utter Defiance of God when faced by the almighty in Genesis 4 and 5 verse uh 4 verse 5 verse 9 verse 13 and 14 show him to be absolutely unhuman likee in characteristics seeming even to surpass any account we have in scripture concerning a confrontation of Satan by God now we read but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell and the Lord said unto Cain where is thy brother and he said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper and Cain said unto the Lord my punishment is greater than I can bear behold thou has driven me out this day from the face of the Earth and from thy face shall I be hid I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall slay me now now this is this is he's he's he's he's he's resisting God he's he's been a smart elic with God God's asking him where his brother is I don't know him I'm a Brother's Keeper and then when God gives him the punishment now he's turning it on God and saying H now here I am you're driving me away and you're there's no repentance it's it's it's you're doing this to me you're you see what I'm saying he's very very very um indifferent with God now it says notice the exact way the record of God sets forth the account of the births of Cain Abel and Seth Genesis 4 1 and 2 and Adam knew his wife now I want you to catch that knew his wife once now watch this and she conceived and bear Cain and said I gotten a man from the Lord and she again bear his uh brother Abel now Genesis 4:25 and Abel or and Adam knew his wife again and she bare a son and called his name Seth there are three sons born from two acts of carnal knowledge by Adam since the Bible is the exact and perfect word of God there is no mistake but a record for our illumination since three Three Sons were bornn from two acts by Adam you know positively that one of those three was not the son of Adam God has recorded this in the exact manner to show us something the truth of the matter is that Eve had in her womb two sons twins from separate impregnations she was carrying twins with s with Cain's conception sometime previous to that of Abels so those twins again see those twins again the perfect type as always to those who think that this is not possible let it be known that their medical records are replete with cares with cases where women have carried twins who were of separate OVA and separate uh insemination with the fertilization of the eggs being days apart not only so but some of the records show that the Twins were fed by separate males recent uh recently worldwide coverage was given to a Norwegian mother who was suing her husband for support for herself and her twins one of which was White and the other black she admitted that she had a negro lover the two conceptions were about 3 weeks apart in Bowmont Texas 1963 the records again set forth a multiple birth where in pregnancies were many days apart in fact so much so that the woman almost died with the one child in child birth now everyone uh uh everyone okay from here where we're at amen so so we can understand here we got it Tree of Life tree of death God's way for life was going to be to speak the womb into the womb of the woman to bring Eternal to keep life and and and there would never it would it would be we would all be born basically uh like Jesus came to the Earth amen we would there there wouldn't be no U uh but there'd be no sorrow there'd be none of those things we would be speaking uh word life into existence now um but but because we listen to Satan because Eve listened to Satan he gave her a more a more pretty way he came with knowledge and said listen hey you're created beautifully you're created to produce hey do you realize and he began to sweet talk this woman seduced her and had a baby with her now now again it's not it's not a snake having sex with a woman and it's not the devil having sex with a woman that's not possible amen but the Beast was a manlike creature that was so close to the human life can you say amen amen and and this is where we are today are we doing all right so far any questions all right well let's go on Amen now if I get U it says now why did why did this have to be so why was it the seed of the serpent uh must come this way Man was created for God man was to be the temple of God the place of God's rest the Holy Spirit was man the temple now catch that man the temple God created man to be his Temple acts 746 through 51 who found favor before God and desired to find a t Tabernacle for the god of Jacob but Solomon built him in house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house will you build me sayith the Lord or what is the place of my rest hath not my hand made all these things you stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears you do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did Satan has known this all along he also so wants to indwell man even as God so does but God is reserved to himself that right Satan cannot do that God Alone appeared in human flesh Satan could not and cannot do that he does not have the creative Powers the only way Satan uh for Satan to accomplish what he wanted to do was to enter in enter the serpent in Eden even as he entered by evil spirits into the swine at G gadara God does not enter uh God does not enter animals but Satan can and will to accomplish his ends he could not have a child directly by Eve as God did by Mary so he entered into the serpent and then beguiled Eve and she and he seduced her by her did Satan have a child vicariously Cain bore the full spiritual characteristic of Satan and the animalistic sensual fleshly characteristics of the serpent no wonder the holy spirit said that Cain was of that Wicked one he was amen all right so how are we doing amen any anything anyone wants to add I had a question brother yeah I always thought that we're at that that's what it comes into my mind yeah and so it blew me away because I know Prophet God is the truth yeah but I just thought well you know there there there is a difference in um in in possessing and um and then influencing God Came Upon that donkey and and used him but God did not enter in because remember the Holy Ghost could not even enter into none of those prophets so you God cannot enter into anything unclean he enters into us because of the blood of Jesus Christ so therefore we could receive the Holy Ghost but but on the but but to even the prophets the prophets the Holy Ghost didn't enter into they he they just it was an anointing that Came Upon them and so that was to uh that's that's what that's what had to have happened there yeah it was the anointing upon them speaking huh I don't guess I know what that word is okay between yeah okay so so let's you see that's the thing that that's the reason why that they're saying that there is an evolution and to them the missing link they're still trying to find that and and and and I have some pictures here that but they wouldn't have been they wouldn't have been decent for the uh for our audience here tonight but you know we're their the evolution guys are saying okay so so here it's came came came came here so you've got you've got the monkey and then you've got it on up then you then you got the chimpanzee and then they've got this big question mark and then and then here comes the human and then here's the man and so they're trying they're trying to figure that out but the Bible declares what that was there truly was there truly was one between the chimpanze and the man yes but you'll never find that one because he was put on his belly he was stripped of his hands and his feet and his legs and so now uh you you'll never you'll never even come close to finding that serpent that serpent was was a was a a giant of a man um 8 nine 10 10t tall he was a giant he was a giant of a man but yet he was he was uh he had Beauty he was able to talk he could communicate with with Eve and he literally talked her in to believing him over the words of her husband and so again there's there and and and and you know that's the reason why that's the reason why our Prophet said don't you let Satan talk you out of one word of this Bible no not one word of this Bible because that's what Eve done Eve according to the prophet Eve had already fallen before the physical act had already taken place she fell because she believed that serpent over the word of God her nature changed before that even took place that's what he said so so then it it sold the rest of us in and she followed she she you know of course we we'll read on that so does that answer your question so we're not we're it's it's this is not Evolution no Evolution at all but right here we've got what science is looking for what they are trying to find they'll never be able to find because but God's hit it right here in the scripture this is what they're looking for any other questions real quick all right I want cuz I want us to I I want us all to to be on the same page here okay um all right let's start there at that next paragraph now I want to go into a certain proof that we have that there is a definite Infinity between man and animal now brother bandam is fixing a show he's he's going to show us now um H how that they can interact it is a physical thing do you know that you can take embryo cells from an unborn fetus and he's talking about an animal and inject them into human beings then those thyroid cells will go right to the human thyroid the kidney cells will go right to the human kidneys do you realize how stupendous this is some intelligence guides those animal cells exactly to the right place that intelligence accepts those cells and puts them in exactly the right place there is an Infinity between animal and man they can't intermingle and and reproduce that has been tried but in the garden that intermingling did take place and the chemical Infinity which still exists proves it for back in Eden the serpent was an upright creature he was close to man he was almost man Satan took advantage of the serpent of the Serpent's physical characteristics took advantage of the Serpent's physical he took advantage of the Ser physical characteristics to uh use to use him to beguile Eve then God destroyed the pattern of that serpent no other Beast can commingle with man but the infinity is there now that we have come this far let me try to crystallize your thinking on this subject so you can see the necessity of our going into the serpent Seed doctrine as I have we start with the fact that there are there were two trees in the midst of the garden the tree of life with Jesus the other tree is definitely Satan because that is what came forth of the fruit of that tree now then we we know that both of these trees had relationship to man or they would never have been placed there so y'all yall catching there now this is this is this is so important now so we've got Christ we've got Satan and their and and and their Christ created man to have dominion oh if we could understand what the Holy Ghost has done to us today when you receive that new birth Christ has Authority back in his church that's what he created you for the only thing that keeps us from from really coming to our fullest potential is is a faith to really step out and to believe God to believe that God's created me for this purpose that's right those scriptures that are put in there that said whatsoever things you say you can have that was what God gave adam amen that's what God gave Adam's uh to to his sons Adam's race and that's what the new birth is to restore us back to today sometimes we go on emotions and feelings and things that's then it all comes with it but that's not the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the Dominion that he's given in you to stand up and take authority over God's word or o over over Satan's kingdom and whatever he wants you to rule and Reign here on this Earth he wants that even now that's why he says you'll lay hands on the sick you will can you say amen amen now he says um okay so we start with the fact that there are two trees in the garden the tree of life with Jesus the other tree is definitely Satan because there was there came forth fruit of that tree um they must have had part in The Sovereign plan and purpose of God and their relationship to Mankind and to himself or we could never impute omniscience to God uh this is all true so far is it not now the word most definitely sets forth that from the before the foundation of the Earth the purpose of God was to share his eternal life with man Ephesians 1 4-11 according as he has chosen Us in him before for the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sin according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence and having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven which are on earth even in him whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will and then in Revelations 13:8 it says all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship him Satan whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world but that life could not and would not be shared in any other way than through the way of God manifest In the Flesh this was a part of his eternal and predestinated purpose this plan was to be to the praise of the glory of his grace it was the Plan of Redemption it was the Plan of Salvation now listen closely God being a savior it was necessary that he predestinate a man who would require salvation in order to give himself reason and purpose of being I love that this is 100% correct multitudes of scriptures bear it out as does the very pointed verse of Revelations or Romans 11:36 for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen man could not directly come and partake of that uh Tree of Life in the midst of the garden that eternal life of that tree had to become flesh first but before God could raise and save a sinner he had to have a sinner to raise and save man had to fall The Fall which was caused which would be caused by Satan had to have flesh to make fall Satan had to come through flesh also but Satan could not through human flesh to make the fall as would Christ come in the human flesh to restore the Fallen but there was an animal the serpent so close to that Satan uh so close to man that Satan would get to that Beast and through that Beast would get to the human flesh and cause this fall and inject himself into the human race even as Jesus would one day come and inject himself into the human race into human bodies even to the extent of a resurrection wherein we would have bodies like unto his glorified one Hallelujah thus what God worked out here in the garden was his predestinated plan and when Satan brought about that which was necessary to the purpose of God then man could not get to the Tree of Life In The Garden certainly not it wasn't time but an animal animal had the cause the animal had caused the fall uh had it not let animal life be shed and uh see but an animal was taken and his Bloodshed then God had communion with man again there was to come a day when God would appear in flesh and by means of his humiliation he would restore Fallen man and make him a partaker of that life eternal once you see this you can understand the serpent seed now and know that it was no apple Eve ate no it was the degradation of humanity by the intermingling of the seed amen y'all y'all understand am I am I reading too fast all right amen so that that that was very beautiful that that's powerful brother Bram showing how that the purpose of God manifested and let me just say this even sometimes we get we get upset with ourselves because we've got we've we've got that seed predestinated seed on the inside of us and many times we fail many times we come short and and and we we get so disheartened but just remember Even in our failures the way we have our failures God's grace is still so exhibited in and through you God bringing you out of the hospital that's showing his love and mercy amen God God restoring you and forgiving you and giving you Grace to get up and press the battle that is that that is a reflection of the kindness of the heart of God for you don't it's it's God's pleasure to love you it's God's honor to love you this is what God allowed you to be birthed in this kind of a condition in the first place so he could show you that despite yourself and despite your Frailty and despite your weaknesses his love will win out that's your time to say hallelujah his love will win out hallelujah amen all right y'all ready to go on any questions so so you're understanding two Spirits the two Spirits like I was trying to tell you you've got life God's word you've got knowledge Satan trying to explain what every oh my and and and and that's the reason why uh on on Sunday I was you know I was telling you kids amen listen and especially for you you young you young ones that are that are coming in and developing your habits you know you you you you've got to look at God's word amen you've got to look at God's word prayer life must be an absolute the Bible study must be an absolute Church attendance must be an absolute now does does everyone in the church going to follow that no no no they don't have those kinds of principles but you can and you must they'll give an account before God on that day for for whatever verse whatever scriptures that they want to just minimize but I'm saying for you young people if if we go another gener eration you you you watch you watch the generation that that that that just minimizes this when they want to admin the the next generation is going to follow that follow what they think is right or they're going to follow life right and that's why it's important I Don't Preach Church attendance and those kinds of things to change people it's not going to change them it will I cannot change anybody and if they ain't been changed they'll never be changed but what I am saying there is a Young Generation that is coming up and you've got to choose yourself life and if this old man decides to go do whatever he wants to do I hope my grandchildren won't follow me follow life don't follow a man and say well Dad does it Grandpa does it this one no no no no no follow the word word am stay with that word because you will give an account before God someday make it your conviction that's right that's I'm never going to change anybody and I want to tell you you you you old ones that setting your ways you're setting your ways and I can show you scripture and a lot of you might might have seen scripture after scripture after scripture and you're not going to change amen until you are changed until you're willing to stand and say okay this old man has got some attitude problems or this old woman has got has has got some Faith problems whatever we've got to choose that and you will but I'm telling you this next this this young crop you choose it right now choose to believe God regardless right now while you're young because you ain't got a lot of years that's already pulled you this way right amen and so I think this teaching is is so important stay with that life amen all right let's see where are we at now we on the um 104 and the first paragraph it says now I know in answering one question another question or another one is apt to come up and people ask me if he fell that way what did Adam do for God lays blame on Adam this is simple the word of God is forever settled in heaven before one Speck of stardus was made that word God's law was exactly as it is written in our Bible now the word teaches us that if a woman leaves her husband and goes with another man she is an adulteress and she is and is no longer married and the husband is not to take her back that word was true in Eden as it was true when Moses wrote it in the law the word can't change Adam took her back he knew exactly what he was doing but he did it anyways she was part of him he was willing to take her responsibility upon himself and he would not let her go so Eve conceived by him he knew she would he knew exactly what would happen to the human race he sold the human race into sin that he might have Eve for he loved her and those two sons were born sons that would be fathers of the human race was uh that was even now polluted and what does the record say of them read the record John uh Jude 14 and Enoch also the seventh from Adam prophesied Genesis 5 is is the chapter of genology of Enoch it gives the Gen ology lesle number one Adam two Seth three enus four Canaan five Mahal six Jared seven Enoch notice that Cain is not mentioned the time or the line of Adam goes through Seth if Cain were the child of Adam the law of the birthright would have given Cain the right in the lineage also it must be noted carefully that in Genesis 5 and3 it says that men that Adam lived in 130 years and beget a son of his own likeness remember that a son of his own likeness after his image and called his name Seth nowhere does it say that Cain was in Adam's likeness yet he would have to be if he were his son for the law of reproduction is emphatically that each brings forth after its kind it must also credit the fact that in both genealogies genealogies in Genesis and Luke Cain is missing if Cain were the son of Adam it would be said of him somewhere that Cain was the son of Adam which was the son of God it does not say that for it cannot say that of course students for a long time have set forth to lines of men one of which was The Godly line found in Seth and the other the ungodly line founded by Cain it is strange but true these same students have never told us how it was that Cain was the kind of person he uh he was while Abel and Seth were of the spiritual Godly line factually Cain uh should have been spiritual and Abel less spiritual Seth even more so right on Down the Line because each succeeding generation has gotten uh has always gotten further away from God but no Cain comes as a wicked as wicked as no man ever has been described for he violently was understands God and the word now let this be known scripture does not play with words whatever is in the record is there for the anointed eye to see it is there for a purpose in that word it says Genesis 3:20 Adam called his wife's name Eve because she is the mother of what all living but nowhere or but no scripture ever says that Adam is the father of all living if there is not this connotation to be placed see if there if there is not this connotation to be placed in Genesis 3:20 why would it be mentioned that Eve is the mother of all and no word said about Adam the fact is that though Eve was the mother of all living Adam was not the father of all living in Genesis 4 And1 Eve said I have gotten a man from the Lord she does not credit Adam with the fatherhood of Cain but in Genesis 4:25 she says for God uh sayth she hath appointed another seed uh instead of Abel which Cain slew she does not say that God had given her another seed that would have been Christ for he is given this son Seth was the appointed seed instead of Abel she recognized her son that came by Adam she does not recognize uh Cain for he came by The Serpent and when she says another seed instead of Abel she was saying that Cain was different from Abel for if they were of the same father she would have said I have been given some more seed I don't believe anything I I I read uh I don't believe everything that I read but it is certainly a curious thing that March 1 1963 issue of Life reports the psychiatrist as saying exactly the same thing that we're discussing now I know that all psychist psychiatrists don't agree with each other but here it is the fear of snakes is not a conscious revulsion but an unconscious one if it were natural a natural fear people would just as happily stand fascinated before the gorilla or lion cages their unconscious thoughts would keep them staring at snakes The lure that lure of the snake is unconsciously sexual that has been through the ages as seen by the people in generation after generation going through the same thing snakes have always been always will be repulsively attract attractive the snake has always stood for that which is both good and bad it has been uh has been a filic symbol Through the Ages just exactly as the Garden of Eden description we find the serpent personification of passionate evil it is almost Universal among the various uncultured tribes uh tribes that the snake is associated with sex and often worshiped in conjunction with it the study of sexology brings that out in many instances now I would like to show where these people got that from saying they are uneducated and never read the Bible but even as the story of the flood is known throughout the world so is the truth of the fall of Man known they knew what happened there in Eden amen now are you are you catching that so far so it's it's it's it's uh uh even the world knows that the world sees that amen now we're going to go right on in uh again we read this earlier but we're going to um we're going to come through this they knew what happened in our in Eden now right here someone is going to ask me this question did God tell Eve to watch out for the serpent or the serpent would seduce her now listen God didn't have to say one thing about what would happen just skip the point of the story he simply gave the word he said not to partake of knowledge partake of life life was the word of God death was anything contrary or anything that wasn't the word of God how many got how many gets that I want you to catch that now death is anything contrary to God's word oh and if the holy spirit is in our hearts the holy spirit is to direct us and tell us now there's there's a lot of things that's not going to be directly in the Bible we're we're going you know we're going around today in just this cess pool of leay Osa but I believe the holy spirit that that Holy Spirit is there to guide us that tree of life is there to guide us we're going to set before that tree of life on that day but right now we've got his spirit that is that is leading us can you say Amen she allowed one word to be changed and right then Satan had her God had could have said don't pick more of the fruit of the trees than you can eat and Satan could say look that is quite right you see if you pick too much it will rot but here is a method for serving the fruit and and at the same time pick all you want so you see you can have your way and God's way at the same time the devil would have had her right there he that is guilty of one point of the law hath broken the whole law don't fool with that word somebody say don't fool with that word I don't care what you think I don't care how reasonable your way sounds if it's contrary to the written word stay away from it amen that is exactly what happened in the Ephesian age before it ran out in a in 1 70 AD what did the tree produce the tree of knowledge produced death Cain killed his brother Abel the wicked killed the righteous it is a pattern or it set a pattern and it will keep that pattern until the restoration of all things as spoken by the prophets the tree of knowledge produced clever men men of renown but their ways are the ways of death God's people are simple but spiritual minded well that makes me want to want to shout simple people God's got simple people but spiritual mining leaning towards God in nature calmly tilling the soil caring for truth rather than wealth the seed of the serpent has bought tremendous Commerce wonderful inventions but it but with it all comes death the gunpowder and atomic bombs kill in war in the peace time their mechanical inventions such as a car kill even more in the time of Peace than do the inventions of War destroying the time of trouble death and destruction are the fruit of her labors but they are religious they believe in God they are like their father the devil and their ancestor Cain both of them believed in God they go to church they mingle with the righteous as do the tears mingle with the wheat in in so doing they corrupt and produce uh a nickan religion they spread their poison and effort to destroy the seed of God even as Cain killed Lael there there is no fear of God Before Their Eyes God lose but God loses none of his own Hallelujah he keeps them even in death and as promised in the day in the last day he will raise them up to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God what a thrilling thought that is the Tree of Life In the Garden of Eden which was not could not be approached unto because of the fall of Adam is now given to the Overcomer the Flaming sword of the guarding cherubim has been sheathed but it is not sheath a its blade was Bloody with the blood of the Lamb let us meditate upon this truth and a while truth a while as we consider why the tree was denied to Adam and his descendants but now allowed again God's intention for his creation man is to express his words in Genesis Adam was given the word to live by a life lived by that word would be the word expressed that is that is true is it not but Adam but did Adam live by that word no because he was to live by every word he failed to take heed to every word then there arose Moses there was a mighty a Great and Mighty Man he was yet he also failed to live by every word and the prophet the type of the great prophet to come failed in Anger to obey the word and there was also David the great king of Israel a man after God's Own Heart he failed by adultery when he was attempted he was but eventually in the fullness of time there came one the head even Jesus who also must be tempted to see if he would live by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God and then was Satan foiled for here was one who lived by it is written and that Masterpiece of God overcame the ref by reflecting God's word and this then this was manif uh then was this manifested perfect one given to the Cross as the perfect Lamb of God for the perfect sacrifice and on the tree he received the wounds of death unto death that we by him and because of him might eat of the tree of life and then the Tree of Life given with an able us to overcome and express the word of God now to these sons of God who by him overcome are given the privilege of paradise of God and constant Fellowship of Jesus Christ there will never be more uh there will never more be any separation from him whether he goes his bride will golu what he is she shares with his beloved he shares with his beloved you on a joint a relationship the secret things will be revealed the dark things things will be made plain we shall know as we are known we shall be like him this is the heritage of the Overcomer who is overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of testimony to Jesus Christ how we long for that day when the Crooked roads will all be straightened we will be with him time Without End May that day hasten its appearance and may we hasten to obey his word and thereby prove our worthiness to sh sh his glory he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit sath un the churches how tragic it is for the first days that did not listen to the spirit instead it listened to man but thank God in the last day in the last age there will be a group rise up the true Bride of the last days she will listen to the spirit and in the day of gross Darkness the light will return by the pure word and we will return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah oh how glorious how wonderful amen Overcomers he's overcome amen he conquered us and purged us he's living his life through us that tree of life is is Among Us the tree of knowledge amen is is an incredible tree amen man has produced a lot of crazy things amen but they'll never produce life all right any anybody else uh any any questions on this praise the Lord any any comments Hallelujah yeah yeah you know I had never I had never seen that uh I and I've read this so many times but I I think that was new to me that was I just read it yeah that's right it was an animal that sinned and it would be an animal give us life until until Christ come to Reed redeem amen his seed amen praise the Lord now now if it was just an apple now the rest of the have you kids have y'all ever have you kids ever seen the I mean when you all think about Adam and Eve and the and eating the fruit um in your little Bibles does it what does it show you anyone ever seen do y'all ever read children's Bibles amen huh yeah yeah I I had some pictures I was going to I was going to send sis claya and I forgot but you know I remember as a kid and and um you know it had this had this snake hanging out of an apple tree and it was over talking and telling Eve this is some good stuff this is some good stuff and so uh that's that's the way that's the way they all teach it that's the way they all teach it um that's that's the way all religion teaches it uh snakes don't talk they that that that's exactly right well okay so I like what brother brandom would say he he would say if it was an apple that brought the sin then we need or if it was the Apple that made Eve know that she was naked we need to pass the apples back around amen amen now we we have a lot more we could say on that but I just and and and it will be brought in some more during on through the church ages U but but I thought brother brandom laid a real good um uh foundation for that uh as we get ready to dismiss now God being a good God God being a fair God God God is not he he he's not going to in other words the punishment's got to fit the crime now I can't see that a good god a good a good father that loved his children that says all right you eat this apple then you're going to then you're going to die and um and and and and then at the end I'm going to send a lot of my own children to hell it wasn't it wasn't the fact that the Apple was involved it was it was but but here's the deal Satan was that tree of life or tree of death he knew not the apple he knew that if the poisonous breath of Satan got into the spirit of man it would kill them that's right it was more than just a punishment it was God saying if you listen if you partake you will die are you seeing the difference now it's not a good loving God saying you eat that Apple so help me no God knew the spirit of that Wicked he had already dealt with him that Spirit of that Wicked one if you listen to him and you eat of that it'll kill you you hear you see what I'm saying so so and and and then so that's number one but when when so when God gave the punishment look at the punishment when God gave the punishment unto Eve the he did not curse her mouth for eating an apple he cursed her womb because she listened to the voice of that serpent that's right and done what God said not to do are are y'all understanding so so her he didn't curse her mouth he cursed her womb and said in sorrow thou wil conceive and thou shall have so so I think I I I think that that is that that that is uh something that you you got to keep in mind and you can see these things uh so how many how many understands does that does that make it real clear on the serpent seed to you guys I mean it to me to me the serpent seed is just it it opens the whole Bible up you understand why we needed a virgin birth you understand why Christ had to come you you understand why we had to be born again you understand all of these things amen praise the Lord if the musicians would come are there any other uh questions any any questions from you kids uh any any questions any any anything that you all want to add to it you adultss 3020 that that first there kind of ties in the the adulterous woman yeah yeah yeah maybe you can put that up to Sister CLE wipes her uh eats her yeah such is the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth and saith I have done no wickedness and so this is a figurative speech going back again this is a fig F of speech it's it's it's an adulterous woman is a woman that is not living true to her vow to her husband and so the scripture is is saying she's she's she's partaken of the fruit wiping her mouth that figuratively and saying I have I have done no wrong and so uh so yes that is that is that is very good and to and to even prove and and again I you know this uh we've done a whole lot of reading tonight we'll get on into it maybe even just take a a service and just preach on the serpent seed sometime but um Jesus even even said to the Pharisees he says you you generation of snakes you're of your father the devil uh they said we be not born of fornication he said he said they said we be not fornication we be of a Abraham's seed and he says if you were of Abraham's if you were abraam 's children you would do the works of Abraham Abraham believed me and and and they and they went on he says but then he but then he brings it on down and he says he says you you do not hear because you can not hear because your father is the devil and so uh uh there's there's there's several scriptures in there like that and and and so it's a it's a very plain deal that the beginning was not the eating of an apple but it was a sexual adulterous relationship between Eve and that serpent not a snake not a snake he was a beautiful handsome fell that could talk reason seduce and tricked her she she was deceived he tricked her into believing that he was right and not God oh oh God don't ever let us be tricked Amen in into those things amen anything else real quick praise the Lord yes yeah I know you've said this before but that the closest thing to human DNA is snake they found in science year years later but that even though you know the serpent with a beast was changed all the way to snake which is like yeah extreme but that that DNA is still the closest DNA to a human that is crazy that that is good I forgot about that they say the snake organs are the snake organs are the closest to human organs really different orans you know I remember Alba coming coming home from school one time and uh she was all excited you know when she come in she said we learned that snakes
