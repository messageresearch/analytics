the Lord so we're we're so thankful if you have your scriptures here tonight let's let's look here in the Book of Ruth the the first chapter here and um uh we're going to uh read here at the first verse and um amen I'm I'm I'm sure glad to to know the Lord Jesus amen and I'm thankful to be an overcomer aren't you glad you're an overcomer you're an overcomer because he overcame amen there's no way that you would ever have overcome if it hadn't been for a redeemer amen amen let's look here in Ruth 1 and one and it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled there was a famine in the land and a certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab he and his wife and his two sons and the name of the man was immc and the name of his his wife Naomi and the name of his two sons melan and Chilean ephra ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah and they come into the country of Moab and continued there and ALC Naomi's husband died and she was left and her two sons and they took wives of the women of Moab and the name of one was orpa and the name of the other was Ruth and they dwell there about 10 years and Menan and Gillian died also both of them and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab for she had heard in the country of Moab how the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread why don't we go to the Lord in prayer father we just want to thank you today thank thank you for um a beautiful day Lord the the visitors that you sent this morning we pray that there was something that pricked their heart Lord we ask Lord that the word that was that was ministered that it would reach every one of those Lord to to draw them closer to you we thank you for the lunch today and the fellowship Lord we thank you for Brotherhood and what it means to be a part of the economy of God but Lord we come here tonight Lord and usually Sunday nights we're a little uh weary and tired and and we're just asking Lord that you would you would just come as special for for those that are here and and help and encourage and anoint me Lord to speak what you would have me to speak and father we'll just give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen amen and amen God bless you you can be seated now uh I want to go ahead and continue reading on down we just um we we're at the seventh verse now it says wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and her two daughters-in-law with her and they went uh on the way to return unto the land of Judah and Nomi said unto her two daughters-in-law go return each to her mother's house the Lord deal kindly with you and ye have dealt as you have dealt with the dead and with me the Lord grant you that you may find rest each of you in the house of her husband then they then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and wept and they said unto her surely we will return with thee unto thy people and Naomi said turn again my daughters why will you go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb that ye may be uh that may be your husbands turn again my daughters go your way for I'm too old to have an husband and if I should say I have hope if I should have a husband also tonight and should also bear Sons would you tar for them till they were grown would you stay for them from having husbands nay my daughters for it grieveth me much for your sakes that my my that the hand of the Lord is gone out against me and they lifted up their voice and wept and orpa kissed her mother-in-law but Ruth caved unto her and she said behold thy sister-in-law was gone back under her people and under her Gods return Thou after thy sister-in-law and Ruth said inre entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for wheither thou goest I will go whether thou lodgest I will Lodge thy people shall be my people thy God my God where thou dest will I die there will I be buried and the Lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee from me and when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her and so they two went until they come to Bethlehem amen so this is a um a a wonderful story and um man this is a um this is a a story of redemption and I'm wanting to continue on on rest a little bit here tonight if I if if I may um and and but yet this is a story it's um it's it's a love story that was it's pretty incredible that it was included in the scripture and the prophet would tell us us that amen that it had so much uh uh hidden meaning and prophetic meaning uh to the to the church and to the bride and so amen there would be uh this this book of Ruth has four chapters and and it deals amen uh uh with again a prophecy of redemption it compasses a vast array of material it it it includes the Jews and the Gentiles it includes amen the fall and the Redemption of the Jews it talks about the Gentile bride being called and so then there's also the three women there's Naomi the Jewish people there's Opa orpa the the the you know the church member goes so far then turns back and then there is Ruth am man who who is the the Gentile bride that says thy God will be my God thy people will be my people and so you can you can see in in the world today you you can you can find where you are in this picture amen you can see where you are in this in in this uh story here but tonight I want to deal um uh uh with Ruth and and and maybe maybe we should you know uh uh uh just just sort of go back a little bit where it all started it all started with amen a covenant that God made with Abraham amen it was and and God says I'm going to give you this land I'm going to give this land to thy seed so it was a promise that he was going to have a seed and that they were to stay in that land now we all know that that uh uh it it was election from the very beginning because because Abraham was the first of the Jewish race Abraham was a gentile himself and so amen he he he he was no special breed he was no special race there was nothing special about him at all other than really he was a he was the least candidate he he was not one that that could even uh uh you know uh fill out a resume to God because he was never able to have a son he was never able to have a daughter he and Sarah had been married uh all of their lives practically since since kids and and had never been able to have children and yet God comes down appears to him and says I'm going to call you I'm going to give you sons and you're going to have a nation and the whole world is going to be blessed by by uh uh by by by your seed and uh uh you talking about far-fetched you talking about something that seems so uh illegitimate and so far out there Pie in the Sky am amen but you see there there was there was the only thing that was special about Abram is that God appeared to him and that made him special you know it was Grace I've always said it was Grace that made Abram a great nation amen and brother bradam would say this he says God doesn't call qualified men he call he qualifies the men that he calls so God does doesn't call qualified individuals that should make you feel really proud amen but he qualifies the individuals that he calls amen and so when God raised him up amen and he called him out and God ordained his seed and God established them in the midst of their enemies now amen then God said if you stay in this land I will bless you you get out of this land amen then you're outside of your blessings so with the story amen beginning to start here's IMC and and Naomi who came from this wealthy or this wealth of History amen they they they they can their their lineage goes all the way back to Abram amen and and the miraculous uh uh hand of God and they could trace their lineage back but but yet IMC and Naomi in the midst of a famine they left the promise that God ordain them to do now I think this is a good lesson for every one of us I'm not going to hold you long tonight so I'm going to try to speak amen I'm going to try to speak uh fast and you he fast okay amen so so here God told them to stay in the land but Abram that that God gave Abram and it was to his seed it was to his seed forever stay in that land blessings are in that land but Naomi and ALC left Bethlehem in the time of famine amen now they went down into the land of Moab Moab was a country that God did not like amen God had cursed the moabites and uh amen we're not going to go into that but be when they left the land of Israel then they find out that death is a death pursu amen we find that immc and maon and chilon they all died amen they they all died because they were outside of the will of God may this be a lesson for every one of you you husbands listen where you lead your family is important where you lead your family is important amen and you young men that are that are at that marriage age you all need to make sure that you have a a revelation that is that is that is uh rooted deep in the scripture you need a revelation that is deep in the scripture because you're going to be leading a family amen when you lead families you you it's either life or death amen your choice your choice in the in the hour of decision amen will influence the Next Generation to come and could influence generations to come that's right amen so we we we need to under understand this amen now we understand that God take God can take anything that that uh anything bad and turn it for our good amen and out of this here come amen a uh uh uh and the he Naomi who is who means a bitter and broken and she decides to go home and she tells her daughters-in-law amen that that that that they just need to stay behind and amen and and and and the scripture says there in that seventh verse now that both of those daughters-in-law both of them left the land of Moab to go with her amen but but only one went the wholeway and the other turned back amen now that's a that that's a that's that's a that that that's been All Through the Ages where you go so far amen and not going all the way into the promise that God has for each of those ages amen God's got a promise for each of these Seven Ages now Brethren ours is the rapture and we must not ever hold back from that there must be a desire to go all the way turn to your neighbor and say I'm going all the way I'm not going partway amen and turning around and so we we see where where amen she's saying my my my daughters I want you to you know turn back I there's no way I can give you children there's amen and wh ends up amen uh H turning aside and and and and and and but there was a decision that had to be made amen and and orpa was quick very quick to turn around and say I'm going back I love my mother-in-law been a wonderful family to be a part of Amen I'm glad to be associated with it but I I I I I've got to go back I can't go with you amen but but there was Ruth and Ruth in this decision amen she she knew that the decision was going to to mean the the the the harder road going to a land that that she didn't know a people that she didn't know going to a country that despised her race going to a were people amen that hated the moabites she knew the road that she was going to take was the despised road but yet she chose in her heart amen there's something in that heart that was predestinated before the foundation of the world Amen because she was a part of the lineage of Jesus Christ amen she was going to type out the very Redemption of the Gentiles Ruth God used gruth the moabitas to to type out the Bride of Jesus Christ oh that should make you want to shout amen so orpa kisses Grand or Mama and leaves but it was Ruth that said thy God will be my God can you say amen amen now now now it was because of that decision to follow amen that she says now don't don't don't beg me to return amen don't beg me to to go back back Ruth says where thou goest I will go thy God will be my God thy people will be my people where you Lodge is where I will Lodge amen and and she says where thou dest I will die too I am going with you you're not turning me aside amen what a choice for a moit huh what a choice amen for a for what a choice for for a woman to to to leave all of her family family and everything behind to follow after knowing nothing of the way and that she had to embrace she had to leave all of her old family to embrace her new and accept things that were foreign to her amen she left a Land of Plenty to follow this woman I think that's that that's pretty incredible every one of you children's got to make that decision too it's not easy listen it's not easy to make that decision to to Leave the World Behind to follow after Jesus Christ but the rewards come to the one that is willing to leave the one behind in order to walk the road by faith you know Ruth did not have she had no promise Ruth did not have a promise that Naomi even had a home to go to Naomi went back she lost her inheritance she lost it all amen and here she is she's she's she's going back because there is something about that seed that is calling her back home and there's something about Ruth that was willing to follow along too can you say amen amen now amen so so every one of us have got to make that cleancut decision now I I I wrote down here on on on on the board here there's four chapters in The Book of Ruth now the first chapter is is dealing with decision deciding you got to make your choice which way you're going to go amen and you girls girls like reading love stories y'all need to go and read the book of Ruth amen and and so the the second the the the the the second chapter is serving and you'll find that they're the heart of a of a servant yeah that the heart that is willing to love and then the next is resting and then finally the end she becomes the Bride of of of the wealthiest man of one of the wealthiest men in Israel and so that second chapter we find that Ruth is serving amen she's displaying as brother bradam would say the heart of every True Believer amen because they always have a have a desire to serve and to help amen and and she knew that her mother-in-law was breaking down in health and and and providing for herself would be would be difficult for her and and she didn't want her to uh to continue wearing down her body and and so she was she was willing she said listen I will go to work and I will take care of me and you and and and and you know I I think that's the way every Christian should be every one of us should have a desire and you especially you children with your parents you you should have a desire to take care of Mom and Dad can I hear an amen amen that's right I I don't care if if if your mama's 70 years old or if she's 100 years old or if she's you know uh uh 30 years old our desires but I but more than just family I think we should have a desire you know you know Jesus uh uh brother Bram talked about blind Barda sitting on the road and how he had dreamed all night about the uh uh about being healed and and what it would have been if if Elijah you know if he was in the Days of Elijah amen and so there he he's there on the road and he's contemplating and then a throng is is coming by the Jericho coming down the Jericho Road and and and and he hears some things going on and and and he says blind bardus was got alarmed and and he says what's all of this about what's the matter what what's all the racket I hear and someone someone said out of the way you beggar others this way and that way and finally I believe it must have been some precious lady the the old fell had been pushed off his Rock and she said are you hurt sir and he says no ma'am I'm not hurt but I'm I can't understand what's all this noise about she says why Jesus of Nazareth the Galilean Prophet is passing this way and he says now good woman he he says she must have been a follower of C of Jesus because the followers of Jesus is always considerate they're kindhearted like to help people they like to do things do something to help somebody all the followers of Jesus act that way whether old people trying to cross the street a follower of Jesus doesn't uh just doesn't go on by and let them stand there to get ran over he stops and helps them across the street if if they see some poor old person with a big bunch of groceries a follower of Jesus stops to help them pack them home if they see somebody in need they they go help them that's what followers of Jesus does they're always kind and tenderhearted showing compassion doing things for somebody I I I believe that's what a Christian that that is what a Christian does Amen a Christian is one that that is that is always willing to do that and you'll notice that in your you you children in your mamas and daddies they're they're not one when when when when someone is in needing help your mom and daddies aren't the ones that's waiting for somebody else to go do the job but but it's always your mama that is that is in your daddy that's always raising up the hand and saying Hey I want to help I'll help let me do what I can to help you see that's the way a Christian does now a Christian doesn't keep scores say well I helped you yesterday I'm not going to help you today do no it's who we are Ruth had the heart of a servant she wanted to help her uh uh help Naomi and I I I you know and so here she goes and and and and the scripture uh says it was about the time of of of Boaz or about barley amen season and amen when they would bring in the barley and it was fresh bre bread season and amen and so but BST to her she happened in the field of Boaz are y'all following me so far who was next of kin to Naomi now she said I'm going to go and I'm going to to provide bread or I'm going to go get uh uh uh go get a job I'm going to bring in some groceries for you Naomi now now you know after so many days the Bible says this is all in the scripture you can read read that there that that that she caught the attention of Boaz and so Boaz asked his servant amen the the the the the the caretakers of of the property and and and he's and he's asking who is that girl amen and they said oh that's that's that's the moabitas she's come in from uh uh with Naomi and and and she's been here every day working and serving where she can and and he says now that good lady there he says make sure that you give her amen throw throw some extra behind as you're gleaning the the the the the barley he says leave handfuls of purpose behind so she don't have to work so hard to where she can come in and pick it up and and and and get the pick up the barley and that way she can take it home and and uh amen he he sort of knew knew the situation he knew her and he knew Naomi and amen but he taking a l to this girl and and so uh he came up to her and and and told her he says now listen I don't want you to go around in any other field I've done talk to my uh my my head servant here and they've told me all about you and told me how faithful you are and and he says now I want you to make sure you come up and eat with the rest of the guys when they're eating amen I I want you to get a drink whenever you have and and she and he actually went and got her some water and uh he there was something about the girl that he loved amen and there she was with that virtuous nature that she had amen that love pouring out for for her motherinlaw and and and and knowing that that it was all all all all abroad that she had left everything to come and to care for a woman that she wasn't even amen uh naturally K to and so here here She was and doing all of this work and coming back in and taken care of of Naomi in in her in her season and and there was something about that that that struck her heart she she she knew she could see it in the smile she could see it in the in his in his uh in his tenderness and his eyes toward her that she had caught his attention also amen and so she as she's going out and working and amen one day he loaded her up and he comes back she and she asked him Naomi ask what where have you been and and and and she she tells him I I've been back out there at Boaz and I've not been out to any other field and and and there she she is uh uh Naomi says amen I I I I don't know if you know it but he's next of kin he is my husband's brother and he has the rights of redemption and and and he she's not understanding amen the the uh Jewish uh ways of redemption and and and so uh Ruth is saying I don't guess I understand she says you got to understand amen that in order that I cannot redeem myself we've lost our PR property amen we are here living as as orphans you and me but you have happened into the field of my husband's brother and he has the rights of redemption in other words he has the ability to redeem all of us amen take me back to where give us back our land give us back our amen and so uh uh uh he she she is excited and so if you go to the third chapter and uh and you'll you you'll you'll see amen he says oh I'm not I'm going to seek rest for you now now Naomi is not interested in just for herself he's she's saying listen you like him and he likes you amen there's something about this now this is a gentile girl and a Jewish man and God already said there better not ever be any relations between the Jews and the moabites amen that's something else but maybe you m can teach can can can take uh in your next Bible study amen show them the curse that God gave the moabites oh they were cursed amen till the end of the world I mean they because they were bad to the to to the Jews when they were coming into their own land they wouldn't let their cattle uh drink water they wouldn't let them have any any of their crops and so God cursed him with a curse and told Israel stay away from him but now here God's orchestrating something of divine grace oh praise the Lord this Jewish man who was very very very very very wealthy was interested in that was that was showing love and favor to this moabit girl amen are y'all following me now amen so Naomi says all right now this is Ruth 3 and one Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall I not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee amen he says now is now is not Boaz our Kindred with whose maidens thou was behold he winnoweth barley tonight at the threshing floor now wi with barley that that mean that's when they take the barley out of the field amen and and they and they're the hard kernels and so they'll either take rocks and and beat those kernels and and and and so that they can get to the to the good stuff on the inside or they'll they'll actually stomp on it and uh they'll they'll have a they'll just have a party and they're all in there stomping and getting and and and while they're doing this then they've got uh and they do this in the e evening time when the winds are blowing and then they've got they've got these little shovel type deals as rake type Deals they put up and they throw it up in the air and then all of the all of the other stuff blows away and then the lights or the light stuff blows away and then the good stuff amen The Barley itself it settles back to the ground and so that's what winth is amen they they're winnowing the the barley and so she says there it's it's noised around the community that they're going to be doing that tonight she says I want you to do this I want you to go in there I I want you to take a bath and and uh they didn't have bath back then but want you to clean up and I and and I maybe they did have bath but anyways and then put and then I want you to dress yourself really nice he says because once it's all done amen he's going to stay in he's going to sleep out there to guard The Barley so that no one will steal it and and I and I want you to go in there about midnight I want you to go in when he's asleep and you sneak up to him and you lay at his feet and when he wakes up he'll tell you what to do now now listen th this this was this was really scandalous amen and and it's all in the Scripture it it it it it it tell it it tells it the fourth verse says and it shall be when he lies down Thou shalt Mark the place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what you must do amen and so he marked the place brother brother brandham just loved this story as he's in in as as he's talking about the uh kinsman redeemer he says Mark the place he says this was Our Redeemer and and and to mark that place where he laid down where did Jesus lay down Jesus laid at Calvary amen Jesus was laid at gol gotha Jesus was laid there amen and she's telling him you you go in there amen and and you be identified with him and I wonder tonight amen if if we should Mark that place where Christ laid down as Our Redeemer amen where did he lay golgatha he overcome at Calvary now I I now I thought this is interesting because this is a type again Naomi says Mark that spot where he lay and I want you to join him right there can you say amen amen amen I I I think tonight it would be a little oldfashioned to lay at his feet it would be a little old fashion for a woman amen because that that is an act of submission to a man amen it it's it's an act of uh uh a surrendering of of Rights it's an act of humility laying down there at the feet of a man no that's that's that that that wouldn't fit with the feminist uh way of thinking in this day amen now a but but it's the way that she was instructed and she was willing to follow the instructions can you say amen and so amen so that and that's what we've got to do now that before I go on any further I want you to really take that type because brother Brandon spent a lot of time on that he says Mark that spot where did Christ pay the price of redemption for you where did Christ he done that at Calvary he lay there at gotha if you want to find amen if you want to find favor with him meet him there where he laid down and when she laid down it startled it's all there there in the third chapter it startled Boaz man and Boaz is looking at her and saying what are what are you doing here amen what what what are you doing here and uh amen and and and and she uh she says uh amen praise the Lord uh uh let's see here let me find where I'm supposed to be at amen and and and he says' who artart thou and she says I am Ruth thine handmaiden now watch this he says she says spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmade for thou art a near Kinsman brother Bram would teach us he said that was a type you're meeting Christ at gol gooth there's where he paid his price and when you are willing to come in humility and suffer the reproach and suffer amen the indignation and suffer the scoffing of the people amen for you believing in such a message and you believing in the Bible and you believing and giving your lives uh uh to this Jesus Christ when the world is all turned H has turned to commercialism and all of these kinds of things and and but this was not what got him with the got what got him was is when she said take thy skirt and cover me with it brother Bron says oh the anointing that Holy Spirit that was upon him she's asked for that anointing to come upon her for thou art a kinsman redeemer am now now why am I telling my telling this story well I'm telling this story because it's a good story but I'm telling the story because this is a type of where you and I are today amen she had she had found herself at the feet of Boaz she asked for his covering not her own covering not not I I want you to redeem me but I'm still going to be who I want to be no no no no no she didn't ask for her own covering she asked for his covering Hallelujah I I you know I I I I you know I still believe in the oldfashioned gospel and I think I I I think there's a time for a woman to be talking to her man and a and a time when a woman shouldn't be talking to her man I think women should respect their husbands he's your leader you should not get on to your man you should not tell him where to get off you should not tell him what he's to do and what he's not to do he is your provider he's a type of the Redeemer he's a type of Jesus Christ now whether you believe that or not that's up to you but but but the scripture did say that the prde of this last day the great is going to say am I not rich am I not increased with goods and do I not have everything and he's going to say you are naked because you've covered yourself with your own covering and you've not covered yourself with your husband Christ that's well Hallelujah oh yeah it's no wonder they're trying to rewrite the Bible all the time and they got so many different versions is because it just don't fit it don't fit in This Woman's World but I want to tell you if you're going to belong to God's world we've got to accept God's way and if God's going to redeem us the way we act in our individual walks is the way we're acting to him that's right now how could that great church how could the Roman Church be called a you know does that mean there's been some uh there's been people you know out committing adultery and stuff like that that that mean there's church people you know in in the high up that's going and and and having sex with kings and queens all over the world no no it was a spiritual act taking another opinions taking her own opinions over amen God's opinion and it's individual women that make up and men and women that make up the marriage and it is the individual families that make up the church and the church is either going to be and part of the Great Horror or they'll be a part of the Divine bride it's our choice with way we're going to be I want I want I I I I I want to go like I'm taught amen she was willing to do what she was told she was willing to go at the feet of Boaz Amen to lift up his skirt that covered his feet amen and to ask for him to come or to lay at his feet and then he and ask for his skirt to cover over her can I hear an amen now now watch Hallelujah and I don't see I don't see the rest of my my scripture there but I I want to read this to you because it's good hallelujah amen now now the ninth verse again who art thou I am Ruth and handmate spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art near Kinsman and what did he say blessed be thou of the Lord my daughter for thou Hast shown more kind Ness in the latter end than at the beginning in as much as thou followed not young men whether poor or Rich and now my daughter fear not I will do to thee all that thou requirest hallu hallu I'm in need of redemption I'm in need and it was through humil that she came before her Boaz and her act of submission her act her kindness her her humility what did he say he says H you're better to me and your End Amen you were good to me but not following the other men and not following this way and that way but this this is the act he says I will do all well glory to God you know what she was saying she was saying you are my you have the ability to redeem me I'm asking you to redeem me amen I know you have the power I know you have the ability and she didn't have to beg her act of humility caused a response from him that says I will do all that thou sayest I will do all that you're requesting of me well praise the Lord now this is a love story of love stories this is a woman that does not even belong in the nation of Israel this is a woman that God allowed this is a woman wait a minute wait a minute this is a woman this Gentile woman this bride of how did I get here the G Gentiles weren't even a part of redemption we were dogs God never dealt with Gentiles he only dealt with the Jews he called jabr Braham and told him it would be your seed did you know that the Bible says that God blinded the Jews in Jesus day God blinded the Jews so that they would reject the gospel they left the Covenant they left the blessings amen now they've not left the Covenant because God still loves the Jews can you say Amen but they left what happened they rejected the Christ so that all of us Gentiles could come into relation God the Bible says God blinded their eyes now there's two blindings amen the first blinding was to J was to the Jews the Jews were blinded but the scripture says it wasn't willfully God blinded their eyes so that you and I could be called now the Gentiles are blinded but they are willfully blinded come on they are going after their own ways and they are willfully blinded Oh Glory to God now why did God why did God blind the eyes of H H IMC and Naomi and they go down into the land of cursing and lose their sons and lo Naomi lose her husband death is all around them listen why did God allow those Jews to uh to to reject Christ and the Bible says in Ezekiel man that there would be blood just h uh uh uh slain all over Jerusalem and it would start right there at at the temple that Titus would come in and just totally obliterate there were millions of people that has been killed and destroyed because of the act of forsaking Christ death followed them so that God could call you that's right now I I I I am am I am I making this am I making this uh good enough for you youngans God that this is Bible now this is Bible the Apostle Paul deals with this in the Book of Romans he deals with it when in in the in the ninth chapter in the 10th chapter and I believe the 11th chapter you can go in and read it where it talks about how God blinded the Jews so that us Gentiles could come in now all right now back to my story now so so here Naomi God allowed Naomi to go down there because there was a Ruth that had to meet Boaz praise the Lord because Ruth would and Boaz was going to type Jesus and his Gentile bride amen hallelujah now why do we call it resting is the moment the moment that he looked at her and said I will do all that thou requirest of me in other words I love you loved you I've been much in you a long time and you're you're that virtuous woman it doesn't say because she was pretty it doesn't say it said Thou Art known among all of these parts to be a vir virtuous woman hallelujah amen you've been you've been known for that I will play I will do the part of the Redeemer well glory to God now so let that anointing Let It cover over me let amen h h a brother brother brandham would would would say Ruth a gentile excommunicated run off has has been brought in to to be accepted as the pride Christ come in just at Barley season he said now put the garments upon thee uh uh uh and and take thy garments uh not take thy garments off thee how contrary it is today G thy self uh thy garments on thee and when when you go to meet him he's going to win barley tonight amen and and uh uh and then he says cover yourself go down and and it says and then Mark the place where he lays down go on gol gotha amen and he says oh many years ago I marked in my heart where he laid down his life that he might take me amen he says Mark the place that he lays down and then he then he then then then we understand that as he's as he's going on down there amen and and and she she he says when he gets up early in the morning amen he gets up early in the morning he said now take your take your shaww or amen and and and he and she takes it and and he fills it up amen with all this barley and he goes back home and and and uh amen and and and she comes back home and and the 16th verse third chapter and when she came to her mother-in-law she said who art thou my daughter and she told her all that the man had done to her and and she said these six measures of barley gave he me for he said to me go not empty to thy mother-in-law then she then said she and and here here's here's what Naomi says sit still my daughter until thou know how the man the matter will fall for this man will not be in rest until he has finished the thing this day now why why bringing this in today as I've been dealing with rest and and um and so I sort of had I sort of had a i i i rerooted my sermon this morning because we had I thought I'd throw out the net a little bit and and try to try to touch a few hearts that were here amen and so I didn't really get into a lot of the Nuggets so my messages are all messed up this morning and tonight amen but but but I I was trying to throw out the net just in case there was there was someone here that he man would would would be ready to come to the Lord either way amen we threw the net out and we we planted some seeds amen but now the rest the rest Naomi tells this girl sit still don't you worry this man is not going to rest until he has redeemed you today he's not going to let the sun go down you're his baby he he wants you you have done your part and he has you he is going to do what is required praise the Lord all right now so here we go how is this Gentile going to become the wife of the of of this Jew Hallelujah Gentiles moabites are hated did I already say that ha but in order to get the bride he's got to redeem the Jews that's are you hearing me now what we're seeing over there in Israel right now what's going on all this battling that's going on I want you to know God is playing is paying very close attention God is right there with them and you just mark my words God loves the Jewish people amen and God is going to redeem those Jewish people and when he redeems the Jewish people he's also going to get the Gentile bride Hallelujah you are well praise the Lord are you hearing me he loves his bride and it's all a part of the it's all a part of that great work so now so here he goes he says I'm going to do it he said now there's another there's another Kinsman that is closer than me he said so amen so she goes

that Naomi's come back home yes you know that that that uhmc and and her two sons died maon and ailion or whatever his name is they all died amen and so he says uh and you are be you are between me and and and and her amen do you want the bride and uh uh uh or do you do you want to redeem he says yes yes yes I I want to redeem and then he says okay all right well okay he says but in redeeming Naomi you're also going to have this moabit girl and the guy says Whoa no no it'll it'll Mar my inheritance no no I don't want I don't want the girl she's a stinking moabi Hallelujah I don't I don't

just to let you go but you've always been loved you are always in the mind of God he's predestinated you he loves you he's come to redeem you what he is doing in you is what he has seen since the world began and I want to tell you little Ruth amen Boaz loves you tonight Boaz Loves You Jesus Christ loves his bride are you hearing me amen when they when when when when you feeling like oh I'm

grandmother of David come on church amen why because somebody was loved of God and I say you're loved of God Amen when and when you're when you're fighting and you're struggling and you're and and and you're getting all muddled up in your mind I just want you to remind the devil I've been redeemed he loved me for who I am amen he's put his holy spirit in me I I I I I I I that's my desire to walk with him and to please him and I know he's going to perfect that which concerns me that is a guarantee I want everyone to get it so in your mind Eliana I remember the day that you were filled with the Holy Ghost and I want you to Forever More get that in your mind I am who God says I am don't you ever let the devil tell you opposite you're who you are because he loved you not because of all your mind battles not because you get it right every time not because now you're who you are because God loves Elana amen amen UPS Downs ins outs has nothing to do with it has nothing to do with it it's the power of divine grace upon your lives amen do you boys if you don't have the Holy Ghost yes get the Holy Ghost because that's the genetics of God that's when God comes down and and ignites the seed on the inside of you just like a plant it's got to come out of the ground when God ignites the seed of life on the inside of you you can't help but being a Christian but you're still going to deal with his own nature and there's where the devil lies I see the brother brandham was talked about the placing and I promised to quit brother brandham talked about the placing he says this is where you are set into the you you are positionally placed to where the devil can't run you around this way and that way no more he can't run you all over the place with your emotions can't run you all over the place Place making you feel like you're saved today and you're lost tomorrow amen that's right we got to get that solid in our hearts amen if we're going to do anything for God and if we're going to we got to rest we got to rest Hallelujah and then the fourth chapter she's rewarded amen so what did she do she had to make her decision she served this all fits into our walk with God she's served as a Christian does does everything she can for the Lord Jesus does everything she can for his people she is she's a giver at heart she gives and gives and she comes and shows because of her giving her respect unto unto Boaz that night and asking for his skirt to be placed over her to cover me with yours what well glory to God there was nothing salacious about that there was nothing evil or sexual about that it was a sign it was a it was a sign of humility I wouldn't suggest you do that to any boy today amen that might not be good but the thing is that she done what she was asked to do and it won her heart and then all of her choosing all of her service everything was rewarded well glory to God do you love him you now Israel will be a servant Israel is not the bride Naomi was never the bride Naomi was never boaz's bride it was Ruth that was the bride you're not a servant Ruth is the servant the Jews will be the servant the scripture says that it okay so the bride is going to be in the city with the lamb is that right the lamb shall be the light amen when he says I will show Thee the bride and then you seen the new Jerusalem coming down new the bride and New Jerusalem are all right that's who you are that's what that's what it is that that you that you're with the King but the Bible says the nations of the Earth in that new city in that new land in heaven there's going to be Nations that come in and gives their tithes and brings in their things and gives accounts to the King and his bride amen is going to be the Jews they're servants they're not bride they're servants but they're going to be there well do you love him yeah amen all right musicians can come I how long did I take tonight amen praise the Lord woo still took a long time amen praise the lord well picking through my notes here and and I thought well it's just probably best me to just talk from my heart anyways when you're before you're married you're you're sort of giddy you're sort of you're you're you're not everything's not together yet trying to get your house fixed up so you can propose trying trying to do things here and there and just trying to get or trying to get through college or trying to get through this you're trying to get you got to get man you're not it's it's you can't rest but the wondering affections are fixed the only way you can enter into that rest is when you have all of your affections are solidified you got the ring on your finger everything is taken care of you can rest and God you're United right here with his word and I know it's sort of strange but you're a spirit being God's a spirit yes when we get to heaven we will see the body of Jesus Christ but we're reuniting here it's a uniting Time Brother s sister April's dad had mentioned this morning he said I noticed in all that You' said about rest you didn't say anything about [Music] sleeping God doesn't want us sleeping God wants us resting and I thought that's true he's not wanting us to lay down and close her eyes and put her head in the sand and act like amen hopefully we can just numb all of our conscience that's part of our drug Society everyone's just trying to get you out of all of all of the chaos and just with all these drugs that's the reason why marijuana is such a hit today and all of these drugs on the streets and everything everyone's trying to get away from reality I can't find the peace Christ is saying I want to give you a rest [Music] and as I am satting and resting I want you to rest with me I've got this all under control I've got your family under control I've got your children under control I've got your health under control I've got everything there I'm not saying ignore it we know these situations we're not ignoring situations ations but we're resting in the finished work of Calvary we're resting in the Redeemer who has brought us into his arms and says I love you with an everlasting love amen how many wants to be at rest hallelujah praise the Lord what do you play He Is Mine His Banner Over Me Is Love I my beloved and he is mine His Banner Over Me his love yes Banner oh for me is love he brought me to his banqueting table His Banner Over Me Is Love he brought me into his b t His Banner Over Me Oh yes he brought me to his banet his Banner Over Me Is Love his b over me his [Laughter] love boy he set straight P before my feet his b yes he has he set straight paths before my feet is B over me he set straight PA before my feet his manner Over Me Is Love here B over me [Music] oh he broke the chain and set me free he broke the chains and set me free [Music] oh his b Over Me [Music] Love Hallelujah belove and he is yes I'm my beloved and he [Music] is [Music] oh his [Music] better so as we talk this morning there are [Music] brother brandham would disguise would would describe it he says we will go into total lawlessness I've read that quote to you several times over the years lawlessness to where the laws of God just just not going to mean anything and we can see the spirit of lawlessness today until the LA really truly laws don't matter any they don't it doesn't matter but it reflects it reflects where the church has been in a for a while the church has been a lawless church not not the bride I'm not talking about the bride I'm talking about the church the great the great wh and her daughters denominationalism putting their thoughts and opinions before that of God the lack of humility before God just really just and you know brother brandham says we need to get back to where Sarah is in her tent and letting God talk to her husband he said he brings it in he says and it says that in this [Music] day that if you will be as Sarah and obeying your own husbands he said you will be called the daughters of Sarah now that's incredible because it's been brought into the scripture her obedience and I know it always gets tight when when when we preach along that I'm not I'm not getting on to you to you women in the slightest but if the shoe fits wear it but we are all part of that bride and that's that's that's in God that's neither male nor female it's it's our attitudes toward God can be really [Music] stinky have you noticed have have you have you kids noticed uh U Maybe kids a little bit more than well maybe all of us I don't know I just I just go looking at even some of the the the music videos the the Christian music videos some of [Music] these you you you know you'll click on them because there's a song that you like or that you've heard that we sing even and and you'll see these guys up there on the platform with their hats in the church turn backwards and they're up there singing and people in the church dancing and they've got they've got their hats on and they've got to me it's a lack of respect am am I I am I the only one thinking that am I just an old fogy I mean really is it is it is respect and reverence going to be gone with this generation because there was there was someone that that was that that came here a real Precious brother that that came here and sat and enjoyed the service cried all the way through the service but he couldn't get over that he was asked to leave his hat off he'd come walking in with a Jesus hat on and and they stopped him there at the door and said if you wouldn't mind taking off your hat and it really made him upset but he but he come and he and he and he and he enjoyed the service he just wept and enjoyed the service but then when he laughed it's just ate him up so ate him up and over at Wendell's church I had a hat on and it said Jesus now all we were asking for is a little bit of reverence I I I I I know I know I know [Music] it I know that I used to tell my boys if you ever appear before a judge or you do it put on your shirt and tie if you go anywhere important I know it's not that way anymore I know I watched a clip last night of an anointed man oh gosh he was anointed and he had his shirt had his P out of his pants he had his t- tennis shoes on his suit coat and and and his shirt out of his pants you know no tide and he's just preaching away and people were up there just just aen and him with her hats on [Music] and I don't know they're they're getting something cuz there's an emotion about them [Music] the guy was preaching like nobody's [Music] business yet they were dressing ungodly and provocative I looked at the audience and I thought I know I know there's nothing in the Bible says you you don't that you come to church without a hat I know [Music] that but it's been the custom of our of our culture to show reverence and respect it seems like in this age of [Music] lawlessness that we can't give him respect it [Music] all and that's the very thing that ultimately won boaz's heart was the act of reverence he says this thing out of everything you've done you've been there you you said you didn't follow the other guys the young men and all of you and here you are showing this reference to me I will do what you're asking me to do I will redeem you just I don't know I I I don't think it's legalism showing him respect I think it's legalism in our homes loving him and keeping stuff off of our Bibles inste of putting stuff on top of our Bibles [Music] listening to a message while reading the paper let's let's keep go let's keep God exalted in our lives he's worthy to be exalted you kids can never give enough honor to God you can never love him enough mama and daddy you can never love him [Music] enough he's Our Redeemer he's the one that's going to get us out of this hell ho that we're in he's the one that says I love you regardless of all of your nonsense I I love you regardless of all of your past I'm not saying that I'm not but he's not he's a he's a holy God you can't come and and follow him half-heartedly you got to give everything you've got to him you got to be willing to lay down at his feet and give everything you've got to him he gave his all for [Music] you does that sound [Music] crazy because it sure don't match anything you see out there [Music] hearts that love him oldfashioned heart old fashion fallen in love with you say I love you more than I love any else I want to serve you more than I want anything else I want you more than I want things I want my prayer life to be full of your love I want I want my church time to be full of your love I want the way that I talk to my wife to be full of your love I want everything about me to be full of your Divine promises I want to be I I want to be what you've seen before the world [Music] began if you want to be that way tonight why don't we just make a new commitment to the Lord if we've if we've been wrong if we' not given him the respect and the reverence that we should why don't you ask the Lord to just wash your heart with that blood here this morning or this evening the blood will never lose its power the blood is always the blood's for you little little Ruth the blood is for every one of you for every one of you kids mamas and daddies grandpas and [Music] grandmas sometimes we have to just come back and ask the Lord to wash our minds and wash our hearts renew us again amen amen why don't we sing that song in the KFC I love him I love him I love because he first love me and peray just m [Music] oh yes love you I love you call you first forgive me for my attitudes forgive me for my words forgive me for actions that are not like you Lord forgive me bring reverence back to my heart I love you Jesus oh Jesus is the [Music] sweetest I know and he's just the [Music] same has his love [Music] and that's the Reas oh for Jesus the [Music] sweet praise the Lord praise the Lord I love him here today do do you really love him here toight oh I love him I can love him because he
