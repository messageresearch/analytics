And what a what a wonderful blessing it is to be here with the bride of Jesus Christ here this morning. And um I know that if you've come expecting to receive from the Lord that there is something here to receive from him. Amen. So, we are we're just so uh delighted to see everyone that is here and um uh so good to see brother Brandon and and uh Sister Katie with us here this morning and we uh uh got got to eat some breakfast with them yesterday. And so we counted that a real privilege uh to be able to meet Katie and and to fellowship a little bit there. And so, uh, we just say God bless you. And, uh, Brother Nick, where's Brother Nick at? Amen. Brother Nick right there. Amen. Brother, good to see brother Nick and sister Phoebe and and the family w with us here this morning. Now, uh, Brother Nick is going to be ministering tonight. And so, uh, we are really looking forward to it. I figured we'd just have us a little lesson this morning and then um then we'll have the preacher to come and preach to us this evening. And uh so he he comes highly recommended. Amen. And uh so we we appreciate them. Good to see everyone here here this morning in the presence of the Lord. Let's look here at at 1 Corinthians the 3 chapter. And um we're going to start here at the first verse. And um I don't have um I have very little monitors. Um you know what? I I I bet the organs on and the um I used these for the organ the other night. Praise the Lord. Um so we will look here at 1 Corinthians 3 and 1. And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ. Yes, thank you, brother. I have fed you with milk, and not with meat. For hither to you ye were not able to bear it. Neither yet are ye now are ye able. Ye ye are yet carnal. For whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions, and are ye not carnal, and walk as men, for while one saith, I'm of Paul, and another, I'm of Apollos, are ye not carnal? Who then is Paul? And who is Apollos? But ministers by whom you receive, ye believed uh even as the Lord gave to every man. I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase. So then, neither is he that plantth anything, neither is he that waterth, but God that gives the increase. For he that planth, and he that waterth are one. Every man shall receive of his own reward according to his own labor. For we are labors together with God. And ye are God's husbandry. You're God's building according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder. I have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon. Let every man take heed how he buildth there upon. For other foundation can no man lay and that is laid which is Christ Jesus. Now if any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble, every man's work shall be made manifest, for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire, and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. If any man's work abide, which he has built upon, thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man's work be burned, he shall suffer loss, but he himself shall be saved so as by fire. And then I also want to look at another scripture here in the in the book of um 1 John 2 and6 and then we'll let you have your seats. It says, "He that saith, he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked." And I want to minister for just a few moments this morning to be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; Father, we just ask that your Holy Spirit would be with us, Lord, as continue to be with us as we minister your word. And father, we just want to thank you for the the beautiful uh songs, Lord, the special this morning. We we uh just so enjoyed that. Thank you, Lord, for giving us health and allowing us to be able to come to the house of worship. And we just ask, Lord, now that you would anoint me, Lord, and give the strength that is needed. And we just ask Lord that you would be with your people and that your presence would be with us in a real special way. In Jesus name we pray. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You may be seated. Amen. We um I brother Merl had mentioned I had I fell off the ladder and um ladder slipped out from underneath me and um and so um I I am a little bruised up here this morning. Uh bruised ego and uh u a bruised uh tailbone and u and my wife says I've got the bruises to prove that. Amen. And so uh uh so we uh uh but thank the Lord we're we're able to stand here this morning and uh give witness of the hope that lies within us. Praise the Lord. Um, I I'm I'm not going to be doing too many acrobats or anything here this morning, but I do have I do have a a thought that I wanted to um minister on here this morning and and growing uh to be like Jesus and growing in the Lord. And I think I think all of us desire to be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's it's part of the seed of God. you I I don't believe I don't believe the serpent's children has a desire to be like Jesus. I I don't believe that. Now they love to worship. The serpent's children do love to worship. Uh Satan Lucifer was the angel of worship. So he knows how to worship. He is the angel of light. But desire and the the desire can only come from the seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. The seed of God has the desire to be like God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I and I I think you cannot a preacher cannot give you desire. Mas, daddies, Sunday school teachers, no one can give you desire. Either the seed is there and the desire is in your heart to be like Jesus or it's not. Amen. So, so as we begin to talk here this morning, only those who have Amen. who have the eternal life within them desires to come into maturity. &gt;&gt; There is no Amen. You put a you put an apple tree a plant a seed in the ground or or transplant a small apple tree into your yard. Amen. You don't expect the apple tree to just remain a sapling. Amen. Without it bearing any fruit. But the reason you you plant the tree, amen, is because you desire apples. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so it is with God. God plants those seeds within us. And brothers, I just want to tell you, you cannot get away from predestination. You'll never get away from the from the the the act that God done before the foundation of the world. Amen. And so God's desire is for maturity. So you're not the only one wanting to be like Christ. It's God's desire for you to come like Christ. Amen. In fact, the scripture says that you were predestinated to be conformed to that image. Amen. So I I want to say the DNA is in you. Amen. The life of God is there. The sunlight, the sen light is here in this hour to bring about the manifestation of God's presence. Amen. In your life. So when we talk about maturity, amen, we are we are saying it is the state or the fact or the period of being matured. It it amen. Maturity means fully developed, adulthood, uh full growth, sense of responsibility, levelheadedness, responsibleness, wisdom, adultness. Amen. And so so God is Amen. The Apostle Paul was telling the the the church there in in uh uh in the Corinthian church, he said, "The time that you should be teachers, Amen. You have someone you have need of someone to teach you all over again. You Amen. You're you're you're saying I'm of Apollos and I'm of Paul and I'm of this." He said, "You're not taking your not taking your walk seriously at all." Amen. He says, "But there is a growth that God is requiring and there is a maturity that can be had." I believe maturity, amen, should be something that we desire. Can you say amen? Amen. Brother Brandham would say God's looking for character, not membership, but character. Eleazar, when he went to to get the bride of Isaac, he sweated it out until he found character. Remember Abraham put him responsible as God puts us responsible. That's right. We ministers hunt my pride. Amen. I He says, "Bless your heart." I ain't looking for members. I'm looking for the pure in heart. Somebody that will believe the word. &gt;&gt; And that's what God's looking for here this morning. Uh pure in heart. somebody that is mature enough that can sit down with father and God. Amen. Begin to tell them about his word and his desires for their life and them take it seriously and well, praise the Lord. Amen. The church is not uh uh uh just coming to church, you know, once or twice a week or once or twice a month. Amen. The church is the living word on the inside of you. It's the manifestation of God on the inside of you. God is wanting to manifest himself through us. Well, glory to God. Amen. And then time evangelism, he says, "And when he when Elizer found the character that was in the woman, Rebecca, the beautiful bride of Isaac, he told her about Isaac, and she never questioned one thing. She believed the word of the messenger and she made ready to go. They went and asked the father. Amen. And he said, "Well, just ask the damsel of the age. She's of a h. Ask her. Let it be her decision." And she says, "I will go to what?" A man she had never seen. Know nothing about. But she was ready because she was predestined and forained to that. That's exactly right. Well, praise the Lord. Amen. the growth, the the the desire to go. I want to be like Jesus. We sing that song to be like Jesus. On earth, I long to be like him. Amen. All through life's journey from earth to glory, my desire is to be like him. Now, this message has not come to those out in Babylon. Amen. Babylon is not is is not who God is looking for. It is the bride. There there's going to be those out here in Leosa that Amen. they may go to church and they may uh uh uh sing songs but again that is not the reflection of the bride because true worship can only come by divine revelation. True worship only comes by revelation. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You look there at the woman at the well when Jesus come. The Bible says that Jes Jesus said, "I I needs be to go to Samaria and he goes and sets down at that well." Amen. And there he is at the sitting at at the well a because he needed to be at that well. Now get now, now get me here this morning because there was an eternal gene seed thought of God that was going to be there at that well. Praise the Lord. Amen. Now, now the woman that come to the well did not look like a saint at all. The woman that came to the well did not even look like a Christian at all. In fact, she is one that probably we wouldn't want in our churches. Amen. She is one that maybe, amen, we wouldn't want our daughters hanging around. Amen. She was living with another man. Amen. She had been married five times. Her life was a wreck. But yet Jesus said, "I must go to Samaria." &gt;&gt; Why? Because there was a seed that was buried in on the inside of that. Oh, glory to God. Amen. You see, sometimes we we look at our families and we say, "Well, amen. We we've got it all put together, but God is not looking, Amen, at at your at your natural pedigree. He's not looking at your status in society. God is looking at your origin. Your origin did not start with your mother and your father. Your origin started, Amen, with God before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. That's the seed that is wanting to come to maturity. That's the seed that God's wanting to make more like him. That's what God has come. Well, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I' I've always liked that story because Amen. I I I I remember it was it was Melzdc that came to to Abraham and told him that he was going to be Amen. uh have a natural lineage and that he would have a spiritual lineage and amen he was he was told that that Sarah was going to have a baby and he come to the most unlikely couple in in all the world. Amen. Sarah never was able to have a baby. Amen. They were both old. They they never they didn't have anything going for them. They were idol worshippers. But yet there was a seed on the inside. And it was Melzdc that came to him and brought life to him. Amen. Did you know that the Bible says Jesus come after the order of Melzdc? Brother Brandham said, Amen. that God came from that pillar of fire and then he came on down into the body of Melzdc who had no beginning of days nor ending of days. He was the high priest. He was the king of Salem. And then that man become amen in the body of Jesus Christ. You know it was Melzdc that came to that woman there at the well that morning. Amen. It was Melzdc coming in Amen. and speaking the word of life to her. Amen. Because she was an eternal Jean suck of God. It was a it was something by predestination and it took that high priest to come in and to bring about what God had started in her life. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? I like that. He didn't come to those who had it together. No, &gt;&gt; she did not have everything going &gt;&gt; in this world, but she had everything going for her in that other in that other realm. &gt;&gt; God came to her to ignite that seat. Do you realize that you've got a high priest here this morning that is interceding for your perfection? &gt;&gt; Well, that should make you want to shout. You've got a high priest this morning that is interceding. Amen. For your maturity. Oh, glory to God. Amen. Oh yes. Amen. The struggles are there. Amen. Because you're living in this body of decay. And this Amen. But this is not who you really are. This is not who you really are. Amen. If you could see, Amen. where you came from and understand the commitment that God has for you. And brother Brandham would say it was that one angel that come to Abraham and his group up there on the mountain and performed a miracle and discerned the thoughts that was in his heart. And Sarah was on the inside where the other angels went into Sodom had thousands down there. Do you see the shaking that comes in the little group? But he's getting the bride ready. That's what it is. That's that we're going to end right here by saying this. The end time message is to get the bride ready and prepare for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. I I've just been sort of thinking about this. Amen. Here this morning and I just I might just end up just talking to y'all for a moment. Amen. But you realize that that Melzdc has come in our generation. Do you realize that that angel has come? What did he come to do? It's still the great high priest of God that is looking out for God's word. Oh my. It might have been lost in this vessel and lost in sin and lost uh h in in adultery and lost over here, but God knows where you are and God knows how to find you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Well, that just makes me want to shout. &gt;&gt; There's a certain quality. There is a certain character to the seed of God that that wants to believe God's word that does not want to just be religious. Now I want you to understand Judas was religious. &gt;&gt; Amen. He cast out devils, done miracles. Now the Bible says in these last days just as it was in the days of Moses when Janice and James chambers withtood Moses so will it be in the end time. Satan would come in with worship and could really do a lot of things that Moses could do. Moses threw his rod down. They threw their rod down. Moses put his hand in his bosom, brought it back out, it was leprosy. Put it back in, it was whole. So did these other men. Now the the the the prophecy is in the last day, Christianity would be so close that it would deceive the very elect if it was possible. &gt;&gt; But it cannot deceive the very elect. For only the elect can believe the word. &gt;&gt; The elect can only believe the word. And you've got a high priest who is interceding on your behalf. Oh, can you say amen? He's interceding on your behalf. Amen. He's not, oh my, your your mind plays tricks and this plays tricks and that plays tricks, but God knows who you are and God's going to bring that word to pass in your life because God is still God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, so if Christ paid the price, he's paid the price for all his sons and daughters. Amen. Christ come to reflect the heart of God. &gt;&gt; Because he's got a purpose. He's got a design. &gt;&gt; He wants maturity. He wants sons. He wants daughters. Amen. that is going to reflect his glory in this evil age. &gt;&gt; Going to reflect his glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That that that it's an incredible thought because it's not up to you to produce it. It's up to the seed within you that is to produce it. You see, many times we we get this religious attitude. Amen. Whether it's religious thinking that I've got to and then when you fail. Amen. Well, you're not worthy anymore. You never were worthy &gt;&gt; and you never will be worthy. &gt;&gt; You never will be worthy. Amen. So, you got to get that out of your mind. Well, but I messed up. Well, you're going to mess up tomorrow, too. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. You're going to be messing up every time you turn around. Amen. That's just who you are. But we don't put stock in this flesh. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It ain't whether you're a Gonzalez or whether you're a Wright or whether you're a Amen a Martin or a Torrance or Amen Lancaster. That that Hallelujah. That means nothing. Land. Amen. You you can you you can have your class and you can have all of these things here and that might work in religion but it will not work for maturing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Only the seed of God has the permission to be like God. Can I hear an amen? &gt;&gt; It's grace to you. It's grace given to you to be like Jesus Christ. And I just want to tell you right now, if you're a seed of God here this morning and you're running from God, amen, and you're trying to do your own thing, I just want to tell you, God knows who you are and he knows how to get your attention. Can you say amen? Amen. You might be buried. I I you know, we used to have a vine. Sister Carol, we remember this. Amen. Well, there might there's probably several here that can remember that. I Amen. We used to have a vine at the at at at our old church. And uh uh and and the deal was is you know the church is an old building and um but it it had got a crack uh uh uh there in the middle of this of the building there after many years of setting and settling. It it had a little crack there and and then we had a a stone and it's still there a stone altar and um and then we've got those little windows. And so over here on this side, we had a little vine, a little sprig come up. Amen. Right next to that altar. Hallelujah. Well, sister Carol was wanting, you know, and the girls, they said, you know, we would I, you know, want to cut that off. And I said, no, don't cut that off. Don't. Amen. And they said, oh, Brother Wendell, it's grass. It's a it's a weed. It's this. And I said, you know, that that seed has been under that concrete. &gt;&gt; It's been under that concrete for 40 years. &gt;&gt; It's been laying there dormant. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But then there came a crack in the concrete and light from that window has been warming up that concrete. Amen. And it caused the seed to energize. I said there it there is no telling how long that little that little vine has been working its way up working its way through the cracks working its way through the Amen this that and the other Amen until it is sprouted it and and Sister Carol's holding her Amen her head her her her hands like this that vine grew and it grew and it grew and it grew and it grew and they would threaten it. We're going to we're going to pluck that up. I said, "Don't pluck up my vine." Amen. I preached many a sermon on that vine. And I want to tell you, there might be concrete over your over your seed. You might be an utter chaos. It might look impossible. But I want to tell you, God knows who you are. And God's got confidence in his seed. And the light is going to bring your seed to pass. &gt;&gt; It's going to mature. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Character. &gt;&gt; Character. Being like him. &gt;&gt; Oh, it seems like it's so beyond us, but it's not. And it is beyond you, but it's not beyond who you really are. The seed on the inside. I talk about the seed over and over and over. Brother Brandham would say, you study the character a little bit and then look at yourself. And I look at myself. That's what he was. That's who he was. That's why he was to save you. He become you. That you might become him. He took your load of sin. Therefore, when we come to him, we will not have to stand. Amen. We could not stand in the presence of God. There's no way for us to do it. But when we stand in him, he's already recognize the sacrifice. This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. Amen. I I He recognized it. There's no blemish in him. Yet he suffered temptation like any other man. He was scorned. He was made fun of. He was persecuted from the hour he was born until the hour he died. Yet he returned good for evil. You cannot no way ever produce a character like that only accepting that character in you. &gt;&gt; Church cannot do it. A creed cannot do that. Denomination cannot do that. Education cannot do that. It must be a birth. It's got to be a dying out, letting God in it by the grace of God molding this type of character in you that you become him and your life and his is the same. Then you are sons and daughters of God. Then you grow in grace. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Brother Brandon would say after Jesus doing this, nobody else could do it. We are invited. Somebody say, "We are invited." &gt;&gt; Now, church, think of this just a minute. We are invited to shape our own character to his by his grace. We are invited, think of it, to to become characters like his if we're ready to to to uh uh lay our character down and molding that we had heavy, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, false accusers, incontinent, despisers of those that are trying to do right, having a form of godliness and denying the power of the word. How can God come into a place like that when they deny the word? when he watches over his word to vindicate it. And I just want to say again, there's only one class that can do believe God's word. &gt;&gt; There's only one class. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How that should bring us in awe. How that should bring us in such a a love for him. How when we come into his presence, oh brother, there there remember only by revelation can you come into his presence. &gt;&gt; Oh no, no, no. Music doesn't bring you into his presence. It helps assist. But divine revelation. Are are you hearing me? They would say, "Amen." They they would they the prophets would ask for a minstrel. That is true. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But the minstrel was not the presence of God. &gt;&gt; It would prepare them to come into his presence and then his Amen. the presence of God would come over the and a vision would break forth. But you see, it wasn't the music that was the presence of God. Are are you hearing me? So it is today. Amen. You It's the revelation of the hour, who you are, what God is doing. It's that revelation that brings you into his presence. And then and only then is there worship. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Amen. I started out by saying, "Amen. Look, look at look at the all of the all of the running around and and and all of the the dancing and the and the and to to the music and the beats and Leosa today. We've got it all over the place and mega churches and and we we've got all of these kinds of things that that is that is going on. Is that true worship? You've got to worship according to revelation. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; Tears is not the worship. Jumping is not the worship. Well, praise the Lord. Singing songs is not the worship. Revelation of his presence and acknowledging where he is. There is where worship can take place. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, it's not the feel. You can be in your lion's den &gt;&gt; and worship. You can there's the maturity of spirit recognizing I don't feel it but you never did have to feel it. &gt;&gt; You this this flesh will it it it's all by emotions and feelings but God can be right there in your presence and you don't feel a thing. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? It's the divine revelation that I will not leave you nor forsake you. Abraham did not feel tingles going up and down his spine. But Abraham had a revelation from God that he was going to have that child. And in the midst of his questions and in the midst of those times, amen, where he felt so alone and felt 25 years of walking by faith and it looked like it would never happen, but he could stand there by divine revelation knowing that God was going to mature that word in him and that he was going to have that child. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He he had the assurance. Therefore, worship. Amen. He judged God faithful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; He judged God faithful. &gt;&gt; He judged God. Well, I'm not looking at this. I'm not looking at that. I'm looking at the promise. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [Music] &gt;&gt; Good. And then when the time come for the Now it's it's it's pretty amazing because Lot did not have that seed to grow. So Lot's faith could never just rise above it. Lot I mean it rose a little bit. Amen. Enough to to get to the Amen. the fence of the of the of the chicken yard maybe. Amen. But he couldn't he just couldn't get out there and fly like Abraham. Amen. He did. He left and followed He followed Abraham. He followed Abraham's promise, but it wasn't a revelation to him. So, he just went on &gt;&gt; He went back out in the world. He never could leave the world. &gt;&gt; He never could leave Sodom. He had nothing in him. Amen. He was just satisfied with being a lukewarm church member. &gt;&gt; And what little bit of faith he had was totally paralyzed by the world. But Abraham, who had nothing going for him but divine revelation, it was God that appeared to Abraham and said, "You're going to have that child." He couldn't explain it, but he was willing to come out of the world. He was willing to forsake it all and say, "I'm going to follow God's word." Brother, I say today, Amen, that watch what the the the the royal seed of Abraham is doing today. Amen. willing to forsake all the world to follow Jesus to follow his word. It's got to be our desire. It's got to be everything to us. Not one foot in the world and one foot Amen. serving the Lord. That's what Lot done. And Lot Amen. He ended up in great disaster. Can you say amen? But Abraham was waiting upon that promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, Abraham was invited. He was invited by divine revelation. &gt;&gt; You are invited by divine revelation. He says you're invited to be molded into his image that we might reflect his presence. And the works that I do shall you do also. the life that I live, so shall you. We're invited by God to take him as an example and let our character be molded like this. What a thing he says. And then he says, "My hallelujah." Then we have to let his character be in us. Then we have to become sons by having the mind of Christ which is his character. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. growing. Now we So the obstacles the obstacles are not is not is not the is not the problem. Growing is already built within us. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's it's it's there. I think I think what what Satan has tried to do is is he's turned the gospel into a humanistic gospel. &gt;&gt; So he's taken the supernatural out of the gospel &gt;&gt; and made it a human um made it a human religion. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's all about it's all about feeling good. It's all about your emotions and music. It's all about th those kinds of things. So, it's become a humanistic It's become a humanistic gospel. God is not looking for a humanistic gospel. It is a supernatural gospel. &gt;&gt; Faith is the only way we're going to grow. Faith is the only way we're going to overcome. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, hallelujah. Anybody can better themselves. That's not the kind of maturity God's looking for. God's not looking for someone to better themselves. If that's the case, education will do the job. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If that Well, that's right. That's right. Well, well, they say, "Well, education, educa, we we need better teachers in the suburbs. We need better teachers. We need better education. We need better schools. We Amen." Listen, that is not what what what these uh communities need. What they need is the reality of the supernatural presence of God &gt;&gt; to ignite the seed and let it grow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Now we when we when we look at that Amen. The scripture the the scripture teaches us he says Amen. Uh uh there in in in in second uh Peter 3 and 17 he does give us some warnings. He says, "Therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware, lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness. But grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ." Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so when you are when when you are putting God on your own human terms, then you're limiting and stunting your faith. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; But I just I just want to say in order for growth, in order for growth, the the only way the seed can do anything is through divine revelation, &gt;&gt; faith in God's word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That is where we're that's where we stand. Now, when you start looking at Well, but we believe it this way. But we you're stunting your growth right there. Amen. You're going to stunt your growth and you're going to be removed from your own steadfastness. But there is a grace. Hallelujah. Second Peter 1 and3 it says, "According as his divine power," somebody say, "His divine power. hath given unto us all things. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "All things &gt;&gt; that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge or revelation of him who hath called us to glory and virtue, whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature. Besides this, having all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and temperance patience, to patience godliness, to godliness brotherly kindness, to brotherly kindness charity. For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that you shall never be barren, nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Okay? That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God would not say for us to do these things if it wasn't possible. Anything that is supernatural, anything that is has to do with God, there is nothing a man can do to bring it about. Again, if God was wanting that, then then he would have never had to have come. But he's come for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And that is to ignite you, &gt;&gt; energize the seed. Let the seed grow. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Now, I I've got a few things here that I want to &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh to to to bring out just a little bit further. I'm not going to really I'm not going to hold you too long here this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we have to have things to overcome. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We've got to have things to overcome. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just don't believe in this gospel that this message that you're okay like you are. So all you have to do is accept accept this this man that you think is Jesus and then you can stay in your sin. &gt;&gt; That's not what God wants. You can't stay in your sin and claim to be a believer. &gt;&gt; Jesus came to save you from your sin. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that he come and and we could actually look at it. It's there in in in first uh John the 3 chapter. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you what, I do not recommend anybody falling off a ladder and uh that that is not a good deal. Amen. Now, I heard brother Merl saying that this morning, but he should have told me before. Now 1 John 3 and 1, behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God. Now once again it has nothing to do with you. &gt;&gt; What manner of love the father has bestowed. You didn't save yourself. You didn't ask yourself. I did not ask my dad if I could be his son. &gt;&gt; Amen. My dad had to have a relationship with my mother. There had to be, Amen, a literal relationship in order for me to come. There's got to be a relationship of God with your soul that makes you a son of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon me that I should be called the sons of God. Therefore the world knows us not because it knew him not. Beloved, now are we the sons of God. It does not yet appear. Now he's letting us know. And this is where this is where I'm trying to to to bring about. Amen. The two you're living in a body, but yet there is a seed in you. Now we are the sons of God. Right now. Right now. &gt;&gt; Right. Somebody say, "Right now." &gt;&gt; Right now, &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter of God. Right now, but it does not yet appear what we shall be. But we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him. For we shall see him as he is. And what is he? He is the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; And every man that has this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure. Whosoever commits sin transgresseth also the law. For the sin is the transgression of the law. And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins, and in him is no sin. &gt;&gt; Whosoever abideth in him sins not. Whosoever sinnth hath not seen him, neither known him. Little children, let no man deceive you. He that do righteousness is righteous. He even as he is righteous. He that commits sin is of the devil. For the devil sinnth from the beginning. For this purpose the son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil. Whosoever is born of God does not commit sin, for his seed remains in him. He cannot sin because he is born of God. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil. Whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; now you're saying, "What, man? And one minute I'm a son of God, the next minute I'm a son of the devil because I know for sure that I do some sinning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The seed of God on the inside, the seed of God has never sinned. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The seed desires to be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; You were predestinated to be conformed to that word image. It's the desire of the apple seed to produce oranges. &gt;&gt; Got you, brother Mike. It's the desire of the apple seed to produce peaches. &gt;&gt; It that is just as stupid as stupid. See, he didn't think I was going to be stupid. It's It's stupid to expect an apple seed to produce peaches. It's stupid to produce to to to think an apple seeds going to produce oranges, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And it's stupid &gt;&gt; to think you can be a son of God and still want to go out there and sin &gt;&gt; and and and and say that, well, I'm I'm going to I'm going to sin. I know. I know I shouldn't, but I but I just got but you know, this is just the way it is. That's not a son of God. &gt;&gt; Well, God just has to understand that this is just the way it is. In my situation, I have to do this. You are not a son of God until the seed of God on the inside of you has come to life. And then maturity can come. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He's come to destroy the works of the devil. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; So now this this this case that we've got today that says, "Oh, well, God just knows the heart." He does. That's where the seed of God is and that's where the seed of the devil is. And either you are going to love sin and you are going to forsake God's word and say, "Well, I don't care about that." Amen. Well, then hallelujah. You've not been born again yet. But if you've been born of that eternal seed, &gt;&gt; if you've been born of that that that word seed of God, it is God's permission to you. Amen. I you can be like me. I am inviting you into my grace. I am inviting you, Amen, to share of my character. I am divi. Oh, can you say amen? It's not taught. You don't teach it. You don't learn it. It's not education. It's the life of God on the inside of you living its life. &gt;&gt; Well, glory be to the lamb of God. Amen. Why could Jesus, Amen, uh declare the glory of God as he done? Is because God gave him permission as a son to glorify his name. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So what are we doing? We want to take every thought, everything that is contrary to that word and say, "I'm going to line it up with this right here. No matter how big, how small, I have been given permission. Well, pray. How many remembers when God ignited your seat? &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. Amen. Don't you remember that time when that special something? Some of you might have shouted all over the place. Some of you might have been balling at an altar. Some of you might might have been at a at a youth group somewhere. Amen. But but something took place. Whether you was by yourself or with people, something took place. You knew there was something that had just transpired. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, the prophet would tell us that there is sin singular and there are sins plural. &gt;&gt; The serpent's children sin singular. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you're out there in the world and you're you're you're when you were it was the the the the it was a singular sin. You unbelief. And because you disbelieve, you do the things you've done. When it all comes down to it, the seed of unbelief. &gt;&gt; Okay? That's why you crowds and that's why you you you smoke and drink and dope and shack up and do all these kinds of things is because Amen. We were born sinners. That's the nature. That's just Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; But there is a seed on the inside of you as a son of God. Even while you were in sins, there was a seed on the inside of you. &gt;&gt; Come on. that was going to overcome all things. &gt;&gt; And this the Bible says there in there in first uh first John 3, this is the victory that overcomes the world, &gt;&gt; even our faith. &gt;&gt; Where did the faith come from? The seed. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; So, here's here's the deal. If if you're not of God, you cannot believe. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But you can be out in the world and you can have that concrete over the top of you for years and years and years and years and still be a son of God. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; Come on now. You're in as dark as dark. Just like that woman at the well. She was a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; And yet she was living with another man. She had been married a bunch of times. She had Oh, she was she was one of those ill-famed ladies. Amen. Couldn't even come to the well at the same time that all the other ladies come to the well. I mean, this woman had a rough time. And yet Jesus says, "I've got to go to Samaria because I've got a daughter. I've got a You say a daughter?" Yes, it was a daughter. Now watch this. When the word came to her, Jesus just started asking. He said, "Amen. Um uh uh get get me a you know, can can you give me a drink of water?" And and and u and and she matters of fact let me just read it to you here. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think Well, I thought I was going to read it to you. Where where's that where's that at? I think it's in John. Can you pull that up? Amen. I need to go to Samaria. He needs be go to Samaria. I think the words. Hallelujah. Well, do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Now, I'm fixing to show you sins. Believer does not sin singular. That's unbelief. Believers have sins. The sin according to scripture is unbelief. The Bible says, "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life." And then keep keep that scripture there, sister Keys. And then let let me just finish reading this here. Amen to you. Um so and then he says, Amen. Uh 17th verse three, St. John 3:17. For God sent not his son to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be uh through him might be saved. He that believes on him is not condemned, but he that believes not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God. This is the condemnation that light is come into the world, and men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For everyone that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth come to the light, that his deeds might be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. So there's going to be a group that is going to believe and there's going to be a group that cannot believe. The one who has believed upon the name of Jesus Christ is going to have many flaws. They're going to have many things that they've got to repent of daily. And I want to tell you there's a lot of blood that you'll never the blood will never never never come short. Amen. &gt;&gt; But there's going to be that one that is not going to believe the word of God. &gt;&gt; They can't believe the word of God. There's nothing in them to believe with. &gt;&gt; Well, how many knows I'm still in scripture. There's nothing in them to believe with. &gt;&gt; They can get caught up in the emotion. They can get caught up in the feeling, but there's nothing to believe with. Right, &gt;&gt; man. That is sin, singular, &gt;&gt; sin, unbelief, cannot believe the word. &gt;&gt; But then there's the elect. They're not willfully sinning because they've got the seed of God on the inside of them that is going to overcome everything. &gt;&gt; Yeah. point to your neighbor and say that he said everything &gt;&gt; going to overcome everything. &gt;&gt; I don't know what you're facing today, but you're an overcomer because the seed of God's on the inside of me. &gt;&gt; You may say, "Brother Wendle, I'm in some sins right now." But what is that seed on the inside of you saying? Is it justifying your sin, or is it saying, "Buddy, you've got to come out." Is is that something on the inside saying, "Come on up a little bit higher. Come on up. Get out of that chicken yard. You don't belong in that chicken pin. Get up. Get out. I've called you to the higher heights. You're an eagle, not a chicken." &gt;&gt; God ain't got no squawking chicken. &gt;&gt; God's got eagles. &gt;&gt; Eagles up there in the heavens. Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You're an overcomer. You right. Oh, God. This is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith. &gt;&gt; You can't help but overcome. &gt;&gt; Now, let's look here. Let's just read this story here together, and I'm going to close. He must needs go through Samaria. Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which he c which is called Siar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on the well. Now remember last week when I preached on God in another form the form of God. &gt;&gt; He was weary in that that form was weary. But within that form was that great that great logos that pillar of fire. He was as the prophet said Melzdc is no longer heard of because Melzdc becomes Jesus Christ. as Melzdc came to meet meet Abraham. And when he met Abraham, the Bible says that he was in such awe with this great priest king that when the when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah all come and was and was fixing to to to bestow honors upon him, what did Abraham do? Abraham threw up his hand and he says, "I have already lifted my hand to the to Almighty God, the possessor of heaven and earth. I will not take even a shoe latch from you." &gt;&gt; The presence of God, he recognized it. It's that same presence that was in the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It sat on the well. It was about the sixth hour. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. And Jesus said unto her, "Give me to drink." And his disciples were going away unto the city to buy meat. And then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, "How is it that thou being a Jew? Asked, drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? For the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans?" And Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou kneest the gift of God, who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink, thou would have asked of him. And he would have given thee living water. And the woman said unto him, Sir, thou hast not, thou has nothing to draw with, and the well is deep from whence then hast thou this living water? Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle? Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinkketh of the water of this water shall thirst again. But whosoever drinkketh of the water which I give him shall never thirst, but the water which I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. Now watch this. It's a natural conversation, just a normal conversation going on with this woman that &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She she she's matter of fact his disciples come back and they were wondering what in the world is he doing talking to this woman all by himself. Now watch the woman sith unto him, sir. Watch your heart. Watch your heart. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; She was under the concrete. She was a seed of God. They say that this woman had been turned loose as a girl, as a girl. And she had to fend for herself. And then it come through all of the routine until now here she is. And the woman said, "Sir, give me this water." He didn't have to explain it, but he said that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. Jesus said unto her, "Go call thy husband and come hither." &gt;&gt; And the woman said, "I have no husband." Jesus said unto her, now watch this. Watch what now the supernatural is beginning to come in and discern. There's that word in a body. Thou hast said, "Well, I have no husband." For thou hast had five husbands, and whom thou he whom thou hast is not thine husband, &gt;&gt; in that thou saidest truly. And the woman said unto him, "Sir, I perceive you're a prophet. &gt;&gt; Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship." Jesus said unto her,"Woman, believe me, the hour comes when you will neither worship in this mountain, or yet in Jerusalem, worship the Father. Ye worship know not what." We know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is, now watch this. Revelation, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the father seeketh such to worship him. God is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. And the woman said unto him, I know that the Messiah come that the Messiah's cometh, which is called Christ, and when he comes, he will tell us all things. And Jesus said unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. Now watch your watch your watch what happened next. And upon this come his disciples and marveled that he talked with the woman. Yet no man said what what seekest thou or why talkst thou with her? The woman then left her water pot went her way into the city and said to the men, "Come see a man which has told me all things that I ever did. Is not this the Christ?" The attitude. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The attitude that she had. She was a woman that would not be accepted in a church, but Christ had to come and redeem her. &gt;&gt; And it was the word that come. That word was what separated him from all of the other guys. It was the word that separ y'all hearing me. It's the word that has separated. Amen. This present day word from all of the other guys. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Melzdc has come back in this day discerning the hearts and the thoughts of the people, drawing you and me back to himself in redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You might have plenty of things you're going to have to repent of. And before the day is over with, I'm sure we're all going to have a lot of things to repent of. &gt;&gt; But there's one thing that seed on the inside of you can never do. It cannot disbelieve. &gt;&gt; Well, that just makes me want to shout. We're going to line our thoughts, our actions, our everything, our belief system right in line with that word. And we will overcome. &gt;&gt; We will mature. We will see a rapture. And it's all by grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If the musicians would come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? here this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There is there is something there is there is that something on the inside that keeps on pulling me. What's that what's that song? Something keeps pulling me &gt;&gt; holding me every day. I see. Amen. Praise the Lord. And then there's uh uh &gt;&gt; I feel the pool. Yeah. Those those songs like that that that can only that that can only be had by the believer. &gt;&gt; Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers them. The trials must come. The trials are going to come to every one of us. And you may be in a real dark trial here this morning. Maybe you're in a real deep trial, &gt;&gt; but remember the trying of your faith is more precious than of gold. &gt;&gt; That That's exactly right. It's more precious according to First Peter. Amen. James uh uh uh alludes to the same thing. There's got to be a trying. There's got to be something to overcome. There's got to be things in our lives. Listen, if we were all if if if if we were if everyone was where they needed to be, Amen. Well, we would the rapture would have already taken place, but God's still dealing with somebody. &gt;&gt; He's still dealing with me. Here's the deal. The song that we sing, the more that I surrender, &gt;&gt; the lighter my load, the more that I release myself, the more he takes control. Why? Why? Why is it that we cannot be just one of those nominal churches that Christians that's just going to go to church occasionally? We're in this thing. We're in this thing for the long haul. &gt;&gt; We We are in this thing. We are we we are that's why we come to church. You can't get enough church because there's something within us that is saying I want more of God. I want to learn more. I I want to overcome more. I want And every time we come to church, we're growing in him. &gt;&gt; But then we go outside the doors and God takes those things that we're learning, those things that we feel in his presence &gt;&gt; and he starts burning it in us. &gt;&gt; He starts burning it within us. And there's where the trials come and the tribulations and all of the hardships. And there's where the devil tells you, you're not a son of God. You're not a daughter of God. But there's nothing in you. He just can't convince you to disbelieve the word. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He can't He can't convince you to to turn away on God &gt;&gt; because that's who you are. &gt;&gt; Well, bless the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care if you lip your wife this morning on the way to church, you're still a son of God. Don't be justifying your deed. Son of God ain't going to justify a sin. Sins, we have sins and we've got to repent of them. And in order to repent, you've got to admit that you're wrong, fella. You got Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you ladies have got to to to admit you're wrong occasionally. &gt;&gt; Amen. These these are these are areas in our we are overcoming. We are maturing. We are growing. The more we mature, the less we're listening to this, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The less the less we're petting this. And and if you if you notice how the how the prophet has just always gone back and saying just one word was all it took. One word. One word. But he said there's a bride that will not even have one word. She will believe every word. [Applause] &gt;&gt; She will believe every word. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Let me grow Lord. Corinthians were the fleshly church. They were carnal. Oh my. There is no there is no there is no epistle in the New Testament. The the the church of Colossia didn't have the problem. The church of Philippi, the church of Ephesus, the the Hebrew, they it was the Corinthian church. He said, "You're big babies. You're babies. You're carnal. Both man, both epistles, both letters he's writing to them [Music] because they were constantly judging everybody by this, by what they see, by what they hear, by what they feel, by what they And he's saying, "Come on, guys. Who cares whether I baptized you or Apollos baptized you? [Music] Who cares whether you like so and so singing over somebody else's singing? What matters is well, praise the Lord. We could really bring it on down to our right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We could we could do that in our little fellowships. We could do that even with our uh in the dinners. We could do that with a we could do that with a with song leaders. We could do I mean listen if if you want to be fleshly I mean we can be fleshly &gt;&gt; but I don't want to hear those words the time that you need to be you should be teachers [Music] you have need to go back to kindergarten and to be taught all over again. Now, could you imagine a 30-year-old man going back and sitting on the little kindergarten desk? [Music] Or better yet, a 30-year-old having his diaper changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] I want to be everything that God's called me to be. &gt;&gt; And I know the less that I see of this world, the more I see of that world. [Music] &gt;&gt; And if Melazdc has come this day and hunted me out, I did not come looking for him. It was God sent God sent somebody to me. God sent somebody to me with the adoption series. Are y'all understanding? Somebody some God somehow got this message to you. What was it? It was God saying it was an intercessor saying there's a seed on the inside. Don't don't look at that Pentecostal. That's down on the inside of Wendle is a is a real true germ seed of mine. He's interceding for me. He's interceding for you. Glory to God. And you know what? He ain't going to quit interceding for you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Amen. To be like Jesus. To be like Jesus. On earth. I long to be like him. All through life's journey from earth to glory. [Music] I only ask to be like him. All together now. To be like Jesus. To be [Music] to be like Jesus on earth. I long to be like him all through life's journey from earth to glory. I only have to be like him. One more time. To be like Jesus. [Music] To be like Jesus. Take my eyes off of this world. Let me be really serious with your word, Lord. Make me like you. Teach me your word. Help me to be what you want me to be. I love you, Jesus. [Music] From earth to gloryy. [Music] I only ask [Music] to be like him. [Music] Something keeps holding me. Every day I see helping me faithfully to overcome. Oh, guiding me constantly, giving me victory. He's a reality. Something keeps holding me. [Music] the trials of this world. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh Jesus, all I felt was more than I can bear. [Applause] I was on the verge of giving over. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The strength just wasn't there. Something keeps holding me every day. Guiding me constantly overcome. [Applause] [Music] Guiding me constantly. giving me victory. It's a reality. Something keeps holding me. Satan, like before, his temptation and his desire to steal away my faith. [Music] that I have found in time. This revelation, the strength I need to keep me in. It's him, not me. Something keeps holding me every day. Overcome [Music] Jesus guiding me constantly helping me victory. He's a reality. Something keeps holding me. [Music] The one who gave the promise is the one who's interceding. [Music] &gt;&gt; He gave it. That's of himself. And you believing it's of himself, too. He tells Peter, I am praying for your faith that it fails you not. So he gives the promise and then he gives you the faith and then he's interceding for your faith that your faith fails not. [Music] Now what you got to do is quit looking in the mirror or across the aisle or to the guy or girl sitting right next to you. We got to look at his word. Our origins come from the supernatural side. Yes, you came from your mama and we're thankful for your mama and you need to honor your mother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But that's not your origin. &gt;&gt; You come from God. [Music] &gt;&gt; Well, why couldn't you say, "Well, I just have a hard time believing that." Well, they couldn't believe it in Jesus day either, &gt;&gt; right? But you are the form. You are the form of God. You somebody say, "I &gt;&gt; I &gt;&gt; am God's form." &gt;&gt; God's form. &gt;&gt; You're the one. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. You know, it's so simple, but yet it's so hard to turn this old mind off. It is, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I love him. [Music] I love him. I love him with all of my heart. Dog gone it. I tell you what, the more the more that I know him, the greater the revelation, the more that I want him to know that I love you. I love you. God bless you.
