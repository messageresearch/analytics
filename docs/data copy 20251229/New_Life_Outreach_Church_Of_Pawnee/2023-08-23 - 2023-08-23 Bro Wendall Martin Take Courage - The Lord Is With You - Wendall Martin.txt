tonight because God's ordained you to be here on this Earth you're here tonight to fulfill a specific purpose you're here tonight because God seen you thought of you and predestinated you to be here for such a time as this he didn't call you for another age or you would have been here in that age but God's called you for this age God's called you right here in in 2023 and and God's plan is never to send men here on the earth women here on the earth to be a man uh to to be fearful to be running to and fro and trying to be fulfilled but when God calls us God's got a plan for us and his call is for courageous men and women God's call is for you and for me to stand up to understand that we do have a purpose amen and we're not detoured God's original plan is not detoured uh by by danger or by pain amen God is saying to you be brave be Fearless amen be Valiant be lying hearted they be courageous now you know the opposite of courageous is is cowardly amen it's faint-hearted it's spineless it's timid it's fearful any mind matters of fact the word fear is spoken over 500 times in the Bible whether it be a fear or afraid or fearful amen so fear is a real thing amen it's a part of this Fallen sphere of humanity but it is not your purpose it is not your Dwelling Place fear is nothing has nothing to do with your destiny now let me tell you something friends fear is not your destiny God has not ordained you to be here on the earth fearful he's not ordained you to be afraid that you're going to miss the Rapture or that you're going to be displeasing to the Lord God has provided blood amen now an atonement for every one of his sons and daughters he's he's provided a way a remedy that if you should ever fail you don't have to be afraid afraid there is a blood atonement amen if you should fall sick and and cancer is is coming your way and and the doctor's giving you a a a a a a report that would bring fear you have a right to stand up tonight and say fear is not my dwelling place for God has provided an atonement for my healing amen oh my it doesn't matter where you are God's calling for courageous people it doesn't matter what stage of life you're in tonight you can handle everything through the faith of God Amen God says be strong and of great courage amen oh yes it's been said fear not uh 365 times out of the year amen you have a fear not promise for every day of the year amen fear not for I am with thee when God appeared unto Abraham he he said fear not for I am thy exceeding great Shield amen when he appeared to Isaac he said fear not for I am with thee as I was with thy father Abraham to Jacob he says fear not for the god of Jacob or the god of Abraham and Isaac is also the god of Jacob Amen to Joshua here he says fear not as I was with Moses so am I with you now now what is he trying to say don't be fearful there's going to be a lot of things that's going to get your attention there's going to be a lot of things that's going to try to strike fear but God says that does not who you are you're an overcomer here tonight somebody look to your neighbor and say you're an overcomer amen turn to your other neighbor and say you're a I'm an overcomer hallelujah amen yes to Jacob fear or not to Joshua fear not Amen to Gideon he says fear not amen thou Mighty Man of Valor you see I I say here tonight amount as God told Jehoshaphat there and in second chronicles 20 and 17 you shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves and stand still and see the salvation of the Lord with you oh Judah oh Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed for tomorrow go out against them and the Lord will be with thee can you say amen amen therein in Isaiah God was was speaking there in Isaiah 41 and 10. he said fear thou not for I am with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen the yea I will help thee yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness behold all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded they shall be as nothing they that strive with thee Shall Perish and thou shalt seek them and shall not find them even them that contended with thee they that war against thee shalt be as nothing as a thing of not for I am the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand amen and saying unto thee fear not somebody say fear not I will help thee fear not whom thou worm Jacob and ye men of Israel I will help thee saith the Lord and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel behold I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth Thou shalt thresh the mountains and beat them small and shall make the heels his chaff Thou shalt find them and the wind shall carry them away and the Whirlwind shall scatter them and thou shalt rejoice in the Lord and Shout glory in the Holy One of Israel now God's not needing abled man God's needing a amen faithful man God's not needing amen men that that is that's got the muscles and got the intelligence God's needing someone that'll stand courageous that'll stand at the post of Duty as men of God can you say amen amen now now in our society today many are when talking about the men many of the scholars are asking where are the men amen where are men today uh many are asking you know there's plenty of males but there's not enough leaders but I want to say in the church amen we've got plenty of people standing in church and benches but we're meeting some men and women that is going to stand up to the enemy and say I'm going to defeat Satan I'm going to fulfill my purpose that God has given me can I hear an amen he man take Heart Take heart it it's a phrase that amen for someone who may have failed take heart is is someone that may be a little bit on the discouraged side amen it means to take comfort to stand in confidence it means to be courageous it means to get up it means to fight it means to amen we've got a job to do and we must fulfill that job amen God's calling men and women to be courageous here tonight amen that's exactly right oh my now sometimes we look at our failures and we're looking at our situations and we say now Lord amen I would work for you but I've got my failures I would work for you but Lord I failed here I would work for you but but I've got this situation that would stop me I say tonight that we need to stop looking at the excuses and stop looking at our failures and we need to start looking at the purpose that God put us here for well praise the Lord amen Samson was a failure Samson was a big failure Samson was amen when you when you talk about Samson Samson's not talked about too too many times as amen as as a as a good godly man but you know what he was ordained of God he was a Son of God he was the son of God That Failed and even in his failure he took courage and defeated the enemy that had put his eyes out amen hallelujah amen I say tonight it's time to get ready well I you know I man many times we we fall and we fail and and and and and the critics are all around us saying well amen they must not have the Holy Ghost and Satan's right there to try to Amen to to manipulate your mind and manipulate your heart if he can talk you out of your weapon if he can talk you out of your purpose amen then Satan knows that his kingdom will Thrive and flourish so Satan is there to destroy him he's there to discourage you he's there to Bring Havoc to your mind and to your heart what can you say man amen he's the one that Hallelujah that that that gives you the gun and says go rob the bank and then he's the one that turns you in for robbing the bank amen he's the one that he's the instigator and he's the accuser but I say tonight that if there's people with courage that'll stand to the enemy there is no weapon formed against us that is going to prosper well praise the Lord amen as a as a human being you you've gotta you you live in a realm of humanity a Humanity amen but you got to step out of your humanity and you've got to come into the supernatural with God Amen you got to step out of the you've got to step out of of of of of of your comfort zone many times amen and you've got to walk with God you've got to step out of that discouragement you've got to step out amen of what the enemy many of us are are are comfortable just setting in misery and setting and discouragement there's too many of us that are that are comfortable sitting in mediocrity but I say tonight the supernatural will never be found in mediocrity you'll only find the supernatural when you are willing to get up and get out and to press on into the things of God Amen I say oh come on church amen it was Jack anchor that says I believe that we can break that sound barrier amen many had tried and many had failed many had tried and many had failed But Chuck Yeager said I am going to break the sound barrier I I just say tonight amen God Count Me In with the courageous group I am ready to do what it takes to go beyond my limitations and to see a supernatural God man Hallelujah the lines are drawn completely different when you're walking with God the lines are drawn completely different can you say man amen the rights and the wrongs are are are are are not the same as the world standards amen and Christianity is different when you're walking with God don't look at the church norm and say well if you a few hours in church a paying of some money sometimes and and that's all that is required God is looking for men and women that he can walk with and relate with and show his power in he's looking for someone can you see man amen or can you say Amen yes yes in laodicea there's somebody that can walk with God in the Supernatural realm yes this day there's somebody that can believe God for miracles and healings and the supernatural there is a God that can walk with you man the prophet would say when people take God at his word and believe his promise it's so Supernatural till it becomes crazy to the world the people of the world God Is So Much Greater his promises his power his being his living and his expectations of us is so much higher than the things of this world till we become crazy well praise the Lord you know what I'm trying to tell you if God's give if God has has called you for a purpose his purpose is a lot higher than any man or woman in this building amen his purpose is far higher oh don't serve God in this mediocrity of of humanity serve God by faith and expect the supernatural expect your children to be saved expect your spouse to be filled with the Holy Ghost expect a man for a Rapture to take place expect to be a part of it expect it tonight can you see man man you can turn me down in the mains if you want to give me a little bit more up here on the on the uh platform is however just whatever is comfortable for you guys amen his call his call is for us to take courage hallelujah amen well praise the Lord brother Wendell I'm the only teenager here that amen uh it's you know I I I I remember when Caleb he was the middle boy and and so Kobe had his friends and and uh and Josh of course he was a lot younger and he had some friends but man uh uh Josh did or Caleb didn't quite have any friends so you know uh at his age at at that time and I ain't mine and I I began to and there he was a teenager and and moping and a little bit mopping around and saying you know I just ain't got no friends and I said oh but there's a friend that is that is greater that that than any this is a good opportunity well can you say amen amen by the time that I I got you know went into my teenage years all of my friends had all had all you know went their own way and doing their own thing amen but you know what I found is in those times I found God to be real I found God Amen he was pulling back the Shucks so to speak so that the seed could live he was he was doing that for me well praise the Lord amen well my world's been turned upside down brother Wendell amen my lights are off right I I don't have any money or I I lost my job that is an opportunity for you to stand with Claridge and believe God oh my my children aren't serving the lord it just looks so Bleak it looks so packed that is your opportunity to stand up and say I believe God it was the Apostle Paul amen there is the prisoner chained to he was chained there with stocks and and and on the ship and the Bible says that they were they were at Sea uh for many many days and the storm had come and it got so bad that that they they began to uh you know throw everything off and and then they they were fixing to sneak in into the boats and and and take off and the little lifeboats and leave Paul laying there amen but but the but the Lord appeared unto Paul and said Paul fear not I have a purpose for your life I told you that you're going to have to go testify and you're going to make it to testify you know what he done he went to the captain of the ship and he said Brethren fear not for the angel of the Lord come to me tonight and said that we will make it why because I've got a purpose and nothing can take me out before my purpose amen when the devil says well you fixing to die you just stand right there and say but God gave me a purpose to raise my children God gave me a purpose to win souls God gave me a purpose and I'm going to stand upon his promises I am destined with purpose Hallelujah can you say Amen a leader leads in spite of his inadequacies and Imperfections a leader stands and says we're going to make it when things look wrong it's not that the leader is is is uh uh uh lying but the leader has got courage and he's got to stand and say God's brought us forth in the past he'll bring us forth again today Hallelujah a coward he will die a thousand deaths but a Believer will stand up and he'll say we're going to make it through can you say amen hallelujah what we need tonight is some five-fold ministry that's not cowardly with the word of God that'll stand up and say God's word says it friends you can rest your soul upon him what we need tonight is mamas that'll tell their babies listen God has ordained you with safe purpose and you will fulfill that purpose can you say Amen thinking of Joshua's call to lead and divide the inheritance he could he could feel the responsibility of the call I believe Joshua could feel his Humanity Joshua must have felt so insignificant as he's standing there amen now Moses had already laid hands on him and Moses had already told him Moses had already told him you're the one that God has ordained he anointed him and but now here Joshua is he's standing there a little bit questioning amen but then God himself comes down in Joshua 1 and says be strong and of good courage how can you say man Hallelujah well glory to God now Miriam and moles or Miriam and Aaron had come against Moses and they were pointing out all of his his inadequacies and pointing out his Humanity y'all remember that amen he had married a black woman and and and Moses and and his and his brother and sister was there saying huh you shouldn't have done that amen and and here here he was and they were they were coming against him but you see they were looking at a natural situation and did not see the purpose did not see the call did not well praise the Lord you one another we're not careful we can get our little critical amen uh uh spiritual underwear all bunched up Hallelujah we can get all we can get all all upset and just all well this one and that one and well that he shouldn't be and she shouldn't be and they should but what we need tonight is to stand up and say the god that called me can also call my brother and my sister and the one that called my brother and my sister is the one that's going to keep them like he's promised that he would keep me oh come on church is there anyone who is courageous here tonight that is going to stand up and say the god that started me is able to finish me and then turn around to your brother and say The God Who started you he is able to finish you uh well you're not you're not you're not hearing me you're not you're not understanding what I'm trying to tell you here tonight you might be sick you might be feeling down you might be feeling empty you might be feeling forsaken but somebody's got to stand up with courage and say I believe God [Applause] ah well some of you is looking at me like a like a young mule looking at a new gate what I'm trying to tell you is you've got to look out past yourself and see a promise Hallelujah can you say man Samson the Philistines got you now they've got you trapped inside the city you're behind the Gates amen now you've got a lot of smarts and you were you took the 300 foxes and and you you you you you let the tails on fire and you've done a lot of damage amen but now we're talking about Gates that weigh tons amen Samson there's no way out there's no way God's going to deliver you there's no way but Hallelujah you know what I believe Samson done Samson felt the locks the Seven Locks of his hair and he says Dom going to the city Gates can you say Amen oh they were laughing at him and making fun of him but the glory of the Lord come upon him and the Bible says that he ripped the city Gates and he ran up to the top of the hill Sam just a show a courageous man that'll stand for the word of God can you say Amen amen yes Omaha the attitude of victory is so important the attitude when you're in the trial you've got to get up when you don't feel like getting up you've got to go to work when you don't feel like going to work you've got to go to church when you don't feel like going to church you've got I'm not one of those guys you'll never hear it out of my mouth that it's okay to stay home when you're sick that no no no no call for the Elders of the church and let them know when you're sick you need to be a church that's what the pastor believes can you say amen that's what your Prophet belief you see when when in in all of those services that would come I remember the the one the one time when the uh uh uh they they were uh there were two meetings going on at the same time so you had to you you had the sophisticated group that had come in and and and you know they they all come in and and setting down and they had a nice quiet little service amen and so as as they were being ushered out then here come brother branham's group that was you know on the outside waiting to get in and they were all straight jackets hey man they were all they went on crutches amen they they they they they were on cots and they were sickly and what can you say man amen Mark was it you see one had an intellectual gospel but another one had the power of God unto salvation had a gospel saying yes we just want to hear a few words but there were some others that was taking courage amen they were bringing them in from the hospitals they were bringing them in from institutions they were bringing them in from insane asylums and somebody was standing with courage said if I can get him to the house of God I know that God will deliver them why because there's Victory and there's healing and there's love and there's joy and there's refreshing in the house of God can you say Amen oh yes attitudes attitude just Hallelujah nothing's going to hinder me for my purpose nothing's going to hinder me for my prayer well praise the Lord I told the enemy you know I you know Satan Satan battles me a little bit he mind him and I tell him I put the devil right there well you know put the devil on notice right there where he's he's messing with me amen and I say I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna fight you until I die well praise the Lord I'll lay there in bed sometimes and I can't you know it's hard for me to hard for me to fall asleep sometimes you know name mine and if I do I I fall asleep for an hour and then I'm back awake and so I'll just land amen and I'm tempted to get up and and go do something but I tell that old level amen night time is created to sleep the prophet says that all The Evils are out at night and amen and and and so I'm going to stay in bed beside my wife and I'm going to tell you something else either I'm going to get some sleep or I'm not going to get some sleep but I'm going to give you trouble and we'll praise the Lord it ain't mine ain't mad and sometimes I have to set my alarm for seven o'clock because I'm just getting to sleep around six o'clock amen but you know what I'm doing I'm letting that devil know I am here for a purpose and you're not taking me from my purpose [Applause] well praise the Lord amen the devil says you're a husband I say I'm not a husband I'm still here on Earth I've got a purpose and I am here going to defeat the Devil the devil says Ah you're you know you're you're you're you you Elders right you know he'll say you Elders well you know you you your ministry is over as long as you are on Earth you have a Ministry God's calling tonight for courage you take the courage away from somebody and it don't matter you take the courage away from somebody Iman and healing can be right there but because their heart is faint because their heart is fearful because their heart man and it's creating the attitude of a man of Gloom but I say tonight if you could ever put Faith back on the at the at the front door of your house if you could ever put the strong man in the house resurrect that strong man the Bible says put the strong man right there and the strong man will cast out any other day you know what that tells me Hallelujah the strong man of the house is stronger than the biggest imp that is trying to torment you I'm here to tell you well come on church amen I don't care what how strong the enemy is how strong the demons are how strong the sickness is how strong whatever it happens amen well praise the Lord but I'm going to tell you I'm going to do it anyways amen there's been times where I've been up here on this platform and my chest is so clogged up closed amen I can hardly breathe but I tell the devil I'm not going to ask for a substitute I'm going to stand up there I'm going to give it everything I've got well praise the Lord I say when the devil tries to come in one way amen I'm gonna stand right there and fight there is no weapon formed against me that is going to prosper I shall overcome because greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world is there some Believers in the building that can take some courage tonight and say God renew my vision renew my purpose renew me for who you've called me to be I want to stand strong against the enemy well praise the Lord do you love him here tonight man courageous yes the commission and I want you to notice the commissions have always been given to the flawed human beings God called Flawless human beings well praise the Lord all the prophets were flawed and yet God put his Supernatural holy word in their hearts and upon their lips I praise the Lord it's flawed men that God's called to be the leaders of the family it's flawed women that God's called to be mothers they man to take care of the home it's flawed preachers that God has put over his put over his church it's flawed the only difference between you and somebody else is you're here with a purpose what made brother Branham so different than all of those other guys he was born with a purpose amen once calls you to stand when everyone else when many have fallen and failed you were here with a purpose and you will never uh under don't underestimate your purpose can you say man amen Hallelujah we press so submission submission now brother Harry preached on submission here a while back and submission sometimes can be a bad word who or no one wants but the blessings are with submission as brother Harry was telling us the blessings come with that follow submission amen well hello now missions I'm missing submission then everyone gets real quiet on me amen amen but submission submission a human being submitting himself to the supernatural God will bring the supernatural invisible realm in a human being's reality oh Hallelujah Abraham had to believe God he had to follow God he had to obey God says I want you to leave your Kindred won't you leave all of them God appeared to him says leave them all but Abraham Didn't Do It All he done most of it but he kept his his uh his his nephew with him amen and his family and the Bible says that God would not appear unto Abraham God did not appear unto Abraham until he fully submitted but when he fully submitted then the supernatural God came back Hallelujah I got to sit in here today here here in the church and and uh brother Joe would put that that that light up behind that cross and and I I like that you know the lights are off and you're here and and and it just you you know it just it's so peaceful in here and I got to thinking amen oh there's too many times we go without prayer we it's because that we have turned the gospel into a human's religion until we don't really need prayer anymore we've already got everything down and and we don't really get into Earnest prayer unless there's something that's going wrong in our families or our lives and then when that happens then we get Earnest and we start calling out to God and and and I was as I was sitting there I said Lord why is this it seems like this is a routine it seems like amen it takes it it takes it it takes you to to to sort of pull yourself away and and uh because and and I really even felt it in my heart it's because we've learned how to be a Christian but Christianity is not in the learning Christianity is in the presence of God walking with you you dying to yourself so that he can raise you in his likeness oh come on church so where a person is Walking with God if he's courageous it takes courage to stand up and say this this is more than just a Sunday school lesson I need the supernatural this is more than just another church service I need the supernatural amen it's going to require somebody to get out of that comfort zone and say I need the supernatural no we got a Revival coming up amen it gave me another meeting it can be another protractive meeting but oh what would it be if there were some folks that was courageous enough to stand before God and say Lord I want to start fasting and praying and the psalmist says I fasted and prayer returned into my Buddhism I other group of preachers I want just another I don't want these things I to see God somebody that is courageous enough who praise the Lord amen now you're in your mindset amen and I I have found in my sickness some of the things that I've gone through I I can tell you right now amen if I get all gloomy in my mind and I allow that gloominess to get there before you know it I'm feeling bad all the time I'm feeling bad it's just everything I do like it's just like I oh I just amen but when I start turning my vision back around and say that's not for me that's not who I am and I begin to look and I say I'm going to get up I'm going to get out I'm going to do something I'm going to press on Amen what do I find that that that that that something that predestinated something that's on the inside of me what's up and I begin to see things a little bit differently and I begin to take control of that situation when Satan's trying to come well can you say man Abraham had to say he had to confess that he was a father of many nations even though his body was saying he was lying Hallelujah even though he looked at Sarah amen and she was on you know she she had already lost her her good teeth and maybe her false teeth amen and there she was with a cane she had already it was it was but yet he had to stand right there and say I believe God oh y'all ain't listening to me here tonight you guys just want to come in and put our little time clock into the into the church service you guys just want to come in amen and make your little conscience feel good but I am here to say it you've got a bigger purpose than that here tonight you you take a purpose here tonight you can raise up you can pull that sword and you can get your healing can get your Miracle you can get a Revival you can be filled with the Holy Ghost you can have those things in your life can you say Amen yes amen now the ability to see the problems is not one of the nine spiritual gifts the ability to see that what the devil is doing in the church what the devil's doing in your family or what the devil's doing to you or what the devil's doing can you say man that doesn't really take too much spiritual discernment Hallelujah but it does take the Holy Ghost to stand up against the odds and say when I received the Holy Ghost I receive the power from God on high come on but my mind who cares about your mind stand up in faith in the gift that God's placed in your life yeah praise the Lord some of us have got that Holy Ghost so dumbed down amen till although we say we say the Holy Ghost still speaks in tongues and the Holy Ghost still does Miracles and the Holy Ghost amen but we no more believe that than anything in the world if we were what the scripture says or the Apostle Paul told the Corinthian Church there in the 14th chapter he says covet the gifts amen he says but but more importantly covet to prophesy now this that that that that part of the Bible was never taken out amen God still does those things but we don't see those things because there's no one courageous enough to stand up and say the god of today is the god of the book of Acts if he'd done it then he'll do it now Hallelujah I I I you know people say well brother Branham took him out of the church he did not know set the gifts in order you took him out of the church the prophet set him in order and all the way up into 1965 brother Brandon was saying that the nine spiritual gifts should be in every local church the devil don't want those spiritual gifts in the church because brother Bradham says when you get those spiritual gifts to operating correctly sin can't stay in the church the devil wants Sinners setting in the church the Devil Wants backsliders Something in the church the devil wants people without courage sitting in the church but God says I want you to take my word take courage stand upon my word believe for the supernatural where I'm at the Supernatural is pressed Hallelujah well praise the Lord I want our young people to hear somebody speak in tongues I want our young people they meant to be so full with the Holy Ghost that God will give them visions and dreams that God will but it's going to take courage it's going to take somebody to stand up and say the god of yesterday is the god today Amen brother Bradham says all of the ages amen of approximated that church all of the ages have imitated their desire their goal their ambition was for that church to live in them can you say Amen Hallelujah so I'm not just wanting to find my problem amen the problem is is we need courage we need courage amen well praise the Lord ain't mine I want to stand up say Lord there's something wrong with me now I I believe that the spirit of discernment we'll let you know amen if there's if the spirit of discernment will will operate it it'll tell you that the certain situation that is there it'll tell you the devil's behind that thing the devil's working against it the devil's pushing his propaganda can you say man and a spiritual man or woman will stand right there with courage and say Satan you let go of my brother you let go of my sister you let go what what what is he doing he is standing there under the authority of the word and they're believing the Lord we've been talking about families the last you know four or five weeks amen all courageous oh God we need great we we need some courageous mamas and daddies in this day can you say amen amen in this day we need courageous babies amen as soon as the babies are born from out of the womb we need some courageous babies amen but I'm here to tell you now they're they're born Sinners amen but they're still innocent praise the Lord mamas and daddies can stand up and say ah I'm gonna I'm gonna stand there I'm gonna I'm gonna live it I'm gonna pray it I'm gonna believe it my child he I am raising another I am raising another Moody I am raising an amen another Billy Sunday I'm I'm not raising just any kind of a child I'm raising a child to serve the Lord well praise the Lord can you say Amen now remember submission is the only it takes courage to submit it takes courage it takes courage for you women and women's rights and with this women's lib it takes courage for you to stand there and say I'm surrendering my rights to my husband amen I'm going to follow his leadership it takes courage in this evil age amen where Christ has been put outside the church it takes courage for you and I to stand up and say surrender my rights unto my Lord Jesus Christ it takes courage but I'm here to tell you amen hallelujah now you know you might have a frog for a husband I you know I'm not I'm not I'm not here to debate that but we ain't got a frog for God my wife might look at me and and think oh Hallelujah there's plenty of times I'm sure she's done it amen but we've got a God who will never fail so when I Surrender everything I am to him everything he is comes upon me well praise the Lord I said praise the Lord everything he is he's not a he's he's not a man he's not a a one of those gives his word and then then pulls it back amen God is one that keeps his word and I say tonight do all though all hella sell me yet I shall not be moved somebody say I shall not be moved now there's a lot of church members that sing that song preach your eyes shall not be I shall not be moved preacher I shall not be I shall not be moved but that's not the way the song was written Satan I shall not be I shall not be moved I'm not moving I'm not turning I'm not bending I'm not backing down I'm going forward I'm fulfilling my purpose [Applause] well glory to God amen well and while we're on submission I might as well I might as well throw this in some people say some people say well if my husband gave me something to respect I'd give him that honor I would say that if you went back and you looked in the Bible all of those Bible all those Bible believers you know we we might we might not be able to uh let me let me tell you could could you imagine being Peter's wife Hallelujah Peter you know Paul Peter you know and and and I I you know we we talk about Peter uh he he was always the one that say that Jesus and Satan get there Peter was just always talking out of turn Peter was Peter was always missing the mark Jesus would be trying to give the spiritual Revelation and Peter's missing it he's just totally missing it he's telling them I'm not going to be here much time much much longer with you he's already told him the son of man's got to go to the grave and then and then Peter pulls out his sword and says we'll fight for you till till death well Peter you're missing the point here remember what I told you about Jonah and remember what I've told you about these kinds of things you know and and and but Peter just you know just couldn't quite just couldn't quite get it together amen but it was also Peter it was it was Peter that stood there when no one else was catching him when no one else was kept was was a light a light just beamed in his head in his heart when he's asking the disciples whom do men say that I am oh there's later than this or this and then Peter he's the one that stands up and says I Know Who You Are you're the Christ the son of the Living God the rest of the guys are going huh Peter and then Jesus turns around and says Flesh and Blood hasn't given this to you Peter then because of this I'm giving you uh it was revealed to you about my Father in heaven and because of this I'm giving you the keys keys who did he give the keys to the kingdom to the guy that a few days later was backsliding cussing and saying that he don't know who Jesus is but you see and could you imagine could you imagine Peter's wife having to go through all of that and having to Hallelujah but you see what God's seen in Peter maybe those around him didn't see him Peter but God gave the keys to the kingdom to O Brother Peter well praise the Lord can you say Amen amen so so we we when we look in the natural and we we we don't we don't see things the way God sees things and you then you fail to submit to the glory that is to follow that life of submission it takes courage in this age of rebellion stand up and say I am going to resist anything that will take me from humility and submission to the Lord Jesus Christ can you say man amen that that's exactly right Hallelujah well you love him yes I love him with all of my heart amen so so when we look here and and then by the way and then when Peter had done all of that Peter in his heart loved the Lord Peter loved the Lord so much Peter Peter was so he was so condemned that when that when everyone separated Peter was he was when Jesus was raised from the dead Peter was found out there on his boat naked out there in the middle out there out there fishing and when Jesus tells the disciples when he tells us he says he tells the the ladies he says go tell my disciples and don't forget Peter that I'm alive don't tell my go tell my disciples and don't forget Peter let Peter know and he still has purpose [Applause] and Peter didn't quite get the news and and and and wasn't going to hear it and so Jesus went and looking for Peter and there he was he was he was ashamed and he was hiding and he was all of that he had lost his courage but then Jesus says Peter do you love me you know I love you Lord I said feed my sheep then he asked him again Peter do you love me you know I love you Lord you know oh it don't look like it it don't look like it but I do and feed my sheep and then he comes back around and he says Peter do you love me but this time it wasn't the filial love it was the agape love is I'm trying to get way down to your purpose Peter Peter you're you I I know all around you you look like a you look like a goofball to everybody and you are the Peter if I can get down to the reality here do you love me from way down deep inside I do Lord he says then won't you feed my sheep or my Lambs can you say man God was taking this goofball that maybe everyone else was saying and God gave the man courage who was the spokesman on the day of Pentecost it was the Gopher girlfriend brethren these are not drunk as you suppose but this is that oh courageous tonight don't don't sit there in the yesteryears and don't sit there and what you could be don't sit there thinking of what things should be why don't you stand up with courage tonight and say just be courageous enough to come and lay before the Lord and say Lord I want to submit if there's anything I've learned in all my trials is to submit to you help me to submit to you give me courage is that right courage courage Zapora didn't see in Moses what the pillar of fire scene in Moses amen but Moses had a purpose so we've got to see that one and we've got to see that in one another we got to see the husband's got to see that and the wives children's got to see that in the parents we got to see that one we we've got to be able to look beyond the flaw and see the purpose well praise the Lord when we see that who are ugly surrendering your mind surrendering your eyes surrendering your thoughts to him to where you can see your spouse or your children or Mom and Dad or or or or or or the church the your brothers and sisters in the church you can see them the way God sees them when you look at things you want to you want to condemn it and zap it and kill it but God is merciful God is compassionate God is renewing God loves the opportunity to restore can you say Amen I love him here tonight that should take that should make us all stand with courage is that right Satan coming into you tonight and we're going to close if the musicians would get ready to come how how good we are at 8 30 out let's have the musicians come amen now now Satan's always there he's always there and he's got to have somebody that he can use and Satan come to Jesus now he was the very Son of God Satan come to Jesus and he said if thou be the son of God Jesus says or brother Brandon says Satan never did believe it he never did believe that Jesus was the son of God never he never did come to that and he's constantly and and he says and brother Brandon says and he will teach others he will instruct others with the same unbelief he says he'll try to take he says he'll try to put something in your heart against your husband to where you cannot fully see him and his purpose it'll happen he says it'll happen with the with the pastor where Satan will do it to where and he'll put if if if until the pastor loses its effect and brother Brandon says and sister he says and sister you that's been considering now now I'm just your brother but he's called me now you shouldn't think those thoughts that's him [Music] oh there was somebody there that was that was that was saying that brother Branham just you know yeah he's he has his opinions he has but he stopped it he caught it he caught it he's right in the service says sister don't do that now I'm your brother you don't have to believe me as your brother but you have to believe purpose you have to accept the call what can you say man so so what are what what am I trying to say Satan is if he tries to teach you teach you not to love your husband or not to love your wife or not to love or to believe the prophet or don't you know that he is also the one that is questioning your call [Music] if if he if you're my wife toward my leadership how much more would he do it to my wife concerning herself [Music] are y'all catching me in other words the same one that influences men and women here on the earth is the same one that influences our minds and our hearts that tells us you're not going to make the Rapture you're not bribe you send away your day of Grace you never were you'll never be it's the same spirit that would get on you concerning questioning the prophet's Authority is that same unbelieving spirit that gets you questioning your own salvation [Music] in product is for you to stay out of his presence so he'll do whatever it takes to keep you out of his presence but I'm here to tell you someone's going to stand up with courage and say that ain't happening I ain't listening I ain't buying it praise the Lord amen some years back when that when that believed the sign you know before that believed the sign came in and different ones that left I want to tell you Satan fought my mind was fighting my mind so hard I said you know this ain't right you know that message ain't true you know that ain't and I mean he bombarded my mind and bombarded and bombarded well at the time I'm thinking dear God I must not be a believer do I even have the Holy Ghost now this is before this is before these people started going off this way in that way [Music] and I'm sitting there in prayer and of course every time when it would come I'd take it right back to scripture if this isn't true then then tell me who it is [Music] if the words of that Prophet isn't true then then why all of these scriptures and then hit then it would then it would leave for a little bit then it'd come right back be listening to a tape and then say well that's just his opinion that was stuff going on in my head and I'd say I'd come right back and I'd say no it wasn't his opinion he was God's voice for this generation he was my prophet now then I began to hear so I talked to some others I said man does the devil replied to you they said yes amen Saints fought me hard fought men fought and fought me hard you mean you've you've always been a great defender of the message you mean you because Satan fights you I said man it's been hitting my head like crazy before you know what this was going and that one's going and this one's going and that one's going and I'm thinking you sorry scoundrel these were demons that were trying to come in and someone had to take courage use that word it's not based on his personality and it's not based on my personality it's based on what God Said and I've got to take courage enough courage to say I believe God and you know what that happened for that that happened probably for two or three months and then one day it left and then that's when I found the quotes where brother branham's using that same thing where Satan's saying if you be if you be if you be he said that same spirit will come on you if it be if it be if it be but he said you got to take him right back to the word and say it is written well glory to God you know what that done to me that made me Rejoice I thought that old scoundrel if he's trying to get me to doubt that means that must mean I have something pretty important I have a pretty important purpose here and Satan you're not taking it I want to tell you tonight if there's a if there's ever a time to believe and believe with all of your heart if there's a time to take courage to stand up and say I am a believer I think we need to do it tonight and say I believe God [Applause] praise the Lord if thou be the Son of God if thou be the Son of God if thou be the Son of God shut up devil get thee behind me it is written aren't you glad Jesus had courage he got more courage than what you think something that's in you that is greater than you think the anointing power of the Holy Spirit oh yes submission is a beautiful thing when we fall in love with him submit ourselves to him He will draw nigh and he gives more grace take courage take courage what are you playing [Music] give it all to you I surrendered Jesus [Music] foreign Satan put a lot of ifs in your mind tonight has he been doing that lately if thou be if you were if I want you to just tell him tonight I'm taking courage against you and I'm gonna say there ain't no if about it you have gonna have your part in the Lake of Fire and I refuse to go there with you you're condemned I'm not you're unsavable Satan I am [Music] I'm going to act like a child of God I'm

at a blood atonement we believe God we believe what he is We Believe Who We Are I want to I want to tell you right now Heaven has no problem identifying Who You Are the reproach for Christ or the cause of the word brother Branham says Satan didn't believe that you know he said if thou be but the angel said he is he says and that's the difference another place he says if thou be do so and so let it see you do it but the angel said he's there and I say tonight if if if if if shut up God's word has already come message has already come Eagles cry each scream has already come I've heard it
