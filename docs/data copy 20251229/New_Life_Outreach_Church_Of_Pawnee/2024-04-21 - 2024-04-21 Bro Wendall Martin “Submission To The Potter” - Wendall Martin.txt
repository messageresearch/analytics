they just poor and poor so all the neighbors got together and they said let's plant some extra crops this year and the money we make off them extra crops will pay for Benji or Benny to get that operation so they sent them off on a train to get the operation done and he was as he was coming back the people were standing around cuz they wanted to see Benny as he got off the train as the train pulled up to the station he was getting up the conductor asked him said Benny how much did that operation cost you said I don't know what it he said I don't know how much it cost them but it cost them

let's go ahead and turn to the book of Ephesians and and um uh we will look here at um the 10th verse and um trying to learn to um preach with a uh timer a little bit a little better I know so I I look at my I put my get get I found this little Gizmo here that uh might help me to stay a little uh a little closer uh to time and now don't be getting used to it cuz amen but um we're going to read the 10th verse Ephesians 2 and 10 it says for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you for your many blessings thank you for your love that you have given us and calling us your bride Lord we're asking that your Holy Spirit would Minister to us here tonight I Lord I as as I was just closing my eyes to pray and uh looked like a text that came in from Sister Laura Martin there from Arkansas asking for prayer for her mother and we just pray Lord whatever that situation is I I pray Lord that you would touch our precious sister and that you would make her whole you know the situation just asking Lord just now that you would you would Minister in that need in that situation father we thank you for ministering for Brother Steve and Sister Laura and and encouraging them and strengthen them their family father now Lord here we are today Lord ministering your word and we're asking that you would speak through me and that you would hear through us all father and we'll give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus can the church say amen amen and amen God bless you you can be seated here tonight amen we um want a minister here tonight uh on a simple a simple thought submission to the Potter amen submission to the Potter and it is good to see brother Josh and sister Loretta they they went uh to uh they ministered for Brother Sam Parker this morning and so good to have them uh back here for the service I know it's hard when you leave so early and and U he was just they were just skidding in here um just right before church and so we're glad to see you all back amen but um uh submission to the Potter I I I think um as we as we have talked a little lately about character and and growth and maturity I I think the there's there's a word that we need to use and that's pliability amen being pliable the quality of being Supple enough to bend freely or repeatedly without breaking and and I I think that's that is a requirement for every one of us as as Christians in our growth amen is is there has got to be appli leness in our heart we don't want to be um so set in our ways so set in our experience that we um that we can't grow because growth is part of Amen uh maturity amen and and not necessarily maturity is not necessarily uh uh there's there's a lot of there's there's there's a lot of grown men that aren't mature there's a lot of grown women that aren't mature and so we don't want to say that I've been you know I I've been a Christian for um years without maturity we don't want to be uh sitting on the sideline uh and saying I'm just a child so amen I don't have to worry about maturity no God is calling us all into maturity and we're all going to make a Rapture whether you're a kid or whether you're a hundred years old we have all got to mature in the Lord amen so another another definition for pliability is is the capacity to yield to another it is stretchable to be flexible to be workable now uh pability is opposite of stiff neck amen a stiff neck is hotti it is stubborn amen it is it is set in in their way acts 7:49 amen uh it says Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot stol what how house will you build me saith the Lord or what is the place of my rest hath not my hand made all these things ye stiff neck and uncircumcised in heart and in ears ye do always resist the Holy Ghost even as your father did so do ye can you say Amen so we want to be pliable there in in Isaiah 54 and the 16th chapter the the Isaiah God speaking through Isaiah says I have created the Smith that bloweth the coals in the fire now I want you to say I have created I see it is God speaking saying I have created the Smith that that is blowing coals in the fire amen and that brings forth an instrument for his work I and I have created the waster to destroy so God is the one who has ordained things in our lives to bring about uh uh the the The Treasure of his nature within each one of us I've created the Smith that blows the coast I've created the waster to destroy I have brought this thing in why because there are things in our carnal walk in our carnal nature that has to burn that has to fall short so that he can bring an instrument of his glory within us you see the designer of you built you to respond to the word of this day amen when God designed you when God built you he designed you to be able to respond to the word to respond to correction to respond to the holy spirit because that's the only way that he's going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle that's the only way there's going to be a Rapture is the when God designs you he didn't just place you here just to be here he's placed you here to reflect his glory reflect his purpose in this generation and it's got to be of his own choosing his own making can you say amen amen so when he builds you to respond to the word of this day that means you are soft that means you are workable that means you there's no resistances in your will to his will amen there is one desire God I want your you I want your reflection in me whatever you've called me for whatever you've designed me for whatever I I want your will to be expressed through me can you say amen amen I think this is this is important because amen it is God that prepares the beding crowns and amen he plants you according to his eternal purpose amen and you you are are are in amen uh in your body in in a full of emotion and full of decisions and and and and and you're full of the ups and the downs and you're full of you you're full of Pride you're full of Amen uh uh I I thought brother brother David reminded me this morning that the the the first time that brother brandham and actually a couple times when brother brandham talked about um the story that we that we expressed here this morning he titled the sermon Pride amen it was pride and every time he's going back he goes back to Pride and how that Pride keeps us from coming and giving everything that we've got coming into his presence Pride keeps us from surrendering and offering the thing that we hold as a treasure the thing that we hold as valuable the thing that we're trying to hold on to you've got to come and and and Lay It All Before the feet of Jesus Christ knowing that Christ has everything for our lives can you say amen amen but you're in this body you you you are amen but it is that soul that is soft it's that soul that is pliable God created you with the ability to to to surrender to his will amen now amen so when God equips you when God brings you here on the earth he plants you according to that Divine Purpose amen now he places you where you can grow he places you where you can flourish he gives you amen he gives you kids a a a good home he gives you a good pastor he gives you a good youth leader he gives you good friends he gives you these things but the the the key ingredient is are you willing to be tutored by the Holy Spirit where he has placed you are you willing to be taught on it's not good enough for the for the pastor to have the anointing and the pastor to to desire and the pastor to flow it is got to be your desire Amen to to achieve the desires that God has placed in that local group God has placed that desire God has placed that Vision God places those things and it's our desire to be pliable so that his anointing can work through me amen hallelujah places you young people in there with your youth group amen not when not when the youth leaders you know gets up and says all right well we don't see it that way we don't want to do it that way we don't well you know you're not being pliable amen well that's just you well you're God gives us leaders and he expects us to be pliable to his will amen but we're living in a day where there's not there there's no such thing as leadership because no one wants to follow there's no such thing as leadership because no one has the courage to lay it all down so that we can follow God's will can you say Amen but God places you in the in the grounds where you can flourish now I want you to think about that now because amen where you are where you are right now is so important where you are as a Believer is so important where you're setting the trial you're looking at the situations that that God places in your life is so very important to God because God is trying to mold something within you as his believer a praise the name of the Lord amen the scripture says there in Ezekiel 17 and8 that it they're talking about the church it was planted in a good soil by Great Waters that it might bring forth branches that it might bear fruit that it might be a Godly Vine well glory to God it's God that plants this it's God that puts that in there so that you and I will surrender our Wills to the Lord Jesus Christ amen now we want things to come in a supernatural way where we're where we're feeling we're shaken and we're we got we're speaking in tongues that's the way we was in in Pentecost amen it has to come and we we feel the vibration no God sends the situation and he expects you to yield yourself to his word come on he expects every one of us hallelujah somebody say let me yield to his way Amen to cultivate Amen to cultivate that ground planting seeds has got to be in a cultivated ground not going to hold you long here tonight but I just want to leave this to you cultivate is to break up the F ground that means you got to you got to you got to get in there and cultivate you got to get in there and God comes in and and and he takes his tractor amen and and he takes the tiller and and he and he goes through that hard ground and he goes over it and over it and over it and over it because he wants that ground to be soft he wants that ground to be pliable he wants to plant some good seed in that ground and when there's good seed in that cultivated ground then you become the Accord according to his wisdom you become come amen a masterpiece you become a vessel unto water come on now a vessel unto H sometimes we look at elders and we say oh I wish I could be like you no you don't because if you did want to be like that person you'd be willing to go through the trials that that person has went through well I wish I could I wish I could be used like that minister no you don't because God sends situations your way and you're not willing to give that's right come on now but there's only one way to grow and that's through the power of His word in a pliable heart amen now special attention has been given to the ground that chooses the tractor or that allows the tractor can you amen well glory to God now I came out here or I was I was out here studying uh last week I believe it was and uh just sitting in right out here and brother Nathaniel and and uh Brother Devon and brother Daniel came out and and uh they chose a piece of ground out there that they were going to come in and and and till and so I seen I seen Daniel over there behind that big old tiller amen he's trying to he's trying to till that ground up amen and I seen brother Nathaniel happen to pull it back a little bit and amen set it back down and and tilling that ground you see now now the ground was hard and the ground was either going to resist or the ground was going to be pliable yeah all right on praise the Lord that ground was chosen by Nathaniel that ground was a piece of ground he he he decided not to put it in those raised beds or whatever those pretty things y'all got out there he chose that ground on the backside of that and he put the tiller in that ground so that he can put the seeds in that ground so that that ground can produce the fruit that he desires am come on now but it requires somebody killing that ground well glory to God Lord Make Me submissive to the Potter as he is as he is coming in Lord come down my road God don't I don't let a rock stay there don't let the root stay there don't let bitterness stay there don't let self stay there God I'm pray and take pride out of me get everything out of me till my ground I want to learn on I want to learn I thinking as we see you kids sitting here and I wanted to bring this in because oh I know we've got some 10 11 12 year olds here and brother brandom says I I noticed last night there's a little girl sitting here looks to be about 10 years old and she raised her hand a few minutes ago she wanted Jesus about the age of my little Becky I guess at home my little Rebecca and I noticed the little girl come up last night when she stood at the altar no more than she stood there she started speaking in tongues and someone told me some of the Brethren that she was running all over the church and speaking in tongues and singing in tongues and everything and how the Lord blessed that child get her when her heart's young and tender before she's pulled through the old TR stories and magazines and the filth of the world and got her heart all calloused I like to see the little ones come dedicate your life to him he will do something for you too honey he sure will I would never I I would never I would never replace or I would never I would never take back my raising as a young man being raised on on the pews of the church I would never take back my training from my father who taught me how to be a servant my mother amen and taught me how to be a servant I would never take back the trials that I've gone through even as a kid I would never want to take back Lord knows I wouldn't go want to go back through them again but I would never I would never take back amen the the situations that I've gone through as as a pastor as a Christian as a man amen you know why because I believe that the footsteps of a good man are ordered of the Lord and I believe that nothing comes my way except God is working on wend Martin I don't believe anything comes my way amen but what God is moving upon me that's the way we should all be that's the way our Desir should be here tonight can you say Amen you see and you young people all I can say is I've been serving the lord for for many years now amen been pastoring going on Amen close to 35 years there's one thing that I can say I'm thankful that God chose this piece of ground to work his will through and then I'm thankful that God chose me to work that in because amen I want to be something of his glory I can't do it as long as I'm still holding my peace back and say but but but no if I'm going to be a sheep I'm going to have to give my wo I'm going to have to surrender I'm going to have to well can you say Amen now I want you to look because God has prepared you with that softness but Satan wants to come in and he'll try to take that softness too and this is where I I hit all the time time on those games hallelujah amen so I hit all the time on on the gaming and on the uh the the the internet and those those kinds of things God has prepared your heart to be soft Satan wants to take your soft heart and place his junk in amen he wants to do it now Noah's Arc was made of gopher wood it was a soft wood it was light and pliable amen it was a type of what God was building in his church the ark now I want you to look at this gopher wood for just a moment no other wood would do God didn't allow any other wood he wanted gopher wood gopher wood was the was the most porous of wood gopher wood would would just soak up it's the it's the last kind of wood that any smart man would use to build a boat with because it suck it would suck all the water up but God said build the boat on out of gopherwood God is saying I'm I I I'm going to call some human beings right come on and they're going to be the worst they're they're going to be the most fickle they're going to be there is no way that these folks are going to be reliable to build an ark out of but then God says I want you to take an evergreen tree and I want you to beat all that resin out of that evergreen tree beat all beat it until all of the juices and all of the resin and all of the sap comes out of that tree and then I want you to pour on to that gopher wood and the goer wood is going to suck it all up but after the gopher wood is all sealed with that sap then that gopher wood will stand the test of time it'll go 40 days of rain it'll it'll well praise the name of the Lord God chose the go Forwood to build that Arc out of that it's a type of you and me amen we're either going to suck in all of the all of the tribulation Waters or we are going to repel the tribulation Waters it all depends on our ability to really look deep in our hearts remove all the pride and then submit can you say Amen you see why would God do that Hallelujah you kids are soft in nature God's built you to be soft God's built all of us to be soft God's built us because he wants you to soak in these words every service he wants you to listen to tapes and to be able to soak it in but we've got to be careful at what we are putting well glory to God if we're gaming all the time and we're on the internet all the time and we are we are constantly uh uh filling our hearts and our minds with junk all the time you don't have what it takes to fill up on God's things well praise the name of the Lord you can't you can't you can't love your neighbor until you get whatever you think you've got in you out you can't love God until you get whatever you think you well the Pharisees thought they had it all and we found out they were just actors they did not have anything when it came to Jesus Christ they had the wealth they had the riches they they they had the prestige they were the leaders of the church who's the one that got it it was a little lady couldn't call her a lady then it was a little woman and she needed something that was going to change her oh can you say Amen brother Michael told me amen he said about the time when she as I was talking about the money all the money that she had been saving up for a new life all that money and she's laying it down there little did she know that she was getting her new life in buying that bottle of ointment little did she know in the surrender of everything she had she was finding the amazing purpose that God had predestinated her for oh come on church amen I think that's beautiful and here we stand today we've been given a message that has been denied by the world just like it was denied by Jesus Christ and we can stand here and say yes you came for me hallelujah amen you came for me amen now I I I I I look here and I amen as we look there at the at at the scripture and I and I'm looking for my scripture I must have I don't know what happened to my scripture hallelujah oh there it is there in 2 Timothy 2 and 20 it says but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and Earth some to to honor and some to dishonor and if a man therefore Purge himself from these well I thought it's all in predestination and I thought it was all in in this man we got this thing no no no well you you're predestinated that's right but if a man Purge him well well well I know brother buend preaches on Holiness but we don't get that just his opinion I I well I I I I I just don't know you know he says we can't wear makeup but you know we got you if a man or in this case a woman purges her s well I I I I no no no no no no we had those kind of guys out there disputing everything about William brandham and brother brandham and I and I and I love I I love I love the internet I the what one girl says but really I found this quote amen now now skip skip the and and 95 other quotes but I found this quote and uh I'm going with that and and I'm thinking you know what God gave that just for the Serpent's children yeah because they're not going to surrender to the will of God or they would take everything else the man said right but they're going to take whatever they can a Serpent's Seed cannot take the word of God but I guarantee you a son and daughter of God will take that [Music] word hallelujah come on what brother brandham said that amen there's a there's a trinity he call it the Holy Trinity well bless the Lord that's for those guys who let surrender to God's will come on well glory to God I don't want to be one of those guys that's given the exception God put me right in the middle of your word put me right in the middle can you say Amen don't you boys be one of those guys that's just right on the outside y'all stand right there in the middle of the word so that there can be an anointing upon your lives I want to submit to the Potter can you say amen amen if a man Purge himself from these things he shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified and meat for the Master's use and prepared unto every good work can you say amen I got off my I got off my thought when I was talking about the girl on the internet and um and and the and the topic was earrings amen and and earrings and how this was just the opinion and and so to to to to to watch all of these girls on the internet that claim to be in the message and and they're and they're I mean they're running with this well I can't find it in scripture and this is Brother bram's opinion and this that and the other and I and I thought I thought who who's their Pastor Hallelujah I'd like to know who the pastors are to these girls that are teaching these girls that ain't giving them no absolute I want to say this evening amen if if if if you can find it and it's correlated from the from 1948 to 1965 brother you'd better believe it right amen well I thought I'd have a a bigger amen from all of you folks here can you say Amen we want to believe that word we want to be pliable to the Master's children now or the Master's Hand the Serpent's children are hard they're callous their head strong they hard willed they'll Bulldog their way through life amen and and uh uh uh uh uh but but but I want to tell you I want to tell you you they're going to have to answer to the word are you either going to answer it now or you're going to have to answer it later and by I I can be dead and gone Hallelujah brother bram's already dead and gone he's gone he's he's gone he's gone and and he done what the Lord told him to do and a preacher can do what the Lord tells him to do and and and he might be dead gone I might be dead and gone and you forget my name even but if it's the word and if the prophet sent if God sent a prophet to say it and say it and say it and say it and we resist it and resist it and resist it and resist it you will stand before God someday but I didn't get on I I just read and chuckled amen praise the Lord now however there was another preacher that got on there and he seemed to agree with them shame on him now so God wants not going to hold you long now God is looking for peness in our lives brother brother brandham would say the high priest once a year entered in the first Veil then the second Veil and on the outside at the labors where they washed the sacrif then the sacrifice was killed put on the Brazen Altar and the blood was put in a charger and the high priest once a year walked in behind the veil to make an atonement notice the dressing of the high priest before he could enter into the veil and and and I want you to catch that notice the dressing of the high priest before he can enter into the veil he had to be stripped and dressed right to go in and that's what the church is today what it needs is a stripping off of all these little Cults and things and dress in righteousness of Jesus Christ and ready to enter in he must his walk must be different along the hymns of His Garment he had a pomegranate and then a baale and when he walked his walk was so perfect until the baal's played holy holy holy unto the Lord what we need today is not another not whether we're assemblies or Church of God or Oneness whatever it might be but our walk ought to be playing to the public holy holy holy unto the Lord another thing he must be anointed before he goes in the anointing oil was made with a rose of Sharon and the crushing of the Rose brought forth the perfume and they put it on uh uh put it on the oil that run on Aaron's beard and plumbed down to the hems of his skirt and covered all over with the anointing oil walking right living right moving right dressing right and there he went taking before him the blood as he went behind the veil into that third room and there was a veil that dropped behind him that the outside world could not see him no more every man or boy or woman or girl that is ever anointed of God Walks Behind that Temple the veil of God the Holy Ghost put him in that secret place and that Veil drops behind him and the world and all the things are cut off behind him oh make me pliable make me PL I want to be able to just walk not not not not stop at the first not stop at at justification not stop at sanctification not stop at at at at at the Holy Ghost but God let me go behind that Veil and live there with you can you say amen amen that's right in ashamed in 65 he says now it's not only a desert it is hot it's spiritually a desert oh my there's no spiritual life at all talking about Arizona in the churches he says why you never seen such in your life we don't even have a church to go to nor nothing the people almost perish spiritually I notice it in the people that come out there and see the differences in they're watching it so you stay under the spirit of God and your life becomes sweet and tender like water brings the grass and the soft buds this grass in Arizona wouldn't grow it wouldn't grow in Arizon these trees would be Cactus them leaves just wind up and stickery that's the way way it is when you get dry around the church and everybody is stickering one another you know you see you got to have the soft Waters of rain to soften you and make Leaves and shade for the pilgrim that passes by can you say amen amen now as I wind this up here tonight there's a specific purpose for your existence come on that's part of what adoption is that's where the word places you the word so puts you where you know who you are the word so put you that you know you're not you're not you're not trying to be you you know that God's got a specific purpose in a specific place and you are standing there at that place that you know that God has built you for you're standing in that position because God has placed you in that position a man don't put you in that position a man can't take you out of that position mama don't put you in Sons don't put you in daughters don't put you in the preser don't put you in Sunday school teachers don't put you in God places his sons and there's no man that can ever take an individual that has been placed who knows their position can ever take them from that place before God trial can't do it heartache can't do it why because you have yielded yourself to God you know that he's got your life you say can I know brother wend oh yes you can know because it's you're yielding to him and the power of that almighty God coming upon you in your life life and as you're surrendering to him he is placing you he is setting you where he wants you to abide there is a specific purpose for every one of you I don't care if you're one of these boys sitting on the Pew amen or or or if if if you know your brother Ken back there God's got purpose by the way I appreciate all those I appreciate all of those posts that brother Ken places I do I appreciate I I I appreciate those those quotes of the day and those scriptures I appreciate I appreciate the stuff he puts on the other Pages too amen I like it all amen you see but God's got God God places us how can I put this you are the answer you are the answer to God's word When God says that there's going uh uh that that he would live and and abide in a church and and the prophet begins to talk to us about the Masterpiece and he and he talks about how it was this and this and this and this and then at the intelligence in the last day the intelligence will move into that body and she will become a living a living uh uh bride here on this Earth you you are that answer you're here specifically to fulfill the call that God has been has has seen in his mind before the world began amen you are here for that and God is placing you into that place what can you say amen amen now here we are amen there is a need for Sons to go back to that Garden of Eden there is a need for Sons to rule and Reign there is a need for Sons to stand up in a in a love forsaken world and to stand up as the beacon of light there is there is a need for Sons there is a need for God's word to stand against the tide of this evil generation there's a need amen and because of that need God's brought you because of that need Jonah because of that need God allowed all of the mess ups back and forth and ups and downs of of Joe and Stephanie Hallelujah to bring the results of you here sitting on a Pew in the front row tonight you're not an afterthought you're not here because of them could it be that they're here because of [Music] you could it be that God allowed that that that boy Joe brother Joe to to run a muck and put all those gray hairs on his mama's head for all of those years so that he could meet a certain woman come on an atheist that was going to need salvation could it well come on now could it be that the other two boys that are sitting right here tonight that God has worked everything else around and placed you in amen brought brought you hallelujah amen brought your mom all the way over here to PA e and then and and and here and here you sit here tonight yeah that ain't an accident am it's no accident it's no accident that God that that that that that Caleb back there is on the sound uh uh you know the sound system and and God and and here he is a beautiful light here in our church you see God's got the purpose we are an answer to God's word so what we are doing we are are we are yielding ourselves we are we are giving we are exposing everything that we are we are throwing ourselves naked before God and we're saying take me mold me I'm not just a church member I'm not just here for what I you know to play music or to you know to to uh uh H uh belong in a youth group or uh to not I'm here and God has placed me in the youth group and God has placed me in these kind of positions because he's got a specific purpose for my life and as I yield myself to him and I give myself holy unto him then God can make something that goes way on Beyond this it goes something even greater and deeper what can you say man so from the Creator's point of view he's got a need for making you from the creation's point of view I've got a need for him from the Creator's point of view there's got to be a church ready to Rapture there's got to be somebody that's going to live this message there's got to be somebody that's going to be the the the epitome of redemption and love so he makes you from my point of view from your point of view we're built to crave more of him we're built to want to please him our desire is mold me make me show me what you want me to be I want to be what you put me on Earth to be come on I have not been Evangelistic at all lately right and I'm getting a little bit nervous because I'm preaching I'm one of the preachers at brother Sean's meeting and can you imagine me preaching this over there in a tent meeting amen coming into the realities or coming into the maturity coming to the possession that God's looking for from this bride amen yeah brother random talks about the de or the Deep calling to the deep and he says in order for there to be a response there has to be there has first of all got to be a cause yeah there's got to be a call and then there's a response yeah yeah Hallelujah Eliana how could you crave pizza if there were no pizza well praise the Lord amen I went to go get my wife today and she was cooking those hot dogs and oh I love hot dogs good old healthy hot dogs the reason I'm so good-looking amen and she was frying them just like I like them and I I me those things were all fried and I tell you what I just reached right in there picked one up and I ate one as I was walking out of the fellowship hall amen you see I love hot dogs and when I when I walked in I didn't even know what it was going to happen but I when I walked into that building and I smelt the aroma of a hot dog there has to be a hot dog first Hey listen I I these days I can take I'm with brother TN I can take a hot dog over a over a hamburger amen matters of fact the other night when we had the hamburgers and hot dogs I ate a hot dog amen but but you see the there is there's got to be there's got to be the hot dog right before there can be a craving there was a Creator who's got a specific design and purpose for you being here on this Earth you've got to yield yourself to that submit yourself to that and be and be willing to be tutored there's got to be now from the cre Creator's eye when he was creating he seen the grand scheme of things he seen the fall he seen what Satan would do he saw this layot Ayan age where he would be put out of the church but then he begins to design and prepares the grand scheme of things and he begins to create you and me did you know that brother brandham says if he would have had a choice of which AE which generation that he would want that he would be put in if God were to ask him before the foundation of the world you're going to be a preacher I'll let you go wherever you want brother Bram says I I would have loved to been there in the days of Jesus I would have loved to been that witness I would have loved to been one of those preachers but he says I think I would have chose this day for this day is the grandest of them all come on why he says this is a day of death this generation is dying but yet this is the greatest age to reflect Jesus Christ can you say Amen there's got to be the Crave the Serpent's children they're not going to Crave right they don't want it there's no seed they're not designed for it they're not built for it they're going to fight and resist their Pride's going to do whatever they're going to do it's nothing going to change them the preacher could preach the rest of his life and that serpent seed is not going to change one iota they'll stay religious just like Cain was religious they'll stay religious just like uh all the rest of them you say then what's the difference between us and the Serpent's children the Serpent's children has no desire the Serpent's children weren't built for desire for the things of God you were built with a spongy heart and if the devil can get that sponge and turn it into bitterness and turn it into malice and turn it into selfishness for crying out loud me me me me turn that in to all of this then there's no room for you to be what God's called you to be let me be what God has called me to be help me amen am one more time it was the need that brings about the product it's the need for sons of God that brought you here on this Earth in the first place are y'all hearing me it's the need for uh Sons and Daughters of God to Reign that's the reason you are here if the musicians would come I'm thankful for what I feel in my [Music] heart I'm thankful for purpose [Music] I'm thankful that God's not called me to be a Pew warmer but God's called me to make a difference I'm thankful that I am here by God's design I'm thankful for that the last 30 years well I should say the last 50 years of my existence God has been preparing BR me for such a time as this I'm thankful that I'm not an afterthought I'm thankful that I am who God has called me to be because he foreen me as the solution well I just want to jump and Shout on that he foreen me he foreseen an Adam he foreen a man and a woman that was not going to the woman amen wasn't going to heed to Satan and the and the man wasn't going to follow the woman he he he knew that there was going to be a masterpiece there was going to be a man Christ Jesus The Living Word in a body and that there was going to be a bride and that bride that bride with her husband the word would reain on this Earth above all demons and all powers come on church and that there wouldn't be any sickness there won't be any trials there won't I'm saying that's where we're going and that's why it's important that we pass the test right now that you're in right what you're going through what you're going through what you're going through what you're going through and you're going through amen God's called us to what's what is he doing for Christ out loud he is placing me he's ordaining me so I ain't crying over spiled [Music] milk I am the [Music]
