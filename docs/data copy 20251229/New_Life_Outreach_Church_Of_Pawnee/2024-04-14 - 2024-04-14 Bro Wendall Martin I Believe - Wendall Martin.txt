Amen and and I appreciate that in in Brother Martin and um I I'm I I can't wait to get him back up and Minister I told him here the other day even if it's for 15 or 20 minutes just amen and um I think that would be wonderful brother William is ministering at brother Parker's this morning and and um he had text me uh saying that his back was is really pulled his back and really hurting and and so when we go to the Lord in prayer let's remember brother William and ask the Lord to bless his service and and we always want to uh remember those that are um brother sister Applegate we got a baby that's going to be born amen just any time now and and um we've got uh brother Steve Laura Martin we their family to pray for we have a lot to pray for don't we so as we get ready for the word why don't we just go to the Lord in prayer and if you've got something on your heart why don't you just make that known to the Lord by the lifting of your hand and say Remember Me Lord father as we come to this portion of the service for your word and we're asking that Lord that you would be with us and that you would remove every hindrance and that you would allow us into your presence I pray Lord that your Holy Spirit would be with brother William this morning as he is ministering there in wital and I pray that you would take that back pain and whatever he's pulled Lord just heal him so that he can minister to the people I pray Lord that you would be with all of those Lord that are fighting in their bodies my father sister Applegate brother Applegate Lord those that are even in the congregation this morning that that are battling in their bodies I pray Lord that you help them and we're looking to you who was the author and the finisher of our faith looking to you for healing for them Lord be with Brother Steve and Sister Laura father as we continue to lift them before you father oh God let your great presence be with them now Lord as we open your word I I pray father that you would you would speak to us this morning I ask Lord that you would just help me to get out of the way and let your presence be here and that you would Minister what you have for us this morning as I give myself to you Lord I ask Lord that everyone in the congregation would do the same and that you would lift us up into your presence and we'll be quick to give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen amen amen and amen if you have your scriptures let's look here in Titus the first chapter and um it is so good to see everyone uh in the house of worship this morning and um uh tonight we're going to be having um our our communion service it's been a it's been a little while and so we're going to be having a communion here this evening and then um um we uh while we've I think brother William will be back by then and so most of us will all be here for communion and and um I'm I'm looking forward to that um Titus 1 and N holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught that he may be able by sound Doctrine both to exhort and to convince the naysayers The Gangs Sayers for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers especially they of the circumcision whose mouths Must Be Stopped who subvert whole houses teaching things things which they ought not for filthy lucer Sake One of themselves even a prophet of their own said the Christians are always liars and evil beasts and slow bellies this witness is true wherefore rebuke them sharply that they may be sound in the faith not giving heed to Jewish fables and Commandments of men that turn from the truth unto the pure all things are pure unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure but even their mind and conscience is defiled they profess that they know God but in Works they deny him being abominable and disobedient and unto every good work repeate now that's quite a reading isn't it I'd also like to look here in the book of Hebrew Hebrews the 13th or the 12th chapter and we're just going to read the first two verses wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking at to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God Amen God bless you you can be seated here this morning we are looking at two groups here if you were to go back and look at the Hebrews the 11th chapter you would see that these great cloud of witnesses were amen uh were all here in the uh were some of them were mentioned right here in the Hall of Fame right here in Hebrews the 11th chapter amen who had to fight who had to persevere who had to walk by faith amen because it it was a total walk by faith and most had to walk alone but as we read the first verse or the first reading there in the book of Titus man we we seen that the gospel was birthed in in in in the midst of apostasy you see the the this was the changing between law in Grace this was going to be the this was the time to where the law had come to its end and the grace was now fixing now beginning for Christ was the end of the law and he was the beginning of Grace and so but yet in the when Jesus came Jesus came in the midst of of major apostasy amen it was satanic forces were doing everything from spting lies to beating the uh Saints and imprisoning and even killing the followers of Jesus Christ and and and so we can we can see as we parallel where we are today as this is a this is the ending of the Gentile dispensation amen where the Grace has come and we know that the Rapture is upon us and we are amen things are now turning from the Gentiles and going back to the Jews amen so as we could see what God took what what happened at the at the changing of the old into Grace we can now see that it is the changing of the Gentiles and going back to the Jews and there must be a faith in order to see this now this is nothing new this type of Doubt has has been around amen Since U since the world began God's word has always been doubted by Satan and his children God's God's word cannot be accepted amen by by by Lucifer and he teaches others the prophet says he teaches others to doubt that word just as he doubts that word amen and so we can see how that amen uh uh the angels of uh uh uh Lucifer has transformed him into the angel of Light amen there the you you talk about the hardness of our age and and and you you look there in 1 Timothy uh 4 and 1 and it says now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy and having their conscience seared with a hot iron Amen in other words their their heart would become so hardened to the truth of the Gospel until they themselves would become the vessels amen of Darkness can you say amen and brother Bron would talk about the the hardness of this age and he says you've got to keep your your heart bathed with the tears amen of the Gospel you have got to bathe your heart in other words there's got to be repentance within our hearts there's got to be a cry Lord I want to be what you want me to be I want to be everything that you've ordained for me to be can you say man amen in the bomb of Gilead brother Bron would say the number one killer isn't heart's disease in the world today as we are told the number one killer is sin disease it's a disease of sin that is killing the world now amen for a for a title here this morning I'm just going to use two words I believe amen won't you turn to your neighbor and say I believe amen that's right now uh there in Proverbs 21 and2 it says every way of a man is right in his own eyes but the Lord pth the hearts now I want us to look there for just a moment at the condition of this age because amen the condition of the age is a hardening of the heart it is consciences that has been seared in other words there there is a numbness that begins to transform amen the being of a person to where amen they're not able to think and they're not able to to look at the word and and apply that word to their life because they have become hard-hearted amen and it's incapable of being moved to pity or to tenderness or the unfeeling or callous or unconcern brother Brandon would put it this way he said you might as well admit that that this anglosaxon people is finished that's all there's no more gospel the that America will receive amen you might get a few straggling now and then but just as the gospel it is over you can't even preach to them you can't talk to them they won't believe nothing see they got their own hardheaded ideas and they're set and the thing the next things for this judge this nation is Judgment she's going to have it too it may be through depression it may be through atomic bomb it may be through Great Plague a disease or something but she is ready it's coming thousands times thousands will fall we've passed by yesterday brother Z and brother Woods coming in uh from down in Kentucky where we had been 3 days and passed by a housing project and brother zel said I he says there's not hardly any of those people in that project that even goes to any church you would ask them about it and we'll we'll get our television and that's how we find Comfort that's the American attitude we've got television we've got plenty of money we got Fine Cars we got nice homes we what do we need the Lord we don't need that that's the attitude about the only religion and salvation we have and love is among the real godly people you know the Bible said that would happen uhhuh you Bible readers amen I heard you hollering amen and you preachers back there and that's right the love would be so far away in the last days that only the elect would be left would be uh uh the only love would be left would be between the elect of God's people the father would be against mother mother against father children against parents different ones against each other the only love would be left would just be the elect just the elected the word elect comes from elected God's elected people can you say Amen so now we are seeing here that there is the day that is approaching now we're living in it the day was prophesied that would come to where the Hearts would be very callous and the only ones that would God would be able to even halfway penetrate would be his elect that's the only ones that's going to be able amen and they say family you know father against mother and mother against father and this that and the other because everyone is looking after their own ways instead of the ways of God can I hear an amen but yet faith has a very solid foundation amen as we begin to as we look this morning God says when everything else is shaking and he did say I'm going to shake the heavens I'm going to shake the Earth and all that can be shaken will be shaken everyone that can be shaken that has not got their their their foundations in the word of God can be shaken and they will be shaken amen well praise the Lord amen but the Apostle Peter would say in 2 Peter 1:16 for we have not followed the cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were I Witnesses of his majesty amen so what he's trying to say now amen they may not understand they may not uh uh you know they may be fighting the word they may be wrapped up in a apostasy but I want to tell you the reality of Jesus Christ is here the realities that I have declared is real and you have not followed fun uh cunningly fables can you say amen amen and I want to say here this morning when Satan is there to come against this church there is a foundation and that Foundation is the revelation of the word of God in this day amen if there's a young man man or a young woman that needs a a a a foundation amen you've got to have the foundation of the word of God it's got to be the foundation of your thoughts it's got to be the foundation of your belief it's got to be the foundation of your opinions it's got to be the foundation of everything you are because the word is the only thing that will last can I hear a great big amen now so faith is a must amen You Must Believe God and you must never question now before Adam partook of the tree of knowledge it was Faith they simply believed what God Said Amen now Satan come in and said this will make you wise and to know as God knows amen and so Faith was traded for wisdom Faith was traded for understanding from then on everything had to be proved in order to believe and since then we have amen as mankind even God's children uh uh we we we have all been trained Amen to follow what we see smell taste touch and hear we we've been taught to Amen to uh uh what what we see here on the tree of knowledge is what God or is what we are tangible what we can uh uh what we cling to what we what we can prove what we can feel what we can know what amen because now everything is around us it's the tree of death it's the tree of it's the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil amen and the unregenerate will never know God because amen you cannot know God after the carnal mind you'll never know God after the natural flesh you you cannot even please God in this flesh right here can I hear an amen you cannot do that so you you have to be born again and when you are born again there is a faith that opens up amen your soul begins to see things on a totally different level it's a level that is not known to the church member it's a level that's not known to amen uh the the average preacher it's a member amen it's it's a it's a level that is not known to many many many message folks it is a level amen that sees things the way God sees things understands things the way God understands things and you can believe God and you become a Mystic to this world Amen now your faith you're not looking at this and this and this you don't have your calculator 1 + 1 equals 2 you're walking with God by Divine Faith you're walking with God you're fulfilling his word you're living your purpose because the Holy Spirit is living and abiding within you can you say amen amen the unregenerate will never know God because they will question scrutinize and doubt God's word every time why because his system is built from birth around amen the tree of knowledge everything is all wrapped around that tree of knowledge well praise the Lord Brother Merl mentioned this morning this old flesh amen is not is not the it's not the real thing this ain't the perfect will here amen and God but God is calling you through the Holy Spirit and through that soul to believe him and walk with him and fellowship with him so that his character can be revealed through your flesh revealed what you see in here what you see here is manifested in your talk manifested in your walk manifested in everything you do it's a different a different set of rules the evil spirits have been prophesied to be so persistent till the elect would be deceived if God hadn't put his own DNA in your soul am you would be deceived in this state of apostasy and selfishness and and can and and Canon F if you had not had the DNA of God within your heart well I I I just want to say here right now how is it that we can sit here this morning and believe God how is it in the land of Chaos in the land of apostasy in the land of of Amen of sin and death and amen it's it's a it's every man for himself how is it that we could come off the tree of knowledge and start partaking of the tree of life it's only because God has called our hearts it's only because God has placed his seed on the inside of you and given you the ability to hear his word given you the ability Hallelujah now I'm going to preach my message here this morning amen I I I'm going to preach praise the Lord but John 9 6 and44 says no man can come to me somebody say no man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him ah well Hallelujah you know what you would be you would be preparing right now for the Great Tribulation if you had not had the Holy Spirit drawing you hallelujah amen he says and I will raise him up at the last days it is written in the prophets they shall all somebody say hallelujah hallelujah amen now the scripture going back to the scripture that we would be deceived amen we could be deceived if it were possible but it is not possible for all of God's elect will hear from God amen hallelujah amen now watch this and they there in 45th verse and they shall be all taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the the father comes unto me now who is me Jesus the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God the word was made flesh Calvary came to pay the price amen Calvary came so that Jesus could pay the price to redeem everyone of God's predestinated seeds take them out of their family circles and bring them into the family of God to where there is nothing but Christ and you as a Believer well glory to God Amen now I want us to think about that what caused Abram to come out of her what caused Abram to leave that lucrative job that he had as an idol maker amen there there in Babylon amen he heard the voice of God and come on now he wasn't able to prove it by mama he wasn't able to prove it by Sarah he wasn't able to prove it by nobody else he had to prove it he had to prove it by the divine revelation when Sarah didn't believe it he believed it when no one else seen it he believed it when lot couldn't see it he believed it when there was nothing around him it was a divine revelation that was given to him and he believed the word of God when Abraham took Isaac Amen to be sacrificed the Bible says that he never questioned he never he never got his calculator out he simply got up the Bible says he got up early the next morning now God appeared to him in the dream God told him I want you to take that son that you've been waiting on and he's now 13 years old he's fixing to he's you're fixing to give him amen the right uh of of of of uh of sunship you're fixing to do all of these things but I want you to I want I want you to change your plan I want you to take him to a mountain far away that I tell you and I want you to kill that boy and the Bible says that Abraham just simply got up the next morning Sarah was asking him what he was going to do amen he says the lad and I are going to worship god well can you say amen he never questioned God he got to mount Mariah amen he got to the place that God told him to take he rose up and he went well glory to God and you know what took place God was testing him God was trying him God was trying his faith God was seeing where he stood he was going to see if he loved things over himself he knew he knew that God had called him and what did he say when he got to the bottom of the mountain he told his servants I want you to wait here y'all stay by the amen by the donkeys amen he says for the lad and I are going to to worship and the lad and I are going to come back if God is asking me to give of myself and the sacrifice my my son he is able to restore him back God gave me that promise he gave me that son and God cannot lie you can't compute this in your head on you've got to stand face to face with God hallelujah and then let God vindicate okay it was God who gave the son and it was God who was going to show Abraham would have broke every type if he had not followed god well can you say man but now he's now Abraham is in Abraham is now in he's he's in the Hall of Fame chapter he says but by faith there in Hebrews 11 and 17 by faith Abram when he was tried he offered up Isaac and he that had received the promise offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in Isaac thy seed Shall be Called accounting that God was able well I want to shout right now God was able to raise him up from the dead come on church amen from whence also he received him as a figure he had when there was no when when when when Sarah didn't agree amen when lot didn't agree when no one else agreed when there was no preacher to agree when there was no mama when there was no Daddy when there was no nothing he had already had to separate himself from everything that was contrary to Faith and now his faith was proved tried and found true somebody say I believe I believe Noah had to believe Noah had to believe even though there was no there was there was no evidence there was no evidence rain what's rain Noah couldn't go to his computer Noah couldn't go to his to to his friend no one couldn't Noah couldn't go to the professor or the pastor or nothing else on no one had to believe God he was the only you boys you're going to have to believe God you're going in order to be leaders you're going to have to be able to believe God you're going to have to walk with God in order to stand against the tide of the enemy of leosia we've got to walk with God if there's any one of you that's ever going to succeed if you teenage girls here if you're planning to succeed you're going to have to walk with God M and daddies you're going to have to walk with God though it can't be proved that there's rain though it can't be proved amen that there's ever even been a clown and though you've been claiming this for over a hundred years now you're going to have to walk with god did it happen of course it happened Faith paid out no one done what he was and I led if you were to go back I don't have it here but if you were to go back in Hebrews 11 and look at all the action words that are all part of a man he prepared an ark he believed he went through all of those things now Faith is going to be tried and so I as we talk as we ministered last week on character and what it takes and the tri trying of your faith here in Hebrews or or 1 Peter 1:7 he says that the trying the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found under praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ now the faith is what God gave you but then then now comes to the new birth that's what takes place when you are born again but then the faith has got to be tried sometimes we go through the trials sometimes we don't understand the trials and we everyone have to go through our trials hallelujah amen if we could we don't want to give a testimony to the devil amen but I'm sure we could all go we could all go back and and tell you stories of our trials and our things that we have gone through amen as Believers since we have become Christians Christianity is not amen is is not easy living Christ that Easy Living has nothing to do with Christianity our Easy Living is on the other side amen what we're here to do is to come and to proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ and to live that gospel with everything that was within us every ounce that is in our body every breaking moment everything that we have is Jesus Christ and he tries us and he puts us to the test and he and he and sometimes it seems like we're going to break and sometimes it seems like we can't go any further but God knows what what he's doing and he wants to see his reflection in you he wants to see his glory in you and the only way that that can take place is through the test and the trial Hallelujah in the midst of it all Ephesians 6:16 above all somebody say Above All Above All taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench at least half come on wherewith you shall be able to quench most come on above all I don't care whether you have got the sword of the spirit I don't care whether you have got amen you have got to have that Faith to build your foundation but you have also got to keep that Faith as your shield and because the scripture says that you are going to be able to withstand all the fiery darts of the wicked one that are fighting your soul you're not going through your mind you've got another filter you're not filtering through amen this or that you have got another filter it's the word of God it's the faith in that word what are you doing you are standing when the enemy is amen is striking you are standing when the powers of hell are oh come on church amen what it looks like amen all hell is against you when it looks like amen Satan is Ping you young minds amen this way and that way you keep that Shield of Faith it's God that called you it's God that's going to finish you it's God that said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you never let your faith waver Hallelujah you are his purpose can you say amen amen it's faith in that word when I said when I chose I believe this morning I say that because everything of the scripture everything that we see here was for men that was willing to die for this word now think about that acts 7:51 it says ye stiff neck and uncircumcised in heart and ears you do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do you which of the prophets have your fathers not persecuted and they have slain them and showed which showed before the coming of the just one of whom ye have now the betrayers and murderers Isaiah was killed by the authorities Elijah was sought to be killed by the queen right Daniel was condemned to the Lion's Den amen under the decree of law Jeremiah Was condemned and imprisoned by law he was attacked by his own Brothers beaten and put in stock amen a as uh uh by a priest and and a false prophet he was thrown into a sister by the officials of Judah and later on stoned to death Ezekiel was stoned to death Micah was killed by King Gerome Amos was tortured by amziah the priest and killed by the priest's son what what am I saying is everything that we hold dear has been fought by the enemy everything that that we hold as a treasure of our heart Satan has tried to kill can you say amen amen there's been a cloud of mysticism over the church amen there is a mystical component to the church it's unexplainable it's a mystery it's it's beyond human understanding the church is the Apostle Paul says the church is a great mystery Satan wants to destroy not just simply you but he's trying to get to the word that you possess because we know that in this final day now the prophets they were carriers of the word now that word was not for them that word was for a future generation that word was for you and me so the prophet Satan was trying to kill those prophets to shut up the word to keep that word from reaching you because the word would be believed in seed form and would take flesh in you in this last generation they tried to kill the prophets they they they tried to kill the word when they killed the prophets so that they could destroy Jesus Christ they couldn't destroy him they they they killed Isaiah but the word lived cuz the word of God is eternal amen you can kill the messenger but you can't kill the word you can you can destroy the body but you cannot destroy the faith can you say Amen so these men were carriers of that light they were Gods the prophet of Amen Malachi 4 said amen he says they were gods to the people until the word left them once they expressed it then they just become the ordinary Isaiah or ordinary uh uh you know Moses amen but they had Moses had to keep that Veil over his face until he come and declared the word and then the glory of the Lord would leave him oh glory to God but there was going to come a time where the glory was no longer just going to come upon Moses face to leave again Isaiah to leave again amen Malachi to leave again there would come one where the pillar of fire would rest upon his name would be Jesus Christ and I love it because what God told John was the one that you see the the light come upon and remain he is the just one the one that you see see there's a reason why the word had to come there's a reason why Satan has tried to kill amen and Satan is going to come and kill the Prince of Life but they don't realize that when they killed Jesus Christ in him are all the genetics of God in him is wend Martin is Josh Martin Amen in in him is Kaye in him amen is every one of us here is in Christ how many's ever stomped on a spider that was pregnant and when they killed Jesus that was the wrong thing to do he was pregnant in him was God's Eternal genes in him come on chch church and now it's no longer a prophet that is willing to go to the Grave it's no longer amen just a just just a one one of these great men that the Holy Ghost would fall on occasionally now it is God's Eternal genetics living in bodies in human beings we're living like God we're believing like God we're acting like God we're thinking like God Amen we're praying like God we are casting Devils out like God we're doing all of those things why because the genetics of God are with in me I cannot lie I cannot receive a lie I re I believe the word that's who I am in the beginning was the word I was in him Hallelujah hell glory to God Amen now but see there was no proof brother Joe have you ever thought how it would have been nice that if Jesus would have went to caifas the high priest and say hey dude it didn't work here I am you killed me Jonas had already declared this Amos had already declared it the third day here I am hello nice try now and then go to appear to his you see Jesus did not appear to any of those guys Jesus could have went and just made things so much easier on the rest of us we we wouldn't we wouldn't have to worry about a thing all we'd have to do is just say hey proofs in the pudding the documents are there they seen him right but he didn't appear come on he appeared to his disciples the ones that believed him he's not going to appear oh Church of God on in a day of hardness in a day of rock Hearts don't let your heart become so callous that you can't experience God in the light that he wants you to experience him in can you say Amen you see you see it is it is it is it is these pleasure seeking people that are pushing Christ out but I want to tell you everyone the pillar of fire fell on were willing to give their lives in death what they done why did christ fall on them is because they were elected by God they were birthed for a season he told he told what uh Jeremiah he says I have I have separated you I I've called you he was only 5 years old amen and he says I've called you and ordained you separated you from your mother's womb to be a prophet to the Nations to pull down and to build up I've called you for that God built that man to believe no one else could believe it but he believed it he was designed I hope y'all's catching my message this morning he was designed to believe those Hebrews Jesus walking around amen and they were all saying you're the you're the prince of the devil you are the devil you're this and you're that and you're born from a illegitimate birth you're this and you're that amen and they're all criticizing and when Jesus just walks by when Jesus just walks by and says follow me and Peter dropped his Nets Peter dropped his Nets left him right there right there on the seashore and followed Christ why because there was something within him that was built to believe there was something oh Church of the Living God when the devil's trying to tell you you can't you won't and you never will be why don't you tell him then why can't I believe what is in my heart say I want to please God I want to be with God I want him to reflect his life in me tell me how that happens devil come on Church come on Amen the enemy the enem is there amen he didn't appear to his critics he appeared to those that were predestinated by God to eternal life man Matthew 28:11 this is the kind of guys that the 12 apostles in the first church had to put up with this is what they were doing it says now in the 11th verse now when when they were going behold some of the watch came into the City and showed unto the chief priest all the things that were done and when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept and if this come to the governor's ears we will persuade him and secure you so they took the money did as they were taught and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day now Matthew wrote this years later well praise the Lord but if you have been taught you say you say now now brother Wendell I I I I I I I I I don't know what did I just read to you a while ago John 6 and44 no man can come to me except the Father which you sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day it is written they shall be all taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father comes to me can you say Amen acts 13:48 and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life questioned and asked we need a little more proof questioned and ask are you sure about this can I can do you have any Witnesses amen besides those among you this is sort of weird you guys are all collaborating together but we want to hear somebody besides your little group as many as were ordained to eternal life be lived come on church and if you've been ordained well praise the Lord and the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region but the Jews stirred up The Devout and honorable women and the chief men of the city and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them out of their Coast but they shook off the dust of their feet against them and came into Iconium and the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost the more the trial the more we're going to praise the more Satan comes against us the more we're going to persevere the more Satan says you can't God says you will because my eternal Jean seat is on the inside of me oh come on Church greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world stand the test and stand with the word right H can you say Amen now the vast majority did not believe so it's not just in hearing because remember there in in in in Isaiah 53 And1 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed man there Romans 10 and 14 Paul would pick it up and he would say then how shall They Call On Him whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things but have they not all uh but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah sayth Lord who ha believed our report so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of the Lord but I say have not they not heard yes verily their sound went into all the earth and the words unto the end of the world but the elect will be taught here therefore you can receive it here if it's not taught here amen you'll have to take your calculator around everywhere you go calculators are not important in God's world God's Got a Way God's moving in your life you don't need calculators what we've got to do is open up our hearts to him and say Lord many have heard but it's a Bible plus a human being a human being and their Bible but the Apostle Paul is not wanting that he is saying you're not to just hear it but it's to become part of you you think like the word you act like the word you you persist like the word the enemy comes against you because you are the word the enemy hates you because you are the threat to Satan's kingdom Satan comes against you because you are the Holy Ghost to your children you are the conductor you it's no longer it's no longer God the Bible and a prophet it is God the Bible in me affecting my family affecting those around me affecting why it is God living in me yes sir can you say Amen now I think this is incredible all that the Father John 637 all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will no wise cast out John 6:39 all and this is the Father's will that all will which hath sent me that all which he hath given me I shall lose nothing but should raise it up at the last day today can you say Amen now I I want to just drop this in here I know I'm a little slow this morning but I I I want to put this in here why you believe if you're and and again I know some of this is a little on the elementary side I'm just following the long along the lines from last week on that predestination amen remember uh um um matter of fact you can put that up there sister uh I think it's uh Romans 9 and 10 or uh it may be the 11th verse the children not doing good or bad uh uh for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth let's just read a couple verses on down sis and it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated now I want you to catch all that now because it because that that's that's that scripture is doing something that's the reason you're able to be who you are what shall we say then is uh did I miss something or we still on it is there any unrighteousness with God God forbid for he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that willth nor of him that runneth but of God that shows Mercy amen for the scripture sath unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised thee up that I may show my power in thee that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth how many would like to be Pharaoh Hallelujah Pharaoh okay I've ra raised you up too Hallelujah to show what a bonehead is to show you how you can resist the word of God Amen but I and my word will win every time amen let's let's go ahead and finish it up there therefore he hath Mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth amen so so and that will say then let's just keep me going long we're in that same line let tell you what let me just get the scripture here that way I I know where I'm at amen Romans 9 praise the Lord you love him amen now so Romans 9 and 19 this is this is so good so there 18th verse therefore he ha Mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth thou wil say then unto me why do he yet find fault for who hath resisted his will but nay oh man who art thou that replies against God shall the thing form say to him that formed it why hast Thou made me thus hath not the a Potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor what if God willing to show his wrath to make his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction that he here we go that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he had before prepared unto Glory even us someone Shout Hallelujah even us who is who Heath called not of the Jews only but also of the Gentiles so the trials Pharaoh was raised see sometimes we're looking at our trials in our situations and we're thinking God I don't understand why you know maybe it's on the job or maybe maybe you're just in a big a big trial they've got to come our way they've got to come our way this is the way God expresses himself is through you've got to have a test in order to have a testimony well glory to God see now the children of Israel were scared of pharaoh and God says I have raised Pharaoh up so that I could declare who the children of Israel were yes sir I've raised Pharaoh up I've hardened his heart is that what the scripture says he hardened his heart did the prophet say that we're living in a day of callous Hearts yes sir but in the midst of it all there is light Hallelujah now the enemy can Vex your souls the enemy can do whatever that the enemy amen your mind is is is not is not totally redeemed yet your body is not totally redeemed yet but your soul is and so so with our souls we overcome the evil one now not going to hold you too much longer looking at the Middle East and and and that war that is going on the church world is all in arms about Israel right now you're seeing that in in you're seeing that everywhere you're uh you know all man the it's it's all over the place uh they're all talking about Israel amen and and uh oh sign of the time is getting close we're getting close now this is the same church that kicked the word and his bride out of their churches now this is the same this is the same ones that have kicked the word out kicked the bride out and now here they are oh the coming of the Lord is so soon and I got to tell you that the Middle East is not the sign of the coming of the Lord Putin is not the sign of the coming of the lord it's not the sign to get ready Iran is not the sign to get ready and Israel itself though Israel we watch Israel because we know that the that this that that when when when God leaves the Gentiles that there is going to is going to Israel we know that but they are not the signed to the to the elect you've been given a favor to know because you have the sense to believe you've got the ability to know the scripture says so he gives his word not to leaders not to dictators but to prophets crus chefs not a assigned to the world no sir Hitler wasn't assigned to the world but somewhere someplace God's got a humble Prophet waiting for the hour he is the sign then he says he's the sign that will condemn the world and will save the church that's the prophet see they're looking over here and they're wait and here we've been given the sign the word sign we've been given the word we can take everything back and line it up with the word if you can't if you can't line your attitudes up with the word then there's plenty of blood if you can't line what you walk looking at on the phone with the word then there's plenty of blood if there's if there's amen if you can't line what you have with the word the Vindicated word of the hour then we have got to come back am I making any sense here this morning you've got to come back to that word and you've got to know amen this is what the Apostle Paul amen told his his uh his elected Church uh or here here's here's another one God hiding himself in Simplicity he says brother Bram says the Rapture will come in such a simple way till the judgments will fall they'll see the son of man and say wasn't we supposed to have such and such wasn't there supposed to any lias sent to us wasn't there supposed to be a Rapture and Jesus said amen it's already happened uh Jesus will say it's already happened and you didn't know it God in Simplicity can you say Amen could you imagine the the Apostle Paul there in 1 Thessalonians 5:1 and says but the times and the seasons Brethren you have you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord comes as a thief in the night for when they say peace and safety then sudden destruction shall uh cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and and they shall not Escape ye Brethren are not in darkness someone shout hallelujah that that day should overtake you as a thief ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of the darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love for in helmet the hope of Salvation Amen in a day where many are walking away from this blessed truth that we know and they're going after sensationalism and they're going after this that and the other I as I was in prayer this week and looking at at as we are uh preparing you know to minister today I thought Lord no matter which way the world goes it is so good to have a nucleus it's so good to be to be energized to the great magnet the great magnet is Christ and we're all the little pieces that have been magnetized to him so wherever he is we are now brother bradam says the time is slowly coming where the door is closing the doors almost most closed he says the reason and you can see this he said the reason that there's nothing that moves the people the Holy Spirit just does not convict anymore is because the door is closing those things aren't there anymore he said now they still they're still going to come to an altar they're still going to have big crowds they're still going he says he says the truth of the matter is when the Rapture takes place they'll still be flocking to altars because the magnet is not the word here in this hour when the door is closing and you say well Revival's over well it's the reason where he is you are that's what the Rapture is they're waiting for God to come down and do some kind of voodoo and we've already been lifted up our soul has taken on the word we're thinking like the word we're behaving like the word we're we're we're living like the word what are we doing we're asking God for his grace Upon Our Lives what are we doing he's pulling us and pulling us now you see me here but I'm not living in this world I'm I'm I I've got more of a desire than I've ever had to be like Jesus you're living in this world and and you might be getting more round and it might look like this it's it's getting more impossible for you to lose gravity amen but I I I I I'm just here to tell you the gravity that's got to be left behind is in that soul because the soul the body's the body's got to be changed the spirit's got to be changed it's the soul that God is looking at Lord I'm going to watch that heart with everything that I've got I want that heart to be so in tune and so in love you girls hear me so in love with Jesus in his word you boys hear me so in love that's we sing and the musicians can come falling in love with Jesus Falling In Love With Jesus Falling In Love With Jesus was the best thing I've ever you can go ahead in your arms [Music] I feel protected in your arms I'm never disconnected in your arms I feel Pro Hallelujah [Music] fallen in [Music] love never been [Music] disappointed in [Music] love Falling in Love With You Jesus was the best thing oh your [Music] arm I never want to be disconnected [Music] Lord in every situation [Music] I want to be like you Lord there's be oh Falling in Love With You Lord falling in love I want a hard and soft and fireable falling in love falling in love Falling in Love With You Lord with Jesus oh Falling Falling In Love With Jesus was the best thing I've ever ever done do you feel that way today is your heart you want him to be the Potter are you willing say [Music] Lord I want to start spending some extra time with you in prayer and it shouldn't be because oh look at Israel oh my we got to hurry it should be because the prophet has brought us a message and told us the Vindicated signs we've had wars and rumors of wars and it's looking bad but you see the bride has already made herself ready and if we use with we use those signs of wars and things we may be left behind someday so what we want to do is we want to say Lord here I am make me pliable today and I don't care whether you're 100 years old here today you can get a Stony heart I don't care if you're just a teenager only heart you just remember in all of the facts of life in all of everything that is going on today you young men hear [Music] me thing we could ever do is fall in love with [Music] Jesus I know we might like our girls you girls might think boys are attractive but the greatest thing you could ever do you say you keep holding your hand like that and I I keep wanting to get to it but I I keep thinking other things too brother random says that heart has been made to hold the golden oil of divine love he as if it's ever been broken it it'll heal but there will always be a scar and that's why I say it's the reason I am always preaching at you young if you can learn from me and if I can teach you that the greatest thing that you could ever do is to love him the greatest thing you could ever do is to entertain him when he's near when his presence is in our church service not not to just sat on a Pew like a knot on a [Music] log but the woman that knew she needed Jesus she pressed through everything she didn't care what anyone else thought she had to get to him and touch him blind bmus when he knew he was near he had heard the crowds but when the little girl him says oh that's Jesus he said is that the one that my mother told me about mother told me that he would be coming and he started screaming Jesus Jesus when Jesus [Music] becomes when Jesus becomes our every desire when Jesus becomes our every fiber of our being we're not worried about you you you kids ain't worried about what the adults are doing in the back or what this one's doing or that doing you're you're going to scream out you know he's here and you know you need him and Jesus Jesus Jesus does this good for us Elders to do that too occasionally why we got to keep that oil brother Josh preached the other night on that that that that bottle that made of skin it can't hold the fermenting power of of new wine it'll bust it can't hold it because the old skin is not oil it's it's it's brittle it'll crack it can't it can't expand with the love of God it can't expand with the presence of God it's just rigid it's but I'm here to tell you you're predestinated to [Music] this I don't know I was watching we I went out to go play with the boys the other night over there at there going to go play basketball and so I I went out over there and they found something else for me to do take take one of the kids home and said you you go do that and well it didn't happen quite like that but and but when I got back there was a native over there and he was he was as Saed as could be and he was falling around in that Court as those guys were all playing and these guys they were just they were going at it he was going he how how was he doing that he was going around hollering at him y'all got this y'all got this so finally they gave him the ball and I thought he was a basketball player I [Music] mean it went toward the vicinity of the barn but not close to the goal and I looked at that [Music] man just watching him in his eagerness just want to play and be a part of the guys and it just like I went back I went flashback I went all the way back to when I first came to [Music] Pony I'd take every drunk that I could [Music] find and I would tell him you can belong you can [Music] belong I baptized [Music] so many of them in the name of the Lord as I'm sitting there watching that man said oh [Music] God I need I need something to get my heart back soft and pliable again where I can bleed for the hurting I can live for the Fallen I can give I got a phone call and and so I walked out on on the other about just right over here around the shed there and uh well everyone was through playing and so we got in and it was me Josh and brother Michael in the car and I seen the guy walking walking through here going back over here at a yellow horse and I thought you know I have been rejected I have been made fun [Music] of the years that I put in back in those days but I thought those were some of the best times of Miracles and some of the best times of the supernatural leading those ones to the Lord [Music] Jesus sort of weird sort of weird but I as I was going back I thought God surely there's more now we combed the town when I came into the message I combed the town you you kids probably remember when we'd go door to door knocking and we but that generation is is getting older there's a new generation that has come up they've got to hear the gospel there's kids that don't even know [Music] and my thoughts were does anyone want what I've got really is there anyone that really wants what I [Music] got and then it just comes just as clear as can be the elect does the elect [Music] does we we've got something for the elect don't let it just be me having that cry say Lord let me not be ashamed let it be said oh there goes the man there goes the Son of God down back [Music] Drive he's got Jesus in him he's there's let the screams come out [Music] Jesus Jesus let him hear let him feel [Music] something let them look at you and
