trust that's what you're doing holding the gods unchanging hand friends might leave your family might leave you but his unchanging hand will always be there amen if you have your Bibles Mr in Isaiah 21 and 11. he happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen I've been watching the services that our pastor has been preaching there in Canada and looks like they've been going very well I've been feeling the presence at the house so I know that it's been Supernatural hey he's been fought to get there his tickets was canceled or his flight was canceled he lost his luggage he got to Denver and didn't have his ticket to get to Canada and so he's they've been an uphill battle but they've made it and the Lord's been blessing the services so amen Isaiah 21 and 11 the burden of Duma he called to me out of seer Watchman what of the night Watchmen what of the night the Watchman said the the morning cometh and also the night if you were in a choir inquire ye return and come amen May bow our heads this morning dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord you've been so good to us God you've brought us in to your house safely Lord you kept us safe throughout the week Lord last week Lord has been coming to your presence Lord I ask that you would be in this part of the service Lord I ask that you would anoint me God As I Lay myself aside and I asked that you would speak to these lips of clay Lord you know the needs that are in the in the building this morning the the hearts father I ask that as the word would come forth Lord that there would be somebody to receive a blessing father we ask these things in your precious name amen you may be seated if I had just a simple subject this morning it would be Watchmen what of the night anyway it's a simple subject but I pray something can be said to be a blessing but a Watchman was put in a position where he could see higher than everyone else he was put in the tower where he had a vision that nobody else would have and he was to let the people know if the enemy was attacking let them know uh the time of day and they would really rely on him at the night time they would rely on him for the time of the night if the enemy was coming if danger was coming but it needed to be somebody who knew the position of the Stars so not anybody could be a Watchman but it was somebody that had good eyesight that was able to see you know I started to think of it could you imagine that if your family's life was in somebody that was nearsighted or farsighted or or was cross-eyed or or didn't care about your family's life didn't care about the city you want to want somebody like that for your life to depend on but the Watchman had to be somebody that could see far out there that could read the stars that had your life in in his mind not caring about himself but he was willing to risk it all to let you know that danger was coming to let you know what the time of the day was and brother Branham says the enemy likes to move at night time so at the night time it was very important to rely on the Watchmen to be your eyes you see brother Brandon would say this then when they were all there dancing and going on like a modern Pearl Harbor when they were dancing stripping young ladies of their clothes running them through the streets and so forth and all of a sudden there was an attack the enemy watches for night time to come he likes to come in the night the great air rage in our army today is at night time so we see the devil dwells in darkness if he can keep you in darkness he can pull you into death you see darkness and death always dwells together you look at Luke 1 and 79 to give light to them that sit in darkness in the shadow of death so what he is saying here there's a light that is coming that is going to pull you out of the stair of the snare of darkness which is death but it's only a light that can pull you out of the darkness and brother Branham would say this without light nothing can live without light and so with Darkness there's always death but with light there is always life it continues on to save there was no life upon the Earth today that but what has come by the Light of the Sun in botany life and so forth and there was no eternal life outside of the Son of God see he is the light so without light there's no life but with light there was no death and you see I believe that there was a time when Jesus was in the Tomb then it was a total darkness that there was a black cow but there come a time that there was a word that was prophesied for his life that that word was going to start to produce itself you look at Psalms 16 and 10 for thou will not leave my soul and hell neither without leave thou suffer or without suffer that Holy One to seek corruption so in the midst of death in the midst of Darkness there was a light that was starting to burn there was a light that was starting to produce itself so no matter how strong Darkness was how strong death was how strong the tomb was the hell was when that life started to come to pass nothing could hold it and so the Bible is saying once the light comes darkness is going to leave death is going to leave but it only takes the light to bring this to pass you look out Psalms 119 and 130 the entrance of thy words giveth life it giveth understanding so the light of thou Watchman was in sight he was to watch during the night so he wasn't bringing a natural light to the people but his Insight was alike to the people that they could see it was an understanding that they were in safe hands it was an understanding that it was 3 A.M 5 a.m they couldn't see with their natural eyes but the Watchman sight had become their eyes it had become very light and that's what the Bible is saying thy words giveth light it giveth understanding so they were sitting in a dark place at midnight of 3 A.M the darkest time of the night but they were still dwelling in light and I thought mine were in the darkest age of there is it's been promising or there's been promised that it's going to be brought up gross Darkness upon the people it's gonna be a dark time but at the same time in the evening time it shall be light and what is the light it is the words that has been brought in this generation that in the midst of Darkness there's an understanding that we can see that there's a future home we can see there's a rapture we can see there's a body change we can believe there's an invincible Army upon the Earth because of a spiritual Insight that is been given by The Watchmen you see but you notice the Bible says that if the Watchman didn't give the warning the blood of the people would be on his hands and so I thought my brother Branham did not want to be known as a woman hater he didn't want to be known as an old crank he didn't want to be known as somebody that was cranking but he had a responsibility and that was to bring light to a generation that was in darkness and I thought my and here we are in the middle of Darkness but God has given us a light where we can see you look at Ezekiel 33-6 but if the Watchman see the sword come and blow not the trumpet and the people be not warned if the sword come and take any person from among them he is taking away in his iniquity but his blood I require after watchman's hand but once the Watchman puts out his responsibility it warns the people then that responsibility goes from the Watchman to the here so no longer is it on the watchman's hands but now the light goes from The Watchmen to the people so no longer does the people have an excuse for Darkness because now there's a light that is coming they are taking the words of the Watchmen and now can dwell in a light but the Bible also says that if they hear the Watchmen and they do not listen to us warning the blood is now on their hands so now it's no longer The Watch responsibility but now it is on the people but anybody can be your Watchmen the Bible says in first John 4-1 believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God but many false prophets are gone out into the world so you notice that the Watchman was not just giving any time of the day by his own knowledge but he was watching the Stars so his time was giving by what God spoke into existence anybody could have said it's three o'clock anybody could say It's Five O'Clock anybody could say but not all of them was Vindicated it had to be somebody that had a Vindication by the heavens and on my begotten message that wasn't by a man's intellect but it was Vindicated by the heavens it was Vindicated by the by the the pyramids of the Bible says it was Vindicated by the spoken word of God it was Vindicated so that you can know that time of the day we're not living in the beginning of the church ages but we're living at the end where it's rapturing time it's time to go home we're not dwelling in darkness any longer we're living in the midst of Darkness but darkness is not overtaking us but light is overtaking us but you see brother Branham says spiritual Insight of the word has been swapped with a bunch of creates so even though God has given an Insight you have to receive it and make it your light anybody can be your Watchman anything can be your light but you've got a choice to choose the Vindicated Watchmen or choose a Creed you have a choice to choose a scripture Watchman a star Watchmen or to choose somebody that is making up time brother Branham says that uh it would be like a man saying there's no such thing as a son he says there's no sun I'm going to run into the basement I'm going to lock the doors and dwell in Darkness because there is no sun he says that man would have something mentally wrong with him because there is a son but he's refusing to acknowledge it and he says right there he's refusing the health-given substance that the son brings and so now he's dwelling in darkness because he refuses to acknowledge a god-given light but I don't believe the bride is refusing the god-given light but she's accepting the message of the hour the light that is given in the evening time and is dwelling in our living in darkness but dwelling in the light oh my there's something mentally wrong with him brother Branham says and so you see refusing the insights of the light your dwelling and groping in darkness even though the same things are there but you can't see them I know we've given the example before but if you come to this building and there's no lights on and it's Pitch Black in here you're going to stop over things that is already there the darkness in a put Affair but darkness is keeping you from seeing what is already there and so if you're tripping over the pews you don't know what is there so now you're guessing what you're tripping over you can say I'm tripping over the pulpit I'm tripping over the speaker I'm tripping over the piano I'm tripping over this I'm tripping over that because you don't have an insight to tell you what is there but once the light comes on you can see what is in front of you but now you've got a choice to either accept what the inside brings or I'll continue in the darkness that your mind has because if you trip over the Pew and you say I think it's a piano but when the light comes on you can say well it looks like a Pew but I think it's a piano so now you're coming down to a choice to believe what the light says or believe what the reasoning says oh come on now that sounds like a lot of people that comes to a message Church the light of the word is shining Upon A Heart shining upon the word but too many times we refuse the inside of the word that the Watchman has brought and accept the reasoning but you see there's there there can be no guessing in the things of God God has given us a Vindication that we're no longer guessing what is in front of us you see the pews immense to be tripped over they're meant to be set on so once the light comes on we're no longer tripping over it but we're putting it into action you see once the light comes over the word of God we're no longer tripping over serpents say tripping over water baptism tripping over the the godhead we're no longer tripping over these things but now we're putting them into action you see they're not meant to be tripped over but without a light you can't see what is in front of you but with the light we can take the promises of God and defeat every spirit it defeat every devil defeat every addiction there's nothing that can stand in front of the Bride that is living in the light of the hour oh my brother Branham says how did we get the natural Sun it was the spoken word of God he said let there be light he says there may have taken billions and billions of years but once thou word started to come to pass nothing could stop it and he says the light started to press through the darkness and as the light started to press Darkness started the fleet Darkness started to leave because Darkness has no power in the presence of the Sun and we've got the light in this last day darkness was over homes Darkness was over churches Darkness was over light but once the message come by your way Darkness had to leave those addictions had to leave there's a power that's been given to the bride of Christ through the light it's not a man-made light it's a light that is pressing the darkness it's pressing down on belief it's pressing our reasoning it's a life that you might see that you could see but first it's got to be your eyes you gotta believe the light like they were saying the the watchman's light was not a physical flashlight but it was an insight it wasn't a natural light but it was an Insight that he might not that he might know what is going on in the midst of darkness and oh my the word in a natural flashlight but it's an Insight that you might know what is going on in the midst of Darkness but you see you could not put your confidence in a man if he was cross-sighted you would be living in a constant fear you're believing in anxiety you'll be living not knowing what the future holds you want to know what tomorrow is going to take place you want to know because you would not have confidence in the Watchmen but once there's an Insight you can put confidence in there's no longer anxiety but there's a trust but you see it all comes down to an inside inside is so important to have faith in it becomes your lies it becomes your guide you know I started to think about it in Hebrews 11 and 1. now Faith is the substance of things hoped for him the evidence of Things Not Seen for buy it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so the things which are seen were not made excuse me which so when I'm made of things which do appear but then it goes through by faith Abel by faith Enoch by faith Noah by faith Abraham by faith Sarah and he starts to go through all of these uh the the the the the faith Champions but where is he getting all of these examples he's getting them in Genesis who knows who wrote Genesis Moses Moses wrote Genesis but was Moses there when Sarah was on Earth was Moses there when God said let there be light was a Moses hair when Abraham got his body changed was Moses there when Noah built an ark he was not there but it was a Watchman that was put in a position where he could see him bring back an Insight oh come on now many people have a hard time with the message because it's a fallen man it was a fallen mouthpiece but he had an Insight that went beyond a fallen man he had an Insight that went be hard a fallen understanding just like Moses could save Mama Sarah had a body change and had a baby how do you know brother Moses I have a spiritual insight and if you would just listen to my insight just like Sarah had a body change you can have a body change just like Enoch was raptured you can be raptured but you've got to listen to the insights that I'm giving you so now the Apostle Paul is bringing it down and saying through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God through faith in his understanding through faith in his Insight it brings a revelation of what God is doing oh my but you see brother Branham was lifted up where he could see before the creation he could see before but the Branham says that God is an object of worship and before I before God was God there was nobody to worship him so he created the angels and the angels worshiped up him day and night but he longed to be a father and he could not be a father to the angels he could not be a Healer to the angels he could not be a delivery to the angels so he created the son so that he could be a father to him that he could heal his wounds that he could set him free how do we know that brother Josh it was an Insight from a prophet from a Watchman that got lifted up so high so that we can now see we haven't seen it with our natural eyes but faith in that insight has brought a revelation oh my remember when he will be on the curtain of time he told us of things that was taking place he come back and he says I seen you there we wasn't there we can't see it right now with our natural lives but faith in that Insight is producing a revelation that there's nothing that can keep me from the future home if you can never get a revelation of this message there's no devil that can keep you down there's not there's no pornography and reasoning and addictions that can keep you down once you get a revelation of the insights that God has given you see it's a Watchman that God has given by the brand of Likens these Watchmen will watch men's the prophets he says they're built farther they're built to be able to see farther than anybody else he says but the higher that the eagle climbs higher and our father will take his team and God Likens His prophets to Eagles and they are the Watchmen the clam higher so they can see farther off and their eyes are made so spiritual that they can see the approaching dangers and God sent Isaiah to warn the people that there was an approaching danger and they would not listen to him and today God still has Eagles our Messengers our man is on the tower who climbs up in the spirit far beyond the man uh the atomic bombs and the scientific researches he has the men who are specially designed for the purpose who climbs the ramparts of Calvary in the name of Jesus and stands at the top of the Cross and sends back a message the saith the Lord he says they send back a message for saith the Lord he still has the messengers that are led by the spirit and are left help of our pastor has been going through the church ages and he's saying The Messengers were all anointed by The Same Spirit that just doesn't hit home for me Wednesday and I just love that it's all the same spirit with an anointing that is coming to these Messengers bringing the light of the day but in this day we didn't get a portion of the light we got the fullness of the light we're no longer just looking at justification we're not just looking at sanctification we're not just looking at the restoration of the gifts but we're looking at the restoration of the word and with the restoration of the word comes the power comes the anointing comes the Dominion we've been restored just like Adam could speak to Nature speak to the wind there's the Primus on Earth that has the same spoken word you might not have to speak the name sure you might not have to speak squirrels into existence but you can't speak the cancer out of existence you can speak for your loved ones to come home you can speak for your sons and your daughters to accept the Holy Ghost it's the light of the hour that has brought the restoration of the power hallelujah it's a continuation of the book of Acts oh Hallelujah you see brother Branham talks about the carnival he says if we didn't have enough money to get in there we would come to the fence and he says there if there was a a hole in the fence he says maybe you're not tall enough to see him there but I am he says I would jump up and grab the fence and pull myself up and look through there and come back down and you would say what did you see brother Banner he was saying I seen an elephant he says my but what else did you see he would jump up there pull himself up look in there it says I sent a giraffe I see the monkey I seen a zebra we could not see it for ourselves because we wasn't built high enough to sin but God gave somebody who was built high enough where they put she in there oh my became we had a Prophet The Comeback that's inside saying that God still feels with the Holy Ghost they're saying he don't but God still heals the sick they're saying they don't but still delivers the bound they're saying they don't but I'm looking with some insight letting you know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and if you can just believe this inside all of Heaven is being restored if you can just believe this light you can speak the word you can see your loved ones healed you can see your sons and daughters filled with the Holy Ghost hallelujah it's an Insight that has been given to the bride oh hallelujah it's a Watchman that has given us a light given us an understanding that we can see oh we're not builts like brother praying them to go up there but we are built to believe what he saw oh my like our Pastor said Wednesday he was helpless in himself he would stand by telling testimonies for 20 30 45 minutes it says you know what I'm doing I'm waiting for him I can't do nothing without him but then he would say he is here he is here I take every Spirit under my control that wasn't a man that was the spirit that was the anointing then he could read people's hearts he could tell him what happened you may say I want scripture Ezekiel 11 and 5 and the spirit of the Lord fell upon them the same spirit that anointed our Prophet fell upon Ezekiel and said unto me speak thus saith the Lord thus have you said o House of Israel for I know that I know the things that come in your mind every one of them that wasn't a man revealing the hearts that was the spirit coming to us here coming to somebody with insights and letting them know the secrets of the heart we got a prophet in this last day that had an insight and lets you know let you know the secrets of the heart but he also lets you know the future he lets you know nothing can keep you out of a Rapture nothing to keep you out of the body change if you can just believe the insight Hallelujah if you can just believe the Watchman he will become your eyes Hallelujah he will become your eyes The Same Spirit that show Moses what happened in the beginning Was the Same Spirit the show John what is happening at the end the Bible says John was in the spirit on the Lord's day it wasn't a natural Spirit but he was caught up in the spirit and transported into the Lord's day which is a future events he was a prophet that was lifted up by the anointing oh my look at Ezekiel 11 24 afterwards the spirit took me up and brought me in a vision by the spirit of God in charadia to them to them to the Captivity so the vision that I had seen went up from me then I spake unto them of the Captivity all the things that the Lord had showed me he's doing the same thing for the Brandon was doing it wasn't a man it was an anointing coming to a prophet somebody that was built to see it oh come on somebody just like a job he says I know my redeemer liveth and not be healed My Flesh won't see corruption he did not see the Redeemer if there's a natural ice but the spirit lifted him up oh come on somebody the spirit lifted him up that he could see the Redeemer Jesus wasn't on Earth yet he wasn't he didn't go to the Cross yet he didn't go to Calvary yet but the spirit lifted him up where he could see the Redeemer and not believe his Insight I know my redeemer lives I know Hallelujah I don't care what I'm going through because of jobs inside I know my redeemer lives Hallelujah he was lifted up where he could see it it was an insight Hallelujah brother Branham says this God would not put a man in a tower there now what preacher wishy-washy gospel and not tell the truth and won the people of the Wrath that is to come he put a man in there that would be bold and would have the spirit that seen the upcoming judgment that would have their spirits that seen the upcoming judgment you notice how he's saying that the spirits in the upcoming judgment you notice how he's put in that he would hide the spirit that seen the upcoming judgment and regardless of what the people said he would warn them anyhow cry out against it he doesn't put blind prophets in his Tower he puts prophets preachers who who foresee the coming judgment and warns the people to flee he don't put blind prophets in the Watchtower this says one thing but it don't happen oh come on brother Branham have prophecy after prophecy after prophecy discernment after discernment after his sermon he wasn't a blind prophet he was somebody that the spirit took control and showed him the secrets of the heart remember brother Branham says he turned around and he had us back to the crowd and was refilled revealing the secrets of the heart that wasn't a man that was the anointing letting you know that the same God now walked on Earth is the same God here not if not William praying him but the words in the beginning was the world the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh so the same word that dwelled in Jesus is the same word that's been restored in this day Hey whenever Jesus went off the scene the accident go with him but the apostles were doing the same signs that Jesus was doing come on now and when the apostles went off the scene the acts didn't go with them but the same signs and wonders that the apostles did in the book of Acts is the same science and wonders that the pride is doing we're laying hands on the sick recovering we're casting out spirits to move somebody it's not different actions because of a different word it's the same word producing the same actions hallelujah it's the same word it's the light it's brought in insights where we can sing you see an inside brings assurance well you don't you don't got to worry I think I may have given this before I don't know but if so that's always aggravating when you're trying to scare somebody you're hiding behind the door or hiding behind the wall and somebody says Hey the person you're trying to scare somebody says hey he's hiding behind the door trying to scare you so as she as he walks up there you jump out and try to scare him but it don't scare them because they got an insight what would naturally scare them well it's not scaring them because they had somebody that knew the Future come on somebody we can go through daily struggles but we've got an assurance that my future is in concrete there's no devil Spirit no Leo to see his Spirit no lukewarmness no formalism can't keep me out of a Rapture because I know my future oh Hallelujah there's an assurance that comes with Insight it's a revelation you know I know the story Mark Lowry tells about how he said he survived the tornado I'm sure many people's heard it before but he says he was in the lake bar a houseboat and there was a tornado that come back and he started there started at the boats through him back and forth he was crying and screaming he was scared to death but he walks out after the tornado and he says there's a bunch of guys that were laughing saying wow we survived another one he says how were you guys so happy he says You must be new here this is Tornado Alley this happens all the time and he says this he says if I'd known I was going to survive it would have been fun for me too he didn't know the future so the present state was making him wishy-washing but the bride knows the future you know you're gonna survive so the trials that you go through don't push you around circumstances that you go through don't push you around hard times that you go through does not push you around there's an Insight that you know the future it's an assurance it's a light Psalms 11 4 and to the upright there will rise of the light in the darkness there's a rising of light in the darkness Isaiah 60 and 2 for behold Darkness shall cover the Earth gross Darkness the people but the Lord Capital l-o-r-t the shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee he didn't just say the Lord is going to arise he's not just coming for any purpose but he's coming to bring light to you the Lord is all right has arisen upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee what's his glory his power will be seen upon thee how do we know that there's a sun in the sky because there's an earth that is reflecting the Sun but the Branham talks about Purdue he says the Dew it's pretty in the mornings because it's sparkling but he says that when it happened in the dark times the ninth Honda the the the the the the do is not sparkling but once the sun comes up and starts to reflect through the Dew it Sparkles and its glory is seen on the earth oh come on somebody the same Glory that the sun is shining is now being reflected upon somebody that is shining it through them their lives to do is shining the same lights and that's the way it is with the pride the Lord has arisen upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee so the same power of the message is now upon the bride you're walking as a Victorious Army you're an invincible Army you're more than conquerors you're marching over every sickness over every Spirit his glory is reflecting itself upon somebody that can believe it Hallelujah somebody that can believe the Insight starts to reflect it you see its influences you know you don't got to go to Hollywood for Hollywood to influence you come on now you don't got to go to Hollywood for it to influence you you just gotta let it be your influence you gotta let it come into your home you got to let it come into your derailing place them the same influence that Hollywood has in California or wherever it's at is the same influence in your home oh come on now and that's an Earthly influence what about the Heavenly influence there's been an influence that's been given to the bride because of the light we might not be in heaven but we're sitting in Heavenly places we're sighting in an atmosphere in an anointing where it's influencing my life it's changing the way we're talking you know you let somebody a little girl that's here that that is focusing and so willing upon Hollywood is going to change the way she dresses it changes the way she acts it changes the way she talks she has an influence that she's trying to be like but what about the message come on somebody what if he let that be our Center focus in her homes in our families on the job site then it starts to change us to what is influencing us the glory of the Lord shall be seen on you we're manifesting the light so it doesn't it ain't saying it's taking the darkness away but he's pushing the light through the darkness you see it might be in a dark season of life but the glory of the Lord is still there you might not feel the anointing you might feel like your mind's about to fall apart you might feel like your marriage is about to fall apart but if the glory of the Lord is seen upon you he hasn't forgotten about you it was the dark time of Sarah that God showed up it was at a dark time where when when God showed up it says I'm going to show up at the time of life and you're going to have a son and what does Sarah do she was at a dark time she was at a low time and laughed and says how can I have this baby but then the angel of the Lord says is anything too hard for God he was at the darkest time of Sarah that he revealed the true power of God come on somebody it was at her darkest time that he was saying I will return at the appointed time he come and let her know no matter the darkest time that you're in the mind battles that you're facing I've come to let you know and give you a light gives you an Insight that there's an appointed time that your body is going to be changed you may be at a low time this morning but God sent the message with an Insight that lets you know you are capable of making a Rapture the devil may be saying you've sinned your day of Grace away you fell too many times you're not able to produce the promised child but God sent the light that lets you know at the appointed time you're going to have the promise at the appointed time you're going to share the rapture at the appointed time don't give up in the darkness the light is wanting to shine through you and so now Sarah become the manifestation of the light so no longer was it just a promise but now she started to reflect it because we know what happened her and Abraham went to Egypt I believe and this was a hundred year old woman that the king looked out and says I want her to be my wife could you imagine a king that could have anybody inside of the country but he chose a hundred-year-old woman it wasn't of her age it was the light manifesting itself through her and it changed her body oh come on now the word is doing something to the bride it's not just a promise that we're hoping for but the promise is changing us day by day day by day look at John 12 and 35 then Jesus said unto them yet a little while is the light with you walk while you have the light lest Darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whether he goeth and so in darkness there's no direction in darkness there's no Assurance but the Bible is saying you have a light so walk in it lest darkness comes upon you so you notice the Bible says that the Lord is high the Lord shall arise upon you and the glory shall be seen upon thee so we're either going to Bear the manifestation of the light of the Lord or the manifestation of the darkness come on somebody saying walk in the light lest darkness comes upon you so we're dwelling in the midst of Darkness but at the same time we don't have to die we don't have to let the darkness dwell upon us there's another power that we're manifesting it ain't the power of legal to see you but it's the power of the light brother Branham says this then a fro walking in the god-given length of the hour then God takes the word that was given for the hour and Vindication he says just like he did in Genesis 1 and 3 let there be light and light come forth his word been forth in light followed him it cleared away the mist and darkness went to one corner and the light shined on the other side he says he he sends his word and the lights followed him oh I hope you're catching it this morning he sent his word and I had found it so wherever the word is light follows no matter if it's in darkness if it's in chaos if it's in a hard situation A Hard trial a hard time in your life if you can receive the word you will receive the light that will give you a Direction but the random says this that's the way God does it today he sends his word for this hour and the Holy Spirit comes and makes the word live and the Darkness goes on to their Creeds and their denominations but light shines because it is the word of God being Vindicated that it is his word is true and there's no fictions about it that's just exactly scripture he says all right just the exactly scripture he says once God so let there be light he says the Mist how to roll away Darkness how to go to a corner because God said let there be you look at Genesis 1 and 3 and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light and that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness so he didn't do away with the darkness he allowed the darkness to stay but wherever I was Darkness could not be come on now we're done while I was Darkness could not be you see if somebody is struggling with drinking you walk by a bar there's something that's going to pull you to it if somebody smoke is struggling with smoking you go by somebody that is smoking you're going to struggle with him but if you go by if the word comes by somebody the once the word it's going to pull you in a direction and divide the light from the darkness where you're walking in the midst of Darkness but it's not with you brother random says he separated the light from the darkness and the light he called day the darkness he called nights and God's word always separates the light from the darkness he says see it's the word that does the separating the light from the darkness so you don't gotta worry about being a good Christian you don't got to worry about making a Rapture but once you receive the light it pushes everything out of it you know brother Branham says she don't got to teach a boy to lie it's just in its nature it's a lie you don't got to teach your boy to steal it's in his nature to steal and you don't got to teach somebody to be an invincible Army once they receive the light it just becomes who they are Abraham wasn't the one that changed his body he just received the words and thy word changed his body come on somebody you don't got to worry about them you're just resting in an assurance of what the light says but you see before the Duke and Sparkle like I said earlier the darkness has to be pushed away so before you can manifest the LIE of the power of the light Darkness has to be pushed away but the random says when he gets ready to leave or to use a group of people he has to separate the light from the darkness when he gets ready to use an individual he separates the light from the darkness see light comes from God remember the light come by his spoken word he says the word of God commanded to clear the sky so the sons could shine in and his word today clears back all of the atmospheres of unbelief so that you can Shine the Light his word is shy is pushing back all of the atmospheres of unbelief remember the bubbling brook for the praying him says he would walk by the Brook and no matter the season uh the seasons of the of the country he says it can be winter spring fall summer whenever it was it was always bubbling and he says he went to the brook and he says how come you're always bubbling and he says is it because the uh that the squirrels shrink from him he says if the brook will talk he would say no not because squirrels drink from me is that because the birds shrink from you he says no that's not the reason he says is it because me the prophet of man drinks from you he says no that's not the reason he says how come time you're always so bubbly he says it's because there's something on the inside pushing it out the screen's gonna have to worry about pushing it up there was a source on the inside that was pushing it out and this pride has a source on the inside that is shining the light in the midst of darkness in the midst of Chaos in the midst of discouragement in the middle of Trials the pride is expressing the power of the Sun Hallelujah they're expressing a living God in the middle of a generation that don't know what to believe they don't know if the boys if they're girls they don't know what they are but they're somebody that knows the Living God that can save that can feel but the holy ghost that can heal somebody and free them from addictions they know who they are big pause of an insight it's pushing it out circumstances can't put the sled out tribulations can't put it out there's an unquenchable fire that is on the inside that are shining the light in the midst of chaos I just love this scripture in second Corinthians 4 and 6 for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness commanded he didn't say please starkness let the light shine he commanded with authority no butts about it no ends about no maybe so but God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness so in the midst of Darkness there come a light no Hallelujah in the midst of the darkness there come a light and that same God that same God has commanded light to shine in our hearts to give the light of knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ for we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellence say of the power might be of God and not of us so he's saying the same power the pushed back for Darkness was because of the authority of the word and that is the same treasure that we have in this certain vessels that push the darkness out it's not us but there's the power of the light in us that is pushing it out and then he says this we're traveled on every side yet not distressed we're perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed he's letting you know in the middle of the light there's nothing that can put the light out you may be persecuted but you're not forsaken you may be troubled on every side but you're not distressed you may be middle in the middle of a complex but the light is still shining you may be in the middle of a discouraging time but the light is still shining you've got a treasure in the earth and vessel that is shining the light expressing the power Hallelujah in the midst of a total blackout God has a like better Shining that is expressing itself Psalms 18 and 28 for thou will light my candle the Lord my God will Enlighten my darkness that's powerful the Lord my God will Enlighten my darkness yeah I hope this is okay you might be in the hardest time in your life you might be fighting the biggest doubles of your life but there's a light that can Enlighten the darkness condemnation Temptations complexes anxiety depression nervousness there's the lights that can Enlighten your Darkness Psalms 119 105 Thy word is the lamp under my feet in the light under my path we've hated to The Watchmen and now we're relying on his spiritual insights brother the Bible says that they come up they come to him you notice how the Bible's putting that it ain't him chasing them and saying hey morning cometh but the night does also they're coming to the Watchmen and saying Watchmen what of the night Watchmen what of the night and the Bible says the morning cometh but also the night for the prayer is saying that that means mourning is coming but it's still a night season so obey the Watchmen listen to the warnings he was letting them know that hey morning is coming but we're still in darkness you're gonna listen for my warnings you still gotta listen to my insight till morning comes hey come on somebody whereas one day we're gonna step out of the start the dimension and step into a body change step into the Rapture but until then it's still a night season there's still Darkness all around us you still gotta listen to the insights that God has given us the Bible says in first Timothy 1-13 hold fast the form of sound words this ain't time to throw the message away at this same time they'll turn away but this is the time to embrace the message embrace the likes in the midst of Darkness first Thessalonians 5 and 21 prove all things hold fast that which is good prove all things if you need to study the message study it out but prove it then once you prove it embrace it hold fast to that which is good hey if Creeds ain't lining up with the scriptures throw them out if man's ideas ain't lining up with scriptures throw it out if message preachers ain't lining up with scriptures throw it out but embrace the form of sound Words which is the the insight for the bride which is the LIE right Hallelujah embrace it but the Brandon says that ministers will look back and see what Moody said and what Sankey said that's where the son was but he is here today here is where he's at today it's on the west coast in the evening time Hallelujah giving evening lights not back to Luther's justification or Wesley sanctification but we're at the last day amen where the evening lights are shining we were at the last day follow the Sun so we're not doing away with Luther's message or Wesley's message but we're adding two and we're building upon the foundation you see to do away with Luther's message is for nowhere to say we don't need our for Moses to say we don't need Noah's message no will work for that day but it was another time another day with another message Moses couldn't go to the go to Egypt and build an ark and say come on let's go that wasn't the message for that day he wasn't doing away with that but that wasn't working for today oh come on now you see they wouldn't have been there if it wasn't for the ark okay come on somebody Moses went and been there with the staff if it wasn't for the ark so the ark had its purpose but it wasn't working for today we want to be here in the fullness of the light with our Luther's message come on somebody we want to be here in the wholeness of the light without Wesley's message but that message will not work for today hey Jesus wouldn't have been there with the Moses message but that message wasn't working for that day if they're following me it's a progression it's a life that's getting brighter and brighter and prior to the children of Israel couldn't stop after the first sign and say that's great let's make Camp know they were still needing to go on after they got on the other side of the Red Sea they couldn't stop and say Yep this is where we're staying oh the pillar of fire was still moving the lights was still getting brighter but it took the signs to get across the Red Sea and took getting across the Red Sea to get to the promised land come on now we needed Wesley we need a Luther we need a Pentecost but we've got the word now that has been built off of those stages so that you can walk in the fullness and live in the promised land live with your inheritance and believe that the same God that was with Wesley was with Luther and was with Pentecost and it's with this bride Hallelujah you say they couldn't have the promised land it's not of Egypt but it took that first stage to get him out of Egypt they turn again on the promised land if they stayed up the Red Sea let the rest he pushed them on towards the promised land but you can't stay in the wilderness either they're in the border between I hope this is okay this morning there was on the border between the Red Sea and the promised land and many people get stuck between the Holy Ghost Pentecost and the fullness of the word in order to come into the inheritance you gotta cross that border come on somebody you gotta cross that border it's a stepping stone the step into the fullness where you can have your inheritance what is your inheritance brother Josh it's your rapture it's the body change it's what we're believing for but it can only happen once you step across the border y'all know what I'm talking about the children of Israel that wandered around in their Wilderness for 20 years after 40 years I believe they wandered around wandered around because they didn't want to go across and fight in that land they got complacent it was easier staying there because they didn't want to fight the criticism I'm preaching this morning they didn't want to fight the unbelief they didn't want to fight but there was a Joshua and Caleb that says we're not here this ain't the end of the road this ain't why we was brought out of Egypt that's why we was brought out of Egypt come on somebody God has brought you this far not to leave you here take another step God brought you out of your traditions for this God brought you out of your ideas and those other things for this don't stay on the border cross the line Hallelujah Joshua and Caleb says I don't care what we gotta face he brought us this far and I'm stepping across that's my Promised Land that's my inheritance that's who I am that's why I was built for I was built to possess my land I wasn't built to be defeated in the wilderness come on now you wasn't built to be defeated in confusion you wasn't built to be defeated in the Reds here you was made to dwell in the heights of this message you was to where you were us made to dwell and the powers of your inheritance you see brother Branham says John the Baptist was a little light but then there come a greater light after him and he says once the greater Light Came Luther John the Baptist lights went out but the random says John the Baptist was the light of the hour he was the light before Jesus was the light the prophet Isaiah said a voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord make straight his path that was spoken of that that was the spoken word of God he was laying there it hadn't come to life yet Malachi the last prophet 400 years before it had taken place so behold I will send my messenger before my foot before me to prepare the way of the Lord here he come out of the Wilderness without a denomination without a Creed without an identification but the lights identified him the word identified him so you're saying that John the Baptist had light absolutely just like Luther had liked but they couldn't stay around John the Baptist a greater light had come you notice that only two of John the Baptist disciples ran after Jesus the rest of them stayed with John because what's the Bible say John was in prison and the Bible says he sent his disciples to go talk to Jesus and ask him are you the one or the way he looked to or we look for another are you the Messiah so John still had disciples that refused to go with Jesus come on somebody you can be in the light of yesterday but there's a greater life that is here but the Branham continues on to say Jesus said you did walk in his light he was a bright and Shining Light for a while why until the way was prepared then his lights went out you can't walk in that light you Baptist that is this is the light of the hour the light has come Rise and Shine the word the light the word manifested is the word of God identified is the light God need a light throughout the church ages but those lights went out just like the children of Israel the brother Branham says when they come to the Red Sea they would make camp but once the pillar of fire moved they packed up and went with it they couldn't stay at that present stage they had to pack up and go with him and we know what happened throughout the church ages they denominated the Next Generation denominated and the spirit of God the purifier the light moved on moved on to uh to Wesley and the Next Generation denominated you see if Wesley was here today he'll be be preaching this message he would be beef Luther was here today he would be preaching this message he was a Seer he was one that could see the light for the arrow but it was the Next Generation that refused to go with the light Hallelujah but we're living in a generation that is dwelling in the light and we're the generation of serpent bruisers that is defeating every Spirit brother Branham says he is the light the truth the light there was no dark darkness in him he says he is absolutely the light oh hey absolutely the lightning the time of Darkness yes all of these false glares and things were fade away yes sir he is here don't fear turn on the lights his promised word notice how he says that you've got to turn on the lights so the light is here we have power here we have light switches we have the Wafers up but in order to see the lights you got to turn it on the power can be here the light is here but you've got to operate it you've got to all pray for message but God has given you look how II Peter 1 and 12. there were therefore I will be not I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things that ye know them and be established in present truth be established you look at Ephesians 2 and 19. now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets and like I was mentioning about the curtain of time brother Branham they come up too many and they said Paul's going to be judged or he says you're going to be judged for what you preached and he says well will Paul be judged for what he preached and they said yes he will and he says oh good for I just preached what Paul preached so he was bringing us back to the foundation of the Apostles as the musicians come we've been promised a Watchman in this last day I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord he shall turn the hearts of the fathers of the children hearts of the
