========================================

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I [Music] h [Music] good morning welcome to the house of God this morning brother Andy hello Roman uh it's good to be it's good to be here it's good to um be in a place that we can Worship the Lord this morning and um yeah it's you know it's funny getting the songs together hope you don't mind me I like to talk at the start cuz I kind of like to like I got to get to know you man like I got to connect I can't just like start it's kind of you know when you warm up a vehicle you got to sort of like a diesel you sort of turn it on you got to let it run for a bit you know get it kind of I get to know you you get to know me even though we know each other it's different but um you know I was thinking this morning that um I pick out songs you sort of feel like I should do this one and that one and you kind of try and at least somehow get inspiration to know what what songs you that I should pick you know to sing and I don't know what the message is or anything like that I just feel like okay I should do this one and that one and and you go on a leading you know that's what you do when you when you when you serve the Lord um but every now and then I pick one for me like I ignore all that and I pick one for me but but but I think there's a scripture that says Thou shalt not no it says don't muzzle the ox that Treads out the corn meaning if there's this Ox that's doing all this work and like treading out all this corner and working and working if at any point in time that Ox wants to like reach down and just take some of that corn for itself let it don't put something on its mouth that it can't just you know after all its labor just go and eat some when it wants to and so I think I'm I'm sort of getting these together and I think you know I have to labor week in week out practice plan do all this stuff I'm like you know if at any point in time I want to choose a song for me I'm going to I'm going to put my I'm going to put my mouth down and eat some of the Corn so the first song I've got is is there's a song called when the role is Called Up Yonder and and you know it seems like it's a song that you'd sing it's about me but I have a it's it always speaks to me when I sing it because it's actually something more powerful than than that because you know we have desires in our hearts so we all have a desire some of them are strong desires some of them are lesser desires but we all have desires in our hearts you agree and the Lord says if we Delight ourselves in him he'll give us the desires of our hearts now some of them we think oh well if I get that happy if I don't whatever some of them are a bit stronger where we think I really want that and then some of them but I've got one desire on my heart that's non-negotiable it's just a non-negotiable desire I ain't negotiating with nobody on it it's it's it's off the table I don't care what push comes to shove where it happens I've got a desire that I'm not negotiating with anybody on either side ever it's like this one's non-negotiable and it's always been for the Salvation of my children it's always been a non-negotiable desire like I don't care who talks to me about it we ain't negotiating nothing on it ever ever and you know I think even if God will cast me into hell I'm still going to hold him to that desire say but yeah you can cast me aside but I'm not backing down on that one so when I sing this song when the role was caught up yonder I think I could just imagine you know when when might be about me but I'm thinking my all my children's names are going to be called they're going to be called when that role is called so every time I sing it that's why sometimes I I get emotional but it's like I just know that's what's going to happen so that's my song I chose for me this morning hey let's stand let's just worship uh let's open in prayer Lord we thank you that you give us the desires of our hearts Lord and I believe that's each desire of each one here this morning Lord that that that we all desire Lord that our children would be saved and serving you and we thank you for that promise that we have Lord and we we just thank you for your Lord that you meet every desire of our heart Lord Jesus and we just want to invite you into our midst Lord we know you're the great God Lord that not only knows our hearts and knows our desires Lord but you you're the one that can meet them Lord those things that we hold so dear Lord we we know Lord that if our heart's in the palm of your hand then you hold it there as well Lord so so we just want to come to you and lift our heart to you this morning Lord I pray that any desire Lord that's that's in any heart this morning that that would be met Lord Jesus Lord and and and thank you for this opportunity that we have to Delight ourselves in you this morning Lord Jesus so we just commit the service to you we pray bless it bless the the word bless bless us now as we worship and praise

ties into what I'm saying so praise God good to have Priscilla back in church too trust you're all fighting for again amen praise the Lord God bless you amen praise the Lord happy to see you on your feet here amen that's good amen so um 2 Kings 6 and8 then the king of Syria wared against Israel and took counsel with his servants saying in such and such a place shall be my camp and the man of God said unto the king of Israel saying beware that thou pass not such a place for hither the syrians are come down and the king of Israel sent to the place which the uh man of God told him and warned him of and saved himself there not once but uh nor twice therefore the uh the heart of the king of Syria was so troubled for this thing and he called his servants and said unto them will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel and one of his servants said none my Lord oh King but Elisha the prophet that is in Israel tth the king of Israel the words that thou speaketh in thy bed chamber and he said go and spy where he is that I may send and fetch him and was told saying behold he is in Dothan therefore sent his uh he hither horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night and Compass the city about and when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth Behold a host can pass the city both with horses and as my master what shall we do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them and elishah prayed said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened his eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountains were full of horses and Chariots of the fire of fire round about Elisha and when they came down to him Elisha prayed unto the Lord said Smite this people I pray thee with blindness and he smoke them with blindness according to the word of Elisha and Elisha said unto them this is not the way neither is this the city follow me and I will bring you to the man whom you seek but he led them to Samaria and it came to pass when they were come into Samaria that Elisha said Lord Open the Eyes of these men that they may see and the Lord opened their eyes and they saw and behold they were in the midst of Samaria and the king of Israel said unto Elisha when he saw uh when he saw them my father shall I smite them shall I smite them course I don't have it here but we know the rest of the story Elisha says now feed them and send them home amen but uh let's pray this morning shall we amen gracious father we're so thankful we can have this Grand opportunity to stand in your presence once again Lord Lord on this side of the veil Lord and praise your great name for all you've done for us we thank you truly Lord we can say your goodness and your Mercy's been running after us Lord we praise your Holy Name Lord this day we're asking father may you walk among us one more time may you touch every heart touch every life Lord we Just Want To Praise Your Great Name this morning we love you we asking your blood would cover us each one Lord be with those who are streaming as well Lord those who are away traveling and be be their abundant portion Lord we love you so much we thank you for your great word that we could read now we ask you to anoint speaker and hearer Lord may you make it live For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning so I want to I want to speak about seeing today and the if we look so I got a few scriptures to read here but I just want to go back to this cuz often we take the um you know we take the scripture of of Revelations 3 and the conditions of our age and you it says in verse 18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried and the fire thou mayest be rich white rment thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with I have that thou mayest see now there's some people that have taken this instruction on board amen and I believe I'm looking at them this morning there's those who have actually tooken the counsel of the word of God and they've heard the voice of God they've come out to to him they've opened up their hearts God's come in amen and now they're now they're not blind anymore but they can see am mean they're not naked anymore they're dressed amen and they have uh character tried in the fire God's own character in their life now if we go back to uh if we go back to um Second Kings here we see there were certain things that people could see now quite often what happens when we're walking with the Lord is is is Trouble Comes because God is in us God is walking with us you know it's like when Israel came into the promised land they didn't really have to go looking for the enemy to fight the enemy came looking for them on many occasion you know they banded together they tried to overthrow Israel but you you know it's like us in our walk the enemy tries to find us because he wants to stop us in our tracks but I say if God is in us we're Unstoppable because he's the Unstoppable one and he's very determined to have his word fulfilled and he's going to find someone to fulfill it and I believe that's you and I this morning so now we can see gazi he went out in the morning and he was worried because the enemy tried to come and find um Elisha and capture him isn't it amazing that it was obviously somehow the servant of the king of Syria knew that what what what he was saying in his bed chamber was now known in Israel I don't know how that was tied together but and isn't it interesting that you know that God did not deliver Israel just once or twice but more than that quite often God would as soon as the king of Syria would send out the orders it's like in real time you know it was it was broadcast there too to the prophet and and you know the prophet made it known to the king and and so the prophet could see things that that the natural eye could not see he could see things that were far away from him and even you know God is in such a way he will show you things that have happened and will happen you know like the prophet would stand there and he you know you know when the anointing would come down and you that you know uh Christ was there and he would you know the uh uh God would reveal the secrets and tense of the people's hearts he would often tell people you know like people who had had an operation they were on the table and there was a heavy set doctor a thin doctor he had described the scene and um you you know they would um you look at look at the person shake their head sew them back up and all these things you know the prophet was transported back in time or taken he say I see you looking out the window you got dizzy spells and all these different things so he was transported in by Vision into these different places now there's a reason God did that to show that God's mindful of Our Lives see see see gazi was panicking he saw he just saw a part of the picture right now we know the prayer of Elisha did not bring the armies of Israel down he did not his prayer did not say Lord send your armies around me now I need them he prayed Lord open his eyes that he would realize who is there already and and I believe friends that the Unseen realm is is is so seeable by faith in this day am me that the armies of heaven and we'll go through it quickly before we jump to some other things the armies of Heaven have always been around God's elected ones they have always been present they've never been absent they've never been distant they've always been around and I'd say it's even greater in this day cuz it's not just the angels of God around us but it's Christ in you the hope of glory I mean because this was this is what the message restores is Christ the true baptism of the Holy Ghost the word of God alive in his people once again am mean so to me it's incredible we can actually Sur we see the problems Elisha didn't say no that's not such a bad thing he didn't discount what what what they were going through but he just said Lord open his eyes that he'd see the whole picture and then I think the you know to me gazi he was probably would have been more shocked to see the armies of Heaven than the armies of the enemy there on the ground amen so you see now there is a as we read in Revelations chapter 3 there is a blindness that is upon the upon the age and brother Braham says that this this blindness is like the same blindness that uh that Elijah smokee the um syrians with you know many times if you looking like some kind of Bible cartoon you know it's like these people become completely blind they got to hold on to each other and their lead but they could see but they couldn't see everything they couldn't see the prophet in front of them and isn't it amazing that you know Elisha after he smoked them blind he told them you're at the wrong place but beforehand they knew they at the right place this is Dothan we've seen this place before but you see the blindness caused them to not understand where they were standing standing in that present moment and so now so so blindness will cause people not to realize where they are now I'm not saying we're blind we can see the message of the hour has opened our eyes the Holy Ghost ice have has come down into the church I mean that we can see the full picture now sometimes we can we can get our eyes can get glazed over that doesn't mean we're blind though that means we've just taking our eyes off the right thing right like John the Baptist you think about an adopted son of God fulfilled the scripture that he was meant to fulfill a voice crying you one crying in the wilderness right so he fulfilled his mission behold he's the Lamb of God takes away the sin of the world but when he ended up in prison brother BR said his eagle eyes glazed over but did God leave him in that condition no but you see the reason he was in that condition is because his expect his human expectations weren't being met he thought no doubt the messiah's going to he you know because he said he's going to um what thoroughly Purge his floor take his fan in his hand and Purge the floor and every Mountain Will Made low every Valley made High and all these great things messiah's going to do and here comes the lowely man of Galilee the Lamb of God remember but you see so as human expectation was different to what God's uh uh God's plan was and because of disappointment his eagle eyes glazed over in prison but as I said before did God leave him in that condition absolutely not you see because there's something that God wants us to see the Fulfillment of his word and mean he wants us to see that we're part of that fulfillment because when he sent his when Jesus sent his disciples you think how brother BR would say that when John sent his disciples just a backtrack to to to Jesus it was the you know one of the worst questions he could have asked the Lamb of God are you him or do we look for another and he pointed him out in the water but he said because of disappointment his eyes glazed over but then the Lord did not want him to stay in that state so he said go tell John you just sit here see what happens in the meetings and you see the eyes come open the blind the Dead rais the sick healed demons cast out and then go tell John what you've seen amen so John now heard evidence a testimony that he had pointed out the right man Hallelujah so then he could Rejoice saying Lord I have fulfilled my part of your word that you've allotted to me I mean now I can just rejoice and take courage and rest in what you have done friends our end destination is a Rapture right that's our end destination right and we're going to keep that and very much in the Forefront of our minds and in our hearts that the Lord soon and very soon is going to sweep there's going to sweep come over the church and he's going to catch us away amen because the armies of Heaven are actually a transport hallu we'll come to it amen it's it's it's actually a transport as as I would say in the song of um Song of Solomon he'd say my Dove my undefiled is but one she's the only one of her mother she has the choice of of the one of her that bear her the daughter saw her and blessed her and say yay the queens and the concubine finds they praise sir this what God says you're the you're his undefiled one see we got to look at ourselves as God looks at ourselves right he say well I've been through a lot of things but he says thank you Lord for the scars I thought it's so TI all those songs Just were such a beautiful arrangement thank you for the scars Lord then we say thank you for your scars Hallelujah yes can you look at your life and say thank you for the scars Lord oh but they ran very deep they're very big but thank you for the scars Lord thank you for the scars of rejection pain whatever's happened in life I say thank you for those Lord because without those Lord I would never know your heart just like job could sing that song Thank you for the scars Lord I lost my children I lost everything but thank you Lord cuz without that I'd still be sitting here wondering Lord yeah I've see I see yo yo the death bell resurrection of nature I see it in the sun and you know rising and descending I see plants dying and coming back to life but man where does he go he would still be in that state wondering what happens when he dies we say thank you for the scars Lord because youve revealed to me now I can say because of the scars you've spoken through those scars to say now I know my redeemer liveth Hallelujah as he I trust he spoken through your scars you can look back in life said Lord you spoke through those not just his scars is now Prince and his hands and feet but the scars in your life he spoken to you hallelujah hallelujah amen but we are his undefiled one we're a new creation we're a new creation I pray that we just have a victory dance and our hearts as as we go out these doors as we go through the rest of our life we say Lord I can praise you with the voice of Triumph because you've conquered HDE in the grave for me amen now he says here he um you go read about what brother B says in the about the later and AG the author of the creation of God brother R says it's not a it's not a a a um he he is not we are that new creation God has created us new by the new birth that's why we're his under defiled one cuz he created us undefiled we were born defiled but he created us undefiled by the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen who is she that lookth forth as the morning Fair as the moon clear as the sun and terrible as an army with banners amen hallelujah amen I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley and to see whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates buttered orever I was aware my soul made me like the Chariots of of um ABAB however you say that ad return return oh oh shulamite return return that we may look upon thee what will we see in the shulamite as it were the company of two armies now those now now this company of two armies is speaks of a an an Earthly host and a Heavenly Host those are the two armies so so the question is what shall we see when we what shall we see in the shulamite now this is this is the bride this is Solomon's bride the shulamite right so so the question is what will we see when we see her says as it we're a company of two armies so so when the bride is seen seen it's not just a host on the Earth but a Heavenly Host that's that is with her amen she is as it were the company of two armies say that God's armies have never neglected his elected ones they have always been present they always will be present and they will remain present amen the ones who have been sent to the Earth to minister salvation unto you amen will attend to you and Glory am hallelujah amen that's why we can Rejoice you know many times we look at the look at the darkness of this age just like gazi saw the enemies around the city but it's just half the picture the other half is far powerful and has a far greater impact than than than the scene am mean so he saw the trouble he saw that they were in big trouble the world sees as I said this this blindness that has come into this age causes people to see some things and not see other things so even gazi was under bit of blindness he was cuz he was just seeing the problems that they were facing day to day where's my next paycheck going to come how's this going to happen what's going to happen to my children what's going to happen to my family what about all these things he was only looking at those things but then the prophet said just Lord open his eyes that he can see the full picture I mean then isab was applied to his eyes said Lord and he realized the armies of Heaven wereth the prophet amen I say the armies of Heaven are with the bride of Jesus Christ today Hallelujah now this this uh uh my soul made me like like the Chariots of am dab or D or however you say that now there's a question about what these chariots mean I did a bit of a research and some say that these chariots were princely chariots they Royal chariots but far greater than the best chariots that Solomon had but they're actually the Chariots of the Heavenly Host they were God's chariots amen so when when the bride when the bride comes into the manifestation there's a there's a great yearning a cry in the heart of God my chariots are going to snatch her away Hallelujah this is what the armies of Heaven are come to do not just to protect us but to carry us away Amen in God's appointed time they're going to snatch us away and just like brother Bram was when when he was caught Pastor kurur in a time he was there before he realized he was there amen he was there remember he was lying on his bed like this and he was 50 something years old said Lord you know if I want to do something for God I better do it now and a voice H him would you like to see Pastor curtain of time and he just said it would help me so much and he and he was out of his body before he realized he was out of his body and then you he saw the young you know the redeemed 18 to 21 or the height of their youth amen running towards them AR ra and white these ones weren't defiled these ones weren't naked in their sin they were robed in white amen they run to my precious brother my precious brother amen and then he you know put his head up in his hand he uh his hand on his head he felt a full head of hair and realized he was young just like that so he was there before he realized he was there friends there's going to be a change in our bodies before we realize there's going to be a change in our bodies I mean there's going to be you know God is going to change us before we realize we're ever going to be changed I believe we're looking for that season right now we're living in the season of the Resurrection Hallelujah if we could just see that amen amen amen so there's a company even even Jacob Jacob when he was on his way to return to um God told him go back to you know go back to the promised land go back to your father house he's on his way to see to see um um Esau he's just uh previous to this in uh Genesis 31 this is when he parted ways with leban and isn't it interesting that when when Jacob went on his way the angels of God met him and now so so to me it's like well isn't that incredible that before because Jacob's about to go through a change he didn't realize that he just thought he's going to try and uh mend mend Bridges with Esau but in the process God's going to wrestle with and that desire that he's had in his heart for a change of life I mean to no longer be a Jacob but to be in Israel to be changed amen because everyone wrestles with their Humanity everyone everyone really doesn't like who they are necessarily right but you see so so on his way to a change the the angels of the Lord meet him and then so God changes his name from from from Jacob to Israel after this when he wrestles with the angel of the Lord and He Walks different God touches his leg and he's got to walk different and he's got a different name and to me that shows that the you know there's a body change coming amen our names being changed but there's a body change coming so the angels of God came to meet him before a body change now we've had a visitation of seven angels Mount you know on Mount Sunset what is that signifying as the brides returning back into Glory A change is coming because angels are appearing amen that God has come down upon the Earth why because the change is coming and I say praise the lord we can see that change is coming that's right amen we're living in that season that's right amen and even it would say in Psalms you know Jesus would even say in the New Testament when you know he's about to be you know um you know uh what's his name Judas has betrayed him he's in the garden and you know he tells Peter Peter I could call was it 12 Legions of Angels or however many they were encamped about him waiting just waiting for a nod one of them would have changed the whole scene but the Lord said no I've got to fulfill this part of the word this is the reason I'm here and many times we wonder Lord why don't you intervene on a case it's cuz God's got to fulfill his word I mean God's got to use you to fulfill his word it may not be nice it may be a bit it may be very difficult hard but God you you know you we think God doesn't care he does care but he's got to fulfill his word amen it say in Psalms 34:7 the angel of the Lord encamps about those that fear Him and delivers them amen so there's a there's a certain thing just like the as we read about the men uh the the um Syrian Army could see certain things but they couldn't see certain things they couldn't see now where they were when they were made blind and they couldn't see that they're on the way to Samaria but then God opened their eyes and they could see after that right now brother R would say that this is this is the condition of the uh age here he says he says they were yeah blind and naked now that is really desperate how can anyone blind and naked not know it yet it says that they are blind and naked and can't perceive it the answer is they are spiritually blind and spiritually naked do you remember when Elisha and gazi were surrounded by the army of the syrians you recall that Elisha smote them Blind by the power of God yet their eyes were wide open and they could see where they were going the blindness was peculiar and that they could see certain things but the other certain things such as Elisha and the servant in the camp of Israel they could not see what this Army um what this Army could see did not Avail for them what they did not see brought them on brought on their captivity now what does this mean to us it means exactly what it meant back there in the Earthly Ministry of Jesus he tried to teach them truth but they would not listen John 9:40 to 41 some of the Pharisees uh which were with them heard these words and they said unto them are we blind also Jesus said unto them if you were blind you should have no sin but now you say ye we see Therefore your sin remaineth he says the attitude of this age is exactly what it was then people have it all they know it all they cannot be taught so this is how you know you can see or not what's your attitude what's your attitude amen do you do you do you have an attitude well I know it all I know how the word all goes together I know how a Christian should be I know all these things and you cannot be taught see many things many times it's not doctrines we need to be taught in but it's attitudes it's how to forgive it's how to let go it's how to it's how to not try and manipulate control people all those things see see what happens to the scribes and Pharisees is they were not willing to be taught this was Messiah and their attitude was we're going to kill this guy you see and then when someone comes along to you and says well your children are this way you should do this or you know your attitude's this way you should stop being a gossip stop trying to slander people or why do you manipulate try and push me in a corner and put pressure on me and they get offended what is that that person's blind amen I know we've gone to a very serious part of the service but you see we got to realize are we teachable are we teachable I pray we are can we be adjusted well this is how I am this is how my upbringing was the New Birth changes everything amen the new birth changes everything amen it changes your attitude your personality it changes well whatever your parents did that's been destroyed in the blood of Jesus Christ in your life amen so there's no excuse to hold on to what you were or what you're raised in because God transforms his children I mean because the grace of God opens our eyes of understanding that we realize Lord I need to be changed amen so so we do not those who see do not think they have it all or know it all they want more of him amen that's that's the those who can see Lord You've Done many mighty things you've showed me many of your great Mysteries the great Treasures of your heart but Lord I want more of you amen the more you have the more you want amen hallelujah it's not like when you have a natural feast and you get stomach ache cuz you ate too much that's not the same with God no the more you eat the more you want and you don't get sick you just get happier you get more satisfied you rejoice more Hallelujah so we should never if you say you can't be taught they're wrong you get offended I say you need an isav AM and that isav is free without money or Price amen and it is an abundance amen it's in I I can't say excess but hey there's there's there's so much to go around that every single man woman and child could have this I have on their hearts and it wouldn't run out it wouldn't deplete it's just an abundance of I sa amen I say praise God that though maybe a you know like brother BR would say it's like when he was being raised and I can't put myself in his childhood you know when he was in that you know wood Log Cabin there was holes in the roof and it would snow and they had to put a tar poing over them as they slept and you know I can't put myself there but he would say when those cold mornings would come and his mom would try and wake them up you know they couldn't open their eyes they'd say they'd say Mom I can't open my eyes there's matter in in the matter in their eyes see what's the matter there's something in your eyes you see when people like gazi what was what was the matter with him he couldn't see some of you got it some of you get it tomorrow see that's why you asked the question what's the matter with you but if you can see there's no matter there we go you see Hallelujah you see but this when people are looking through a complex they're looking through a hurt they're looking through it's amazing the the anger and resentment and frustration and things that someone can build against someone just imagining them that's matter there's a big matter that needs to be removed out of that person's eyes you know cuz you can actually get it in your mind like I could get it in my mind that brother he doesn't like me I don't know how I could but it's that that crazy because the because he loves me I love him I know this is why I can use you right I could actually use anyone here but you know you see that I could get it in my the devil could twist it so much in my heart that brother he doesn't like me and I could build a complex around something that is not even real amen I'd say there's a matter that's got into my eyes then I need some eyes have of the Holy Ghost I mean to actually take that out of me that I can see no he loves me I love him we love the Lord we have all things in common amen we're we're we're brothers amen an eternal Brotherhood hallelujah amen what's that when when the Holy Ghost comes into the church you see there's a lot of cold drafts like brother BR when he was a kid there in the in the L cabin that caused a lot of matter to come into a lot of people's eyes but I think we should never let just a cold draft come in most people don't who like Sub-Zero temperatures everyday life you and you have no snow equipment and you got to live in it no there's some people who like building shelters in Alaska and things and I say they can have that I'm going to stay in the wom but you see most people will will will shut a door right there's a cold draft comes in you don't just oh that's you know when you're cold already whatever you you close it eh right you get warm you adjust your environment based on the draft to to exclude the draft right but the problem is many many times people will allow a draft to just keep blowing and it matters up their eyes it's like a thought comes in a cold draft those people don't really care that person's done this this is why this person's like this and all these negative things and you hear some stupid sulfuric acid of Gossip of hell and you let it just come in a cold draft and you know we should never murder anyone am me that you should never ever speak evil of anyone if there's something comes out of you saying that person this and how dare this and this person does this you need the Holy Ghost to come and give you a good eyes sa not just on your eyes but on your heart because that thing should stop with you say I do not want to pass this on I'm not a I'm not a skip I'm not a dump I'm not a trash can I mean you can take your trash and dump it somewhere else I'm not not interested in anything negative I just want to hear positive I want to hear God is real he's alive he can fix every situation why do we are why are we like gazis looking at the enemy when the armies of Heaven are around us all the time I mean the answer is present all the time which is him Hallelujah why do we get into that way so we should always adjust our lives a cold draft comes in we should close that door close that window how do you do that say no I'm not I'm not listening to that yes sir I'm by the fire Hallelujah and we don't have a painted fire around here in our lives we have a holy ghost burning fire amen if you ever get too much matter in your eyes you can't see clearly like you used to so for example you have such a joy when you meet the Lord the world's knew everything's great but then you just all you begin to see is the Troubles of life I say you've been standing in a draft but just like John he was standing in a draft of his own disappointments of what he thought Messiah would do but God sent some isav into the into the prison he didn't take him out of the prison he just changed John's perspective in the prison hallelujah hallelujah sometimes God will take us out sometimes God will leave us but he will open our eyes that's for sure that we can rejoice in whatever condition we find ourselves in amen so there you know so praise the Lord there's plenty of ice amen we have really just get warmed by the fire well how do you get warmed by the fire begin to look at the promises of God go through the message of the promise that God's given to you amen think about his goodness well about this person that person they're not your God they're not the one who died for you amen Jesus did like brother Bram says the blood of Jesus Christ has never given anyone a complex amen people give complexes the devil gives complexes but the blood of Jesus Christ has never given a single person a complex amen that's why you just begin to get warmed by the fire Hallelujah let's go to a few should we go to a few sir let's go to revelation hallu we could just start reading but you know amen let's go here amen let's go to let's go to uh verse 6 of Revelations 19 we could just read we could just um I don't have this on you can put it up if you want whatever you want to do you're on holiday remember at sum we appreciate everyone in the back eh we appreciate you all very much back there Revelations 19 and6 and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and the voice of many Waters the voice of a mighty thundering saying Allelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth now what caused this to come open the message yeah amen many people put the marriage up a way off in the future but but what happened is God's Prophet prayed basically Lord Open the Eyes of your bride Open the Eyes of your elected ones amen and what has the word done it's opened our eyes Amen Let us be glad see this voice of a great multitude the voice of many Waters that's you that's not just the ministry that's you right are you feeling a bit warmer you find yourself in the scripture amen as the voice of Mighty thundering saying Allelujah for the Lord God onent reth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted she should be ar raay in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is righteousness of saints well that's just about someone no that's about me that's about you I mean this message brother said the bridegroom call will come right through this amen this has called you to a union Hallelujah that you can see now the whole picture that you're not in this journey alone just trying to struggle through life no God's Got You God's Got You God's got your family amen so praise the Lord and he said unto me right blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God you're blessed am amen hallelujah you're blessed amen I trust there's a bit of fire you're blessed you say I'm going through a lot of trouble but you're blessed amen and God's blessing what God has blessed he cannot take his Blessing away amen what God has blessed remains blessed amen see the Devil's cursed he remains cursed but God's children are blessed they remain blessed amen you're blessed all the time Hallelujah he said that through balum God said through balum about Israel what I've blessed I blessed I cannot reverse it and God saw all their life all their trouble all their struggle all whatever is going on but God said no I bless those people amen they're walking with me they're here to fulfill my word they're my chosen ones Hallelujah if we can just look at ourselves realize we are God's chosen elected ones amen we're not alone in this walk but God is present hallelujah amen now let's go to let's go to verse 20 uh chapter 21 let's go to verse one I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth will passed away there's no more sea and I saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall W wipe away all their tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away amen and he said and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these are the true uh for for these words are true and faithful amen let's just let's just keep going and he said unto me it is I Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I'll give unto him that is the thirst of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I'll be his God and he shall be my son Hallelujah you know God's talking about you God's talking about you in that scripture praise the Lord hallelujah why how our eyes have come open to what is really going on completely not just world events but what's God doing he events amen now praise the Lord amen hallelujah now John would I mean sorry the Apostle now let's just go I'm going to go back up to this verse here he says because we were talking we're driving up to um Tanga for Christmas I was just we just talked briefly Chris about you know you can't I was just talking to her about the fact you you think about the grace of God you know isn't it amazing that we we we know you know our eyes have come open that we came from God we're going back to God right we were in his mind as thoughts now but but he wanted fellowship with us he knew all about us but he wanted to fellowship with us he wanted to reveal all that he was to us so he puts us in this body of time and he walks with us all through life's journey and then he takes us up into eternity again and we're on the other side of Eternity then we can fully praise him for all he's done in our lives and as we're walking with him he reveals himself he proves his word and we just love him more and more as we walk with him don't you love him more today than you did maybe last week amen then you hear about how that we're in the that that are names before anything was made the lamb was slain and and and and God took the blood of the lamb and wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life and nothing in heaven or under the Earth or anything the devil can do can take your name off the Lamb's Book of Life amen that so so by election God knew us and he didn't chose us because of good behavior but he chose us because we're his just like our children our children are our children doesn't matter what they do where they go they're ours Hallelujah they're part of us we look into their eyes we see ourselves we see our mannerisms we see our characteristics you know we see our family in them those amazing going up and seeing the family all together you know William and and uh uh Albert and R's son Matthews too it's like you could basically put a mask on them and it's like they're twins cuz they do all the same kind of things you see that's my family Hallelujah this is my son that's that's his cousin that's my nephew you can see the family come together and God when he looks at you now not your Humanity but that seat on the inside of you he sees part of himself amen so so you know we know all these things but yet there's something about the grace of God it doesn't become common to a child of God it doesn't become just something we take for granted well I'm his child and that's just it no there's something in it that it it just builds a thankfulness it builds an appr appreciation let's experience that when you think about the because you know all those things we we we we we're predestinated we're elected to sunship amen we have a new body waiting for us we have a theophany that if this body be dissolved we have one Eternal in the heavens already amen we have a New Jerusalem that we're going to live in we got eternity to enjoy we got a Rapture to take you know all that because we're part of him but did you think Lord why me and it's not a pity party Lord I'm useless why me it's a Lord why me of all the 8 billion people I think upon the Earth today why me Lord why did you find me why did you come looking for me oh because you're part of him but yet why Lord who's ever had those kind of a thoughts now that really is a nice warm fire to get close to amen that really takes the I sa and really puts it in your eyes when you think Lord why me Hallelujah and I think in eternity that will be the question we'll always have we'll never really fathom the depths of why me yeah amen that's just how I feel I think the Apostle Paul had the same kind of a same kind of a heart there he says for you've heard of my conversation in times past in the Jews religion how that beyond measure I persecuted the Church of God and wasted and profited in the Jews religion above many my equals of my in my own Nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers but when it pleased God hallelujah who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to re reveal his son in me see see but when it pleased God see we came to a season like gazi it actually pleased God to open his eyes to see the armies of Heaven are with the prophet with him amen it pleased see there came a season in our lives that it pleased God I'm going to I'm going to make myself known to that person I'm going to reveal myself I'm going to I've already sent Elijah to the earth now the message of Elijah is going to come into their lap and there's something in them it pleases me that they're going to receive it they're going to enjoy it amen they're going to become one with that word hallelujah amen see there's see grace like I think Dwight Moody when he when he read about uh from from Romans chapter 7 how Christ is Christ is we become dead to the law there's been a death more than just a divorce but there's a death from that first nature from the law and we're United with Christ he ran out on the street brother R says and the first person he says says do you know Grace and the person's prob startled said what do you mean he says the grace of God because he saw he saw how God had killed that first husband separated us from that First Union me that's why brother B said he preached a sermon an invisible Union of the Bride of you and Christ he says a Thanksgiving message where God would see we're going to see the whole picture I've been married amen I'm not married to my first age of my first birth no I've been United to the one who Resurrected I've been I've been United I've been married to Jesus Christ himself and brother B takes it further says that you were born before the foundation of world you had a you had a wedding band of unmar predestinated Grace slipped on your finger before you came to the Earth and no devil can take it off you Hallelujah I me I trust you see these things and rejoice with me amen that those things that we have been that that that first Nature's dead that first husband's dead not just put away he's been destroyed he's gone am mean we're not United with him no more we're United with the Living Word hallelujah we're been delivered amen from those things praise the Lord I'm just trying to find where I am Hallelujah you see gazi was no doubt thinking about how he could fix the situation what can we do we've got Dothan we've got soldiers but he's trying to humanly trying to deliver himself maybe in his mind thinking how can how can we get out of this situation and how many people trying to they trying to establish their own righteousness just like here uh Paul would say about you know Israel being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness amen have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God and how you know maybe gazi you know he would look at those things say how could I fix the situation and how many people think how can I be righteous before God what can I do you see but no your eyes have got to come open you need I have see this world has either gone to you know there's either the very Orthodox trict follow the ceremonies follow the Traditions you know and you've got salvation but then you've gone to the opposite end of the spectrum as stay as you are God loves you as you are doesn't matter how you anything about Holiness whatever there's no change of heart just be caught up in the music and you're saved they're all the world is trying to establish its own righteousness but to the Bride of Jesus Christ she has no righteousness of her own in own self there's nothing that we can bring to God to Merit anything it's the blood of Jesus Christ is our righteousness he is our righteousness he's our peace he's our Banner he's our defense he's our joy he is our King the only Glory we have is in him Hallelujah am me but the reason we can say that is because is have has been applied to our hearts say Lord I can see there's nothing in my hands I bring simply to Thy Thy cross I cling hallelujah praise the Lord now the Apostle Paul he said when it pleased God to separate me from my mother's womb amen and called me by his grace by his unmar favor now the Apostle Paul could he had a very different kind of a life after he met the Lord you think he's a man who knew the Bible back to front I'm just going to leave that picture up there for a while he knew the Bible back to front but then it's very different when you read the Bible when you read it and you don't know the author then you read it after you meet the author it becomes a new book even brother said when the seals came open the Bible became a new book to him amen and now the same God has come into our lives through the message of the hour right that we can read this and it becomes a new book amen that tradition is all taken away amen and now he would he would walk in his life now he knew God was with him here he is he's on the island after the Shipwreck now when you only see part of the picture you try and work out how you can save yourself but the Apostle Paul saw the Unseen realm God revealed himself all he knew was tradition but then I say that unseen realm the pillar of fire himself came down on the road to Damascus and opened his eyes gave him Isa that he could see really what was going on and then so that same God came and spoke to him when he was when there was a big tumult going on and there was a big fight you know and and and you know he's put in prison but God told him you're going to be witness in Rome also he was a witness he was going to be a witness in Rome also now God did not tell him the hardships he would go through to get to that point God doesn't tell us everything we go through right but he tells us you're going to get to a certain destination what is that destination around my Throne amen You're Going To Rule and reign with me to he that overcometh will sit in my throne even as I sat down on my father's Throne so there so we it's been revealed to us the word has revealed it to us we've got a we've got a place to sit that's right am amen because God has made us Overcomers and how do we become Overcomers we take God's word above everything else that's how you overcome you deny your feelings deny what you think deny your opinion deny your culture and you take God's word if all those things is contrary to God's word you take God's word that's how you overcome amen praise the Lord there's many other aspects to it but that's really the main thing you take God at his word that's how Jesus overcame in the desert he took he said it is has written Satan and he overcome it's the same thing with us God was showing there that the weakest of Christians can take God take God at his word and overcome in every situation amen so here is the Apostle Paul he's he's on his way to Rome he wasn't told before he got on the ship there' be a shipwreck but you see because he could see the Unseen because God was real to him when that storm came he didn't talk to the captain about how best to keep the ship afloat he didn't use his own human ability to to to to know what can I do to keep the ship afloat he went into prayer sure no doubt he would have helped when he was asked to help on the ship but his main source of strength was not his ability it wasn't the captain's ability it wasn't the sailors wasn't the boat it was the Lord God Almighty that told him you're going to Rome so his Revelation made him see something far greater than the storm around him what it made him see the fact he's going to Rome friends we're going to heaven amen we're going to heaven Hallelujah because Hallelujah I trust the Rapture is a revelation to you I'm part of it amen God has been God's grace is so great Hallelujah in spite of me and my fluster of my Humanity that doesn't even come into the equation but he saved me so much he's transformed me so well that I am in Rapture condition right now that if he that if the dead in Christ come through those doors my I'm going to be changed Hallelujah respective of what I'm facing in life what I'm going through this holiday season whatever more I am in condition right now Amen brother says if you receed the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are Rapture Ready right now Hallelujah and then he gets you know the Lord tells him that you know the ship's going to be lost no one's going to but you know that's the only thing that'll be lost the people won't be lost he gets aore he starts picking up sticks helping out making the fire then he you know then that there's that snake in the bundle bite bites him on the hand there'll be things in life that bite you you'll be helping he was helping his fellow shipwreck or whatever they're called I don't know but you know he was helping there right he was doing good he wasn't being you know self-righteous and holy and saying I'm a minister I don't need to do anything and help in any way he was he was there with everyone in the trenches right and you see he got bit by a snake there'll be things that bite you you that's right I'm sure we've all got snake bites I'm not talking about n some of us being naturally bitten by snakes probably seeing we got Africans here and so on but you see we've all been spiritually bitten by a snake right but there's something in us that's greater than whatever the devil's fangs can put in US amen why because he had a revelation in his heart just like Elijah had the Revelation the armies of Heaven are around me nothing can happen against me without God permitting it Hallelujah nothing can get me right so so Paul had the Revelation I'm going to Rome so the Shipwreck couldn't stop him amen the snake couldn't stop he just shook it off in the fire yes Hallelujah that's why it's so important you begin to feel cold and different sometimes it's a slow release of a poison of a bite you know some people say I feel so distant from God what are you feeding on you know if you're Doom scrolling you won't get Faith from Doom scrolling I guarantee you amen if you want a closer walk with God put your phone down or just read the Bible in the message on it or put on spiritual things right cuz I cuz I can guarantee you hear will not give you Faith stuff won't give you Faith it's just a bunch of stuff I me BBC CNN Fox News I don't know whatever your Instagram that gram won't let you won't cause you see man whatever platform telegram I don't know all whatever whatever it doesn't matter that won't give you faith it won't give you overcoming power it won't help you in your situation all it does is lull you off to sleep we're not a bunch of comos people around here now our eyes have come open I mean we can see Hallelujah and we see our source of strength as the Lord God Almighty Hallelujah so what he do he shook he shook the snake off in the fire you got a fire burning do you know that I trust there's the Holy Ghost fire burning in your soul Hallelujah that you can take any snake bite you begin to think on what God has done for you he did it for a purpose he didn't just do it for you and just for fun he did it for a purpose and I believe everything God does for us is has an eternal purpose he wants to prove himself to you on this side of the veil that when you get that side we can praise him now but we can praise him there amen that God is so good to us that we will never run out of things to thank him for I believe eternity will be continuous praise sure we'll do things you you know there'll be things we'll do but there in our hearts I just think of it often you know we go off and I don't know how it'll be but you know we just spent a few million years fellowshipping over this side Hallelujah and then we're like let's go see him and for some reason we choose walk cuz we used to do that you know not just travel by thought and then you see the great Lord and you see him like maybe raise his hand and wave you see those Nails God had I think he'll have those I don't know he had it in his glorified body he may have them on that side I don't know but I believe there's something about we just see him be just so that that great wave of thankfulness and appreciation and love cuz he is that great Fountain of love but I trust you know what I feel this morning Hallelujah so we're we're not going to Rome we're going to Glory so you may be bitten but you've got a fire burning you can shake it off in there amen and keep walking on with God you see we got to realize that God see every one of God's children God could not take them until God's purpose had been finished so he says and I know God could not take them he could not drown Noah in the flood until the purpose of God had been finished he could not burn up the Hebrew children until the purpose of God had been finished he could not kill job with the boils and troubles until the purpose of God had been finished neither can the Lions could the Lions Daniel until God's purpose had been finished neither could death an old age take Abraham until the purpose of God had been finished I said neither can the bride of Christ be taken out until the purpose of God has been finished nothing can stop you if you're part of his word nothing can stop you a lot of things will try but you are unstoppable you're Almighty conqueror amen you're you're undefeatable you may end up on the carpet sometimes but remember the Bible says it's not him that falls and him that gets back up you may be on the map quite a few times but it's not him that wins the battle it's him that wins the war that really matters I mean the Allies lost a lot of lot of battles in World War II but they won the war they are the victors amen what about us I've lost a lot of battles but the war it ain't over till it's over and it ain't over amen it ain't over till it's over and it and I tell you it ain't over and neither can it take you or no or can take me until the purpose of God of our life is finished so we gather from their these uh their consolation and why does God let trouble come God harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with God Amen I trust you have eyes have to see that man I'm going through a lot of trouble well God wants you really close God wants you closer than you've ever imagined in your entire life man this is the most some year I've ever had God wanted you real close this year hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Lord for the scars thank you for the trouble Lord thank you for the trials Lord Praise Lord I've gone through the ringer well he wants you real close he's not angry at you we got to realize God's Wrath and anger was poured out on our lamb that down Calvary the Judgment we should have received amen what are we just sing this morning you took my place the wrath of God had to be satisfied and what did he do he took on flesh Jehovah Hallelujah hanging between heavens and earth Jehovah tooking the own judgment of his law upon himself that we don't have to taste none of it Hallelujah so why are we scared that God's angry at us his angers was poured out that down Calvary Hallelujah we walk in fear too much we should walk in love walk in faith Walk In Joy Hallelujah we got joy unspeakable full of Glory walk on those things don't walk in fear I'm going to put a foot wrong just walk in faith amen God will direct you if you're Sensi I believe you're a sensitive people not in terms of emotionally but sensitive to his Spirit right that if we're walking in the wrong direction you say just turn left a little bit turn right a little bit stop and turn this way and we'll say yes Lord amen so don't be afraid trust him can we trust him this year I mean next year than more than we ever have I believe we can God's conditioning us to trust him more and more Hallelujah why cuz we can look at not just at the trouble but we see the armies of Heaven all the God is is around us hallelujah brother R says deity is not just in heaven but it's in you amen praise the Lord hallelujah now we're just going to wrap up this I feel like Abraham had to patiently endure after he had patiently endured he he obtained the promise right so there's going to be things we have to endure through but we can see the whole picture there's a promise right in front of you you got to realize you may be there's a lot of Road bumps before before a promise you go into a car park of a place you want to get into normally there's Road bumps hey speed bumps yep there's security gates of it's a real fancy place there's there's obstacles for you to slow down but you're about to get there okay how many people have ever gone on a plane and actually not got on the plane because the queue got too big or Customs took too long now they're not late now they're not going to miss the plane no people endure those first world problems to get on the plane to get the where they want to go to right cuz they're looking at the end end goal how about us in our everyday life you say man I'm going through some hardship brother R says that's just to test your faith so you can see what what in you amen like Abraham Abraham didn't really know who he was he thought he was a man from the childes he was the father of Faith right that's who God knew who but Abraham had to knew had to know who he really was in God same thing with us now I'm going to so I said I was going to finish I'll actually be true to my word for once he says now he says there's the 15th verse we um 15th verse we just read after he had patiently Jed he um he obtained the promise now after he had patiently endured he um he obtained the promise oh I don't know whether we're going to get down to the seventh chapter um after he patiently endured he obtained the promise can you do the same thing this morning can you set your faith and say it's thus sayith the Lord and no matter what comes or goes whether today is easy tomorrow is hard the next day uh they're teasing you the next day they're making fun of you the next day they're saying I'm crazy I Endure amen after not before he endured but after you endured he obtained the promise amen oh my there it is you see brother that shakes all the devils and everything else away see there it is and Satan comes says oh now I tell you you're just a bit worked up you might as well um be kind of reasonable about this thing say it's thus sayith the Lord Satan no matter how hard it comes what it looks like what anybody says I want to with patience not fretting persons can't have patience and fretting all the time you just have to set yourselves right there and walk right on no matter what takes place move right on so don't fret don't be stressed don't be anxious faith is not being anxious faith is not being tense that's just being tense and anxious no faith is a confidence Lord no matter what happens you've revealed it to me just like Paul I'm going to Rome I'm not sinking in the Shipwreck I'm not dying by this poison I'm going to Rome amen should be the same thing with us we it's been revealed to us we're going in the Rapture what comes and goes before that no this body's going to be changed we should not fret be anxious about nothing amen we're only Fring and anxious if we got it in our hands faith is Lord I give it to you and I actually really do come give it to you amen now let's let's um let's just come down to this point I want to come down to this point brother Bram was and and I'm going to close with this I really am brother Bram was uh speaking of when um Congressman Upshaw was healed and he's and he and he and he's speaking to him about his accident where he's well he's speaking he sees in in a vision and and then he be and and then he turns and then he and then he talks about a a a young colored girl who who was operated on little colored girl about four four years old and it paralyzed her and about that time about three times the distance of this building a typical old Aunt jamaa with them big old black fat cheeks let out a scream and she had a stretcher there she come that that was my baby uh you couldn't keep her away 16 houres couldn't stop her she was just knocking them left and right with big fat arms going I said now stop lady I said have you a prayer she said no sir I don't I don't have no prayer card I said you just come in here that but that's the doctor man that operated on my baby 2 years ago I looked down at the baby the intern or the man with the ambulance was there I said that's the baby she said will my baby get well I said auntie I don't know only thing I can do is say what I see she said I just pray God somehow your faith touched them I never seen you and the old Congressman said sir will I get well cuz he before this he just heard the vision of himself his AC and everything I said I can't tell you sir I don't know I can only say what I see if God is that close to you surely he has a purpose of it amen so many times we look at things you know we're going to think about this for a second has God not spoken our questions our conversations service after service song service after song service things we've been talking about in the cards it's literally like the whole world is bugged whever we go our phones are listening and sending and you know that's how the preacher gets their material because many times people would read this and say Lord if only I could be back there with brother Bram a vision will be seen and it'll be spoken and I'd be well I'd say the word of God is still a discerner of the thoughts and tense of the heart and that same God that was back there Hallelujah is the same God that's here this morning with us amen so so you got to realize if God can speak to your life service after service tape after tape accurately right where you are there's a purpose for it amen and many times you it's like this little girl she was paralyzed and man can paralyze one another it can be trauma it can be hurt it can be pain and many times people just see those things you know but God is not here to keep us paralyzed there is a reason that we come into the anointing of the word of the hour is that our whatever's paralyzed us will be taken from us amen so there's a reason you got to realize it's the same as a vision to me as God speaking and preaching about someone's life over and over again and there's a reason for it there's the purpose for it is that person will get out of their Affliction that's right and begin to walk with God you see Jesus would stand up Jesus would stand up in uh in Nazareth and says the spirit of law is upon me uh to preach the gospel to the poor has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to to preach Deliverance to the captives and the recovering the sight of the Blind and and set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord that anointing that was in the Messiah is a new God said all that God pulled into Christ he poured into the church right so the same anointing the same holy ghost that anointed the word there as to anoint the word here amen that that that we we are part of this now the reason I'm saying this is because what are you seeing that's right right there's a blindness in this age many people just see church and families and length of service or songs or you know all those human things that's right but can we look beyond that have we got ISF that we can see the Unseen realm where God comes down to a meeting I mean and change and wants to change Hearts that's why brother B said the question well I don't know if you'll get well but there's a purpose God has done that he's close to you if God is that close to you surely he has a purpose of it right I'll say if God is that close to you there's a purpose for it and it's not to leave us in our Affliction it's for us to get out of our affliction am me it's for us to get out where we're maybe wounded in our spirit to be healed our hearts have been broken because of trauma disappointment abuse Whatever It Is God can heal that and that's why God speaks to our hearts see you got to realize you know you sit there and say man God spoke to me there's a purpose for it God wants you to receive that by faith and get up I mean to take God at his word and step out of that Affliction you say well does those things really happen as I said has God not preached Our Lives over and over and over again amen remember our first camp we had two sisters come and their question was God if this message is you you better reveal it to me now otherwise I'm leaving and what and and but what happened is they needed isav well where did they see that isav in the body operating I me one of them asked a question Lord where are you and the voice said to her what do you see and and she looked around the congregation she said I see Jesus yeah it changed your life Hallelujah just like you know brother Armand you with your with your parents right he wasn't a gazi he tried the natural way he says Lord I got to call you on a conference and God came down we all know the testimony and then what happened in the end of that year God was speaking service after service to them dealing with them because why they got by a fire I mean they got by an anointing Hallelujah and Isa was being applied to their lives and then how did God seal it all up on the last night they were there where you know Hera was going to get baptized and kba said I'm not going to get baptized and you know but God spoke to him through a 2-year-old Lilia who couldn't even speak where where where she got up cuz remember the spirit of the Lord is upon us to heal to sit at Liberty them that are bruised what is a religious prison yeah it's a bruise can be but but it's something that contains people he was in a religious prison I'm sure he wouldn't mind me saying that right but he used a little two-year-old girl probably not even that age you know come up and point to the Bible as I was you know reading from Romans chapter 6 and go to him then take a little toy mask and give it to him and he broke down he said the Lord told me to obey his word and take off the religious mask that's right he's a different man and how many other testimonies do we have of those kind of things what's happening because God's anointing is here see we're going to look beyond what we see and really realize I mean I know you do thank you Lord but if we could just real lord I just like Lord may your realm become more real than what I see here than the natural may may Faith be so great that all I see is your word your promises in spite of whatever I'm going through not to put blinkers on but just to have everything in perspec of God you're more than able and you're present sir hallelujah how many other how many other um testimonies could we share like that but God's still God that's right God has brought the message of the hour to open our eyes we have eyes sa it doesn't make us proud doesn't make us arrogant makes us thankful that's what say when you realize when the grace of God has come into your life yeah you think Lord you found me you came looking for me I wasn't looking for you I was running in the other direction you found me there is a purpose for it that's right well I've got to be in a certain Church certain condition for for for you to heal up the Brokenhearted you to work no this is this is not really church we say we're going to church no the believer is the church We Gather we worship but God doesn't just like come in here then we leave and he's not with us that's right he's with us wherever you go where Elisha was in Dothan the Angels weren't just around Dothan they with Elisha wherever he went wherever the bride goes the angels of God are there and God himself is within her amen hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord I think I think we'll just we'll just finished there I say you say well I can't see I got a bit of matter just warm by the fire in conclusion look into the promises God has given you every promise in this book God God could literally written your name and said it's yours it's for you and I've purchased the ability for you to have it by my blood right look into his promises go back into your testimony you say well God hasn't done much has he called you has he spoken to your heart you don't have to go into the world to have a testimony to me a testimony is someone who's raised in church God lights the fire god becomes real and they just go steadfast on that's an incredible testimony that they overcame religious pride and all those kind of things I said Lord Your Grace found me in a Pew I say thank you Lord I'm going to walk on for all my days and you're going to take me into a Rapture why cuz there is a purpose for it all amen let's have the musicians please amen praise the Lord hallelujah I just love him this morning amen amen praise the Lord let's stand and um I want to I want to sing um I want to sing I've been touched by your fire I've been touched by his fire and I want to sing um I have a reason to worship amen praise the Lord amen I trust you I trust you're happy today
