one person at a time on the trampoline um there were a couple of kids that thought that because they were under 100 kilos that they could both be on there but we risk things like injuries and head

evening and um you know many of you come from we all come from different walks of life and our experience to get to the camp was you know it's all different some people live nearby some people travel a long way some people uh have been looking forward to this all year other people maybe it was the last minute to ision just to come and and some maybe didn't want to come and are nervous and and even you know not sure about God or just anything like that and and but I just I've just I want to the next few songs I want to sing are an expression of the heart of God to each one of us you know if there's anyone here that's unsure about God I can let you know that he's a good God that we serve a good God and that he he loves us and his heart is for us you I was looking at a there was a little meme it said um a picture it said you know thanking our heavenly father for whatever it is that we can thank him for and someone had commented there you know I thank my heavenly father for life and things like that and and my cousin actually of all people my cousin wrote a comment there and he said in the words of Slayer God hates us all and I thought you know that's a lie that's not the truth that Slayer is some death metal band that's not the truth he didn't he got that information from the wrong place because the God I know is not willing that anyone should perish but that all should come to the knowledge of the truth and and that's the god that we we come to this morning so I just want to sing these few songs if you're weary or anything like that just open up your heart God can

said all seven seals are open he said it's a seven course Feast for those who will come and dine and I don't know about you tonight but I don't want to be like those in the Bible that found excuses amen not to come Feast at the table amen I know tonight we may come here and it's the first night of the meeting and amen I know there's always that element of tiredness and amen but I know tonight the Lord has something special for us and amen we know that wherever two or three are gathered together he made a promise he said there I will come and be in their midst and you know tonight I was just hearing the prophet of God say it today he said you know he said it's not how many's there he said it's the attitude of the two or three that are there and you know tonight there's a whole house full of Believers here amen but if we have the wrong attitude there won't be one promise come to pass amen but if we can all find that right mental attitude amen then all things are possible tonight and I wonder before we open the word if we could just buy our hearts together for word of prayer as they just play that softly tonight I know as we said this is the first night of the meeting how many's come here with an expectation something you're Desiring from the Lord amen I know he will meet your expectation tonight let's just approach him Heavenly Father Lord As We Gather here this afternoon on this first night of these meetings Lord Believers have gathered here from different walks of life different areas Lord different parts of the world different parts of this country Lord but father we've come here for one motive and one objective and that is to lift up the name that is above every name for lord your word said if I be lifted up I will draw all men into myself and Lord we know there's no name given in Heaven and Earth whereby men might be saved but at the name of Jesus and Lord we know the devil hates that name the world hates that name Lord they've done everything they can to kill the influence of that name but Lord your word prophesied that you would raise up a people for that name's sake and Lord standing before me tonight as a group of people that you've raised up for the name of Jesus and Lord As We Gather here tonight we just want to speak the name of Jesus over every heart the name of Jesus over every life over every situation Lord you see the needs here that's represented Lord maybe some would think their need is so great that Lord nothing could happen that would help them maybe some would think their need was insignificant but Lord we know tonight there's no need too great there's no need too small but Lord when your spirit begins to move the spirit of God Lord will move upon the face of the conditions and will bring a transformation father We join our hearts together tonight we lay aside tiredness oh God lord we lay aside the cares of life and the situations oh God and Lord bring us into one mind and one Accord under great expectation Lord father I believe there's events that are going to transpire here this weekend Lord where lives will never be the same again oh God Lord I rebuke every Spirit of the enemy Lord we bind the hand of Satan Lord may your anointing just take over these meetings in a supernatural way Lord if there be an empty vessel here oh God I pray you would fill them with the Holy Ghost and Fire there be one growing cold on you I pray oh God that a coal of fire would come up off the Altar and touch the lips of your servant Lord father I pray you would just reveal yourself to us Lord now move Among Us in a special way and we'll be sure to give the all the praise and all the honor honor and all the glory in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen God Rich you bless you all tonight it is a real honor to be here with you and we want to bring a greetings tonight from our pastor there brother Matt Morris the church there back home Grace Tabernacle there in Arkansas we bring you greetings from them tonight and it is a real honor to be here with brother Ben and shakana uh Tabernacle here once again it's been a few days since we've seen many of you all but it is a real honor to be back here and I do want to say I apologize that we were unable to be here last year uh we were scheduled to come and uh had already made plans and was headed to the airport to fly over here and we got word that brother Donnie Reagan's daughter sister Erica had passed away and at that time I just didn't feel to leave the country but I know amen the Lord had uh Jehovah Gyra had somebody in the wings and I know you all were greatly blessed by Brother Isaac and his ministry we sure appreciate brother Isaac and his stand for this word and it is a real honor though to be here this year and all the pastors and ministers we say God bless you all amen we thank you for coming and taking time away from your busy schedules to support these meetings and how many how many is under great expectation of what the Lord is going to do amen I know that whenever Believers get together something good always happens amen and we want to say it is an honor to be here tonight and appreciate the invitation to brother Ben and the opportunity speak with brother Chris God bless you it's our first time to meet in person amen so we're looking forward to the word of the Lord for my brother and I know it's the first night tonight so we want to go straight to the word if you have your Bibles we want to go to the book of St Luke the 16th chapter we have a few places we want to read tonight we're going to begin in St Luke 16 and then also Philippians 3 and 2 Corinthians chapter 4 amen amen you love the Lord tonight amen in St Luke chapter 16 in verse number 16 Jesus here is speaking and he says now the law and the prophets were un John and since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth into it so there is a preaching and there is a pressing the kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth into it now in the book of Philippians chapter 3 Philippians chapter 3 I want to read a a very familiar reading there in Philippians chapter 3 and verse number 13 Philippians 3 and verse number 13 Paul here writing he says now Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before so Paul is saying there are some things behind us but really they're worth forgetting and moving forward to what's in front of us now watch what he says I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus so he's going to have to press forward into what God has in front of him now one other place I want to look with you is in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 uh We've read here in Luke 16 where the Bible tells us that we press Philippians chapter 3 we read about pressing I want to identify here in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 13 the way that we press Paul here writing says we having the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken now we also believe and therefore we speak you say how do we pray press well the way we press is we believe the things that are spoken and then we begin to say the things that have already been said and by saying those things we press forward now I want to read Verse 18 in 2 Corinthians 4:13 down to the 18th verse Paul says now while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here uh this afternoon I want you by the help of the Lord for just a few moments tonight if I would title this sermon I want to talk to you on this pressing by faith into the realities of the Unseen pressing by faith into the realities of the Unseen now uh we look there at that word press and of course Webster will Define it he says now to press means to move or to call calls to move into a position of contact with someone or something by exerting continuous physical Force so when something actually uh is pressing you're actually moving into a position of contact now we all know the prophet of God would tell us that the most powerful force Amen on the face of the earth is a Believer who is in contact with his maker now just to lay a foundation here I want to read a couple quotes beginning here in 1949 n brother speaking upon the subject of Science and I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision he said and I just thinking of how that science how they are taking the natural man and how he's went into the research from the fall of the natural and what he has done and how little the spiritual man has progressed in the kingdom of God he said I was thinking that the natural man went out at the Unseen of his eye and he pulled an adom down out of the sky and split that atom in two and see that destroys human life now if the natural man that knows nothing of God and cannot know nothing of God except he be converted then his soul becomes alive with the supernatural if he could do that in the natural realm amen then what ought the man of God to be doing he said my friends the church is so far behind he said let's pray my that God Amen will move his church up see the natural man with the natural resource is getting greater results than people amen are that calls thems Christian he says let's press into the Unseen amen let's press into the Unseen he said the blessings are yours amen they are there for you I think it's a powerful thing that a prophet amen has come among the church and he has identified amen where the blessings are he says see the blessings are not in the visible realm amen but they are in the Unseen he said see the blessings are are there now in 1950 uh looking at the Unseen he said now we look at the Unseen amen and believe that those things which are unseen amen but spoke of by God become realities amen we look at the Unseen and we believe that those things amen which are unseen but spoke of by God Amen those things become realities now I believe the time has come as Believers amen I believe the time has come to press I don't believe it's time Amen to lay down or to back up or to give in to the devil I believe if there's ever been a time to press amen now is the time to press now when I say press I don't mean go to the back or to the left or to the right amen but I believe it's time to press forward see brother so we all have to work together as one unit we have to get our differences away and lay aside our doctrines and things and put our arms together and press forward amen and take the promise that God Almighty has given us now amen I don't know about you but I believe we have been given promises amen and I know the devil don't want you to possess those promises amen your flesh don't want you to possess those promises amen but we are under a Divine Commission of almighty God Amen to possess those Divine promises brother said a man amen that is commissioned of God Amen he looks upward and onward amen you don't have to care what the world say says about it anyhow amen he's not listening to the world he's got a Divine commission from God and he is enjoying that presence amen I believe that we are enjoying amen the presence of Jesus Christ we are enjoying amen the company of the Holy Ghost now amen I believe that there is more than just a feeling Among Us I believe there's more amen than just a sensation or an emotion amen but I believe the Holy Ghost of God Has Come among the church amen and when he comes Among Us he's doing more than just exciting us amen he's doing more than just making us feel good amen but the Holy Ghost is actually making us perseverance now you all know what perseverance means it means to be persistant Amen to make a goal brother said a man that's ever amounted to anything at any time through any age has been men who believed in God and they had faith in God and they stood against the enemy on every side amen and they were perseverant because they believed in God he said therefore I believe every Christian amen should be very perseverant listen I don't think this is the hour Amen to become casual with the devil I don't believe this is the hour to step aside amen and just put on a pair of gloves and try to handle the devil I believe if there's ever been a time for Christians Amen to take a stand upon the word of God Amen now is the time to stand listen it's time to stand against the devil it's time to stand against the world listen as long as a Christian can know that he's living above sin and the Holy Spirit is blessing him and is standing with him amen then be perseverant amen and press towards the mark of the High Calling amen Christians should be very perseverant Amen in their claims to God Amen stay with it amen I don't know about you but I didn't come down here amen just to for a social Gathering or amen just to see who showed up and who didn't amen but we come here to do business with God Amen and I'll say this amen we are not amen of those who pull back amen but we are perseverant Christians we will not lay down to the devil we will not back up to the spirits of unbelief we have been anointed by the message of the hour Amen to move into all that God has for us amen I want to say this we're not just pressing amen toward something we are pressing towards an identified something that is the mark of the High Calling brother B said as Paul said I could stand quoting again amen forgetting those things that are in the past amen now I press towards the mark amen the High Calling are you'all ready for this Amen to the complete identification when all time will fade out into eternity amen when Jesus comes listen we are not just pressing towards justification we're not just pressing towards sanctification we're not even just pressing towards the baptism amen of the Holy Ghost but a prophet has come among the church and he has said justification made way for sanctification which made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost has made way amen for the word itself to return listen this is not a church bride this is not a hybrid bride we are a word bride who has been birthed from the genes of the word of God listen we are more than just church members we are more than just citizens of a country hey but we have come from God and there is a jean seed in our soul and that seed is calling for a full identification of a full Son of God listen we're not going to have a rearview mirror Fair amen a rearview mirror only looks back amen and sees where you have been he said but we are looking forward Amen to see where we are going my my goodness we're not looking back to see where we have been we're looking forward to see where we're going don't look through a rearview mirror amen 40 years ago amen look what is tonight amen look what the scriptures is promising tonight he did promise them in that day amen but we're living on above there now amen we're going on hey I don't know about you amen but I think it's time to go on I think it's time to go on to perfection I think it's time to go on to Victory I think it's time to go on to the Rapture I think it's time to go on to the resurrection it's ain't the time to lay down and go backwards it's the time to go forward hey we are pressing into the Fulfillment of scriptural promises now I know this is a Revival amen a Revival meetings and sometimes amen the prophet of God said amen we got to press to get into Revival he said I'm not satisfied see I want to see the spirit of God moving children look how many believes I love you he said you know I'm not scolding you amen but you got too much Hollywood around here he said you got too much fashion to the world you got too much care amen break out of that we need a Revival he said you need God people you need to wake up we're at the end of the road amen judgment is here listen if there's ever been a time Amen to break out a tradition Amen to break out of formalisms Amen to break out of ideas and dogmas and Creeds I say now is the time Amen to break out of everything the devil has tried to bury the church under my goodness hey the prophet of God said we need a Revival now if we're if we are a generation who has been promised to Revival then we are not a generation that is going backwards amen but we are advancing and you know the only way we can advance is to press yes amen you know the only way you can advance is to press amen because there's going to be times you don't feel like going forward amen but you got to press on a have you ever been there amen if you ever if you some of y'all was on a trip here amen listen amen when did you get the tiredest brother 30y right before you is about 30 minutes away amen that old that old sleepy Spirit got on you amen and you ready to pull over and take a nap amen or just go somewhere else amen but see something rose up in you and it caused you to begin to press listen friends we are closer to the Rapture now than we've ever been before amen and people are turning around amen they're laying down their swords amen they're backing off of the message of the hour I say oh Church of the Living God arise and shine thy light has come if there's ever been a time to press against the devil if there's ever been a time to press against Leota hey Now's the Time to do it anden the law and the prophets were until John amen but since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth into it look at this word pressive it means to use and to apply Force Paul says in 1 Corinthians 9 and verse 26 he says I therefore so run amen not as uncertainly he said so fight I amen not as one that Beth the air now I want to say this we're not fighting amen Flesh and Blood amen but we are fighting spirits and principalities Amen in Demons of Darkness amen but the prophet of God said every man presses into it in desperations he uses Luke 16 and he said not just simply walks into it easily amen but it's got to be pressed into listen the devil's not going to step aside and say come on into your healing and come on into your deliverance and come on into your salvation listen you're going to have to apply some Force against that devil and say I refuse Amen to come up to the Border amen of the Divine Promises of God and then back off because of some Spirit my desperation it causes you to press now when brother R preaches desperation he's not preaching a fearful or begging desperation he's preaching a desperation amen that comes with a sense of urgency he says there in paragraph 102 of desperation he said the law and the prophets were until John he said but see since then amen the kingdom of Heaven's been preached amen and Men press into it he said you don't just stand around and say pick me up by the collar Lord and push me in no you press into it you get desperate it's between life and death listen I don't know about you but we'll never have a meeting amen until we get desperate enough to have a meeting know what I'm talking about amen you you'll never have a breakthrough until you get desperate enough to have a breakthrough in the message desperations comes along there and he opens his sermon in prayer and he says this he says I want to speak tonight on giving them courage Amen to encourage them to take that god-given rights see they have a right to defeat the Devil he is already defeated and he's just bluffing them but I'm claiming them Father now listen to The Prophet now help me to speak the word see you speak through me Lord with this few notes that I got wrote down here and little scriptures wrote out amen and I pray that you'll help me Lord and get in the word amen and give them faith for the glory of God so a prophet was identifying amen the way faith comes into the church amen is by the word of God listen our music is wonderful but music won't do it amen emotions are wonderful amen but emotions won't do it the only thing that will defeat the Devil is the word of God I say the word of God will defeat the Devil anywhere anytime any place under any condition listen I say tonight oh God come down in our midst amen and give us Faith Lord amen give us courage listen I pray tonight the Holy Ghost will so move across your heart and will Quicken a revelation in your soul listen the devil's already defeated amen the devil's already a bluff amen the word has already defeated the devil then I pray tonight courage amen will come into every heart it'll come into every life amen to rise up and accept the challenge and say devil You' stood before me long enough you stood before my family long enough you stood before my church long enough you stood before my children long enough I have been anointed by the promise of the word to move into every Divine promise of God Hebrews 11:1 amen Hallelujah I know it's the first night but I feel like preaching it's time to move Church it ain't time to back up it ain't time to lay down it's time to put on our marching shoes let's go forward hey let's go into every Divine promise that God has given the church in Hebrews 11:1 Paul says now Faith is the substance amen of things hope for it's the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it amen the Elder has obtained a good report listen at Paul verse three through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear brother comes along in 1950 he says believest Thou this he said now you testify of the things you do not see faith is the substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of things you do not see see and we look at the Unseen church that's almost what is an oxymoron amen that we look at the things we do not see an unpardonable sin 54 he said faith is something that's born in you it's something that God gives you super sign 1961 he said faith is Supernatural amen and it does Supernatural things Blasphemous name 62 he said now coming from the holy Spirit what is come then he will give to you Supernatural Faith amen spiritual faith that here at the bottom then that spiritual Faith recognizes only the word no matter what anybody else says it don't do no good amen that only knows the word if somebody say the days of Miracles has passed that Faith only knows the word somebody says there's no such a thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that Faith only knows the word see that's real spiritual faith it only knows the word no wonder a prophet would invite the holy spirit amen to the platform to anoint him to preach the word to bring a courage upon a Joshua generation Hey listen we don't have just church Faith we don't just have human Faith but we have been taken back Amen to the stature of a perfect man where there was a foundation laid and the the foundation was not feelings the foundation was not sensation but the foundation was the faith of Jesus Christ listen and Jude come along and said contend for the faith of Jesus Christ listen I tell you what it take this meeting into an atmosphere where all things are possible amen is the faith of Jesus Christ in the flesh of a redeemed believer who believes that God Is Bigger and God is greater and God is stronger listen I don't know what your mountain is I don't I know what your Valley is I don't know what the walls of Jericho for you are but I know God and I know if he's the same yesterday today and forever when faith comes into the building it will begin to encourage somebody to say devil your days are over yes sir I love how the prophet moves there in 1963 he says now we want to speak upon Faith he says and a different type of Faith a perfect faith my goodness amen now Faith we told in the Bible amen that Faith cometh by here listen you cannot be saved without faith and faith is something that you have to believe that it's there that really nothing else will declare it's there but Faith see listen if you're waiting on your five senses Amen to declare the realities of God it'll never happen amen if you're waiting on your five inner senses to declare the realities of God it'll never happen the only way we can have a meeting is to break out of the five outer senses and the five inner senses and move over into the Super sense which is Faith and when you begin to believe by faith your faith will declare things that you don't see you don't feel you don't smell you don't remember you don't reason oh Church of the Living God listen hey I might as well preach I come all the way down here it's time to break out of the five senses and step over into the jurisdiction of the faith of Jesus Christ listen hey I believe that prodical can come home but sometimes your sense of sight won't declare it amen I believe that while I'm preaching cancers can leave bodies but sometimes your feelings won't declare it but there's one thing that will declare it that is the faith of Jesus Christ and when that Faith begins to operate and a son of God begins to exercise by that Faith something begins to happen what is Faith amen what is Faith I love what the prodag God says 1964 he says it's an unseen force my goodness brother Ben faith is an unseen Force see it's a spirit and the Holy Spirit brings faith faith is an unseen force your feelings are not an unseen force your smell is not an unseen Force but faith is an unseen Force faith will move Things That You Don't See possible to move now faith is the evidence I love what Paul says it's the evidence of Things Not Seen Hebrews 11:7 Paul comes along and writes about Noah he says by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet my goodness he moved with fear and prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and become an air of the righteousness which is by faith listen abrah rather Noah amen I've been studing on Hebrews 11 so I might preach it all right now amen Hebrews 11 Noah amen moved by faith and prepared an ark when he didn't see one raindrop when he didn't see one cloud in the sky listen but his faith had Rose to a level to believe if God said it I may not see it yet but it's going to happen oh Church of the Living God you know what that I'm getting ahead of myself amen Paul said Things Not Seen if you look in the Amplified Bible that translates to events not yet seen or happened so there are events that's going to take place that the only thing will declare they're going to take place is Faith there are events brother Andrew that are going to take place but the only thing that will declare it is Faith listen friends I know there's going to be a rapture but my flesh don't declare it I know there's going to be a body change but my sens of feeling it don't declare it but because I am a Seed of Abraham I have got Abraham's faith I have been called Amen to call things that are not as though they are and things that are as though they are not brother said Noah waited and he believed and moved with fear and he built an ark he said don't criticize why that old fellas must have been crazy yet no clouds had ever come before there was a cloud before there was a drop of water in the skies amen Noah with the Unseen of the natural eye with this spiritual eye he tuned to the word of God my goodness Noah got in tune with the word of God and he seen the rain falling did I read that right he seen the rain falling before one cloud ever formed in the sky before one drop ever began to fall listen before the ark was ever finished Noah's Faith declared there's a rain coming oh he says if we tonight in this angelous Temple could so tune our hearts amen not our literal mind let it go and cast down reason but with our heart could tune it to the word of God to see a Revival Break Forth to see the altars full to see the church packed to see the Revival spreading through Los Angeles listen a fire that cannot be put out our heart would begin to pulsate under the power of the Holy Ghost there would be such a prayer meeting over Los Angeles tonight if it happened listen when the church is in tune what if the people here tonight that sick would begin to think God is God if he isn't then why serve him if he's still God he's still a Healer if he's almighty God he can do all things and if he made a promise he can't break it he has to keep it then that pulsation begins to rise in your heart something's going to take place there could be nothing stop it Hallelujah did y'all hear me listen amen there could be nothing stop it so your senses can't stop it your feelings can't stop it your emotions can't stop it when the faith of God drops in the heart of a Believer they begin to move with fear for the preparing of this rain that's coming listen Noah got ready for a natural rain that was bringing a destruction but I come here tonight to say there's a rain and it's a harvest rain it's a latter rain it's a rain that'll bring a refreshing from the presence of God listen I don't see a cloud I don't see a rainstorm but I have a message and that message says there's a rain that'll fall in the last days yes sir there could be nothing stop it it's a fire like a building on fire in a windy day it'll just keep blowing as the Holy Spirit fans the fire and it keeps burning are y'all ready for this it keeps burning turning until it becomes a reality to you so it don't even have to become a reality to your neighbor but if it becomes a reality to you it don't matter what anybody else thinks see what is it it's the word of faith now Paul comes along in Romans 10:8 he says but what saith it the word is n thee it is even in thy mouth and in myy heart that is the word of faith which we preach look at this word preach it means to Proclaim openly or publish something which has been done with the intent to be done again so when a preacher begins to preach they begin to say listen he's done it before he can do it again they begin to declare to you that there is a pulsation of faith in their heart that believes he's not just the god of the Old Testament he's not just the god of I was or the I will be but there's something in the heart of a believer that begins to testify he is the I am he is the I am and he's right here present now brother said I must preach the kingdom of God he says I must preach the truth regardless of how it hurts or what it hurts now let me just say this we must preach amen the word of faith when Paul writes to Timothy he says these three words he says preach the word be instant in season out of season you reprove rebuke exhort with all long suffering and Doctrine comes along in present stage of my Ministry he says that's the reason I would not talate with any of these Creeds and denominations is because I have been commissioned of God to stay with the word he said I love to see God heal his children certainly don't get me wrong but there's one thing I've been noticing I've been trying everywhere I go when I get an invitation is to press in to preach just a little bit I've let down on my preaching and it's too much on just the anointing and working on the Eternal part of the supernatural rather when to see Visions he said they're wonderful and I thank God for it listen the the Visions are wonderful he said and I thank God for it he said but yet the preaching of the word is a million miles beyond that when I see the lame walk and the blind see I love this deceived Church by the world he says the success of the church it lies within the preaching of the Gospel of the power of God and the demonstration of the spirit so our success does not lie in our programs it does not lie in our buildings it does not lie in what we can come up with in our minds but the success of the church is laying within the preaching of the Gospel then the Bible says that God sent his word amen by anointed preachers in Romans 10:14 how then shall they call on him in whom they've not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the three to them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah saith Lord who hath believed I report now somebody say well I don't have faith thank you for telling me here it is so then Faith cometh hello Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God somebody say I ain't got no faith well listen Faith cometh come on I don't know a better way to start these meetings off than to tell you this Faith cometh church and it cometh by the hearing of the word of God spoken words Original Seed you can only serve God on Earth as God's servants that sent on Earth by divine inspiration interprets the word to you remember said a few years ago when the Holy Ghost before it came the church began to get formal back in the days of Methodist and you people cried to God for deliverance and God sent down the baptism of the spirit now since then people has been liberated from their sins by receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost now those who do not believe in it they cannot receive it you've got to to believe in it are y'all ready for this therefore he sent anointed preachers to preach the word and you received it listen Christ does not anoint ministers to preach the gospel just to have it returned back to him void but he expects you to receive the word listen when God sends a man behind a pullit that's not for a preacher's ego that's not an occupation or a job that's because the word of God has got an intended purpose and it's got an intended effect and God will raise up somebody who will stand behind the pit and they will take off the gloves they don't care who it hurts they don't care what it hurts they have been called to preach the word and by the preaching of the word it is encouraging the Believers to defeat the Devil who is already defeated you know what I say I say we've been taught that we get what we expect you know what I believe that works for God is what I believe that God Amen gets what he expects you know what I believe I believe as he sends the word you receive the word and you become the word as you hear the word faith cometh to your heart and as Faith cometh you hear the word receive the word and you become the word amen how can I talk about preaching and not speak of Jesus last commission and the final words that fell from his lips in Mark 16 when he said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth that is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe here it is in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them listen they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover listen that's not the words of a man that's the words of Jesus listen I refuse to back up to some devil that don't want to see somebody get help in the house but I might as well preach I'm all the way down here amen I know it's got to a time where we spend more time arguing about what we should have and what we should do than just doing it y'all know what I'm talking about amen God spend 20 years arguing should there be a prayer line should there not should there be altar calls should there not should we lay hands on should we not listen I remember when I started preaching amen a few years ago I started preaching I was 13 I remember the word of God breaking open to me in the realities of the message and I was just looking for a pull pit amen anybody invited me I was just looking to stand there and say the third pull is in the bride and the Seven Seals open and the MDC has returned listen I remember when they used to argue about the third pull being in the bride and the Seven seal being open but do you see what we've done now we argue about should we shout or not should we we dance or not should we have prayer lines or not should we have altar oh come on sir you know what I say I say go ahead and Shout a little bit and have a prayer line and make the devil uncomfortable and bring the power of the word back in the church listen I refuse to back up to the devil and let some ungodly formal ritualistic devil crawl up out of the pits of hell and invade our message churches we are not a lukewarm hibiz bride we are an invincible Army we have received the opening of Seven Seals the word has returned to the church there is a fire and it's a holy fire it's a consuming fire and it's a fire that'll burn every devil out now let me just go ahead and bump that devil again why are we arguing about helping people I don't care if they get helped by a prayer line or hands laid on them or the word being preached to them or an altar call let's just help the people of God well I don't think there ought to be emotion amen well let me just say this amen obviously the devil's convinced you that we shouldn't be excited about the message of the hour but you're looking at one preacher who refuses to lay down and not come to my complete identification somebody say well amen that Devil's CW in the churches and craw in homes and you know what that come on we might as well preach Devil's you know where we've come to we've come to now where the devil's trying to take away the rightous to preach the gospel for the first time we finally have something to say and the devil says set all the preachers down and just put a tape player in the pullit and just press play well can I tell you what that is that is a coward Spirit from the pits of hell you say can you prove it I can it's a lot easier to put a tape in the pull pit and let brother Brandon preach against makeup and let brother Brandon preach against High heill shoes and let brother Brandon preach against the way we dress but you know what I say I say if I believe his message then God give me the courage to stand behind the pullit and take the gloves off and say what a prophet said we ain't a bunch of cowards we're end time Believers we're Eagles of God we have been anointed for this hour Devils come in and start pushing and pushing and don't lay hands on the sick and amen and they oh god well let me just preach but let me say what the part of God said he said the preaching of the Gospel is the casting out of the devil so no wonder the devil don't want preaching because when you begin to preach it begins to kick him out no wonder the devil wants to shut all of our preachers down but you know what I say preachers I say preach I say preach until the Holy Ghost Falls I say preach until the devil's back up I say preach until Liberty breaks out in the house of God and people can believe God again it's only a devil but a Prophet come along and he said God has given me the authority to break the power of Satan another place you give us the divine power to break the power of Satan over this life in the name of Jesus Christ see the battle we are in is a spiritual battle it's spirits that don't want you to move into a complete identification of an overcome but can I tell you tonight you're not the overcome you're the Overcomers now brother B comes and believe in God he says now the only thing that kept me from being saved when I was 12 years old was because a spirit hung over me and he says it was a devil that said wait a little while longer he said there's not a man that's got his right mind but what wants to do right see but there's something that won't let you do right is that right he said that's the devil but he commissioned his church to cast them Devils out there you are in my name they shall cast out Devils you ain't going to heal anybody you're going to cast The Devil away from them so they can accept the healing I've already done listen to brother bram's words preachers they stood on the platform and they preached the gospel and devil scattered then the man come the altar under conviction and said I want to get saved the preacher never saved the man he cast out the devil and the man got saved and accepted his salvation you see the same thing by Divine Healing you sick people here this morning believe and have been born again and are Sons and Daughters of God Christ has already healed you listen Church the only thing that keeps you from being well this morning is a spirit hanging over you that won't let you fully go out yonder and believe God's promise that he's done it now I'm preaching to you now that's what hinders the services it's not your husband it's not your wife it's not the song leader it's not the Deacon it's a spirit that hangs over the church listen it's a devil trying to stop you from breaking out of the depression and breaking out of the nervousness and breaking out of the confusion it's a spirit and Spirits are real he said but here's my commission he said that's what God gave me it's what he give every gospel preacher who will believe him the power and the authority to break that Spirit Well I might as well say it the devil showed up for camp this year the devil showed up for camp and he's already trying to hang over you he's already trying to tell you it ain't for you and the preacher's too loud and the preachers too emotional and the preachers to this and the song leaders to that come on you know what I'm talking about amen but but it's a spirit hanging over you it's a spirit hanging over this meeting but I want to dedicate this quote to the devil I believe with all my heart that every demon power that's in here at this minute is already broken hu it's already broken you say preacher it's going to be broken no it's already broken whatever Devil's trying to bind you is already broken so faith is coming to the word and the word word is coming to the bride and she's receiving Courage the devil's already broken see that's the matter the devil has broke away from you he has to because Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God the word of God made manifest see Faith doesn't wait Faith takes God's word for what it says and starts rejoicing see that's why we're not a Pentecostalism bride right we don't wait for the service to get righteous out we go ahead and praise God we don't wait for the music to get good and hot and the drums and the guitar listen when the word drops in our soul we start rejoicing on the promise of the word of God he said you're wanting a Revival then start watering the word the promise if you want to come out of that wheelchair then start watering the word if you want to come from that cancer then start watering the word you say water the word amen the watering of the word is the Praises of God and it makes the word grow listen friends you say preacher how do we water the word well let me say what a prophet said he said by the watering of the word is the punctuating in the word with an amen when you say Amen it is equivalent to getting a water hose and Watering your flowers when you say Amen it is the equivalent to water in your garden oh Church of the Living God I say Jesus Christ is alive and well somebody ought to say amen I say the message of the hour is the absolute to this generation somebody ought to say amen I say William brandham was a prophet somebody ought to say amen I say every devil is defeated somebody ought to say amen I say the Holy Ghost is the Dynamics of the church and it will be a refilling I say amen I say amen I say Amen until ever devil backs up and the power of the Holy Ghost comes in the church I say Amen to the word I don't need music I just say [Applause] amen glory glory I don't need drums I just say Amen I'm a [Applause] Believer you say preacher that word amen's p costal know it's Bible under the angel of the Church of Le ofans right these things saith sath the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God Church age book thus saith the amen are you ready for this Jesus is the amen of God Jesus is the soul Let It Be of God are y'all ready for this amen stands for finality it stands for approval it stands for prevailing promise it stands for unchanging promise it stands for the Seal of God when you say Amen you're saying devil the word of God will prevail over you you know what I say I say we got a we got a guy running for president right now in America and his whole campaign is make America great again well you know what my campaign is make amen's great again bring back the word amen to the house of God oh I feel that devil pushing against me it's a dangerous spot I got a sword amen is not Pentecostalism it's the amen of God nowhere in the Bible does it say when the priest got done reading the word that everybody nodded or they smiled or they give him a thumbs up or they shook his hand the Bible says they all with one Accord they all said amen well Church of the Living God I say bring back amens in the house of God till every promise of God receives a seal of God upon it in your heart preacher says you're healed just go ahead and say Amen preacher says you're delivered just go ahead and say Amen it don't matter how you feel it don't matter what the devil's working against your flesh if the word of God is in your soul there is an amen in your soul and there's a place to go in god until that amen brings the unseen reality before you you say preacher that's work up no it's a believ in God you say that's a bunch of nonsense no amen it's called praising God and let me just tell that devil the praise of the Bride of Jesus Christ is different our praise is different we don't wait for the promise to be manifested to praise we don't wait for one physical evidence to begin to believe it's our promise but the very minut the word of God Amen drops into our soul we forget those things that are behind us and we begin to say amen and press Forward Unto every Divine promise that God has called us to yes sir listen the praise of the Bride is on the promise of the coming manifestation I love this quote so what is the evidence of your healing when you believe it no matter what takes place you say I don't feel better that don't have nothing to do with it you've got the purchase power you believe it now I know the devil's tried to take the dance out of the house of God but I asked that Devil by what Authority did you take praising God the dance out of the church my Bible says praise ye the Lord in a dance now listen friend somebody say well then that's just a bunch of emotion well let me just say what a said he said don't have nothing to do with it you got the purchase power so just start dancing a little jig saying praise God I'm going to be well because I've got the purchasing power of that loaf of bread come on it doesn't say the healing it already happened it said the very minute the reality strikes your heart I'm going to be well then go ahead and praise God in a little jig somebody say well that's a bunch of workup well I tell you there was a man over Donnie brother Donnie Reagan's church one time was sitting on the front row eat up with leukemia I just talked to him the other day he was sitting on the front row eat up with leukemia and in the middle of a Sunday morning service brother Donnie stood there and read that quote Amen in the middle of preaching nobody arounded him on their feet but that man jumped up on his feet he said brother Ander I didn't have no fancy footwork he said I just started praising God listen the leukemia was still in his body but the reality of healing had already struck his Soul you know what he got up the next day and went to the doctor and the doctor come in there they said sir we don't know what happened to you but you're completely free of leukemia come on this ain't just a sermon it's thus sayith the Lord It's the message of the hour either we believe it or we don't I refuse to lay down my weapon of Praise I refuse to lay down my sword God gave it to me ain't no devil going to take it away listen somebody's going to preach it somebody's going to preach it and somebody's going to believe [Applause] it somebody's going to preach it and somebody's going to believe it you say what's happening it's God by his Spirit energizing his word not our feelings not by might nor by power but by my Spirit sayith the Lord listen not by wisdom not by knowledge not by nomination but with my spirit I will energize my word listen what the prophet of God said he said the disciples had it solded into them then the Spirit come to energize the word see it's the water of the word of faith that energizes the word of God and makes it work what is is it brother Taz it's an unseen energy and it's coming into the church and it's causing you to believe when everything wants you to doubt see Jesus said I am the vine and ye are the branches sorry I'm from the south branches now if he will let me know what you his listen to prophet of God if he will let me know what you his daughter let I his child his son know what his daughter wants then I being a man and you woman there has to be something between us here it has to be God using us as branches listen he being the vine is energizing your heart to believe and mine to yield Church of the Living God so we are here as vessels both a speaker and the hearer he said as we yield our Soul and Spirit to as vessels as I yield m un to you for a mouthpiece I yield my eyes for the vision I yield my mind for your words he said they yield their hearts and their Spirit to receive now listen what we're receiving amen is we are receiving the promise of the word and it is becoming materialized right here even though nothing else will declare it now listen it's prop of God he said now how many believes that Jesus completed the Plan of Salvation and healing at Calvary he said okay as far as that it's all over isn't it he said but the only thing that he can do is to shock you or to bring you to an understanding that he is still God and he keeps his promise so in doing so he anoints preachers that's These Fine men standing around here and many back there he anoints them to preach another place once more 63 he says oh I think now to be conscious of the spirit near us light he says break out of the shell of the hour that we're living in in the time and be conscience of the spirit of God that is now Among Us come on friends you know what I'm talking about we get in a shell and we get used to everything in the shell and brother all we forget there's something happening outside of the shell do youall know there's a chicken and a chicken's born in a shell remember brother said the only way a chicken can get out is he's got a little p a little a bill on the end of his nose he said a little a little he says he peeps his way through he says he peps his way through now listen that chicken gets so used to that shell that he forgets there's life outside of the shell are you hearing me we get so used to our little way of doing things and we get so used to our little narrow view of the message and we get so used the way we think things ought to be that we forget outside of our little shell there's there's a Brides revival going on and it's happening around the world it's not just in my church or your church it's in the body of Jesus Christ universally so what happens is if you go over and crack the egg and pull the chicken out you'll kill it so brother Bram says that as a little as a little uh a little chicken in there he'll start Ping his way through he'll start just going pep pep pep now I got to wonder One Day how long does it take a chicken to get out of the shell and then then you know what I found out I found out it takes 21 days for a chicken to pick his way amen out of the shell sounds kind of like the Book of Daniel don't it amen that Daniel waited 21 days but after 21 days he had a breakthrough oh Church of the Living God I don't know how long you've been waiting but there's a breakthrough on the church there's a promise of a Revival there's a promise of a refreshing from the presence of God I got to thinking one day brother CH amen he starts peping his way out amen amen can I change that peping to amen you know some days he'll pep one time and some Services he'll pep 20 times some days he'll just feel like going amen and some days he'll feel like going amen amen amen amen amen amen amen and you know what we say Pentecostal emotional but do you know what the problem of God said he said he's got to do that because he's building up strength in his body to receive the things outside of the shell oh Church of the Living God listen friends there's joy outside of that shell of depression there's joy outside of those superiority complexes there's joy in the house of God I say it's time on a Friday night Amen to break out of the shell and remember God is God and His word is true and his power is here it's time to forget the shell we got used to amen you imagine brother 20 days 20 days he's been amening 20 days he's been pepping his way through and on the 20th day brother Chris he's ready to give up he's ready to lay down and quit and say it ain't getting me nothing it ain't getting me nowhere but something on the inside something on the inside says listen to a tape one more time something on the inside said Say Amen one time and on that 21st day when he begins to say Amen all of a sudden a little crack comes in the shell and he sees light oh Church of the Living God I know it's an age of neurotics I know it's an age of confusion I know it's an age where Satan has become the god of this evil age but I propose to you tonight that Jesus Christ is still the Son of God he is still the god of Deliverance and he's right here in this meeting tonight what are you saying I'm saying anointed preachers stand there and they preach to you under the pure inspiration of his presence I love what Jesus says he says yet a little while and the world aren't you thankful for a prophet who can give you commentary on the word of God the world he says the unbeliever seeth me no more but ye the believer see me because I Christ live ye the believer shall live also he said when Jesus and leaving the world after a Ministry around the world around the known world that day he said the works that I do shall you do also listen to his going away Lo a little while and the world the visible intellectual cultured scientific the world will see me no more that's exactly a prophecy it can't help but be the truth Jesus Christ said it the intellectual believer the world won't see me no more yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age and and the works I do that I have done shall you do also and More Than This shall you do for I go to my father he says I Christ in his church energizing bringing the same things that he did when he was here on the earth listen another place Jesus Christ is in his church his branches energizing them bringing forth the same fruit he brought when he was here on the Earth are y'all ready for this when he comes to the church in the last days he will come in the fullness of the light of the sun Church of the Living God so the fullness of Christ in the bride is making you undefeatable now come on Church you shouldn't be sitting here tonight but you're here come on people you Swit to church with has walked away but here you are are you hearing me preachers that you sat under and listen to preach this message have walked away and scoffed it but here you are still believing it do you know why because the prophet of God said when you really realize that God has revealed to you the truth of the thing then there's nothing in the world going to defeat you in it that's all you are absolutely undefeatable well I believe it tonight church I believe everything the devil's Throne against against you his plans have foiled you're still standing come on I know what I'm talking about amen it's just the first night and I'm feeling this good are you hearing me I know what I'm talking about the devil throw stuff at us he throw stuff at us and in my in I'll speak for myself okay in my immaturity when the devil threw something at me I would back up and get scared and think I was going to fall apart and then the devil say I'm going to get you I'm going to get you I'm going to get you but one day brother Andrew something struck my heart if the devil was going to get me he would have done got me if the devil was going to get you he would have done got you but he ain't got you cuz he can't get you because before he threw anything against you God put a seed in your soul a germ seed of God to believe the message in the face of every devil oh church not Christ not the body but this word that was in him not Mary but the word that was born from her has that ever dawned on you you're undefeatable brother Chris when's the last time you got up and went in the mirror and got ready and told your wife said come here honey look at an undefeatable Son of God Hallelujah come on brother Andrew come on preachers when's the last time brother fery you got up and said Jenny come here and look look here here is an undefeatable Son of God you know why it hadn't happened is cuz you're looking at what you see you're looking at the failures and the mistakes and all those things that devil throwing against you but if tonight you could break out of the shell of this visible intellect cultured unbelieving world and Look Away to Jesus one time you would see that on the inside of you is a predestinated seed just like was in Jesus Christ I tell you what you see you see the flesh you see the mistakes you see the failures you see the shortcomings but I pray to God tonight you would look beyond the Flesh and look in the Unseen one time you say brother Ander I can't yes you can yes you can yes you can you can look beyond what you see one time and one look in that Dimension will cause you to forget all the failures somebody say I'm not undefeatable yes you are get up in the morning and look around and say we're undefeatable Church come on fathers get up in the morning and tell them babies you're undefeatable is this foreign to you come on you got to fight the devil come on young people come on it's time to fight back the devil's trying to stop you because he knows what's laying in front of you he knows there's a future home he knows there's a body change listen I tell you right now the devil knows that there's a breakthrough right here in these meetings he knows there's a healing right here he knows there's a miracle right here and that Devil's pushing and that devil pressing but I say tonight Satan in the name of Jesus I adure Thee by the authority of Jesus Christ I rebuke you take your hands off of this meeting take your hands off of this people take your hands off of this church Satan now are defeated we dismiss you Satan in the name of Jesus Christ you say why because we're not preaching ideas we're preaching the word of faith and we're prach preaching the Word of Promise I got to tie this together see as a minister as a prophet of God was preaching listen he was ministering in entrance you know what the Bible says in first or two 2 Peter 11:11 for so an interest shall be ministered shall be ministered so an opening a door shall be ministered listen unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ now this is not very deep but for a country boy it is to enter something you've got to exit something so when a door is opened as an entrance the same door that's an entrance is also an exit like you come in this building but you left outside behind you listen friends so Believers are Kingdom people who are exiting the influence of the worldly Kingdom and they are entering into the influence of the Heavenly Kingdom that's why Prophet stood there amen by discernment and he said this I'm pressing into another's fear listen the human parts gone and the supernatural comes in and works through human flesh can I give you just a few quotes in closing expectation 51 see you got to break into a sphere that people know nothing about testimony 1951 may he come tonight and anoint thy servant with great power that this audience will be illuminated with his great August being may it sway over the building may it sway over the building till the people will lose sight of their diseases and they will sway on out in those spheres there where they can see Jesus and take his word another one now come near to me father and anoint thy servant and pack me pack me from this sense bound existence into the Spheres thir t my prayer for this meeting that's my prayer for every service Lord pack us out of this sense bound existence brother said we get so used to what's going on down here and things get so dreary he said we forget there's something happening in another realm pack me from this sense bound existence into the Spheres where you live can I say this as a Believer begins to believe the word of Truth and Faith they begin to exit the sphere or the realm or the kingdom of unbelief that's why Prophet stood there and preached the word preach the word preach the word preach the word and Faith was coming to the church are you with me Faith was coming to the church and then he would turn in the discernment oh God and he would say now I'm standing here here he said but really I'm over there he had preached an entrance oh God he had stood in the pullit and preached away through the lines of unbelief into a dimension where all things were possible and as you the believer begin to believe what he was saying you begin to follow him oh Hallelujah you begin to follow him out of this Dimension into a place where all things are possible have you ever wanted to stand before a prophet hello have you ever said if I could just stand before a prophet and hear him speak something over me everything would change well can I just can I just bring a quote here tonight now I want to say this you're going to be the little woman okay you say brother Andrew that's far out there no the prophet of God said you're a little faith woman okay at Thy word here's a discernment and you're you're you're that little woman okay Thou Art here Lord and this devil knows his time has come to this woman who is entering into this sphere of Faith here he knows he's got to lose he can't hold her any longer hallu Hallelujah the the devil knows he's got to lose he can't hold her any longer are y'all ready for this he says Thou death Spirit come out of her in the name of Jesus Christ I charge thee to leave the woman now you say preacher a deaf spirit and you ATT me as that little woman I'm not deaf I'm not talking about a natural deafness I'm talking about a spiritual deafness I'm talking about you got so used to being DEA to the word of God that all you can hear is the problems all you can hear is the situations all you can hear is the circumstances but for the next few days would you follow me as I follow a prophet and leave this sense bound existence and go into the Spheres where there is a place where you can believe clearly you know what a deaf Spirit does a deaf Spirit cuts off your hearing you know what somebody that's deaf be they could not be totally deaf but a oh God I'm trying to quit brother Ben but a death Spirit begins to alter the way they hear things so that death Spirit has a hold come on come on husbands you know our wives think we're deaf right come on say Amen you that's the truth amen amen take out the trash huh start the car no take take out the trash take out the trash I'm going hunting I didn't say go hunting I said take out the trash you need to go get some here and AG you know what you're just going down no what's happening is there's something altering oh god listen friends what's being said is not changing what's changing it is the spirit on your nerve controlling the way you hear it y'all know what I'm talking about amen when you first got saved every promise of God was yours but a few mistakes and a few trials and a few situations and a de Spirit got a hold of your spiritual hearing and now all you hear is condemnation and all you hear is guilt and that Devil's so piled on you till he don't want you to have a good camp but I say this tonight I come here to kill that devil I come here with a sword to charge eviction notice on that devil in the name of Jesus Christ I charge thee to leave the woman can you hear me do you hear me he says this was in the ear that's been deaf all the time watch a prophet do you hear me I love what he says out of all the words brother Chris he could have chose to identify the death Spirit had left her he chose this word do you hear me then say Amen do you hear me then say Amen because amen is the watering of the word of faith in the heart of a Believer what are you saying I'm saying are you saved are you delivered is your name in the Lamb's Book of Life Is there an atonement is there a blood is there a [Applause] sacrifice hallelujah amen come on Church break out of it amen I believe the word my past can't control me any [Applause] longer let our musicians come tonight I say [Music] Amen remember when you first heard that quote you got saved you never done it in the first place and you used to say Amen but a few mistakes and a few troubles and a few an old DE Spirit got a hold of your hearing and now you go to say amen and it sounds like the preacher said everything's against you the quote hadn't changed your hearing has changed the message of the hour hasn't changed it's the hearing of it that's changed that I rebuke that deaf spirit I rebuke that spiritual deafness in the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke it here tonight young people I rebuke it I rebuke that devil that says you're going to be a victim of Leona I rebuke it tonight and say greater is he that is in [Applause] me I rebuke that devil that says you've gone as far as you can go I rebuke it there's a land there's promises church right here tonight there's a land a new land a land flowing with milk and honey brother a land flowing with anointing Revelation promises but church it's not behind you it's not behind you it's in front of you I refuse to look back I refuse to lay down and say devil you're right I've gone as far as I can go I refuse I refuse tonight I refuse to stop short of the complete identification I refuse to allow the devil to start interpreting what a prophet taught I refuse I refuse I got a future you got a future can I tell you something the devil's not in [Applause] it unbelief is not in it brother Taz can I borrow you for just a second just just stand right there for me in the middle there and face me I hate to do this to you but you're my buddy so you can take it okay you're going to be the devil for a second all right okay so here I am in my past that's my present God called me out of my past and I'm in my present but you're standing between me and my future and I'm following a Vindicated Prophet who preached an entrance into the kingdom of God he opened the door and he broke a way through and I'm listening to his tapes and I'm hearing what he said and I'm hearing my pastor I'm hearing the ministry and I'm looking into my future and I'm W to go I'm wan to go there and you're saying no no you're not going in your future and I say but but but Mr devil I'm sorry Mr devil I got a future and he says no you don't I say yes I do I've got a future listen listen I got I see I see Deliverance in it I see a Rapture in it I see Power to overcome 200,000 thou I see my future and the devil says no there's no future there now let me tell you something he don't see what I see he only sees behind me oh God he sees where I have been but by the word of faith I see where I'm going can I say this a devil who's looking at your past doesn't have a right to interpret your future he don't see it he only sees what's behind you he only sees your failures but Old Church of the Living God somewhere or another I'm sorry you got to apply some force and say devil get out of my way I'm going on I'm going on I've listened to your lies long long enough I'm moving

seventh seal in the bride but I see [Music] it he don't see the power of the spoken word creation Power by the spoken word but I see it so I refuse to back up and become a Pentecostalism or lay out of sea and bride going Beyond just the baptism I'm going over into [Music] Perfection do you hear me do you hear a prophet of God do you hear him he's preaching in a meet the other day a lady sitting

we're surrounded we're surrounded he said we can't go no further we're surrounded he said he went out there he looked around he said God open that boy's eyes he said the hills was on fire the mountains was on fire alry I love what a prophet says he said that he said when he said open your eyes he didn't put them there they were already there he only opened the servant's eyes to what was

a Son of God he clung to that promise Lord and your Prophet said he looked in the Unseen and in that unseen Lord he saw an event and that event was Sarah holding a baby Lord while her milk veins were still dried up Lord while her womb was still as good as dead Abraham pressed Bey on the scene he took God at his word and pressed out into the Unseen he pressed out into that Dimension where there was no sense bound existence but Lord there was faith and Liberty to believe your word and Lord he kept looking at the promise father I pray tonight God as your word Goes Forth here this weekend Lord as
