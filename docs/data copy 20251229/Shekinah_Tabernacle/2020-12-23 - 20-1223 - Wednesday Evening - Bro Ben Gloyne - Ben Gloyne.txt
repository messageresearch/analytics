a positive you know never go in and lay your head down on your bed angry with someone go make it right it's not worth it to sleep in your bed being angry at someone just not just not worth today amen so because it's christmas they asked me to sing a couple of christmas carols now a little bit of a testimony i don't know christmas carols that well it's all pretty new to me so you're gonna have to help me once again we're gonna sing the first song joy to the world amen okay i don't even know what key we're gonna have to start us you have to give me something the [Music] joy to the world the

christmas carols lord you are so worthy eh amen oh glory let's give him a hand of applause hallelujah i'll i'll share a testimony if i may have a seat for five seconds i'll just be late to do that so um we had a pre-meeting in my house on a friday night oh lord help me now so um brother andy and and brother ben they said they wanna now let's have a pre-meeting at your house we're still staying in stokes valley and we moved from the house here at 243 stokes valley you know four six two four three just there right and we moved up to mana drive and we were staying there and they said we want to have a pre-meeting why don't we have a pre-meeting in your house on a friday night they've even knew where i came from friday nights was definitely not nights i dedicated to the lord friday nights was where i was out and about with my friends doing other stuff everything but what the lord wanted me to do so i said to them okay come over let's have a pre-meeting now inside of me i was so scared because i never knew what this prayer meeting is i don't know what a premier ring is you know i've never had one especially not in my own house so they get there and i might be saying a couple of the highlights so i don't color in pictures i just remember the highlight reels pretty much that's how most of my memory goes and we sat and we were all sitting around in the couches and and brother andy said why don't you start praying first now i'm terrified they're sitting in my house and i've got the pastor and brother andy which is the other part that i'm like oh yeah we got we got we've got the ministers in my house so man are they gonna cast out some demons or something's gonna happen here because it felt very serious and i was really like oh what do i do and they say no you start praying but i don't know how to pray i don't know what to say and i don't know what to expect so it's all new for me and i closed my eyes and i prayed the first time i just say thank you that we're in the house and lord i've got family and friends that's now here and they're going to pray with me and you know i don't know what's going to happen because i've been honest but we just start praying and i just say thank you for everything that he gives me and it goes to the one and goes to the other and everybody gets a chance to pray and it comes around the second time but when we prayed the second time we started praying against things that was hindering us spirits and things that would be cleaning to the house before and and things that we used to do before and the whole prayer meeting changed so much that it was starting to talk to me inside and i got so happy and then all of a sudden the presence of the lord came down and it was tangible i don't know the right english to put in and i wish i had a better vocabulary it was so real that when it came down i knew that deity stepped into the room now never in my life have i ever experienced something close to this and i want to encourage you if you ever wonder what to do on a friday night invite some brothers and sisters around to your house and start praying and don't stop until the lord wants you to stop okay don't stop even if it goes two times even goes three times just keep praying on a friday night because guess what it is a million billion gazillion trillion google play sometimes much better than anything i had any other friday of my life and that is the truth as god is my witness it was the best experience i had in my life and i said lord might never forget this experience so kids you don't need to know how to pray you don't need to go and work yourself up all this big all you need to do is be available and god will make you able okay so just pray and pray what's in your heart but don't stop when you say amen because you never know that second time it came around it changed everything for me in my life amen and i experienced the presence of the lord on a friday night in my own house amen so i thought i just said it i don't know why but i thought i'll just hear that to you guys because again i would have never been here if it wasn't for his miraculous wonderful power amen so days of miracles kids are not over amen so let us stand and we sing away in a manger amen i don't know why i shared that i just felt lead to so may god get the glory out of that testimony and if you've ever experienced the lord jesus christ if you've really experienced him in your life there's no doubt in your mind that there is a god no doubt amen no doubt okay [Music] the little lord jesus lay down his sweet hair the stars in the bright sky look down where he lay their little lord jesus [Music] the baby of waves but little lord jesus no cries he makes i love the lord jesus look down from the sky and stay by my

wednesday we don't have the midweek services on the thursday night instead so amen luke luke two and we're going to read from verse 22. amen i heard brother reman spoke i speak about being nervous i feel nervous say i feel nervous but that's probably a good thing but um anyway praise the lord luke luke 2 and verse 22 i don't have a slideshow so uh so we'll just start here and when the days you know i was hoping sister maggie the birthday girl would have been here but uh i hope she's having a good time i mean when the days of purification according to the law of moses were accomplished they brought him to jerusalem to present him to the lords this is mary and and and joseph taking jesus to to the temple as it is written in the law of the lord every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the lord and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the lord a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons and behold there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of israel and the holy ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the lord's christ hallelujah hallelujah and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the child jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then he took him up in his arms and blessed god and said lord now let us thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation hallelujah amen let's let's pray together shall we lord jesus we lord we can say that too lord our eyes have seen thy salvation lord as the apostle john would say that they have handled and they have seen the word of life hallelujah lord that life lord we have handled lord we have seen eternal life oh god that lord jesus is no longer just just up in heaven but lord is now in flesh lord by by the shedding of your blood lord it puts your holy spirit into the heart of the believer i want to thank you lord we are beneficiaries lord of your birth of your death your burial resurrection and lord thank you we have seen your salvation in this hour lord your word made manifest and i just want to pray lord as we have gathered here lord may you just come visit us lord jesus always think of lord your brother ahmad was telling that testimony of you coming down to his house and lord i pray once more may you step lord among us oh god and not just among us but in us lord and may you lord just meet every need may you take the service under your divine control we just want to also remember those who couldn't be here today lord may you anoint them as well or those who may be watching by the way of youtube lord i i just pray they'd feel your presence lord it may not just be information being received but lord may your word administer lord your holy spirit may your holy spirit administer your word to their hearts as well dear god we commit our lives into your hands once again we just ask your lord receivable honor glory and praise dear god and we just want to commit the service into your hands and we lord we love you we thank you we can gather as a people lord and just just know we're being washed in your blood my new creatures and you lord we we thank you so much in jesus christ's name amen amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats tonight and if i could just take a a a title i just want to ask you the question what do you see when you see the word made flesh now it's amazing that different you read through the gospels and you can start from genesis all the way down through it's amazing the people's reaction when god comes among them you know we uh we read it on sunday i believe but you know herod when he heard about you know the wise men came into jerusalem psyches turned me down a bit uh brother ed you know the wise men came into jerusalem i said where is he born king of the jews they're all excited and they're under expectation and and the whole city was moved and troubled by this and you know but herod herod wasn't all that excited about a king being born because he felt challenged he felt intimidated because in his little you know top two inches of his brain he said i'm king around here and it really just brought out he was a murderer anyway but it really brought out what was within him and you know he he he wanted to kill jesus because because he saw him as a threat to his kingship yeah and we know that you know uh the same the same attitude came out in the scribes and you know scribes and pharisees you know it took them a lot longer to come to that point but that was already in them anyway but you know you know they weren't like hear it here it was uh quicker out of the starting blocks you know so to speak about wanting to kill the lord but you know the scribes and pharisees you know were in the same boat because eventually they came to a place let's kill this man now we've come to the scene in the temple where jesus is to be presented you know the best that mary and joseph could have had as an offering was was say two turtle doves or you know because they were a poor kind of people and jesus was wrapped in swaddling clothes and here they are in the temple now we we must remember that they weren't the only ones in the temple there are many other first-born sons being presented to the lord you know that would just be one and men you know one of many and you know the other woman there you know everyone responds to the word being made flesh everyone you know there's a saying it'll either make you mad glad or sad and you know so i want to be the glad one not the sad or the mad maybe sad at first knowing i need salvation but after i've met him i'm glad right but it should ultimately make you glad i mean not mad hallelujah so you're mad sad or glad you know whatever category uh you choose to fall in well that's your choice but you know the other woman you know herod he wanted to kill the word made flesh the other woman when they saw that word made flesh when they saw it they saw an illegitimate child you know jesus you know there's already a rumor and you can even read this in in you know in in history that they say that jesus father was either a roman soldier or it was joseph himself that's what history would say you know so so before he even came to the came to the earth or even you know you know as he's just as a little boy baby there child you know he already had a bad reputation to begin with he already had a bad name now if we could just dramatize this you know there'll be a line of woman there they're all waiting with their gift and you know maybe they're carrying their baby in the best kind of blanket or or your needle work or you know they're all dressed up for the occasion this is a big day this is not just any day this is a big day and you know you know they're all excited but then there comes in another two into the line there's there's there's a poor kind of maybe 17 year old kind of girl you know you know she's not wearing the best kind of clothes you know she has a baby and he's wrapped up in swaddling clothes not the nicest kind of you know you know kind of gown or whatever you would call it you know and and and they would they would come in and then immediately people would begin to see and there'd be a whisper begin to run down the line they're from nazareth you know i mean they're from bethlehem this is mary oh mary you know it's amazing how quickly things spread you know when when when my parents lived in papua new guinea you know the locals would tell you as soon as you get off the plane everyone knows who you are who your mum is who your dad is where you're from what they do they know everything about you you've never met anyone but they know exactly who you are they know where you're from your age things spread wildfire just spreads around you know so they begin to talk and now immediately now oh this is an illegitimate child i don't want him photobombing me you know i don't want him i don't want mary you know i'm trying to bring into today's language i don't want that photo bombing in my photos with my son when he's being dedicated to the lord and then because that stigma they begin to spread away and there's always a gap in the line there's a gap around him because no one wanted to be associated with the word made flesh they were embarrassed they were embarrassed to be near him even though they were in the temple they were claiming to be believers following the word but they were embarrassed to be identified with the very god that was actually the one they were claiming to worship they were embarrassed to be near him now we must never ever be embarrassed to be associated with him so now i may be talking a lot about back in the temple but really that same scene is played out today so what's your attitude you see someone you know it's very easy just to go through a form of church but then when the spirit begins to fall and maybe people begin to cry and shout or rejoice and be happy are you embarrassed to be associated with those kind of people i mean when people are going to testify and talk about god out in the public are you are you embarrassed we shouldn't be embarrassed we say i'm so glad i can say i'm one of them hallelujah i mean even even even um paul would say to timothy uh in in second timothy i don't i don't have it um in my notes but we can turn to that second timothy 1 and verse 18 he says the lord uh grant unto him no sorry verse 16 the lord give mercy unto the house of oniferous for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain so he was not ashamed of the condition that the apostle paul was found in and also paul would say to timothy in verse 8 be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god so to paul's telling timothy don't be ashamed of me don't be ashamed of the messenger yeah right we shouldn't be ashamed you know to say we believe god's seen a prophet his name happens to be william branham and he fulfilled malachi 4. and i'm part of that fulfillment because my heart's been turned back to the apostolic faith of the fathers we shouldn't be ashamed of those things amen but you see you see now now but they thought that jesus was an illegitimate child remember jesus you know that you know even even when jesus came into his ministry the scribes and pharisees said to him i believe it's in john 6 of john 8 we be not born of fornication see they were they were talking about the garden but they also talked about him and his birth upon the earth right but you know so something that's illegitimate now i did the definition of illegitimate it means it's not authorized by law and it's not in accordance with accepted standards of rules so something that's illegitimate it's not accepted right you know there's no there's no legitimacy you know behind it you know if you if you take that into a religious realm a church that is legitimate to not illegitimate but the opposite it's one that's recognized so so for example you know what denomination do you belong to if you say you can say any denomination you want and people say that's a legitimate church right anyone under the sun what bible school did your pastor go to if i had a dd behind my name that would give me legitimacy because i've studied it i didn't get my degree in a theology college i have a i have a postgraduate diploma in biochemistry but when it comes to theology i mean when it comes to lord i got my degree of neology down on my knees i met my jesus that's where i got my degree hallelujah so but the thing is if i you know if i went to bible school people ask me what bible school did you go to i didn't go to any you know and they and they can't get their head around that you know what kind of denomination is it oh we're independent what do you mean the thing is when you begin to talk about those kind of things the legitimacy of a church goes down in the people's eyes just like jesus carrying uh mary carrying jesus to the temple a bad name was associated with him and no people were embarrassed to be near where he was now if we go back to the the days of exodus of the first exodus because we know there's parallels between every exodus in the scripture and we know we're in the third exodus we're going from this world to the next world and that would be as i said that'd be such a cool christmas present hallelujah but you see when when when um when joseph is bringing his father and and all of his family down into down into egypt and he's going to introduce his father to pharaoh um joseph begins to tell his father you know that ye shall say this is what you should say to him thy servant's trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now both we and also our fathers that we may dwell in the land of goshen now this is genesis 46 34 if you're taking notes that we may dwell in the land of goshen for every shepherd is an abomination unto the egyptians so so they were shepherds they had sheep that was their livelihood their goats that are cheap they had you know shepherds but he's trying to say don't tell them this is your trade because this is an abomination to the egyptians now this word shepherd here in the scripture i mean let's start with the word abomination this is so an abomination i mean something that is disgusting this is this is from the strong's concordance it's something that's disgusting morally it's something to be loathed or detested so this is what egyptians thought of shepherds they are disgusting morally they are loath and they're detested it wasn't a trade that you'd say boy when you grow up you want to be a shepherd reuben you want to be a shepherd in egypt that's what you want to be everyone will love you for it no everyone will detest you you know you know if if they you know how you get to i think it's high school you get asked questions what do you want to be when you grow up you know and so i want to be a ship but the teachers say no you don't you don't want to be a shepherd but you see that's right this is what the egyptians thought of it now now i'm coming to a point this is going to tie a neil we may go this way but we'll get there okay now a shepherd in the hebrew here so this word shepherd now says an abomination something that's disgusting morally something loathed or detested now a shepherd in the hebrew is from the from two words it means one means to tend to flock and the other one means two uh uh two it's a collective name to migrate or a collective name for a flock of sheep or goats so he's talking about a shepherd he's talking about those who have sheep or goats so those that occupation was an abomination to the egyptians now so if they were an abomination to the egyptians how much more do you think it would have been an abomination to the egyptians the offering that the israelites gave on the passover so the very thing that they were detested and they loathed the israelites took the lamb took the blood of that lamb and put it on the door in lintel and no doubt the egyptians when they saw that they said that's disgusting why on earth that i loathe that thing i detest your worship that's a disgusting kind of worship that's not how our church does it that's not what that's not what we believe that's a disgusting word how do you believe that doctrine i mean serpent seed come on one god and many manifestations what do you mean by that baptism in the name of lord jesus christ holiness dress oh that's a horrible thing yeah isn't that what the world thinks they think it's detestable it's disgusting but it's the word that's right right so so the very thing the very thing that the israelites offered that save their firstborn was the very thing that the egyptians detested they did not want to be identified with it they were embarrassed to be around it no doubt they detested it they said it was morally disgusting it was wrong but it gave life it preserved life those who believed it and applied the blood that preserved life amen but that was the attitude of the egyptians to what the israelites did but that was the word made manifest and that was their because their culture trained them a certain way they saw it a certain way because of how the culture trained them we shouldn't look at the word of god according to culture and also even a message culture i'm just quoting quotes and quoting scriptures and no life and going through a motion now we're gonna go beyond that the very god that died on calvary he said i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world and this is what this we know the end time message releases the holy ghost upon the people because there's no more creeds there's no more dogmas holding him back there's nothing to bar him no more but he's free to be released upon the people and that's what we believe we believe we've been restored back to a book of acts church before there was a fall we know we're not restored back to the problems in the church we're not restored back to the division and the and the fussing over legalism we're not restored back to that we're restored back to a people individually led by the holy ghost and god lives in power and manifests himself and the word puts on flesh in those people and they can gather as a group and that same holy ghost will work through that body hallelujah that's what we believe do we not isn't that what the message is meant to produce are we not restored amen hallelujah hallelujah amen you know even so we should never ever have the egyptians attitude to the word i don't want that kind of attitude i want caleb or joshua's attitude let's go take that mountain ah let's go let's go into that promised land amen we've been called out let's go in now hallelujah amen we should be ready to leave amen hallelujah as as as moses told the people of israel get all the living out of your house we're applying the blood get all the unbelief get all the malice get all the strife get all the unbelief get a you know get anything that would hinder the word get it you know anything that's not pleasing to the lord just get rid of the thing apply the blood amen you know peter would say but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that's in you with meekness and fear having a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers so don't be surprised that people speak evil of you we shouldn't be shocked they spoke evil of the lord jesus and i just asked the question what do you ever do bad and the answer is nothing nothing but yet they spoke evil of them so whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers well how do they do that they call it a cult they call it bondage they call it brainwashing narrow-mindedness man-made control that's what they call it do they not amen but so so whereas they speak evil of years of evildoers um they may be ashamed that falsely accuse you i mean accuse your good conversation which is your behavior in christ so have a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers i'm just repeating this that they may be ashamed that falsely accuse you accuse your good conversation which is your behavior and christ so we should have a good we should have a good behavior how we should conduct ourselves should be beyond reproach now let's go back to let's go back to the let's go back to the temple so if the unbelievers in egypt thought that of the of the shadow of the lamb and the passover how much more now what they would think of the real lamb when he came they detested the shadow if they detest a shadow they will to test the reality they can't help it right but if the believers believe the shadow the believers will believe the reality hallelujah and and and we'll get to that kind of thing later but you know here she is now and i look there's an expectation standing way down there along some of them holding a little lamb as they're leading up for their time for their baby their babies wrapped in pink and blue and so forth coming along the line silk needlework so there's all the mothers queueing up to you know to to give their offering for their firstborn but i see standing there a little woman puts your puts you mind of the holy ghost church just a little despised she had a kind of a black name a little virgin stood there about 17 years old engaged to a man and she had a baby in her arms some of them say pointing their finger to a look at that baby it isn't wrapped in fine needle cloth but it's just got a swaddling cloth wrapped around it that's that's what they take off the back of a yoke of an ox when they plows there's nothing in the stable to wrap it in so they just took that off and wrapped it i imagine holding two turtle doves a peasant's offering well what was wrapped in swaddling cloth the king of kings and the lord of lords the rest of them stood their space they didn't want to go near there they were good that's about the way people feel today but there was someone else in that there were two people in the temple that were not ashamed or embarrassed when the word came into their presence hallelujah we read about simon imagine standing there you're in prayer i just dramatized it you you're getting up in age you love the lord with all your heart you know the messiah must be coming soon there's been nearly 400 years of silence there's been no prophet and you're just something just something's just in you what are you up to today simon i'm going to go pray hallelujah what are you looking for simon i read about a lamb hallelujah i just read the other day in the scrolls of genesis and you know moses was inspired that you know adam and eve were wrapped up in the animal skins of a you know i believe it was a lamb that where they were wrapped up in and you know the promise was given of the seed of the woman and i'm looking for that seed of the woman hallelujah you know and he would read through all the prophecies you know i mean i mean all the prophecies and yeah maybe just a burn came on his heart i want to see him before i die i've already gone over my three score and ten but but but you know i i just want to see him before i die you know he'd be praying and then i don't know if an angel came to him it's not recorded but but but the holy ghost spoke to him and said simon you're not gonna die until you see the lord's christ how excited he must have been notice he wasn't a little boy that was young that had decades of life ahead of him he was right at the end so he must be real excited boys i could die tomorrow i've had to see him before i die tomorrow hallelujah he would have been excited it's going to happen real soon hallelujah so he was under expectation hallelujah hallelujah if he's not coming today he'll come tomorrow if he's not coming tomorrow he'll come next week hello buddy i'm going to see him hallelujah you know and then he's staying there in the temple all the women are coming through as they were doing and then then the holy ghost moved on his heart simon he's in the building oh leah hello he's in the building and then and then and then he said where is he says just start walking he leads him he goes past one one mother no no no then there's a gap but the lord says yes and this one woman that stand with the baby and everyone else is ashamed to be even near where she is he comes straight picks up the child lord i can now let thy servant depart in peace for mine eyes have seen my salvation hallelujah what the holy ghost promised me is be manifested this day this prophecy has been fulfilled hallelujah and there was another there was someone else in the temple old anna the prophetess you know maybe if we spent a lot of time around the temple you know maybe you know no doubt some people would have some kind of attitude she's just gone a little bit crazy all she does is pray and read and sing to jehovah and just sits there in the corner and always in church and you know she's maybe you know fasting and praying that's all she ever does you know it talks about the lord and you know to the natural mind i think maybe she's just gone deep off on the deep end in her religion but she had something about her now brother brown said she was blind she was 84 years old and um you know nat you know to the natural world she couldn't maybe see much at all but in the spiritual world she could see far greater than the priests she could see far greater than even the religious heads of the country she could see 2020. and when i was reading this i thought god may i be blind to the world and may i see you either because maybe they thought with anna if you really knew what was going on in the world the political climate the economic climate what's happening in the other you know what's going on in rome and everything that the uh he's doing over there and what china's doing what russia's doing you know if you really knew what was going on you wouldn't be sitting in here praying and fasting but she was blinded to that that wasn't the main thing of her life i mean the main thing of her life is i want to worship god i want to pray to him and fast and you know and in the lord that same time that simon was led to where the christ was the holy ghost moved upon anna and you know someone who's blind or can't see very well they've got to be real careful how they walk but i believe she was you know the lord told her stand up stand up anna start walking and she just walked straight this is just me what she's led by the holy ghost all through the line of woman and everything hallelujah and then she saw amen and she came in in that instant giving thanks likewise unto the lord hallelujah but then it wasn't just that she didn't just see the lord and then go sit back down and continue fasting and praying but the scripture tells us in luke 2 38 and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in jerusalem so here was now a church that had seen a woman in the scripture represented represents a church right so here is a woman that has come in contact with the word i mean has seen that he's alive she doesn't keep it to herself you know there's something when you come in contact with the living god you can't keep it to yourself you've got to tell someone about it you've got to share it so you've got to shout it from the rooftop whatever you got to do because he becomes so real to you hallelujah that you know so she began to tell all them that looked for redemption in jerusalem maybe you know when she was led to the christ child she saw that word made flesh you know maybe she begin to make a list of who she's got to go visit because you begin to make plans i'm going to go see brother so-and-so's sister so and so maybe she'd say well levi lives closest to the temple i'll go to their family first and then and then maybe judah's place is on the way to to sister ruth said i'll go to rubens after that hallelujah he would she would have made plans she began to tell everyone you know imagine that the day before and it comes to your house how you doing anna oh hallelujah just praying and fasting and not just seeking god and you know praise the lord he's good you know hallelujah but then the next day oh my god hello sheep birthday how are you doing anna i've seen him he's alive hallelujah where'd you see him in the temple he's on the grounds right now hallelujah we're not looking for him to come he's here hallelujah oh my hallelujah those who are looking for redemption will see him amen so you can't keep it to yourself amen you've got to tell somebody about it hey we have the greatest message that has ever struck the earth what's our message he lives just tell him how you got your candle got lit it became more than a book more than a tape more than a song more than a church service he became alive he became real hallelujah i think i think that's a good thing to tell people want something real they don't want an argument anyone can you can spend a million lifetimes just back and forth with arguments people want to see life they want to see something real yes hallelujah so there's the mad and when we're at it and so the man is herod and there's the embarrassed ones you put that in some category then there's the glad we've covered the glad now we're going to go to the sad now peter peter was a fisherman hallelujah he was a fisherman one time uh one time you know jesus would come along and he would be sitting in simon's boat he'd be pushed off from the shore so jesus could preach the multitude on the bank and he began to teach the people but then when he had left speaking he says to simon launch out into the deep and cast your nets for for a draw and simon said but we've toiled all night now we're in luke 5 and we've taken nothing so we've tried it you know who's ever been fishing and you see a big school of fish yes normally you see sea birds and they'll take you to where the fish are yep so he's basically in my mind he's looking over the sea galilee he says lord we haven't caught nothing i'm not seeing no sign of fish but at thy word nevertheless lord at thy word will put the net down so when he put the net down ma'am when he put the net down it became instantly full of fish so what had just happened the creator put fish in the net hallelujah hallelujah and then when simon saw this it says it says and when this was done they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net break and they beckon under their partners which were in the other ship that they could not uh that that they should come and help them and they came and filled both the ships so that they begin to sink and when simon peter saw it it says he fell down at jesus knee saying depart from me for i'm a sinful man o lord he saw this was god made flesh and he's saying i'm not worthy for me to be in your presence see this was the sad but he wasn't going to stay sad but he could see his condition hallelujah and then but then he began to tell them i'm going to make you fishers of men so i have not brought you into my presence just to make you feel unworthy that you would leave it i've brought you into my presence that i'm going to commission you to be fishers of men that's the same thing with us you know the lord doesn't convict us to leave us convicted or to leave us feeling wrong hallelujah but the law convicts us that he will actually take that from us and commission us with his holy ghost to go out and preach the gospel to the world hallelujah now we know the bible tells us well the prophet tells us that god may take his man but the spirit is still upon the earth and the devil may take his man but that same spirit is still upon the earth you see it all the way down from genesis to now right and now um brother braham says and jesus came and called satan takes his man and you can find them same spirits watch their nature identify yourself in your present state now where you're standing with some bible character now now to me now to identify yourself with some bible character is not you looking through the scripture and finding a character you like and saying it's me but to me it's the lord revealing to you who you are in the scripture by the nature that's in you now as the nature was in them right and this and what this does is give you faith that what happened in that bible character's life you'll see it reproduced in your life and then brother and says now where would you have been if you lived in noah's time where would you have been where would you have been in the days of the lord jesus when he was here on earth and his flesh what group would you be identified with tonight just think of it see what group would you have been identified with when paul was correcting them back there in corinthians for the things they were doing what group would you be identified with see just look back it's a looking glass we can see where wherever we were we are now that's what we've been uh that's what we have that's what we would have been back there because the spirit that's in us now identified back there that's the same spirit that was on them back there he says my now bible and the message teaches us that all that god was he poured into christ right and the and jesus christ the lord jesus christ is not the second person of the godhead he's not a lesser god or a minor god or the second person of the trinity but he is all of god manifested in a human body he is the godhead paul would say in corinthian i mean colossians 1 19 for please the father in him should all fullness dwell right so that's when why brother braham could take and he takes other scriptures when he says with the baptism of of of of jesus by john it says that that that god said that i'm pleased yeah i'm pleased to dwell in him right speaking of jesus because it please the father in him should all fullness dwell so not a part of god was in jesus all was in him colossians 2 and 9 for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily so therefore now if we have the holy ghost right now that same holy ghost has been anointing prophets and believers since the beginning of time by measure but in the lord jesus it was without measure now that's why people thought that he was one of the prophets he would say in uh matthew 16 he would ask his disciples who to mean say i the son of man am and they'd say well you're john the baptist you're elias or jeremiah one of the prophets because how they saw jesus act they could they could say i've read about that somewhere oh that's in jeremiah's life or i've read about the summer i see it in moses or i see it in elijah you know so because because they had god and portion but now all of the old you can say all the old testament prophets that was god pouring out by measure is now all of it in one body in in christ jesus now brother brown would say perseverance he says look at christ he is the fullness of god god dwelled in christ without measure he had the spirit without measure we have it by measure but if i got a spoonful of water out of the lake out there or the ocean so if i went and got got some of the pacific ocean or the cook straight if i got a bit of that water right see see the ocean that was in christ if i got a spoonful of water just be a spoonful of water out of it but the same chemicals that's in the entire ocean is in that spoonful it's not as much but the same chemicals and if we have the spirit of god in us it's the same works in the same spirit the same manifestation see then you base your faith upon that and when you see that it is then you can be perseverant you know where you're standing so he says now when you see that same spirit that you read about in the scripture living how it lived hallelujah you see it in your life he says then you can base your faith upon that because you see your experience lines up with god's bible because of the spirit that wrote the bibles in you you cannot deny that word and your life will line up with that bible even if you do not know the scripture from verse to verse to verse the nature in you will be the same as what paul was writing so you know as paul would say we are written epistles read unknown of all means the epistles i'm writing to you he's saying you are manifesting those epistles how was that because the spirit that inspired him is now in the believer causing that word to live through the believer hallelujah so now we can base our faith on that if that spirit is within us and we can be perseverant now if we look through the scriptures as i said before the same spirit that was on david to kill goliath is in you the same spirit that was on moses to call those plagues and bring deliverance is on you amen at the same spirit that was on elijah to go on a rapture as a you hallelujah the same spirit that was in elisha to bring the dead back to life is in you amen the same spirit that was on moses is on you or noah is in you hallelujah right the saints brothers on david is a new and you can bring that all the way down through you know into the new testament now and and sirs we would see jesus so i'm just speeding up a bit because i feel like we're running out of time okay now we see when man was anointed like joseph he betrayed christ where moses was anointed he betrayed christ when david was anointed he portrayed christ all leading up to christ and he was the fullness of the word the word was made manifest in him he was the complete anointed one they had it by portions we have it by portions he was the anointed one the entire plan of god laid in him god's plan before the foundation the world to redeem a lost world was in him he was the word and he still is the word the same yesterday today and forever remember he came to the fathers through the prophets uh made himself known through the prophets and in this last day through his son christ jesus he was god made manifest so he says it's christ it was christ in moses it was christ and david we all know this don't we it's christ and elijah christ and isaiah you know christ and ruth christ and esther all it was christ revealing himself now but now it is christ in you the hope of glory otherwise they were portraying something so we are portraying the same thing but the reality hallelujah so now as as as the apostle paul would say i mean even the mystery that has been hit from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory hallelujah so as i said that same spirit that anointed david to kill goliath that's how he spirits on me hallelujah the same one that was on solomon to build the temples in me amen hallelujah is that right if it's the same holy ghost remember it may not be the same magnitude of the holy ghost but it's just like as i said i can take a teaspoon of the cooked straight and it's the same chemicals in that water as in the whole body of water hallelujah same thing so now if that same spirit was in moses as in me then if then if he was commissioned to deliver a people then that same commission of deliverance is in us hallelujah at that same anointing that took elijah i know i'm repeating myself but i want you know what do you think about it that's right you know the whole you know we if we just put our lives completely into god's hands god will win the victory why because he's won it before you know basically he'd say i've been through this before i know how this works this is not my first battle this is not my first engagement with the enemy i know how he works i built him i studied him i know his tactics real well i know what he's going to do before he thinks of even doing it and before he implements it i know exactly when he's going to do it i'm not guessing remember he knows exactly what the devil's going to do when he's going to do it right he's not and it's not a guess you know a room of era you know like different militaries around the world they have their spy networks they can and and they can make an educated guess this is what they're going to do and sometimes it can be very accurate sometimes it'll be way off god is always completely accurate so if we could just really put our lives in his hands he'd say i've got this i've got your battle hallelujah i've got this i've been through it before i know what he's going to try and do to you i mean i i i looked you know i saw it happen before the foundation world but i looked through time amen so i've got this hell if we can just trust in god god's got this amen he's got this bride remember remember the promises we read about in the message and you know and in the scripture we didn't make the promises sometimes we say how is this ever going to happen well well it's not actually on our ability to to make it be fulfilled hallelujah if god gave the promise he's the one obligated to the promise he's the one who actually has to fulfill it it wasn't an abraham's ability to have isaac abraham wasn't the one who gave the promise god gave the promise therefore he could rejoice and count everything but not and just take god at his word hallelujah so the anointing that was on abraham was in me so i can believe for the impossible i can believe and rejoice in things as though they are even though they may appear not to be yes sir hallelujah you know i was um well i'm just thinking about sunday but you know brother braham says that you know god's word is like a great big arcade you know and then he also says that faith in the finished work of calvary is the key that unlocks the door to every divine promise now imagine imagine now if i had the key to your favorite store i had i don't have keys on me but imagine if i had that and i gave it to you and said just say if your favorite store is bunnings or mitre 10 or whatever it is whatever toys you want you know if you really believe that these were the keys to that store you would put your faith into action and get the keys but then you wouldn't just sit back and say i've got the keys you would be rejoicing all the way to the store and you'd be getting imagining in your mind what you're going to do when you get there oh there so maybe maybe before you'd see man i want to try that right on lawnmower i wonder how fast it goes you've got the keys in the store remember so as you're driving then you're imagining how fast it's going to go but then it but so so it goes to an expectation to a reality hallelujah and you don't just drive to the store and look at the store you open the door and you go in right and then you would get that right on lawnmower and and at first you're excited it's going to happen because remember you've got the keys to it yeah see you're excited and then you get on the thing and you bring to experience what you've been imagining in your mind so it's no longer just an expectation it's a reality this thing really goes that fast hallelujah then maybe you wanted to use a nail gun you get the nail gun you know maybe shoot yeah shoot the breeze but oh boy and then you go and build something things you've been imagining now it's no longer just ink on paper something that's imagined now you're actually doing it harley or your whatever's in that store and you wouldn't just stop with one thing imagine if we're outside you running we're here yeah right on lawn mower or whatever just hurting around there stops and then you walk out all satisfied you say what's wrong with you you got the whole store yes no no i'm good no no no well give me the key set you know but it's same kind of thing we don't want to just be satisfied with experience one promise of god every promise of god is in the arcade and god has given us the key of faith you know some some promises may be a little harder to get you know i think of you brother could be in about you know forklifts and getting stuff on high high things you know you can't just go and pick that up and open it you gotta get the fork lift out and you know pull it up and get it down but it's like faith you know you know if you don't have the faith to get it you say lord increase my faith that i'll get it because remember it's mine it may be out of reach maybe i can't get it down with my physical ability but i've got the forklift of faith to go get it hallelujah so now if the word is a big arcade every now you just think about every promise that's in the bible healing's in the arcade remember you think about bunnings there's nail guns in there there's paint in there there's there's electrical stuff in there there's there's there's leaf blowers there's hammers there's all kinds of lawn mowers there's everything in there you can build a house and there's wood there's drop saws you can build anything you want hallelujah so you know everything's in there now if i had the key i'd go in there i'd just i just use everything now you think about our arcade there's healing in there we have the key to healing hallelujah there's deliverance in there we have the key to deliverance there's salvation in there for our families we have that key hallelujah there's healing there's deliverance there's salvation there's peace of mind there's joy i mean there's every divine promises in that arcade hallelujah the rapture's in there too it's all in there remember the key of faith amen faith in the finished work of calvary as amen will open the door to the rapture hallelujah it's all in there and maybe i was just being challenged myself thinking lord if that's really true which it is just make me in such a way that i just i just go through the whole place hallelujah i use everything it doesn't matter if there's is i don't know what i'm talking about right on lawn mowers just thinking you're trying to race them around the store or something but you know after you try one i'm going to try the next one yeah and i'm going to do lap times i'm going to see which ones i'm going to see which one turns better yeah i'm going to try them all and then i'm going to go try everything else you know so one by one i might be there in a long time but i'm going to go through the whole place and it should be the same with the word of god lord in this arcade of your word which you've opened up for us it's not anything we've done it's just his grace saying here's the key go enjoy yourself manifest every divine promise enjoy it i've i've given you the ability you know if that's the way i say lord may we be a people that is that that that is so hungry or addicted as brother john andy's preached mary so addicted amen that we want to see every divine promise manifested oh jesus he's given us the key yes amen hallelujah that's all free anyway this book now so it's christ in us the hope of glory amen and this is a so now he's in modern events may clear by prophecy now this book is a book of prophecy it's it's believers are commanded to honor it and to read it and to believe its author for every word that's written in there must come to pass everything that's been promised has to come to pass because it's jesus christ in each age the same yesterday it was jesus christ was a noah was it was jesus christ of moses it was jesus christ and david it was jesus christ and joseph as jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and as jesus christ among his people today doing the things that he promised he would do in this age is jesus christ i mean so what are you really going on about here i say in order for us to see who we are in the scripture the reason for it rather is not just to fill our head with types and shadows that is not the purpose of seeing yourself in the scripture but the purpose of that is the lord so so it's good to study those things out and i encourage you to go study them out but it can't just stay in your top two inches but it's got it the lord must quicken it to our hearts that we would see our nature now and the believers back there i mean so we can see if you if you look at the bride she is revealed in all the types of the old testament just like christ was so is the bride i mean so we can see christ and david but but we can see ourselves in david right we can see christ and joshua but we can see ourselves in joshua amen we can see christ and moses but then we can see ourselves and moses how do you see ourselves and moses well moses came to a point where where god basically told him i'm going to wipe off israel i'm going to start with you and he threw himself in the gap saying lord blot my name out and said and that was christ in moses interceding standing in the gap for an unbelieving people isn't that how we should be hallelujah all we can see we can see that nature in esther or in ruth or in the shunaway woman or any believer amen that because their lives see if you have that same nature in you that same remember christ and all them is in you then you and then the lord identifies who you are in the scripture then the outcome of that believer will be your outcome and then things that you do not see will begin to actually your your life will begin to be changed to manifest that outcome amen hallelujah and that will give you and and even just to see yourself as esther that should give you such a joy in your heart because the end of esther wasn't she was dead and haman was king no haman was dead and esther had a great victory amen hallelujah you know so it should give us such a revelation and that's why when i was thinking about this i said lord show me is enoch in the scripture hallelujah don't you want to see wouldn't you wouldn't be awesome if the lord said you're enoch amen we are he not carly but may just anchor down in here amen hallelujah i mean their lives were a manifestation of the word because they were part of that word amen amen so we are part of that word too amen he was being revealed in their lives and he's but he's being revealed in our lives now you say well how does this happen today well brother brown would tell a story of a of an african-american woman that had a son and that son went out with the wrong crowd ended up with a transmitted disease and was dying on a bed who knows the story we all know that story now here she is she's a godly woman no doubt she took her son to church tried to raise him in the love and fear of the lord but he got in amongst the wrong crowd and he ends up in the spot and something was inspired on her heart i'm like the shunamat woman so now the lord shows her she's the shunamart woman but then she begins to ask a very good question if i'm the shunammite woman where is my elisha where is my elijah so now now if you think about this before the lord ever showed her she's the shunammite then the natural course that would have happened is he would have died right because there was no medical help for him he was beyond so the natural course of it was he was going to die and her great burden was i don't want to see my boy lost but now what happens is she's reading the scripture or she's in prayer and the lord puts on her heart you're the shunammite so now the whole course of events are going to be interrupted you see the devil wanted to take his life before his time but god said no you can't take his life so now he put faith in her heart he put a revelation in her heart i'm the shunammite but then she asked the question well where is my elisha now i just want you to think about this the the shunammite woman in the old testament knew where elisha was when when when her boy got heat stroke or whatever he said oh my head in the field and lay on his lap and then her lap and then died you know she said to the servant sadler mule we're going to where we're going to where he is but then in the new testament so that's the shadow but in the new testament she didn't even know where elisha was she didn't even know who her life she didn't even know not only where he was but who he was was he even there harlow so her faith was even greater than the old testament one then because the reality is always greater than the shadow the shadow is pointing to something other so there she is i'm the shunammite woman but lord where is my elisha and then he just happens to be upon the earth see that's why the lord put that on his heart put that on her heart rather and then so now brother branham is just traveling around going on meetings but then a storm begins to break out remember this is her face because it's been revealed to her that she's a shunamite causing a storm to ground a plane and there has to be a delay when that flight's going to be taken off and so brother brown's just walking down the street and you know singing and you know and he's looking at a window something hunting things or something and then and then a voice just says to him start walking why because there's a woman actually the more that that morning in the early hours actually had a vision or a dream that a man in a you know carrying a a a a briefcase in your dress a certain way with a hat would be who was who looked exactly like brother brown was walking past her past her front gate why did this all transpire because the lord gave her a revelation she's the schumann hallelujah jesus you we should we should look at the treasure in our hearts what's that treasure he said you're the bride a man didn't tell you that preacher didn't tell you that even the prophet didn't tell you that god told you that either he may have used a preacher or a prophet or a church but god had to inspire that to you and for you to realize i misses jesus hallelujah by his predestination grace i am one of them hallelujah but so so now that shunammite woman she got that revelation then god changed the whole outcome of that situation to ground a plane that had elisha on it gave her a vision or a dream that he was going to walk past the gate and then so she's there before dawn waiting hallelujah and then and then brother brown was walking and it's actually apparently quite a few miles from where the lord told him to start walking and where but the lord said just just start walking and he just starts walking on and then he he starts walking past her house and and she just says good morning parson and then she's and then he stops and says how did you know i was a person he says well i was praying and and and i saw you walking down the street but where's your briefcase he left it at the hotel wherever he was hallelujah this is all transpiring because the lord gave her a revelation of who she was in the scripture that's what i wanted to see this is this is not just a nice idea this is a reality hallelujah and then so and then and then he came into the house and he said well i've been in king's palace but it's nothing compared to this hallelujah and then and then he you know she began to tell him you know what was going on in her son and you know he was there on the bed crying it's getting dark in here or it's dark in here and you know and then and then and then he said to her well auntie why don't you lead us in prayer and she began to pray and the prophet said and you could tell she knew who she was talking to hallelujah no and then and then he and then and then and then and then she prays and then and then the prophet grabs him by the feet and then prays he says lord i don't really know why i'm here but you know i believe it's because of this and this is why i'm here and then immediately he starts saying it's getting light in here so he was on he was on his deathbed but then life began to come into his body again hallelujah and then brother brown said soon after that he was healthy and well and and and he just walked out of the house got a cab and went to the airport and it was the last call for his flight but the it wasn't the prophet's faith that that that turned the course of that boy from death to life it wasn't his faith it was her faith and that faith was because of a revelation i know who this is who you are in the scripture hallelujah amen so i'm just gonna i'm just gonna leave it with that i'll say now if she if you if you think about that now she had a revelation i'm not well you're repeating yourself no to me this is well maybe i'm very simple person but to me this is i like it if she could see herself if she could see herself as a shooter might and then the whole course of life changed because it was now it wasn't in the old testament no more it was living and her faith actually caused events to change hallelujah that her elisha would come mean now how much more you and i if you see yourself as david or you know you see yourself as joseph or whoever it may be in the scripture then your whole life will be actually changed based around who god shows you you are in the old testament hallelujah even even those in the new testament yes sir hallelujah why because that that revelation will change the outcome of your life amen hallelujah amen that's why we can rejoice when we read about the woman the wow or the philippian jailer whoever it may be you know god inspires you that's you well if that's the case hallelujah where's the others there hallelujah brother brown was saying and and i'll just finish with this quote then if jesus defeated satan upon faith knowing who he was he knew who he was that's why he defeated satan he was a predestinated creature he says are you ready congregation says amen what about the predestinated bride of jesus christ now you believe the bride is predestinated the predestined bride of christ now the church the word seed with everything that god promised to put in the church in it right now it's in it now everything's in order the holy spirit has been given the seed has been sown the evening light has been shining the sign of sodom that jesus promises here in malachi 4 a predestinated church he says o devil church of living god here and on tape too do you know where you stand amen do you know where you stand seated in heavenly places in christ jesus join here with christ blameless sinless redeemed by the blood of the lamb do you know you're in that condition yes remember faith is not about how you feel faith is not about what you see faith is not emotion amen faith is a revelation in the word of god so you may be feeling the worst you know is it incredible we read about the resurrection the disciples aren't skipping along rejoicing they're having the worst day of their life their world had fallen apart had it not the messiah they believed he was going to be the messiah was dead on the cross the the ministers that hold themselves up in some room the church treasurer committed suicide the whole thing fell apart and they're walking along sad the one they loved was murdered but then he came resurrected the greatest morning that there's ever been better than the first morning this is a better morning because it was a dual sun rising wasn't just a natural sun coming up but now the son was risen i mean a season of redemption had come a season of grace and salvation had come hallelujah and they're walking along broken now do you think they were full of faith no their world had fallen apart but yet here comes the resurrected messiah and he starts walking with them he says what's been going why are you sad and they're actually surprised what do you mean don't you know what's going on have you are you a stranger in the city we're in luke 24 you know where we are oh look remember brother ram says monster made clear by prophecy he says that's a prophecy and then so they're walking along broken sad here he comes doesn't reveal who he is and and they begin to fill him in with what's going on and then he says to them oh fools and slow of heart to believe the resurrected lord is walking with them and he opens the scripture and he opens the scripture and he opens the scripture to them did he fulfill this now let's turn here to psalms did he fulfill this let's go to isaiah 53 was he wounded zechariah pissed my hands of my feet was his hands pissed you know was he buried among the rich he'd go to all the prophecies concerning himself hallelujah but then the reason he went with them do you think they were feeling happy their hearts began to burn within them but they're still sad because their world had fallen apart but then he went with them and opened the scripture and walked with them until they realized he was resurrected and the whole reason that he did that is because they were part of that resurrection it wasn't just him that rose remember they had to go to pentecost and be resurrected from a life of sin and death to be alive in christ so he went with them until they saw who he was and that he that they were part of that same resurrection what's happened today sometimes we'll feel rapture ready we can be in the sunday night at camp and we can just literally feel like we're just going to walk into eternity and you know if the devil came in that place we're just going to chop his head off and you know you know bring it on you know you feel 10 million feet tall and twice as round and you know but hallelujah but you know but then but then that's not necessarily the condition will be when these bodies are changed because god is wanting them to see him wanting us to see it's not how you feel they felt heartbroken but yet they were part of the resurrection that feeling they had in their heart did not stop the resurrected lord walking with them and opening the scripture to them and showing them who he was in the dark resurrection it didn't hinder him one bit because it's not about how we feel it's who we are in him that matters hallelujah so now says i say faith is not a feeling faith is revelation i feel full of faith today i feel empty of faith today hold on what's this that's right yeah you know it's not like well now i'm full and now i'm empty like food it's not that kind of thing but you know so we shouldn't go by how we feel remember they were broken-hearted and the word came open to them like no one else had been been open to and they saw it was the resurrected lord hallelujah and this message is that same jesus walking with you that's why he's a personal god he opens the bible to you it becomes more than stories more than a nice idea the message becomes more than just doctrine and quotes and becomes a it's messiah the word is messiah and he opens it to you because why does he show it to you because he wants you to know you're part of the rapture hallelujah he doesn't he he hasn't come just to excite our you know give us a religion tickle our religious itch or however you want to put it you know but he come to walk with you that he would you would realize in spite of your ups and downs feeling full of faith feeling no faith feeling happy feeling sad feeling glad or feeling mad whatever feeling you have he's walking with you to show you you're actually part of me i'm taking you up into heaven soon and very soon we're going to see the king amen so do you know where you stand hallelujah amen the predestinated bride of christ now the church the word seed with everything that god promised to put in the church is in it right now it's in it now everything's in order the holy spirit's been given the seeds been sowed the evening lights have been shining the sign of sodom that jesus promised is here malachi 4. a predestinated church oh devil now i know i'm repeating myself but hey church the living god here and on tape 2. he's talking to me do you know where you stand lord make it more real do you know that you are called of god that the holy ghost reigns in your heart and every word of god is real to you holy oh brother how satan gonna stand against that how is he gonna stop that from growing he'll try sure he'll try but how's it gonna stop it from growing how is he gonna keep them signs from following it why they could throw them in jail they if they could i don't care uh what you do they've done tried it they've rotted in jails they'll feed the lions they were sawing asunder who's read the who um who's read the faith challenge report there are brothers in china that have been in prison since the start of the year because they are giving out bibles and message books and they're being a witness in in chinese prison and people are coming to the lord see put them in jail can't get it out of them hallelujah and and and actually if you read the report the translation work is like trembled by the believers since since since those brothers were put into prison see see it's amazing the devil tries to squish us down i remember there's a life in us that won't be squished that's why i just rejoice amen let the world fall apart hallelujah amen how is satan going to stand against that how is he going to stop that from growing how is he going to keep them science from following it why you could throw them in jail hey if if you could i don't care what you do they done tried it they wrote it in jails they feed the lions they are sworn asunder they jerk the pieces you can't kill it right a church that's pre-destroyed those who he foreknew like he did jesus he has called those who is called he is justified and those he has justified he has already glorified hallelujah i mean predestinated now in the last days with every seed so everything in order the the world is in its order hallelujah the time shaped up the church and it's ordered the seed of the evening lights the signs of like he said as it was in the days of sodom an angel of god the holy spirit coming down moving performing the signs that he did then malachi 4 promised he would send it in the last days what he promised and we see upon me all of it right here where works is amen amen amen amen do you love him amen sure right here in the last days a predestinated church knowing where they're standing sowed with the seed the holy spirit in the church he says satan be careful be careful devil you put your hand against one of god's anointed you're going to be in trouble hallelujah you're going to reap what you sow hallelujah but do you know where you stand hallelujah now we'll just put it back in as a question you go back to the temple 2000 years ago joseph and mary and jesus are there would it make you mad sad or glad would you be like anna blind to the world yet sing sing in the spiritual would you be like simon reveal to him that he won't die till he sees the lord's christ or would you be like those stealth starch religious women with their finely dressed little babies not wanting to be associated with the word made flesh remember the nature that's in you will dictate to you where you are in that i said lord jesus i want to be like simon i want to be like anna i want to be like those that you're upon the earth but you lead me straight to where you are i said lord i can now depart in peace because i've seen thy salvation amen shall we shall we stand tonight hallelujah and let's um let's pray together before we sing amen you won't be remembered in prayer raise your hands to the lord gracious father lord i just lord i feel like we've been running around in the service they're covering a lot of things but lord i just pray dear god that you would
