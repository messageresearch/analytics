you can be covered by the peace of God maybe you think you're musicians no place you may be in praise the Lord well it's great to have brother and Chris here and brother Phil sister blender got thank you welcome god bless you praise the Lord I mean let's just go to the scripture shall we I mean here we want the peace of God to cover us hey means let's go to the book of Deuteronomy and then we're going to go to Hebrews 11 that's what I am a short thought before we before we go to prayer that's not so just one scripture Deuteronomy 33 and verse 25 I mean who is happy to be a Christian no your brother Brad said you just can't lose being a Christian so we're here to win all right man he says they choose shall be iron and brass and as I and as thy days so shall thy strength be a means as thy days are so shall thy strength me and this go to Hebrews 11 and we're gonna read from verse 1 just a very familiar scripture but just want to just just take a small thought here I mean who's looking forward to camp praise the Lord we're gonna have a tremendous time I mean I think they cooked about one metric ton of carry today I mean so praise a look we're gonna we're gonna feast naturally and spiritually I believe I've been Hebrews 11 and verse 1 now the faith now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen but by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which to appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained a witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch was translated so his viii translated him that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him before before his his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it's impossible to please God so I say with faith it's impossible not to please go on you thank you vice versa for he that cometh to God must must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him we believe he is don't we and we believe he's a reward of them that diligently seek Him by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the of the righteousness which is of which is by faith by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he caught which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and when and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in his land of in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling and the Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which has foundations whose builder and maker of as God through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised their force praying there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky and multitude and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable these all died in faith not receiving I mean having not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth I mean this bow heads let's pray gracious Lord Jesus truly we desire that your peace would cover us we're so glad we can stand and proclaim that our chains of God we've been set free Lord you have redeemed us you have purchased us Lord and just want to pray father as we look into your word tonight I pray you're just writer raise our faith Lord God may use drink for now I'll walk with you dear Lord a move us into a channel for prayer Lord may you grant to feel glory anoint speaker and hearer loved one more time father may you just move on every heart Lord take control of the service for your glory we ask in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats tonight so I want to I want to just take a little thought where we read you know how how in in in verse 13 how Abraham and you know all the believers down through the ages they had incredible promises but we see that they you know Abraham as it said that they all these died in the faith not not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth so they were promised they were promised many things like Abraham he was promised at the land that he was called to go into would be his but we know the promise didn't fall to him but it fell to his descendants you know it was the children of Abraham four hundred years later they would be brought by a by a ministry of a prophet God himself would lead them his angel would lead them and they would receive the promise that that was given to Abraham and that's why when when God would come down into the burning bush and he would speak to Moses he'd say I am the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob so he was declaring to Moses I am the one that gave the promised Abraham but now I now is the season where that promise is going to be fulfilled hallelujah so now we are living and and you just think about that where Abraham didn't receive the promise but it's so gripped his life and he embraced it though singing afar off it changed his whole life his whole walk was according to that promise but yet he didn't receive it and I'm so glad that we are not living in a season where we are looking for something to happen way off in the future and maybe well one day someone will rise up the bride will take her position one day and you know maybe someone will take a rapture some day we're not looking for it in the future but now we're living to receive the promise hallelujah is every promise of the scripture I mean we are actually in the day where we don't just look at it we receive it hallelujah that's where I want to go I want to go this night because you know brother Brown would say he would say and I can find it here he speaks of how the angel of the Lord accompanies the message always he sees it and he sees it in 1954 he sees the angel sorry so time and decision he says he says the angel of the Lord accompanies the message always so where wherever the word as God accompanies that word to ensure it comes to pass now God was with Abraham we know that God was with Isaac and Jacob and God was with Moses and so the one that gave the promise to Abraham was now the one that would lead his children into the promise it was the very same God it wasn't a different God it wasn't a lesser God the same one in the beginning was the same one at the end now if the angel the Lord accompanies the message always then we should have such confidence where his word as he is present Amen it's more than just a man speaking you know on table more than ink on paper but God is there to follow his word that when someone receives that word Amen he anoints that word and makes them live in their lives how then he quickens you to his word they meant you know I was just thinking of you know we know words have great power words have great power they have incredible power I mean even even I speaking to our children they've got incredible power I'm in the you know the words we speak about each other or to one another they have incredible power and we should never ever diminish the power of words even even men with fallen fallen fallen men under the anointing of demon power can change the world you take a Dolf Hitler amen he stood there and he preached under inspiration and it changed the world by a fallen man being anointed by a demon power maybe but how much more a redeemed son or daughter of God under the Spirit of God speaking the Word of God hallelujah you know I was thinking of I was you know I was thinking of of the Apostle Paul let's go back Apostle Paul stay he was in jail quite a lot amen he would have a meeting and most the time he would end up in jail hallelujah but Sir imagine if we regards guarding the Apostle Paul we would see no doubt a man and you know he would maybe we wouldn't necessarily understand what he was saying when he was maybe praying in Hebrew and or praying in Greek whatever language he spoke to the Lord and but we would see a man that maybe wasn't too big he wasn't such a big strong man but he would get down on his knees and talk to God and and maybe we would we would see him and people would come into the cell or come by the under how visiting hours were in those days but you know the Apostle Paul would would either pick up his own pen and he would begin to write words down on scrolls or he would dictate those letters to ascribe and and and and they would be written down and then and then people would come along just imagine you're on guard duty and then and then someone visits the Apostle Paul's here and he and he feels inspired to give the scroll to someone that's good and then he goes off and he takes that if you're on guard you to eat by thinking well there's not too much about what's just being delivered I mean but that word changed the world I mean that word that word wasn't the Apostle Paul I might need that later yeah that work wasn't the Apostle Paul sinking it wasn't some man's religion I mean that was God coming in on into print form hallelujah and that word shook the world in his day I mean a little man sitting in a dungeon Holly just writing down what God would inspire to him I mean then it was written down and it was carried away maybe the guys didn't think too much of it but that was like nuclear bombs being released honey the devil's kingdom was being explode up here as the hill as the bombs take this hallelujah I mean a dinner was sit down and maybe the believers would unroll it and and then and in it that begin to read and the Angel Lord always accompanies the message always and God follows His Word and there were people there that were listening to those words to some it didn't mean anything but to saw others have been a lot hallelujah the summit didn't mean to my choice just a Jew is just a fanatic I mean but those who are predestinated to hear the word it was he alive polio was the Word of God being released to them and God followed that word and when they received it God quickened into their souls transform their lives hallelujah amen think about it he ever thought about that hallelujah and God shook the world through one man hallelujah and you just think about this day you know brother Brown the first recorded words well they got these recording gadgets hallelujah a word is being recorded because it's going to be released maybe not just in that generation of the people that hear it it's going to be put on tape because God you the other bride is can be fashioned by that word gonna be molded by that word hallelujah and then you heard it and the angel Lord accompanies the message because he's waiting for you to hear that word holy when you heard that word something moved on you may be like no other words dead I know it happened for me and God did it for a reason hallelujah he wasn't just waiting to make you some religious person have a different kind of idea no gods won't find his bride hallelujah and he quickens his bride to his word hallelujah he says he says in the message trying to God a service without it being the will will of God he says the word the evening message must-carry evening results the evening message must so evening seed it's not morning seed evening seed is that right the midday scene it's at seeds back there was denomination of diet parish but the evening time message will show evening time light will show evening time results the evening time missus Jesus time midday message showed midday results the beginning message showed the beginning results make creation he made his son in his own image in the midday in the evening time he makes a bride for it see what by his word how did he form the earth how did he speak it into existence by his word who was his son the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us how will he take his bride by the word not buy a new cart not by some theologians idea but according to his word he'll identify her hallelujah don't put one thing - it'll take one thing proper now leave it the way to see hallelujah now when I say the word will identify the bride that's just not ink on paper that's him I didn't define himself with you hallelujah now as we speak about promises we know you know you would you would sure agree with me what's the point of me saying that you know speaking of the promise of Abraham's day even though it would be you know it's a promise in the scripture it's not you know the promise of we're gonna go to the promised land it's a promise in the scripture but it's not for today no it's a promise in the scripture what's the good of me saying you know that that is going to be a king come to the throne promise in the scripture but not for today what's good to me saying that John the Baptist is going to come it's a promise but it's not today's promise right what's it going to be saying Messiah is going to come and purchase the salvation of the world and so I'm laboring the store because I just want you to think about it we're gonna wear to preach today's promises you had a look at today's promises Abraham and breaks the promise for his then that would embrace me is like and folding your arms wholly he took it to himself and see this is my promise this is what's for me hallelujah but what about what's for you I mean ever you look into the scripture to see what is your promise and it what's the promise for this day hallelujah say what's the good of speaking of a promise of the books gonna come up and win another he has holy the words already come up and God's covenant has been unveiled and this day to you hallelujah so now now we can stand here and say the promise we understand in the scripture is the translation of the loving bride hallelu to meet the meet the groom in the air amen and I'm so thankful that we're not standing there in the Apostle Paul's day when he would pin to the Thessalonians we which are alive and remain you know hinder them which are asleep for the dead in Christ rise first and then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up to meet them with the Lord to meet them in the air hallelujah and and no doubt when the Thessalonians read weed they said that's us hallelujah but he is prophesying not of that day just like Abraham Abraham's day he received the promise he didn't possess the promise so the first church age they were see the promise but they didn't possess it they died in Christ waiting for the bride to come in the last day hallelujah so now that's why I said we're not looking for a future we have to promise now everything God is going to do as in this generation you say well how can you put that in Scripture what Jesus said speaking of Israel when you see the fig tree put forth its buds you know that summer is nigh even at the doors and that generation shall not pass till all things before little hallelujah and Israel has been a nation simony Yod years however long that generations going off the scene they're holed up in years hallelujah so that means we are now living in the time holding the promises father fulfillment is far closer than when we first believed hallelujah so now if we're living now in the time when the promise is to be fulfilled what we have to think now so they soar the rapture is as a true Jubilee it's where people do not taste death but they walk from this dimension to the next dimension hallelujah that's a breaking of death I mean death literally loses its grip it's put under her feet and she goes from this world to the next world by the revelation that you've already been given I mean so now if that's the case then that bennett's then it's speaking of a true Jubilee I mean where people are no longer living under the bondage of sin no longer living under the oppression of this or the devil but every cycle that can be broken will be broken I mean every cycle of bondage will be broken sin cycle will be broken this revival will be broken every cycle must be broken in this age Holly that we're living in hallelujah we're not looking for another time we look we are now living in the time I mean when brother Branham prophesied of the of the bride's revival this bride age we're living in it hallelujah so now we are living in a season where everyone that is belongs to God must go free I mean there's a law in the Word of God that actually declares you cannot stay in bondage you cannot say subject to the devil any but you must walk free hallelujah under this word because it's cause it's a law of God just like gravity Zalora God that's the same I think it always works hallelujah so now we are living in a time where every cycle must be broken yes Amen even even the Jubilee cycle was a cycle but now there comes a time where we don't go we can't be sold back into slavery again hallelujah I mean we can't go back down and just and just tried too long and sin or trudged along and religion but now we're living at a time where all those cycles are broken the cycle of revival and death is broken within the church hallelujah we're living in that day amen and and so we what we must do as I read it you're in the beginning as like days are so shall thy strength be hallelujah so our strength cometh from the Lord I mean he is the strength of our life you read in Psalms 27 so this they may be wicked it may be your may be dark it may be terrible but as our days are so shall our strength be and we know when God does anything he doesn't equal the strength of the devil he's always greater than the strength of the devil I mean he was he said greater than a Sindhi that is in the world hallelujah and greater does not mean equal that means greater I mean so that means this power of God within you is greater than anything the devil can do how low you go start to look at what you hide man what you have how they don't look at what you don't have look at what you have holy Abraham had one promise and he walked with that one promise Holly he received the promise zone he received the body changed to receive that promise of lujah we've got more than just one promise hallelujah we've got many promises we should embrace them to ourselves and we should walk with God amen hallelujah so our strength and and I'll just finish with that as our days are so shall our strength be so never think this world is too dark I mean remember brother BAM told the story and and I remember going I think actually it was the only time I've been in South Africa we went into the fort down cake town that star fort and went down into the armory or sewing and they turned off a light and it was pitch pitch pitch black you couldn't see any you felt it and broadband tells a story about those people going down to a place like that and then and in the talk light turns off a lot and then the little girl starts screaming and so dark and so dark but she had a brother there said don't cry little sis there's a man standing prison that can turn on the light so doesn't matter how dark it was how how dark it feels there's a man standing present that can turn on the light and he say well I'm in a dark place there's a man standing prison now hallelujah the Lord Jesus Christ himself member the angel of the Lord accompanies the message always holler is severe a message believer the angel Lord accompanies you hallelujah and he is standing prison to turn on the light I mean profound said don't worry about how dark it gets is a man standing prisoner rapturous Church hallelujah don't fear there's a man standing prison holy I'm not talking about it just in these four walls wherever you go wherever you go wherever Abraham went Godwin hallelujah River Moses was God was wherever brother Brad was God was where the Apostle Paul was God was the scripture says I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee that means wherever I go he goes hallelujah I trust we're conscious of his presence and our ups and our downs he's there oh it's not when you feel like your reps are ready it's when you don't feel rapture ready he's still there hallelujah heavy in good days there bad day he's there sideways day he's there bad month good month bad yet good days prison hallelujah do you believe it I believe in it who me yes me hallelujah the slaves in Egypt you know they were there they were slaves but when God came down into Egypt said I'm going to fulfill the promise this is the season hallelujah and it's for you and Caleb just said it's for me didn't matter what condition here is and when he was in Egypt that's me I'm going to my I want my mountain respect doesn't matter what condition we think we're in member brother Bram cheek Pharaoh looked out at the Israelites hit a button saw a bunch of slaves Moses looked out same windows and say that's God's people that's God's heritage that depends how you look at yourself yes hallelujah amen shall we stand and maybe sing a song and then we'll go to prayer hallelujah we have so many promises spend some time looking finding them this is for me this is for me you like read the book of Ephesians make it personal let's see it for the Wii let's wait this just as they're well they probably already here but let's just do it quickly anyway that's got Ephesians one there and this is read from verse three let's just read down you don't make it personal hallelujah doesn't matter if you having a good day bad day that doesn't change God's promise hallelujah they said be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ so when it says I say me he says we say I okay let's let's read this out loud blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed me with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen me in him before the foundation of the world that I should be holy and without blame before him and love having predestinated me and to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace and he has made me accepted in the beloved and whom I have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace we're in here - bounded towards me in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto me the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together anyone in Christ both which are in heaven and on earth even in him in whom also I have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that I should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ and whom I also trusted after I had heard the word of truth the gospel of my salvation and whom also after I believe I was filled with the holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of my inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession into the praise of his glory he just keep reading it that way hallelujah it's a personal love letter to you it's not just to the Ephesians when God heads up all right that's the Ephesians just thinking of you I mean this is this sing that song Amazing Grace with the chains of God shall we I'm glad my chains are gone hallelujah praise the Lord [Music] Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that's a the rest like
