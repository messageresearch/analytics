thank all the cleaners amen amen because you know we we turn this place upside down they come and clean it through the week and it's all ready to go again so God bless you all amen amen so let's go to Micah chapter 7 verse 7 8 then we're going to go to Romans chapter 8 says therefore I will look unto the Lord I will wait for the god of my salvation my God will hear me re not against me oh my enemy who has an enemy this morning when I fall I shall arise when I sit in darkness the Lord shall be a light unto me amen amen let's go to Romans Romans chapter 8 amen as well Romans and and and 8 and verse1 15 go down to verse 23 it says for we for ye so you should say I me have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but I have received ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby I cry or we cry Abba Father you got to make the scripture personal the the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and of children then ears ears of God and Joint ears with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to Van uh vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for for the adoption to Wi the Redemption of our body amen amen may the Lord bless his word you may have your seats I want if I could take a title this morning I would take it from Micah 7 and8 I shall arise we are living in a such an incredible time and I trust you know Peter says to way stir these things up in remembrance so if I go over some things that you've already heard before I trust it sinks a little bit deeper amen so now we are living in a season where the manifestation or that word actually means the revealing of the sons of God is being lived out amen that there are people upon the Earth that are not dead and trespasses and sins and are slaves to the enemy but they are are victorious amen they are sinless they are free people amen I trust you can say that's me amen that they are free people hallelujah that the that the revealing of the sons of God this scripture we just read is being manifested in your mortal body Hallelujah so we see Micah here the enemy he says Rejoice not against me oh my enemy when I fall I shall arise when I sit in darkness the Lord shall be a light unto me and we understand that you're the prophet of God he would go to Isaiah and chapter 60 and verse 1 and maybe let's just turn there because when the you know when brother Brenham would would speak a sermon he is declaring a prophet declares things and our Prophet declared when when when he would read a when when he would go to Isaiah 60 and verse1 he would speak a sermon Shalom God's peace be upon you and he would say arise Shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee amen so he is declaring now it's time to arise amen shine amen because the glory of the Lord has risen Hallelujah we've been gone down through seven Church ages and we're in the last Church age we know that but God God and this last hour has Shone a light that is stronger than anything that's been from Adam till now amen that God himself would be revealed in flesh in a redeemed son and that the word that would be spoken out of those prophets lips amen would have a creative power Hallelujah that would take a people that are in slavery and will go into it now and they would actually as Satan dethroned Adam because Adam forfeited his right to be God of the earth out of love for his wife am mean so now the table has been reversed and there's a people that are not under the bondage of Satan anymore but they Dethrone Satan and they take back what belongs to them Hallelujah because man was not made to be a slave I mean Adam's we Adam's Fallen race was not made we were not created to be slaves I mean a slave has no say what they do every day they have no say of what they eat what they wear what they do they are just pushed around like a you know just a piece of you know just an object and we know when you know you're on the slavery days you even go back into the you know Old Testament days where where Israel was was slaves in Egypt you know the Pharaohs thought more of their horses amen they thought more of their pets than they did the Israelites but yet the Israelites were were God's chosen people hallelujah and the devil doesn't care he doesn't think too much of us amen I'm sure you've come to that conclusion he doesn't think too much of us he's not scared of us but he's afraid if we can just get a hold of the promise of God Amen that that life would come into you and I amen the life that comes into you he's afraid of it Hallelujah so now we are not made remember Lucifer was made the Angels were made to be servants right they were made to be servants even Lucifer himself was the anointed Cher that cover he was a servant now a servant can never raise higher than the royal family they because they can never be part of the family right so now if he's meant to be a servant if he is ruling your life he is out of his position and you are out of your position right because Angels were made to serve you you were not made to serve Angels it doesn't matter if the angel is fallen or is or is still in the service of God they were still made to be servants but but us my friends were never made to be servants we are the sons and daughters of God Amen Allelujah We Are Made In His Image we're part of the family amen and the and the and the sons and daughters of the king do not serve the servants the servants serve them Hallelujah so now therefore if that is true which it is now even the Devil Himself must obey your voice amen because you are higher than him amen hallelujah we were created we were created that he would be under our feet amen and this is the hour where Satan all things are placed under the bride's feet amen hallelujah because we are not waiting to arise because the light has already come amen and and the light the Lord has put a light upon us that we shall arise if you're sitting in darkness my friend do not wait stay in darkness amen amen do not stay with just a fig Leaf religion amen amen you know a a message fig Leaf religion don't try and justify yourself amen come to him and he will restore you and place you where you should be hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I'm so glad the power of the blood in this day is incredible anden you think about the how God can take a person and transform them and then not only transform them but they gain ground and they gain victories every day amen all all complexes get under their feet amen human human traits that are passed down are Broken Hallelujah even you people who have a temper you see it passed down through a family or a lust problem or unforgiveness problem but then when that when that person who who who now has that problem comes under the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah they don't need to worry about those things anymore amen because those things they get free from them Hallelujah and if the enemy tells you you can never be free cuz it's been in your family for Generation to generation that's a lie that is a Lie from the bottomless pit I would not accept it I would not hold on to it I would return it back to where it came from Hallelujah that's what we must do because man as I said Man was created to have total dominion over the Earth we read in Genesis 1 127 when God created man he said go so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth so now if God is all powerful and man is created in His image then man is all powerful remember all things are possible to them that believe so there's nothing impossible with you I mean many times we know there's nothing impossible with God but now now it becomes a stage where there's nothing impossible with the believer because all things are possible to them that believe hallelujah amen so if God has total de your he God is God over everything he has total Dominion right so if Man was created in His image then man was to have total dominion over the Earth but then as I so that that is what we're been called to be restored to amen amen and I believe we're living in the hour this is not a carrot too far away maybe I'll grab it one day now is the hour friends the Saints of all ages have been waiting for where you are right now and if you could just recognize the power that's within your within you amen that the word is neither even in thy mouth you don't have to obtain anything you don't have to you evolve yourself into something God makes you thus Hallelujah you know as I read last Sunday brother Braham says that when Jesus was in the was in the desert in his Temptations He said now God himself was going to show that the weakest of Christians amen could take the word of God and defeat Satan any place anytime anywhere amen showing it doesn't matter what you think you are we're got to get our eyes off the off this guy amen stop stop trying to analyze your walk on what you think you are amen this is an unconditional Covenant amen God said I have made thee thus and you'll be thus amen amen so stop looking at the man in the mirror and start looking at this amen because we are a people of the open book and we'll go into it later on so God has released everything Adam had fell from and forfeited amen he has given back to man amen and now if that is the case now God has written a covenant with you am mean the prophet told us when Jesus was hanging on Calvary God was writing a covenant with the families of the earth amen so he was writing a promise with you Hallelujah that I'll not leave you a slave amen I'll not leave you down and beaten downtrodden amen but you'll arise you'll rise above your enemy hallel that they will be downrod they'll become the slave hallelujah amen this is how it's meant to be but we know so man forfeited he fell from his position as God over the Earth because he could not lose a part of himself you think of Adam he you know he waited it up he thought I cannot spend eternity without part of me yeah amen and Out of Love he knew he knew he had more ribs and even Medical Science has shown that you can remove a rib a certain way it'll regrow amen he knew he had more ribs but he didn't have another feminist part of himself so he could not stand the thought of spending cuz he was eternal at that stage before he fell he could not stand the thought of being being without the feminist part of himself he would he would be empty amen he wouldn't he'd be missing the vital part the you're the better heart amen all Brothers said amen amen hallelujah amen so you know so he forfeited his crown as as God over the Earth in order to to try and save his wife and so by him now by one man the scripture tells us sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned so now a man where once he was made in the image of God all the attributes that were in God were in Adam he fell from that image and now he became a in a fallen State and so now whenever God has ordained positions like a king or a priest or a prophet or whatever it is something always fills the void that that person is not staying in that place you take Ahab he was King over Israel God ordained him to be king you know for someone to be king but because he didn't fully possess his office as king Jezebel filled the void that's right and something will always fill the void yes and so now you've got to be careful with with M and dad children those are officers husband wife father mother those are God ordained officers and if you do not possess that office take full responsibility of it something will fill that voice amen amen cuz it's God ordained and so now man fell from his position as as as God over the Earth so now Satan became the prince of the power of the air now brother bam he says and he says and let us reason together in 1955 I was going to read a few quotes now because people no this is this is just me people ask why do bad things happen and the first one they always blame is God if God is so good and just why do bad things happen it's very simple because man fell from his position and Satan took his place that's why there's that's why there's storms that's why there's natural disaster that's why there's sickness and strife between nations and War and killing and bloodshed it's because Satan is the prince of the power of the air am mean that's why bad things happen because man forfeited his place and fell right and so now Satan has taken his place he says and come and let us reason together in 1955 our public school I mean he's speaking about brother Billy Paul now man has fallen from Eden and continues to fall and brother bam and and come let us reason in 55 he begins to recount how brother Billy Paul he was he was young and he got out and you know he was in the schools and he started smoking cigarettes and so now brother Braham he saw a vision over him of him so you know you know um smoking and and he asked his son what are you doing smoking cigarettes he said I'm not I said don't lie to me Billy and he he commenced crying and and and Billy Paul said I won't do it no more daddy and he went out he kept on doing it he wasn't hiding it he can't hide it no no here's here's someone who's born in a fallen condition and his dad his dad is Malachi 4 incredible imagine in that house and he even tried to lie to his dad no I'm not but of course God chose any everything and so now here was someone who said I won't do it no more and this is our condition too without a birth without a new birth we can intend to do right we can desire to serve God but unless our hearts have changed unless we've been converted amen we still have a fallen sin nature that we're born with and so he saw he saw Billy you know um he said I've seen a vision and the Lord showed me that Billy had disobeyed me and had jumped through a window and was going laughing Head Over Heels like that down down down um um on through eternity turning over and over and when I come out of the vision I was screaming at the top of my voice oh God don't take my boy only boy I have don't take him Lord I was screaming at the top of my voice and he says I told Billy even told him about the vision he said this is your state now it just goes to show you know someone can have a a vision of your life am mean can come and tell you about it can come and try and correct you about certain things but unless God comes and catches you amen unless the hands of God catch you we would be falling Hallelujah so people come and try and reason to you and say this is the way of righteousness is the way you should go you shouldn't do these things and and it may even sound right to your mind but if you're if you're still in a fallen State you will still go that way amen and that's why that's why we need God to catch amen amen and then then you know the rest of the story he went out fishing you know and then he you know and then he got you know he caught a cold he got a shot of penicillin Billy puled it and he ended up in hospital with a was an antic shock and he was going to die yeah this was now brother bam was crying out save my son and God's going to save him and then he's dying and then and then brother B's told get to him right quick you know and then he um and then he and he gets to the bedside and and and his son asks him pray for me Daddy he says no you do the you've done the sinning you do the praying and that's why it comes down to you and God amen amen you have to get serious amen you're you're the one you said I've heard this all you for years no but you're the one you got you're the one that's got to really cry out you're the one who's got to get to a space of desperation and then so he began to pray and then brother BR knelt down by the bedside he be to pray quietly he saw the same vision and his son falling he saw these two arms come strong arms catch him and pick him up and place him to where he was in the beginning Hallelujah but that was all of us amen we were all falling amen we're all and laughing thinking we're having a glorious time amen you may come you may have been raised in church amen but you're still falling whether you like it or not whether we like to think about it or not unless God catches us am amen we will continue to fall and we'll continue to laugh cuz man has a of nature to begin with but thanks be to God I trust who's been caught today amen who who felt the mighty arms of Jehovah catch them H and lift them up hallelujah amen so that's that is the way that man has been born amen but thanks be to God we don't remain that way we need God's hands of Grace Strong hands of the Lord to catch us amen and we need to call out upon God for those who are unsaved amen yes we got throw away this this putting up an image of everything's fine amen cuz if you cuz the devil could put you in a corner with that kind of mentality everything's fine praise the Lord Brother Hallelujah and and you can be falling you can be broken am mean you can have great needs but you have to speak it that's right you have to be the one that goes to God Amen you got to be the one that goes that talks to your pastor amen and get prayer because he is the high priest of our profession and he can't act on your behalf unless you speak it he cannot his hands are tied you H you tie we tie the hands of all the almighty God that made heavens and earth we tie his hands cuz we don't speak amen so speak the word amen if you have a need don't be afraid that's right we're in a battle together friend hallelujah we're in a battle together and we you know that song brother Isaac wrote my sword will not return empty you know what that means that means I've drawn my sword and it will take the head off the one I'm going to kill and that what it means it will not return empty and that should be the burning fire in our souls is that we will defeat the enemy amen we are you remember a Kinsman a kinsman redeemer he is our kinsman redeemer that's right amen he became flesh he became man to redeem us back to himself right but part of being a kinsman redeemer is the Avenger of blood amen so the Kinsman now has the has the privilege to find the enemy drag him out of the City of Refuge have a court hearing which he has amen and put him to death if he did it if he did it on purpose so now our enemy Hallelujah this has come open amen amen and just like in Eden where where where God stood there with Adam and Eve and The Serpent and it narrowed down to one because you've done this serpent on your belly you'll go he traced it back to the source and it's the same thing now now in this day there's been a there's been a court hearing you know we think sometimes our judgment is being poured out upon the Earth we live in a terrible time we forget that's just one side of a of a judge brother R said when when when the Lord came on down there sunset Mountain the cloud there he says he's the mighty wig one supreme judge of heavens and earth and sometimes we just think oh that's just judgment being poured out upon the um ungodly oh know because in a court hearing there's always two parties yeah one will be found guilty and one is found innocent right and so now he came down as Supreme judge and he has found Satan to be guilty amen amen he traced it back he traced it back through the word where did all this come from that's right amen it was Satan in the beginning iniquity was found in his heart when he's in the heavens that's right and he was cast down to the Earth Hallelujah but so he's been found guilty but then he's also judged the bride righteous Hallelujah he has judged us amen he is part of uses thank you Lord does that mean something to you friend so it's not just judgment as and they're going to be they're going to receive a judgment we received a judgment but we've been paron we' received pardoning Grace in this hour Hallelujah that's why brother bradam says now the power of the blood I me when you confess your sins into the blood of Jesus Christ amen it it is transferred from off of you it goes on the head of Satan and he takes it to the Lake of Fire hallelujah amen amen that is the power we don't have to carry you don't have to carry a bur you don't have to carry unforgiveness you don't have to carry some complex or pain or hurt from the past you can let go if you want to let go of it you can amen amen because God respects your choice amen he respects your choice you have a choice this morning do you want to hold that baggage do you want to hold on to it or do you want to let it go he won't take nothing from you he doesn't mug his children beat them around and steal what he wants to he waits for you amen and nothing will happen unless you say it amen so it's your choice you know a sheep is not a beast of burden amen you ever seen a sheep as a pack animal carrying a burden no it's not built it's not built to be a pack animal we're not made to carry those kind of Weights of sin and burdens Lord we're not built that way friends so don't try and be it amen hallelujah so now let's go to Ephesians chapter 2 I'm so glad I tell you do not let the devil lie to you that's right there is nothing that God canot restore as I said he's the kinsman redeemer he redeems back to places back in our original position and so there is nothing he cannot restore you try him one day oh no I can't that can't be made right go try him one day there is nothing he there's no marriage he cannot restore there's no relation ship he cannot restore amen there's no walk with God he cannot restore amen there is nothing he cannot restore this is an age of restoration sometimes we just think of all the true Doctrine being restored no it's not just that amen it's a true Harmony between a husband and wife a true family relationship being restored Hallelujah we live in that hour that's right I'm so glad it's that case there's nothing God cannot do amen that's right Ephesians 2 and 1 and you have he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins when in times past you walked according to the course of this world see you're a slave according to the prince of the power of the year the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation see even the Apostle Paul throws himself in here we all had our conversation in times past and the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved and ha raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace and his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus under good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them so as we can see we were slaves amen we walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air so we were once a slave under what Satan would have us do it doesn't matter if we're raised in church how good our family was whatever we were all born slaves that's right but that is not the end of the story amen even we you know you when we think of the lust of our flesh you know normally we think of some kind of sexual sin but really the desires of the flesh the lust of the flesh is really just doing what you want to do what does my body feel like doing today I'll just relax you know it's just it's just being caral that's right amen but now but God would not leave us in that because there's a position that he wants to raise us to and we read there in verse six he has raised us up together and made us sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now this heavenly places is the believer's position in Christ amen right so it's the position that Adam was in before the fall amen but now because man fell Satan took that position and became the prince of this power of the earth so there has to be now a war where Satan is the squatter cuz he doesn't own it it's not his rightful position amen that is not what God ordained him to be he with me and so there has to be a revolution or a war whatever you want to call it where man now is elevated defeat Satan and takes what should be man amen now brother baram he um he says in he says in the mighty conqueror he says and while after I mean and after a while you're a cigarette fiend he'll tell you there's no harm in taking a socialable drink I've stood by them before they went to Gallows stood by them before they was electrocuted and and they would say I never intended to says he to be a gambler I never intended when I was playing cars to be a gambler I never intended to botle out of a filling station I never intended to be a thief but only thing the devil wants you to do is start and he'll take you on see we never we never really you know it's like the prodical son he never intended to leave the promised land and and fall into such a state where he was feeding an animal that was an Abomination to him yes and he was in such a deprived State he wanted the food that the scraps of food given to the pigs he never foresaw his decision would take him there and it's the same thing with us when we have a selfish desire I want to I want to do this for me amen and you step out of the word you never foresee it would take you to certain places right but thanks be to God we don't have to stay there amen that's why people say I never intended to do such and such it's because you're still a slave and he says get over on his ground one time and watch him you know what it means to do wrong but there's an influence of the power of Darkness the prince of the power of the air that leads you traps trapped into these things you've got to stand up separate yourself from the things the World come out and live for Christ that's right that's in prodical in 50 and then 1956 the Great and Mighty conqueror and in the great Millennium which is to come the Bible said Rejoice all ye heavens and ye holy prophets for the kingdoms I mean for the uh Earth I mean you holy prophets of the Earth for the kingdoms of this Earth have become the kingdoms of our Lord and He Shall Rule and Reign forever now we will become we'll have no more war there when he comes no more sickness no more trouble notice when he died there was so little spoke of of his Ascension it's one of the greatest days when he ascended up amen CU all over the Earth since since the day in the Garden of Eden that sin was committed all Heavens was shut off from mankind Satan is the prince of the power of the a that's right why art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer no man can see into Glory no man could understand because the power is just above us Heaven means atmosphere above and then all these Powers were shut off from mankind because of sin amen that's how bad it was when Man became a slave that we were trapped upon the Earth we couldn't have any access to heaven but I'm so glad amen that one day amen amen the first promise that that God ever made of redemption was that the seat of the woman was going to come and undo everything that that that Satan did through the serpent that day amen that when heaven was shut off you that's why you read in Genesis 5 where the sons of God I mean sons of Adam then they began to call upon the name of the Lord because they calling upon his name cu wanted to know when will this be undone when will we Return to Eden amen and we're about to step into Eden hallelujah hallelujah amen so they were calling because they knew Heavens were shut off imagine that you're sitting around a campfire and your granddad or great Granddad is Adam the topic of the conversation always be you know you see that Hill there I moved it I didn't like this tree I said tree move over there and it obeyed me hallelujah amen I just I just rearranged this just right and you know Eve wanted it this way so I said move here be a plane and do this you know and then from one day to the next I could say the I I'd say the same words so I'll show you Mountain be there or removed it doesn't move tree be moved it's still there imagine that there'd be a longing but no doubt thatd always come end the story but you know then he came we were afraid when he came cuz we thought we were going to be destroyed But Here Comes The Judge Amen to Pardon his children to give them a promise me they're not going to stay in that situation Hallelujah then we heard the voice of God walking in the garden I was afraid I never knew what it was like to be afraid I had a fear come upon me Hallelujah then he came down and he closed us with skins lamb skins he killed some Lambs covered us up covered our sin up we felt the blood dripping down our legs as the prophet said as as we walked out of the garden Hallelujah imagine that kind of conversation and how how impossible it would be for Adam to really describe the greatness of being in the garden amen because it's greater than the best day of our life it's better than the best I whatever the best moment of your life is it's far greater than that amen words can not even touch it but yet then they had a desire Lord when is this going to come when is this going to come back but heaven was shut off but then under the blood of bulls and goats man had had a limited access to heaven where under the blood of an animal he just think an animal does not animal blood doesn't change us many times when we we look at ourselves I was thinking about this in the week you know we always look at the negative side of ourselves man yeah that's man's condition we always look at the negative we always think you know we always see the negative sides of ourselves oh but look at the positives being too proud no I don't think so and we always think then and then if we look at the negative side of our walk then we get a fear or God's going to deal with us we need to be corrected and you begin to get a fear between you and God but you just got to think about Israel coming I was thinking about Israel coming from Egypt to the promised land here they were traveling through Moab on their journey and there was a false prophet there that they hide Moab hide balum and he came down and he he gave the same sacrifices that Israel did the spirit of God Came Upon him and now God is going to speak his opinion of Israel and he says I see no iniquity in Jacob hallelujah amen I see no sin in them I see nothing wrong with my people and here's a people they're under the blood of bulls and goats they're unconverted am me they still have caral nature I mean but when God looks down upon them he says I see no iniquity I see nothing wrong with them Hallelujah they had their problems they offered countless thousands of bulls and sheep and goats to cover their sin am mean none of their sacrifice changed their nature am mean this the very nature that caused them to do the sin and give the sacrifice after they gave the sacrifice they had the same nature it didn't change them one bit but yet when God looked down upon them he says I see no iniquity amen for the shout of the king is among them Hallelujah CU God was walking with his people amen if that's under the blood of bulls and goats friends how much more people under the blood of Jesus Christ I me that are walking with him in this hour in his word hallelujah you got this is how God sees you friend I see no iniquity in them Hallelujah you just got to you got to look through God's eyes amen oh how am I ever going to take a Rapture he says I see no iniquity in you your sins are not just covered they're done away with thank you Lord hallelujah they are not attributed to your account at all your slate has been washed am hallelujah amen so under the blood of bulls and goats man had a limited access Amen to Heavenly places but under the blood of bulls and goats Hallelujah they conquered a land they came out of Egypt under the power of power of God amen the Red Sea was parted plagues came down on on on Egypt amen and God liberated his people under the blood of bulls and goats and brother baham said now if man could do that under the blood of bulls and goats what about a people under the blood of Jesus Christ amen where it's not just covered it's been it's been divorced from theml Hallelujah that the chasm between you and God has been bridged amen he says now we could have real sermon he's preaching in the prach Lord hallelujah oh but I'm not a prophet the bride of Christ amen I will ask you a question when alasa went to get Rebecca who was greater amen Alazar or Rebecca Rebecca was greater Rebecca was the one that the you know that that the father wanted for his son amen that's Hallelujah alaza was just a servant amen amen and here we are hey we should I I love the life of the Prophet I preach out his you he can learn so much just from his testimonies you know how he conducted himself his character and nature those things are incredible but we place them sometimes up here too much yes he was the servant to get you and we'll belittle our our own walk amen cuz we think how can we ever be like that he's the servant hey he's the bride like we are I trust this comes out in the right way amen but you're the one God's looking for he say behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet Hallelujah and so you've got to put yourself in that scripture say that's me Hallelujah even even I'm the only one who has sent for here I am hallelujah amen and he's furnished us with what we need to make all the rest of the journey that's right Hallelujah so you know he sees no iniquity in us we have a power you say well I don't have a Ministry like brother brandham all of the age was manifested in his ministry now it's in a multi membered body amen but the Same Spirit may not be the same quantity that was in him a portion of it still in you brother said like in Jesus was the fullness of God here B it's like the ocean but then now God just took it's like getting a teaspoon of that ocean it's the same quality of water in the teaspoon as it is in the ocean it's just a less amount but it's the same quality amen it's the same thing with the Holy Ghost there's no weak part of God Amen there's no weak part of the Holy Ghost amen there's no less or greater it's all the same quality of spirit amen to the same one that spoke the worlds into existence comes and dwells in you and there is nothing impossible with you amen friends right take the safety off the gun amen amen take the take the governator off the engine amen take your restrictions away Hallelujah you say well I've never seen it done before it's been done before I've never seen the dead raised they've been raised I've never seen demons cast out they've been cast out I've never seen God come down and shake a place and thr over the spirit it's happened Hallelujah we can't limit God with all this is how I am and I'm just there's no weak part of the body there's no greater part than the other part every part of the body is important every part of the body is just as powerful as the other it's just different offices and places amen if I break my little toe the smaller whatever the smallest bone in the body is if I break it the whole body will know I may never even think about that bone until it's broken but when it's hurting the whole body hurts because but when that bone is strong the whole body is strong amen so every part of the body is important so never belittle I'm Just a Nobody I'm never seen the inward Parts if I didn't have any organs I would not be standing here right now you never see my organs I hope you never do cuz something went seriously wrong but I need them that's the inward part of the body amen so it doesn't matter what we put our eye I've never seen I'm just behind the scenes that's still that's even now my heart is behind the scenes it's very important I need it my brain how much is there I don't know but I need it you understand so do not diminish what you are amen hallelujah the same God that was in the prophet the same God that became flesh in Jesus Christ the same God in the apostles the same God down through seven Church ages is present and that same God I trust is in you and if he's in you brother says that if a man I'll say or a woman speaks the word that is Anointed speaks the word of God across his lips their lips is the same as deity speaking Every Mountain must move nothing can stand before that man I say or that woman Hallelujah you say well how can that be me if God is in you that is you amen amen we are called to believe for all things amen doesn't matter if we've never seen it it's been done amen there is nothing new Under the Sun sometimes we take that as other things there's nothing new so man's been taken up into heaven come back that's been done the dead have been raised Nature's been taken control of every sickness has bowed everything that can be named has bowed to the name of Jesus Christ yes amen every Power of Hell everything is bowed we've had a record of it it's been done amen the pillar of fire moving down in a congregation that's happened amen you say well I've never seen it well brother BR say it's like a blind man who's never seen in his life he goes out when it's sunny and that's about a week here during the year and they feel the Sun Ray on their skin they feel the effect of the Sun but they're blind so they don't know what's shining on them they need to ask someone who shine I mean who can see what is that it's the Sun and it's the same thing in this day and hour we may never see the pillar of fire but we feel the effects of the race we feel the effect of his anointing thank you Lord hallelujah amen amen why are you saying these things we friends you you say oh I'm just don't be on the grand stand the reason this word has come to you is because you're part and will come to it you're a part of this being fulfilled that is the reason that God has revealed it to you that's why you're here this morning it doesn't matter what you feel about your walk with God the reason you are here amen that you endure and you keep walking with the Lord is because you're part of the vision amen hallelujah amen amen now he says in the future home says Heavenly places he says he's the prince of the power of the air he he keeps off he Wards off the blessings from God and there comes Thunderbolts of lightning and Strikes the Earth and everything from the heavens sheets of ice and rain and typhoons and storms and everything comes from above which is Satan the prince of the power of the year that's why these bad things happen amen and as we read so Christ the mystery God revealed he says what is Heavenly places Heavenly places is the believer's position in Christ so now there's a war going on where man is retaking his position as God of the earth amen you say well that's going to happen in the Millennium now God is going to demonstrate it now in a people that there's a people upon the Earth that have dominion over hell death in the grave amen it has Dominion everything of the enemy is conquered remember the devil's already conquered amen he's already defeated we Face a defeated F foe amen he does he's just a bluff you got to call his hand you hear the prophet say Satan you're nothing but a bluff amen amen you have to call his hand don't be afraid he's got no gun he's got no weapon amen do not be afraid of him you have to call his blood Hallelujah now let's go to Ephesians 6:10 and I heard this um coming from the Sunday school I say praise the Lord amen Ephesians 6:10 now this is our Warfare Ephesians 6:10 it says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that ye may able to stand against the walls of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places now this word high places the same as Heavenly places we read about in Ephesians 2 amen so there's so there's demon powers in a place where which is actually ordained for you that you actually have to cast them down and take your rightful position in Christ hallelujah amen so there is a war now we fight against demon powers that's why you find big cities there's more demons there where people are there's a greater Congregation of devils amen so now there is and we understand Satan's kingdom he's the ruler but it's a broken thing but there's demon powers over cities and Nations amen over suburbs and areas and we rule against we we fight against them amen amen but we have been given dominion over them amen just like Daniel Daniel was praying he prayed what 20 OD days waiting for the answer from God and the angel that was coming to bring the answer was fighting against a demon power and and that demon power was blocking the visitation of the Angel amen and if the say you if that's a you know I was thinking today I didn't work it out but one will chase a th000 and two 10,000 that means three will chase 100,000 four will chase a million five will chase 10 million six will chase 100 million seven will chase I think am I going a billion now yeah is that seven seven now there's been 2,000,000 demons released from the river eup frics which I think is 200 million or 200 million million okay there's more Believers in this room compared to them there's more for us so there's what 60 on I how many people are here just say there's 60 people that is more power you understand you can chase all of the powers of hell all the Believers in this room United together can can can chase all the powers of Hell upon the Earth have you ever thought about that oh there's so much Darkness oh there's so much light a hallelujah oh there's so much evil there's so much good Hallelujah there's more power friends we could we have more if all of hell if there was a pitch battle between us and all of hell we would win amen cuz we actually have more power than them anyway Hallelujah but that's how powerful Unity is amen now so man has been fighting this battle to Dethrone Satan out of out of heavenly places but now because but now we've come into a season where God is adopting or placing his children back into Heavenly places amen that the power of the blood now is restoring a people back to their original position so we are called to tear Satan's kingdom down Amen to break the cycle of generational traits and curses which are not of God Amen the things that Trace through families we have the authority and power to break them amen This Is the End you know brother B spoke of a season of Revival and death and Revival and death you know we've come to the end of that season that's right right we're not here just to have a season of Revival and death but now he himself has come in spirit form to break that cycle amen that now the things that once plagued us must come to an end amen amen you know God God told Joshua to circumcise the people again and he told them to do that and he says now I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you you got to read about it so there came a there came a time in their walk where the the slave history that they had all of their past everything that for 400 years they were in bondage and you know down in Egypt that reproach was rolled away amen right and now we are living in that same kind of hour now we're not this side of Jordan we've crossed over but there has to come a time where God actually anchors it down into your heart the reproach of your old life the reproach of what you used to be cuz don't let your past condemn you the the reproach of what you used to be has been rolled away Hallelujah because in God's mind he knows you're forgiven he knows you're sinless he knows you're perfect I mean he knows you've been redeemed and called and Justified and glorified am mean he knows those things but he needs you to know it he needs you to recognize what you are am mean if God is for us who can be against us hallelujah it's God that justifies you God that calls God that glorifies amen he that have called I've also Justified he have Justified I've already glorified it's easy to say but God needs you to know hallelujah amen now we read there in Romans 8 the manifestation or the revelation of the sons of God the whole earth is waiting for us to come to our position I've heard this for years but now's the hour yes amen amen where it's not just maybe a doctrine that goes forth becomes a living reality you see like you going to you know we all have sure trials and hardship you going to a believer's home and you see there's like Eden is now just being created yeah there's a peace in you know there can be Strife you I mean cuz we're all all Temptations we suffer com you know all those things but yet there is something there's an atmosphere that the believer lives in that it becomes common to us and we take it for granted and we actually begin to think we're living below our privileges sometimes but people will come into your house that know nothing about God or even just denominational people and they will be so amazed by the atmosphere amen amen by by by how your family is and it's not good behavior it's not good behavior it does it but God has come down don't take it for granted am don't take it for granted the atmosphere that you live in every day don't let it become common to you amen amen amen amen because why we're said he made us he's made us to sit in Heavenly places amen amen so he's going to make us sit there Hallelujah you don't have to try and climb up there he makes you sit there hallelujah amen let's go to Revelations chapter 10 just quickly CU we have a responsibility Revelations 10 and we'll read from verse 8 as I said heaven was shut off from man but then Jesus came amen Jehovah's salvation Came Upon the Earth the greatest man to be alive God Emmanuel our Kinsman came down amen hallelujah opened up Heaven glory amen that that that that that from his from from his death burial Resurrection now into Pentecost now heaven was fully open to a people and when we're a people who once scared you know like Peter tried to cut a guys air off swore and deny the Lord when pressure came on they were totally different people after that why because heaven had become open to them personally amen but now there comes a a time where what Adam lost has been placed into the hands of man again amen amen amen and so now as I said now the title deed to the Earth was sealed up and it went to the original Creator right but but then now after seven Church ages the lamb steps forth now you say well if he's off the throne is there Mercy well the Bible says that heaven and his Heaven is his throne so when we physically our bodies are changed and we meet him in the air that's when Mercy's over because that's the physical coming of our Lord Jesus amen but he hasn't left Heaven yet in that way his spirit is here are you following me his spirit is here everything that he is is here amen everything he is but physically his body is still at the right hand of majesty on high interceding on your behalf that's why there's still mercy and I'm so glad there's still Mercy today amen I'm so glad the door is open still Hallelujah brother R said just keep doing what you're doing if you're called to be an evangelist go evangelize whatever you call do keep doing it until you're taken away amen we don't want to try and seal up Heaven amen but Mercy is greater today than it ever has been in all all of the ages so now the now so the lamb steps forth and remember John now John is actually a symbol in the book amen it's a remember the Book of Revelation is a book of symbols okay so John himself is a symbol amen when he at you at the end of the church ages he he he sees the open door in heaven a voice says come up hither and that's the Rapture of the church one man in a vision represents a whole body amen right so now when John turns in Revelations 5 and sees the lamps you know sees the line of the tribe of Judah stepping forth he turns he actually sees the lamb now there's not a lamb in the line they're the same person just like I'm a father and I'm a son and I'm a uncle and all different kinds of things but but they're just different officers that I have and I'm a husband right and so now so so the same one stepped forth the same one that he leaned upon the bosom of in the days of his flesh but when he turned and saw him he saw a lamb he saw Mercy he saw an atonement yes he didn't see the king who's going to judge and tread down the nations with a rod of iron he saw his atonement stepping forth am amen and I pray that is the same thing when you look into this word you do not see a judge or an Angry God Amen but you see a lamb you see a blood you see a high priest you see an intercessor you see a mediator Hallelujah you see your Advocate amen an advocate works on your behalf and we have an advocate Jesus Christ the righteous Hallelujah so when he turns he sees the lamb M but then now he takes the book and we know he looses the seals then now that title deed to the Earth here's your inheritance coming down and its fullness remember it's all symbolic because the mighty angel that Des sends in in in verse one with the Covenant upon his head rainbow and a cloud this is this is the anointing coming down this is Jesus Christ in spirit form amen coming down and then let's just and he had in his hand a little book open he said his right foot upon the Sea and the left upon the Earth and cried with a loud voice as a lion Roth and when he had cried seven uh seven Thunders uted their voices and when the seven Thunders had Ed their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders Ed write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the scene upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that there in are and the earth and the things that there in are and the sea and the things that there in are that time should be no longer and that means there shall be no more delay and he's swearing by he's actually swearing by himself cuz he made all things he's swearing by himself there shall be no more delay so in other words what has been taring for seven Church ages amen now I'm going to wind up my plan I'm going to take a people and put them into Heavenly places I'm going to make them in my image am mean I'm going to magnify the power of the blood Hallelujah I'm going to transform people into my image amen amen that they will be adopted as Sons and Daughters of God yes there's no more delay Hallelujah that I'm going to I'm going to take the people from the earth that are alive and remain amen amen the enemy's come going to come to his place I'm going to pour my wrath out upon his kingdom after My bride is left there will be no more delay we're living in a time you say well it's been 50 years since the prophet's been here that's a short space of time for God and world events have changed very rapidly in the last 50 years even the last 10 years God is winding up his program I mean where once people who take years for maturity to come the former and the latter reign of falling and there's a quickening going out upon the Earth all over the world the spirit is moving amen all over the world as the prophet said it would be and people being quickened to be made Alive by the word and so it's not just it's not people just professing but they possess the promise I trust that you can say you're one of them amen hallelujah and also it says in Hebrews speaking of Abraham when there is a you know when when there is an oath you know he he swears he'll do something they you cease from all Strife so when you recognize he's going to do it he promised he'll do it to you amen all all Strife is gone am amen you can have confidence hallelujah amen amen not Pie in the Sky amen and the angel which I sorry verse 10 but in the days of the voice of the seventh Ang when he should begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared it to his servants the prophets and the voice now this is our part of it right the prophet's gone that voice is sounded yeah amen and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again said go take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I was eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings we understand John physically did not prophesy before many people's Nations tongues and Kings after the a of Patmos he went to Ephesus and pastored the church there amen so this is actually speaking of a people remember John one man in a vision as a symbol of a whole people upon the earth now so here is a people that have received a cover with God Amen theyve received a word and they become one with that word amen so you don't see a you could say a book a covenant anymore but they embody what is in the what is in the document so if the Document Speaks of a body change they will they will embody it if if the Document Speaks of healing they will have healing if it speaks of Prophecy and tongues interpretation of tongues they will embody that me of whole people amen if there's victory over the enemy they will manifest that if there's peace that passes all understanding they will have peace and pass all understanding if it's joy joy unspeakable full of Glory they will have joy unspeakable full of glory amen they will actually live out what is in the contents of the document you know it's like America they signed a a proclamation of independence and they said we're a free nation under God but they had to fight a very hard War to enforce or to live out the contents of their declaration Amen to actually enjoy what what was in the document they had to fight and it's the same thing with us it's the same thing in this country even see the colonies won their independence but then when the Treaty of white Tangi was was was signed in this country it started a war and because if you go read into the history no one really won and so the disputes have come down generation to generation into this day because there's still a dispute over over what happened nearly 20 about 150 years ago amen M but now the colonies they won their independence so what was written down and signed they lived it out now we have received a declaration of independence amen we have received the power to have dominion over Satan hey following me because the bride is an independent woman the prophet says I mean we're not subject to this world we're not subject to Rome or any any kind of religion we're independent Hallelujah so when the open when the word became open God was declaring now this is war Satan there a revolution amen amen it has been fighting skirmishes have been fighting down through seven Church ages but now is the hour my people shall arise Hallelujah and so you have to fight you with me you have to fight to enforce the contents of the document amen that if there's bitterness in your heart you got to get rid of it if there's unforgiveness you got to get rid of it amen if there's Strife or whatever it is you got to get rid of if there's lust am mean so you know any unforgiveness anger whatever it may be you have to fight to get rid of it amen because it is a struggle it's a war for you to fully surrender amen hallelujah amen amen we must fight but there's not also just that now but we have a responsibility to Proclaim what is in the document amen that all men women children that want to go free can go free yes amen that is our job in this last days is to prophesy again so to receive take the word that we have received and to speak it forth upon the Earth amen that everyone else can look and live you say well I'm not a preacher your life is a sermon you have I think we sometimes very much uh not even think about people read your life every day and they notice how you are they notice how you conduct themsel your conduct yourself and they are watching you yeah you say well that puts me under a lot of pressure I'll just say this Naomi was living a sermon in Moab amen amen thank you Lord and if you thought and if you think about it she was not a Victorious believer she's backslid out of the Homeland her son's marry unbelievers amen and then her her her husband and her sons die now here she is but her life has been living a sermon because when she says now I'm going to return back what was what was Ruth's testimony your God will be my God your people will be my people you die I'll die Hallelujah that was the effect of her life amen upon a woman that had to come in yes amen so it's the same thing with us you have no idea we have no idea the effect that we have on people hallelujah so I put yourself under it well I have to always be perfect everything we find we have a supernatural gospel amen and it will Quicken those who need to be quickened amen and it will find them in spite of human see God has tied we must you must prophesy again God has tied his Plan of Redemption with you amen amen that you are actually part of his plan to find his last yes amen amen so now if that is if that is our commission I say let's go live it out yes remember we have this is not a religion that's right this is not psychology amen this is not seven steps to a Rapture amen this is not seven steps to a Victorious walk this is a reality where God comes on the scene changes people's lives i' I've seen bitterness go I've seen unforgiveness go I've seen tempest Go I've seen lust go I've seen indifference go amen I've seen I've seen hurts pains complexes go remember the anointing it says I'll set at Liberty them that are Bru I'll bind up their Spirit of Lord is upon me to bind up the Brokenhearted and to set at Liberty them that are bruised amen so the anointing has actually come you know a broken heart is actually it says in the Bible it's like a pot that's been shattered he says the anointing is upon me to take up the pieces amen place them back together and the beautiful thing about God is you don't see the cracks Hallelujah that becomes restored I will restore not I will patch up I will restore amen and them that are bruised we can be bruised by things amen even among Believers things can bruise us amen but there's a healing power present that can set at Liberty them that are bruised just because someone's bruised it doesn't mean they're not a Believer doesn't mean they make believer unbeliever it be genuine believer am mean but a bruise in the spirit can bind people I say friends you don't carry those things that's right amen don't sit in the waiting room and say oh I'm here I am waiting that's right the phys The Physician is here and this is the power I I'm fully persuaded amen there is nothing God cannot heal there's nothing God cannot restore we can maybe years and years in a slump God can take that away amen when we stop looking at ourselves he said I can't live this you don't have to that's right I can't live this message you don't have to live this message he lives it amen we are not the Christian he is the Christian in US amen we we are just vessels empty vessels that he fills with himself amen hallelujah he say well amen you have to Don't Let The Devil twist it and say you have to conform to this amen God changes us amen none of us you think about when we the first second in heaven not one of us will be Hallelujah I'm here I made it I did it I know sir we will never be like that we'll be thank God he got me here he took me through the trials of life when I didn't know where how any way out he brought me through Hallelujah that'll be hey it's his Saving Grace hallelujah amen we will have no we will have no uh what do you call it take any credit for anything I mean brother brah said when when when the Crown you know when the crowns are given out he says he's going to crawl up to his feet maybe just touch his feet Yes hallelujah hallelujah because he knows it was him Hallelujah and it's the same thing with us friends amen that the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God is not you being revealed it's him and you being revealed hallelujah hallelujah amen it's not you you say well I can't do it you don't have to do it I can't let go of this past of my bitterness you just let it you know it's not you this is not I'm working through something amen no it is him working it amen amen well you say well God has to reveal it to me don't blame God thank you Lord God is here to reveal himself Allelujah we're living in a season and and and I'll try and close with this we had gone into a different season around the world where God is mending healing and restoring right because he wants his sons and daughters is to be victorious remember we are not to be slaves of our past those that came out of Egypt Joshua and Caleb maybe they received more stripes and the rest of them they would have no doubt had the scars on their backs but they stood there said we're more than able to take it let's go and take it Hallelujah because they pass to being obliterate in their mind cuz they saw a God come down mean they saw him come down and say I'll give you the land hallelujah hallelujah amen no doubt they can feel we can feel the scars of the past but you got to look the scaring look beyond the one who's delivered you look be on the one that's calling you look to him that's what we've got to do Hallelujah forget about well you say I've done a lot of bad things let's go to let's go to John 8 I'm just going to read this and we'll close John 8 And1 Hallelujah we have a god of Liberty Hallelujah God of joy and peace amen you say well should I look for an emotion no just Look to Him amen amen John 8:1 I was going to open with this but I felt no may I just close with it instead Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives wait yes and early in the morning he came out again into the temple and all the people came unto him and sat down and he taught them and the scribes and Pharisees now notice this here's the Phantom of all of eternal life standing there in flesh and look what these people come and the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery when they had set her and they had set her in the midst and they said unto him Master this woman was taken in adultery the very act now Moses and the law commanded us that we should be stoned I mean that yeah they should be Stone too that thou that such should be stoned but what sayth thou this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but Jesus stooped down with his finger rode on the ground as though he heard them not so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her now this is you this you're this woman you're this woman yeah yeah amen God is here amen Satan is here he's the accuser of your brethren and he will bring up your past right but you got to understand this this whole passage like we haven't finished reading it sorry brother but we this whole passage of scripture is actually it doesn't condemn her it condemns them right amen so now and again he stooped down and rote on the ground no doubt he was probably writing out their book of life and everything they did and when they and they which heard it being convicted in their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even at the last and Jesus was was left alone and the woman standing in the midst he didn't write anything she did right when Jesus had lifted up himself and saw no one but the woman he said unto Heroman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemn thee now notice her response she said no man Lord that's supreme authority no man God and Jesus said unto her neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more amen here we are we come to the presence of the son of man Jesus Christ himself right and the enemy wants to bring up everything we did hey we were living an adulterous life whether you like it or not amen cuz we were married because our first Union married us to basically Satan our fallen nature and then we tried but that had to be done away with for us to be married to another but then in order for that to happen now one had to come and obliterate our part amen amen amen because if he did not come we could not we could not walk in Liberty right so now here's a supreme judge writing in the sand and he is writing out their lives he doesn't write out her life because that whole trial right there is actually to vindicate or Justify her right so now here we are upon the Earth Satan wants want to bring up your past and everything you did and he actually likes he wants you to be in the presence of God that you'll feel condemned amen but then our our judge my judge comes along and he wipes away all the accusers he takes away all of anything that could be held against us what does the blood do wipes our slate clean amen that there is nothing brother speaks of an abstract title right and an abstract title is where the every every claim against that title has been searched out and done away with and once that has happened then the purchase can happen right so now God has come in this end time and everything that could be held against you your first birth your first nature everything you did after the age of accountability every evil thought every evil deed everything we did goes under the blood of Jesus Christ thank you Lord and it's wiped clean amen because if there's a claim upon you God cannot claim you God cannot redeem you if there's a claim Satan has a claim so he comes along by the power of the blood wipes all the claims away amen amen hallelujah amen and then there's the question where we have to think he says woman where are thine accusers where are thine accusers bride amen that's right amen and then what does Jesus and then we should actually say no there's none amen there's no more accuser because his voice has been stopped amen amen every every voice that rais against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn it says in Isaiah and here we are you have to recognize there's nothing holding me here amen amen are you in the same boat amen if you have made if the Lord has made peace with you if he's reconciled himself to you there's nothing holding you here amen amen Our God purges us of every sin and if we and if we sin he's faith if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us that's why we still have a blood amen that's why we still have an advocate we have the greatest you think what's against us amen what's stopping us nothing is hold Nothing is Stopping Us what you say I wrestle just give it to him amen I can't let go say Lord help me let go amen amen Hall can we have some musicians to come we have Liberty to Proclaim hallelujah amen you say well that's just lofty things no it's not you have in you everything the world wants you actually have am amen people want people admire good families they admire loving marriages they admire good children amen the world admires those things and you just wake up in the morning how you doing honey love you praise the lord we got another day you roll out of bed rearrange yourself off you go you just live that way amen Jo you have battles and struggles all those things I'm not negating them that's just how you look yes don't take it for granted [Music]
