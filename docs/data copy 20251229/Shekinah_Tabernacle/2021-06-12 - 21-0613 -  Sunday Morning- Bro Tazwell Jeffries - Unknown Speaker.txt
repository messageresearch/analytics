god so closely knitted into one you've taken us into your hearts and we so glad to be a part of this great family makes me emotional you know when i just um just the experience you love and god richly bless you we've watched it was it nine years last week we've seen what god has done under the pen and just continue to serve him continue to love him continue to work for him and we see we see the results so god richly bless you we want you to know that we love you jeffrey's family love you rfbf loves you the world loves you even my mom sometimes should stream from south africa so god it should bless you um if you could just stand to your feet this morning it's got a few scriptures i'd like to read and we'll see how the lord leads if you can turn to the book of numbers chapter 13. just numbers chapter 13 just a few verses there 13 verse 1 and 2 and the lord speak unto moses saying send thou men that they may search the land of canaan which i give unto the children of israel of every tribe of their fathers shall you send men everyone a ruler among them and then verse 25 says and they returned from searching of the land after 40 days and we'll jump down to verse 32 it says and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great statue and there we saw the giants the sons of enoch which come out of the giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight then if you could just turn me to john chapter 14 john chapter 14 just one verse in john chapter 14. it says here let not verse one let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me then the last one is second peter chapter one just read two verses then then we can pray and take our seats second peter one i'll read verse 3 and verse 4 according as his divine power had given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust let's just pray lord your word has been read and father i believe all things are in order you speak this morning in jesus name amen you may be seated this morning in the presence of god amen just let me go back to that scripture so before i i start i just got this quote that i wanted to read um but the brandon says here in the message speak to this mountain he says i believe that the church of the living god and i believe i'm speaking to the church of the living god he says i believe that the church of the living god is moving into a sphere now that's going to shake the whole world and then he quotes he says ask anything that you will and it shall be given unto you now i want to just drop that with us this morning ask what you will he says it shall be given unto you anything you desire don't you see he says the words of jesus christ being fulfilled oh it's going to come to pass pretty soon he says i'm looking for it to happen in this meeting he says i'm wanting it to happen now that the anointing will strike the whole church of the living god and she'll rise to her feet like a mighty marching army and i believe the god that i serve is not a god of history but is a god of now so whatever i need now i can ask him by faith and he will do what he what he's more than able to do so before i just go with this one one more quote he says in the adoption part 4 he says he says he says that's what bothers me though he says to preach to you people and then he he drops in this which really struck them he says don't remain on in the same condition you've been going in he says change now so basically he's saying don't continue in the same whatever condition you are he says change now he says hear me as i say it and then in capital letters it says here thus saith the lord so i believe the god that i serve is a god that changes situations changes lives now it doesn't matter i know i'm i'm as we're going to go through the service this morning i'm i'm ministering to to christians this morning i believe we all the majority of us we are christians we've had our experiences with god but i believe as a christian it's not me standing on one place and not moving forward we need to grow and he's calling you and me up higher and higher and higher so i read that and i say i've got to change i've got to allow him i've got to allow the word to bring a change in my life i remember when this one time a service back in in the in the church back home and you know it's so important that that these kinds of meetings we do not take it for granted that the preaching of the word it's it's so powerful um i remember i ministered the sermon i can't remember what it was but i ministered a sermon back home and uh after the meeting we went home and then i got a text from a brother that was in the meeting and he said brother tez i was sitting in the meeting and he says as the word of god came forth he says i was sitting there and i knew that there were circumstances there was some demonic forces that was keeping me bound but it says tears as the word of god was being preached i sat there and i received the word of god he says as i received it i felt those demons of oppression leave me amen and then a couple of weeks later i get another text from someone else not in the local assembly he says where the tears i i i went to the archives somehow the sermon popped up i listened to it he says where the tears as i was listening and receiving he says for the tears i felt demons leave me two or three witnesses speaking about the power of the word of god so i want to encourage you this morning however the lord leads receive the word amen as we receive the word we become the word quote to brother branham so just for the title this morning um i've got here out of that script of saint john let not your heart be troubled and then adding to that so let not your heart be troubled you are walking under great and precious promises let not your heart be troubled as sons and daughters of god we've got precious promises and as we're walking wherever we're walking we're walking under great and precious promises now the bible says jesus says let not your heart be troubled and jesus doesn't just say stuff just to say stuff so he says let not your heart be troubled and you know as human beings it's normal we go through life we love we're human beings we've got emotions that's the way he created us but jesus says let not your heart be troubled so i i thought i wanted to so what i did was i went into the strongs um and i just wanted to have a look to understand the context of this word troubled i'll just read you a few things here they say a troubled heart is a heart that causes what they call inward commotion and commotion is like a confused and it's a noisy disturbance so and i encourage you if you don't believe what i'm saying go into the greek lexicon go to strong's and you'll see this a troubled heart it causes that it's like an inward commotion so someone that that has got a troubled heart or it's troubled we might not see it on the outside if they're very good at masking themselves but deep inside it's like that it's a confusion and it's a disturbance and it's just a noisy disturbance inside also a troubled heart it's easier is to agitate it's to just make you feel troubled and just to make you feel nervous a troubled heart it can take away the calmness of the mind it says there it can disturb this word that's there it says disturbs equanimity which i believe is your your composure maybe you're a person that's very calm but a a troubled mind can come in and disturb that and and and and take away the calmness a troubled heart can also they say cause this quietness which is it makes you worry it makes you feel uneasy jesus says let not your heart be troubled i'll go further a troubled heart they say it makes you restless because you it strikes one spirit with fear and dread i believe fear happy to be corrected fear is a revelation from hell because fear it just when it takes over that's why jesus says fear not when fear takes over just man it it has terrible effects a troubled heart renders anxiousness or distress it perplexes the mind it makes the mind and then what it does also democracy of lots of confusion and then what it also does right it it suggests stuff in your mind it makes you you know the the situation it's just all in your mind but you already fetch the problem around there you've already decided that this is going to happen all the negative stuff now in the message amnesia one of one of them amnesia messages brother branham actually says he says worry can cause amnesia and amnesia it's something that uh you you you can't remember i think or you don't know who you are and um amnesia is i'm you know you you just forget things or you i think amnesia i don't know who i am so so a troubled heart causes all the worry it causes all the distress it causes all sorts of stuff that you end up really sometimes forgetting who you are and that is why i believe why why why jesus comes and he says let not your heart be troubled because jesus knows that a troubled heart causes all sorts of things and and it just makes you we're human right but but at the end of the day you know it doesn't want you to allow we're going to be troubled but it doesn't want you to allow that troubled heart to take over and that's where the lord just laid on my heart to say let not your heart be troubled you and i we are hawking under great and precious promises and as we go through the meeting this morning maybe yeah trust the lord he'll allow me just to to to to remind you of these precious promises that you have that you have that i have and that when we go out there and when trouble strikes or when our heart tries to be troubled that we can then just look back at the word and say yes these things are happening but i've got something great that will help me to move ahead and not to allow the troubled hearts not to allow this inward commotions to control me now i read the scripture in the book of numbers 13 and 14 and um i actually labeled that section here on my notes i called it the kadish crisis i called it the kadish crisis now so so most of us and all of us should know what happened where 12 spies were sent out and they all came back with a report so they were sent out to spy out the land that god had given them that god had promised them so when they went out to go and spy out the land they went to go and spy out what was this so they went out 12 of them 12 of them came back and they came back with a report they came back and if you go look in the in numbers it says they came back with evidence they came back with evidence saying this is a good land so whatever god told us about this land it is true it's a good land and and here's the evidence i believe the scripture says there to carry uh the fruit on their shoulders so they they they came back with positive evidence to prove and to show that what god was telling them was absolutely the truth the land was good it was flowing with milk and honey the fruit was there everything was just beautiful so they came back with that report but as we know what happened in that kadish crisis there were ten of them that came back so they all of them came back with a a positive report of the goodness of the land but we know that 10 of them came back and they added some negativity into the reports and if i'll just read it it says here so they came back they said the land is good and they said nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and our cities are hold sorry and this it is old and very great and we saw the children of enoch there and then they also said the men that went up with him said we are not able to go up against the people but they are stronger than us and they brought up an evil report of the land now this was probably a people like you and me god had given them it he told them that i'm taking you i'm taking you out of egypt and i'm leading you into a land flowing with bokeh a land that is yours a land that i want you to enjoy so you're the 10 of the 12 spies came back and they gave a report to the people and as the negative report started moving through the people people started feeling troubled that is why god says let not your heart be troubled so as the negative report started going out the people started just feeling like a defeated people because they heard about the giants and they heard about the the whole cities and all these things and they started then getting all nervous and they started getting all scared because they were listening to a negative report they opened their ears to negativity and as they opened and they received the negativity it started having an impact on their lives now this was a people that had left egypt had experienced a god that was able to pot the red sea this was a people that was following the purifier by night and following the cloud by day this was a people they were not strange to the supernatural for them the supernatural god was just part of the journey so you'd expect that a people that have seen god open up the red sea a people that had seen what god is able to do you would have expected them to say hey my god did then whatever i'm facing ahead he's going to do it but they allowed a negative report to come into their hearts and then they became a people that totally forgot a people and i will use the word that had amnesia i mean do you remember what god did we seen pharaoh and his army coming and we're seeing god perform the impossible we're seeing god opening the red sea and we've seen how we hooked on dry land because of the negative report that they received and they allowed it to consume them it made them forget about what god had done and it made them forget what god is able to do so they forgot about the supernatural that was leading them they forgot about the miracles that they had seen with their own eyes or that they had heard maybe young youngsters coming up they've heard it now we know that as you go through the scriptures and as you go through the book of numbers and as you go into the book of hebrews god refers back to that i'll use the word kadish crisis and god we know but if you don't know he was not happy because he hears his people he's proven himself to them over and over and over again but yet when they get faced with some adversity and they allow the the negative speaking guys to come and plant this negativity in them god was not happy he was displeased with him and we know if as you go through the scriptures there were repercussions of the decision that was made at kedesh because the end of the day because of the this the 12 spies that came with this negative stuff and it flowed over into the people and the people got all negative and their hearts were troubled and they just said no we can't we can't you know what they even said they said we look like grasshoppers in their eyes now they probably didn't hear them say ah look at those grasshoppers but they in their mind they told themselves whoa they big oh they probably think i'm a little gross so they allowed this whatever they were seeing whatever obstacles was facing them they allowed that to consume their mind and then they started this having this imaginations in their mind they probably dreamed at night how the sons of enoch would look at them and they would be hopping like grasshoppers and it consumed them and at the end of the day we know there were repercussions but you see god doesn't want us to focus on the negativity he wants me by the full to focus on the promises of god he wants me to focus on his word and his word is yea and amen his word is super powerful and i'm not just saying that i've experienced it i believe it when you stand here and you speak what you speak you speak out of an experience because i could stand here and i could tell you good stuff and good stories but it will not really have an impact because i'm just talking of your sake but i whatever whatever the lord is laid on my heart this morning it's coming off an experience and i am totally convinced that the god that i serve is more than powerful so in this kaddish crisis god was very very displeased with these 10 spies that came with this negative report he wanted them he wanted him to focus on his promises he promised it to them and all they had to do was just yes lord i receive it standstill what the brandon says in the message standstill he's talking about the kadish crisis he says and of course ten against two they were outnumbered he says but even though they were outnumbered he says joshua and caleb took their stand and they said we are more than able to do it he says but before caleb joshua could speak caleb had to stole the people first get them quiet too much murmuring too much talking too much confusion get them quiet stand still don't be running here running there he says now what made caleb so sure of it when the opposition was so great because caleb was one of those twelve that went out seen the goodness of the land at the same time seen the giants seeing the opposition but what made caleb so sure that we are more than able when the opposition was so great brother branham says it's according to what you looking at it's so important to be aware of what i am looking at he says caleb was looking at the promise of god so caleb remembered and he remembered the promise that god had given them and that was all on his mind he's seen the giants he's seen the negativity but he also seen the promises of god for him the other 10 was looking at circumstances if you go to look at circumstances oh now i know it's easy to say these things right i know it's easy to quote it easy to say don't look at your problems look at the promises of god it's easy to say but when when the situation strikes man that's a different story but god had to come and deal with me i've been going through situations where at the end of the day god and it was over a couple of years and god had to come and remind me stop looking at the problem yes and i think i said this one time yes the problem is there you can see it don't look at it don't focus on it just go a bit higher and look across and see the promises of god i think i mentioned that there was this quote i love about the brandon he talks about the joshua and the caleb outfit and i am grateful to god you see he identifies the joshua and the caleb outfit as the true believer and i identify myself as part of the joshua and caleb outfit i'm a true believer of this word of god absolutely he says now listen closely this is here when the word test came when they went over and they seen the opposition opposition so great it was the greatest opposition they ever seen the amalekites was ten times the size they said we look like grasshoppers the fences in the cities are so cold so they can run a chariot race around it he says why we look like grasshoppers we can't do it that was the negativity which just spread like wildfire amongst the believers but then brother branham says and two men that stood on the word caleb and joshua caleb and joshua outfit the true believer they stood on the word and caleb and joshua said wait a minute you've got two million people he says shut up just a minute sometimes you've got to just be strong caleb and joshua told him shut up we are more than able to do it we are more than a match for them what was they basing on they said god god said god said yes god said not men not circumstances god said i've given you the land it is yours god said it and if god says it i receive it yeah god said it so the bible says that with all the negativity around there were two men tell them i just love i love caleb and joshua i look at them and with the man i see him because i identify with their what this was with what they approach with the way they did things the way they handle situations and the way they just they didn't care about circumstances or problems or whatever their focus wasn't god this great warrior joshua brother branham says here he says caleb run out in the midst of the people and quieten them and said yes it can be and he said and joshua stood by him and said certainly it can be god's given it to us and then he says now every one of those israelites in the church he says everyone had the word of god preached to them but this is what made caleb and joshua different oh really says they all had the word of god preached to them but it only the word taken effect upon joshua and caleb so the old church was there they had the word of god preached to them but joshua and caleb as they received the word they said yes lord it's mine the promises it's mine and they allowed the word to take half and impact and effect on their lives and because they allowed the word to have an impact upon their lives their attitudes the way they handle things was totally different to the others because the others probably just sat in church heard a good sermon went home and forgot but caleb and joshua they sat in the meeting and they said yes lord i want i want i received they allowed the word to have an impact on them and you think of that word impact if you think of a beautiful lake it's quiet and peaceful you go stand there and it's just so beautiful so serene and you come back a couple of days time and the wind is howling and the wind is blowing and you go back to that same lake you find the wind the storm has got an impact on that lake and it's pushing the lake this way and the water is going and the water's going that way and the horde is boiling and then once the storm's upsides and you go back to that lake you find all the dirt all the rubbish has been churned out all the rubbish because the lake allowed the wind or the storm whatever to have an impact on itself and as we allow the world to have an impact on us whatever might be here that doesn't need to be it doesn't belong if we allow the word of god that's being preached this morning or just allow when you read the scripture when you listen to a sermon or brother branham when you may be listening to someone on youtube allow the word of god to have an impact on your life and you will see the difference so joshua and caleb they allowed the word to have an impact on them and brother says the word affected them because they had a fantastic attitude for them it was more than just going to church it's about allowing the word see every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse and every line and that promise is for me and i receive it and wherever i'm going whatever situations i'm facing i know that there's promises of god that's hanging over me amen so because of caleb's attitude god was so pleased with caleb and with joshua he wasn't happy with the rest and there were consequences but god was so pleased with the attitude of joshua and of caleb and in numbers 14 24 god says but my servant caleb because he had another spirit with him and hath followed me fully fully yes caleb seen the stuff in the circumstances but that didn't bother him he followed god fully him the lord says well i bring into the land where into he went and he seed shall possess it now i think caleb was in his forties at the time when this happened that correctly was wrong but i think he was sort of about that age and then we discover later in the book of joshua about 40 years later so for 40 years caleb is walking caleb is fighting caleb is loving a life and he's just walking and he's walking and he's following god until we go in the book of joshua so caleb is walking and he's doing all the stuff but as is walking this word of god which was a promise to caleb and god called out caleb and said caleb this promise is for you can because you followed me fully i will bring you into the land and your seed shall possess it so caleb was walking and he was walking and fighting and all over caleb was the promise of god [Music] and yes maybe canada went through situations afterwards but he knew that there was a promise hanging over him and then we know one day in the book of joshua how caleb becomes he comes to joshua and he reminds joshua of this promise that god had made to him and what was his words he says give me my mountain it's been promised to me the mountain probably whatever was there were inhabitants there but kind of said give it to me this car that has been with me all the time he promised that that is mine brother john it's mine i'm going to go there i'm going to possess it it's my inheritance god gave it to me that was caleb's attitude now caleb wasn't wishy-washy right he didn't it wasn't like fairy stories to him it wasn't just usa caleb knew she kind of had a revelation god had revealed to caleb this is yours that land is lost ask for it go forth possess it drive out the inhabitants that's there caleb i am with you i have promised it to you and that's why caleb could boldly come to joshua and say i'm 80 odd years old man i'm still strong and god promised it to me years ago i'm here now i want to claim my promise and yes i see this stuff there there's people there's obstacles i don't care god has given it to me so caleb was walking and living a life with the promises of god hanging over him and at the right time that specific promise for caleb he got it just a little bit of our promises so when god promises something it's your name amen he's promised it to you and to me the book of isaiah says i'll read the scripture it says therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and be a son and shall call his name emmanuel it was a prophecy that went out it was a promise i believe it went out and we know that prophecy was spoken whenever it was spoken and then years later we find a young mary little girl doing the things that little girls do playing around and enjoying life and whatever but that little mary she's running around but she doesn't know that over is a prophecy is that promise it's hovering over so wherever she went maybe she did some work for mama maybe maybe she helped dad a little bit you know whatever but wherever she went there was a promise there was a prophecy that was over she had no idea and maybe as you sit here this morning you might think that maybe i'm not you know where i'm supposed to be just allow god there's a promise hanging over you and me so this mary she's doing whatever she's doing until one day she gets a visitation and then this angel confirms to her now she obviously knew the scriptures she knew about this one and the angel confirms to her mary you are the one you are this performance of this prophecy so mary was walking before that unaware but there was this promise hanging over her and we know the outcome of that i read second peter one so that was mary and that was caleb so i wanna just let's just come to you and me because we are a people of promise there are so many great and precious promises in this world for you and for me and god wants you to see it he wants you to receive it because it's yours and you know we are back back in our family altar we've just been talking with with the kids with the family about the importance of revelation because the more god comes and he reveals this word to you and to me so as he opens himself up and as we start discovering man this promise is for me our attitude change our approach changes when we face circumstances even that the way we handle it changes so i read the scripture it says whereby are given unto us it's been given to us exceeding great great and precious promises it's brilliant boys being given to us it's mine it's yours you need to receive it exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust we are partakers for the simon we're not just spectators and looking and seeing ah god is doing amazing things every brother jameson but we are partakers we're part of it we are experiencing this word so when i read this bible and i said i find myself i think i was always with andy was the last week when you guys are saying about find yourself in the bible find the character identify yourself i identify myself with caleb and with joshua and when i look at what they did i said lord they were able to do it i'm able to do it the same god that helped them is there to help me so you and i we have great and precious promises i'll just i'll just i won't go into the detail of it but you've got a promise and there's a quote that i just love i use it all the time i just didn't use it today but i'm actually going to touch on it brother brahm says and and and i always say this is my quote that's for me it's dez because i read it ashitas in the statue of a perfect man but the venom comes we're not here to build organization christ did not send me to bold organization christ sent me to build up individuals so that they might be a powerhouse and the abiding place of the spirit by his word i read that and i say tears that's you yes brother andy that's you it's me so he is promised that he's bolding you up he's building us up into a powerhouse we've got great and precious promises promises of adoption i thank god for this revealed word i thank god for the message of malachi 4. where would i have been i think i told someone one time if it wasn't for god but the fall that came via the message of the hour into the home of my uncles it would i would not have been able to appreciate what i am appreciating today don't just think the message is another message this is power packed and it's for you and it's for me a promise of perfection be therefore perfect a promise of a body change we shall be changed i promise of you obtaining your individual inheritance a promise of overcoming that's your promises it's for you it's for me so when your heart becomes troubled remember you've got promises hanging over you and he wants you to receive you are an overcomer don't don't let the devil don't let circumstances don't let anything anything tell you difference you are a son and a daughter of the most high god and you conduct yourself like a son and a daughter of the most high god when the devil comes and you welcome you remind him who you are that you are an overcomer jesus knew who he was brother branham knew who he was oh god i want you and me to come to that realization where we know our position in the world where we come to that realization where we know who we are not just by speaking it's good to speak and we have to speak our promises but it's when you get faced with whatever you get faced with it's then there that that that amnesia just got to go and that you've got to just remember that i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god and no devil no giant has got any power over me so when the devil comes and he kicks you what you do you kick him back you kick him out when he tries to jump on you you jump on him harder he's under my feet don't allow him i think in the brother brother talks about it about this brother that had the dream and how the you know the devil would go boo and the brother gets smaller and smaller and the devil go boo and the devil gets bigger and bigger and bigger until the brother to come to realization of who he is and then he started saying boo and then he seen that they will start going smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller i want you to receive that this morning don't allow any devil any circumstance to overwhelm you jesus says let not your heart be troubled so don't allow you it will be true you will go through emotions we emotional creatures but don't allow that to overwhelm you or to control your life look at yourself today where were you a couple of years ago maybe a couple of months ago maybe a couple of weeks ago where were you and where are you today the god that has been carrying you then is still carrying you today hallelujah chicano tabernacle nine years last week god god started it god carried it and here we are today and god is going to take it further just follow him just allow him to have an impact can you tell the devil devil today i am still standing yes the the naysayers and the negative talkers said huh look at him give him give you a couple of days yeah john i'm thinking about thinking about john how god did something for you at the camp and the devil and everyone else probably thought huh look at john there what's going to happen give him a few days he's just gonna fall but dwan is still here today not by his own ability but by the grace of god and the grace of god is carrying you on the clothes of soon the grace of god is scaring you i want to close up just with this thought as we walking and we're living a life of a victorious christian it's so important that we say the right thing don't be like the 10 negative spies all they could just say was negative negative they said some positive stuff but the negativity overrode it let's be careful what we say it's so important and i wanna i'm gonna take you we're gonna finish when i wanna take you into messages of brother branham how and why it is so important that we are careful what we say death and life is in the power of man i just love him he came and he he he demonstrated he demonstrated this word to us he showed us that james it is possible to love this word it's possible to hawk above circumstances it's possible that even though your heart wants to feel troubled that you can rise above it two quotes in my new ministry with brandon talks he says he talks about banks good he says and unconsciously now as as we're walking and as we're living and as we serving god and as we're working and as we go into union going to school or doing our homeschooling or whatever we're doing let's just be real christians let's just say lord i want to serve you i want to please you i want to talk according to the way you want me to speak so brother branham says here unconsciously banks must have said the right thing now if you go back to to to um what brother brandon talks about you know he talks about hattie right and we know about it how brother branham came with with a testimony and how hat you write said brother branham that is nothing but the truth and she said the right thing and because she said the right thing god was pleased and god says now whatever you want my prophet will speak it but now the brain also talks about banks and and he says banks unconsciously must have said the right thing now what really happened was banks and his brother they were i don't know i think they went by the boats i'm not sure exactly where but brother brandon tells us that they were talking with each other now god had done something amazing to them and they had experienced god and then they started talking to each other and said you know what maybe we should go to that lady you know that lady that looked after us and maybe we should go and testify to her simple right maybe we should just go there and testify god heard that a simple conversation between two brothers maybe can i go and testify god heard that and brother bannon says unconsciously banks must have said the right thing and then we know what happened but branham says um and when banks said that all of a sudden something struck me he said the right thing amen and to us it's a simple thing right i want to go testify but he said the right thing and the holy spirit spoke out and said thus saith the lord you'll find the next few hours there'll be a resurrection of a little animal and we know what happened the dead fish so banks was a witness to the spoken word spoken to a dead fish that came back to life all right thing say the right thing now i want to read you this he says now every one of you every one of you he says not only the ministers i know you are ministers here but brother branham says every one of you from the youngest to the oldest he says not only the ministers but all of you want to pray for these people now before i go on i i i want to encourage you you know look at i look at the the believers in this church i look at i've got a very strong passion for the young ones and i want to just encourage you don't stop praying for your young ones and also don't know just i've got my family so i'm praying for my family and i'm praying for my children brother andy's got kids let's pray for his family let's pray for this family let's pray for each other amen it's easier all of you want to pray for these people he says you don't know what god might do for you while you're praying for somebody else [Music] i know you're praying church but i want to just encourage you let's pray let's see more more let's pray for each other more let's hold each other up i was not last week then in taranaki i looked at these young people man i said what potential people that can shake new zealand don't stop praying he says you don't know what god might do for you while you're praying for someone else what if you will say the right thing banks would said the right thing then some of these things happened at the right said the right thing something happened what if you say the right thing imagine we've got you know we want out i've got a desire for my children to be so on fire for god i want my kids to grow up and just be totally sold out to jesus what if i said the right thing and god is so pleased he says i'm taking sith chloe and micah to another level man what if you'd say the right thing and then he says he says there's a woman standing here that's so sick they have to hold up what if your prayer yeah there's a woman standing here that's so sick they have to hold up what if your prayer would be the right thing just like bank said the right thing like hattie said the other thing what if you'd say the right thing and your prayer would cause god to come down and do something amen so it's not about the minister it's about you you're praying you're sitting in the seat you're thinking the right thoughts you're focusing on him you're allowing him to impact you and you pray the right prayer where you say the right thing and then god is so pleased and he sweeps in and he meets the needs of people musicians can come i've gotten few things but i'm going to finish off with this musicians you can come brother branham it relates he gives a testimony and i'll close up with this he gives a testimony he talks about a brother evans he says and going out so what what should happen was brother evans if you don't know what happened there brother evans vehicle was stolen by the evans vehicle was stolen and he came to brother branham and said brother brandon my vehicle is stolen and can be going to pray so brother branham goes into prayer and he says and going out so in in prayer he said i seen a young fellow wearing a yellow shirt and once been a christian raised in a christian home and he was in brother evans car so this young fellow had been a christian maybe made some wrong decisions ended up just stealing cars and he stole brother evan scott and brother branham goes in prayer and he prays and then the lord shows him this young man in brother evans car going down to bowling green kentucky this is 118 miles below louisville and brother branham says and while praying he says in the spirit while praying that's why the branham is praying and he sees this young man the lord shows him the young man driving in the car and brother branham says and the spirit while praying convicted him so this young man he's stolen the car was a christian experience he probably experienced god or experienced church or seen how god was working with maybe with his family with his mom with his dad and he steals the squad and he goes and with the brand name is praying and the lord shows him this young man and while but the brandon was praying the spirit of god convicts this young man driving the car and convicts him that he was doing wrong he was working for this ring he was doing wrong and then the spirit the world the word holding over him in this prayer is by the branham is in prayer and he's praying for this boy and brother branham says the holy spirit convicts him and the spirit holding over him in this prayer this young man turns the car and he comes back he parks the course somewhere and he runs away now as i i was reading the quotation i thought to myself what a an awesome god we serve a guy comes to brother brandon and he says my car is stolen it just shows how mindful of you and i god is my call is stolen and brother branham goes into prayer and god works in the heart of the thief turns him around comes back now brother branham didn't know the thief brother evans didn't know the thief god knew the thief and god worked in that thief's heart turned him back and i thought to myself if my god can do that for a stolen vehicle a stolen car what can he do for our loved ones what can we do for our children you know what i've noticed in the in the i don't know why but i've started to discover and i said lord i don't want that to happen to my children i discover that i didn't know what happened when i was younger we we in the church we grew up to a certain age we start thinking for ourselves obviously and then we decide we don't want and we go away and we just don't come to church anymore and we allow our parents to struggle but i want to just encourage us this morning each one of us you know maybe of someone that's out there maybe you know if someone is just struggling let's pray for them the same god that could convict a thief driving a car and allow that thief to bring that call back the same god is able to work in the hearts of our children to work in the hearts of our loved ones there's so many out there so many let's just pray lord jesus i'm grateful today lord this morning to know that i'm a son of the king to know lord god that we are so privileged father as we sit in the meeting here this morning just

because unfortunately we have a farewell um brother james and sister nadina got a burden you wanna you wanna come up here please they have a burden for the south island christchurch in particular and from being in that part of the country to begin with i can kind of relate to their burden but um it's sad to see you go because you know over the weeks you've been expressing your burden that you've had for there um i'm of the opinion god gives a burden for a purpose he doesn't just make us have a burden for something just for the sake of it but there's god works at both ends so there's burden for people there's a people that that need need the lord they need the fullness of the word they need deliverance and to walk in the you know and the faith so we're going to miss you it's been a real blessing to have you both here you've been a real pillar and asset and amen it's been a real joy to have you here and um yeah i just want to pray the lord's riches blessings upon you both i believe this sermon was was i was thinking of you when i was hearing this you know sure there may be giants opposition whatever but you're living under a promise hallelujah because god has a burden he wants all of his children to go free and he uses his children to proclaim that liberty amen so if anyone if you all want to come up that's fine if anyone wants to come up and lay hands upon our friends here but may the lord be with you may bless you and keep you amen we're gonna miss you i'm glad i'm glad that we're you know i love this family of god [Music] okay [Music] lord jesus dear god is father i just think of isaiah in the temple lord when he went there lord he had a bird on his heart dear god and you revealed yourself in a supernatural way and lord after you took that coal of fire the angels then touched his lips and then then he heard your voice saying he'll go for us he said here i am lord send me lord you put a burden on his heart oh god father for your people o lord in the land lord
