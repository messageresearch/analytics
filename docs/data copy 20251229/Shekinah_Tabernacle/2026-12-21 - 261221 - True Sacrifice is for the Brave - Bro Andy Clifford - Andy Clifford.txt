god today oh this boxing day where the world is going out there doing their thing but we're here lord we're here for a purpose we're on this earth for a purpose and today i pray lord that you would bring commission that you would bring new births that you would bring life-changing situations lord that you would cause cataclysmic destruction on satan's kingdom and any of his holds any of his prisons the doors are open hallelujah the prison gates have fallen amen the chains are on the ground and it's time to walk free it's time to walk in liberty amen hallelujah oh jesus father we thank you commit this time to you lord we're just resting in you now in jesus christ's name amen amen isn't it good to be here who believes that jesus is a good god amen he isn't he wonderful hallelujah amen thank you musicians thank you brother isaac amen i'm so thankful to be in the house of the lord hallelujah it's just time you know the as time unfolds you know uh we're getting closer to the end the earth as a woman you could say and type is having birth pain and she's about to be delivered amen and those birth pains are getting closer and closer and closer and you seeing it out there it's just hemorrhaging amen but in the true believer is stability is peace as a resurrection amen hallelujah amen amen hallelujah i just want to welcome uh josh and dylan amen hallelujah i believe uh friends of brother and paul amen hallelujah welcome to the house of lord trust you feel at home and you know just get your blessing amen get your blessing uh and we've got jasmine jessica brother isaac god bless you welcome to the house of the lord today trust you feel at home amen hallelujah while you're standing let's turn in our bible to isaiah 9 6 amen hallelujah you know we're celebrating well you know we know that the the birth of the son of god wasn't actually on december 25th but the world is celebrating this and so we're going to celebrate it too amen hallelujah amen so praise god and i want to speak on true sacrifice is for the brave true sacrifice is for the brave not for the coward amen and so if you are struggling to sacrifice something it's a it's actually a portion of cowardice within you that's too scared to sacrifice to god amen i know that sounds pretty harsh probably we shouldn't put that in at the start but amen amen we should own that this morning and say you know what i'm going to be brave hallelujah i'm a brave soldier amen i'm a warrior amen glory amen i've got courage to to let go amen hallelujah so let's read isaiah 9 6 and 7 that says here and i want you to think about this as i'm reading this is the ultimate sacrifice amen the ultimate sacrifice that god would come from heaven knowing his destiny he left the splendor and majesty and he became a baby hallelujah for unto us a child is born unto us the son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this amen god bless you you may be seated amen the sacrif true sacrifice is for the brave hallelujah you know i like something someone that's brave someone that's got courage someone that's got the gumption to just follow the leading of the lord may not know where it's going to go but you know god's placed it in your heart or you know that that's the right thing to do and and you're feeling pulled towards something by the holy spirit and you're willing to let go of all of your pride all of your prejudice all of your built up ambitions anything you're just willing to go you know what you're willing to let go of your routines your comforts oh my help me jesus are you willing are you brave this morning who's brave who's got the bravery the bravado to allow god his way hallelujah you know actually if you look at the whole big picture that's actually the safest place to be anyway [Laughter] oh man we can make our own comforts you know human beings love to be comfortable we like to have a nice soft seat i like to have it all sounding real good god bless the tech team you know we love to just have it nice and we like the the instruments to play good the singers to sing in rhythm or sometimes so amen we like that and we like creature comforts and we like to have things easy and we like to have things structured what some people do you know and and and yet are you brave enough to sacrifice those are you brave enough this morning are you brave enough because we're we as i said in the prayer that i didn't plan anything but you know the the earth is in birth pains and the world is coming to a place where a man child shall be born you know and and really that's just a symbolic type of christ is coming to the earth and so for christ to come to the earth and change the whole situation it's causing labor pains the devil ain't happy about it so there's all sorts of destructions going on and everything and so if you've ever been brave and you want to you want to actually crest these waves and you want to go through it it's going to take more bravery than you've ever expressed in your life hallelujah because each one of you has a divine purpose a divine calling and it's not always what you think it is but it's going to take ultimate bravery to for you to let go of the weights and sins that does so easily beset when when when we read that in hebrews 12 and and it says that we should cast down all the weights and sins that does so easily beset us you know those things are besetting us from his purpose not our purpose we can have a purpose and our purpose and our plans and it could be mixed in are the weights they are the things that say god just say come on are you ready are you ready are you brave enough this morning are you brave enough to let go of those things hallelujah amen i wasn't really going to minister on this but i had a dream and the dream was i'll tell you the dream and it oh my it was actually i don't know this is just how the lord works i guess but um i i had ordered this like i don't know what happened i don't you know how sometimes it just kind of comes into picture and so i came into the picture and we had this big hall rented it was like a city hall and we were about to have a convention or a camp meeting or something and it was going to be real good and then all the open brethren and all the pentecostals people that i knew that have always fought against this message and fought against not actively but just we've always had our debates and had our discussions ministerial type of conflict because of the doctrinal differences and things and they all came in and all their churches and everyone just came in and i was thinking oh man what have i got here you know what's going on here and all of a sudden this boldness just came over me this bravery just came over me and i just started standing there and i felt like i was just standing and i was calling them out and it was like it wasn't my bravery it was his his bravery just came upon me and you know when if you've ever been in a situation where you're in especially as a child and you're with your buddies or you're with your friends and and then the bullies come the bigger ones come and they start to mess with you you mess with you and you guys are getting a bit scared and then your daddy walks around the corner and you you all of a sudden you get brave and you start shouting at those guys that's what it was like that's what it was like it was like just and and i actually started calling them i said i challenge you all right now to a clear discussion to a debate that you can refute anything that this message i challenge you right now and they were as quiet as can be and then i woke up and i thought okay and then i was going to um you know i was going to minister on a subject called human desire will veto the holy ghost you know because as soon as you desire something the lord ain't going to lead you where he wants you because he can't because you want that and he's got this you've got to actually let your desire go you may want to do these things we all want to do things right and and and hey it could be all right it probably is all right more than likely is going to be right because you're in the mind of christ but you have to sacrifice that so that god can lead you and i was going to speak on that and then i don't know i think i was talking to bronwyn and she's like oh wow i said i had this dream and and she said oh maybe you need to preach on something about the pentecost pentecostalism maybe coming into the church or something and i was like oh there's and then we were like oh there's no real we don't that's not really you know we don't really have pentecostalism coming into the church you know like so i was like oh no it can't be it so i just pond left it and then as i was praying you know i'm praying lord show me what to what how this is you know what do you want and then that came true sacrifice because you are sacrificing your desires as for the brave amen hebrews 9 26 for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself you know we as we sit here today we are beneficiaries of the ultimate sacrifice god man you know you think okay you've had the best time in your life and then times it by a million and that's where god is just in splendor heaven perfect no troubles and he he decided that he well he needed now and his of his decision he would come down to the earth he would manifest himself in a baby jehovah of the old testament would make himself and and and trans you know it says that he would metamorphous he would transform himself he would be found in an image of man and he would come through the womb of a woman a virgin and a and and and and so he would go through the struggles of humanity and he would go through the struggles of temptation the struggles of shame the struggles of all of the spirits and all the darkness can you just think about that for now that god would choose to leave the splendor of heaven knowing his destiny hallelujah knowing what he would face and he let it go that is the ultimate expression of bravery hallelujah and that bravery was ignited by love that bravery was was built was buckled by love without love that brave how can the break how can bravery have its way without love amen and how can faith have its way without love and we're going to finish today on love because i believe that love is the ultimate hub of all operation of kingdom of god everything of in god's kingdom whether it's personal collective dispensational eternal all is comes from love and is held by love god's love unconditional love you see if it's unconditional it cannot change if it's unconditional it's a constant reality that cannot be diminished it never began it will never end it just is that's love and that love was expressed in a baby that was born hallelujah hallelujah god would choose in a brave act hallelujah you know and trust in the salvation to trust in that this great god who was invisible and without space and time and so big and so incomprehensible who knows what incomprehensible means you can't understand them it's too big he would become a baby a baby that's powerful that he would become a baby and he was just dependent on a woman and dependent on a surrogate father is that what you call it a stepfather you could say he was dependent on these humans to to raise him up oh my and to trust his angelic host that never fell for the devil's lives he he trusted gabriel he trusted these angels to actually watch over him because here he is in a baby form oh my hallelujah he trusted that he could go through this and he would be helped and he would be delivered and he would be raised up and he would brave all of this this is the ultimate sacrifice hallelujah 1 1 it says i beseech you i beg you therefore brethren now it's personal okay now we're going personal here i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you you me and you us we present that you present your bodies now physical as well as spiritual a living sacrifice so you see now we're called we're called to a sacrifice but not a sacrifice where we go and kill ourself but a sacrifice where we kill our old self on the altar of god so that he can live so that his will can be done not my will not your will but his will and that sacrifice has been that that altar has been restored who believes that under the spirit and power of elijah in the last days of restoration that that the altar of approach to god would be fully restored would be built up again by vision by prophetic vision that the altar where a man or a woman can actually come fully to god no denominational additions or subtractions no you know when you end up with a man leadership when you end up with a council of men running a huge international organization you end up adding and taking because of the fashions because of what's popular because of what's unpopular man has to go oh we shouldn't maybe we don't put that in anymore but god doesn't want that god says let every stone that moses put together let every stone be untouched don't don't try and change it the 12 stones he said don't shake the stone you know this is what man wants to do and we've got to be very very you know we can say oh look out there but what about in here what about in your life are you shaping the stones you know because we can say oh i like all this but then there's a little desire in me that wants to do this you're shaping the stone because that's those stone you know those stones is our approach to god you know in the old testament they approached god and worshipped through the sacrifice of an innocent lamb or the sacrifice of an innocent cow and then then god's wrath or his that was fellowship was under the shed blood and it says without the shedding of blood was no remission of sin and so they approached god through an animal life but the animal life couldn't change them but see the altar this is where i'm getting to the altar was unjudged it was only the men put the stones there but the stone had to be exactly how god made the stone and the stones was all there and then they could sacrifice the animal and it's the same now are you changing the stone or are you leaving it are you letting god just leave it oh my so you can fall on the altar as a living sacrifice you know i'm really i'm calling this from the story of elijah on mount carmel if anyone is not aware mount carmel is where elijah challenged the prophets of baal in a time of uncertainty of israel in a time where great judgment was all over the earth a time where jezebel this woman power was controlling israel just like today we have a jezebel religion a world power dominating the trying to dominate the church trying to dominate the world a jezebel religion a world roman power trying to dominate and and here the spirit of elijah raises up and says to ahab and bring everybody to mount carmel we're gonna have a showdown amen we're gonna have a showdown and and elijah by vision saw that he had to do this and this and this and the prophets of baal could not call fire but here we have elijah and when the animal was on there he says god at your word i've done this amen there's the difference it's your word elijah was brave hallelujah elijah was willing to sacrifice his own ideas his own will his own dreams his own aspirations his own routines hallelujah amen his own routine hallelujah now if you're a routine driven person please don't feel like i'm attacking you hallelujah don't you know but you've got to be willing to sacrifice that you can have routines there's nothing wrong with order all right there's nothing wrong with it we like order we like to you know we like to do things right and do it properly and that sometimes requires habitual routineism but are you willing to let that go elijah was willing to let that go he probably wanted to do it a different way but god showed him this way and that in our day we've had a great spirit of a man anointed with the spirit of elijah to come and restore the altar so a people here we are hello right here you can fall on that altar this morning you can fall on an untouched approach to god hallelujah not crafted not rounded off so it looks real good not covered in gold like some of these big glorious altars and some of these prestigious cathedrals no just pure just pure hallelujah aren't you so glad that you can approach a pure altar this morning an approach to god hallelujah and when i talk about this that altar is repentance and baptism in the name of jesus christ that's it for the remission of sin that's the altar that repentance from your evil ways and everything in your will and all of that and to fall on the altar of the baptism in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and this promise peter says this is now the inauguration of the church and this is how it was all done in the book of acts and the early church until it was changed in 300 or so a.d by the roman catholic church they changed it all but and now all the churches seem to have commanded that and the pope even said that this is how they connect back to us all these churches and baptists and presbyterians and methodists and everything the pope stood up about five years ago and he said the way that they're connected back to us and and in his eyes the way that they are saved is because of the same baptism he said it's the umbilical cord that ties them back to mother rome you know that [Laughter] you can see now that's exactly why it's so important to take the true baptism that's the umbilical cord to father god hallelujah that's the altar untouched no shining of the stone just pure you know peter he says now the inauguration of the church he says this promise is unto you to the people of jerusalem in that day and to your children amen and to all those afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call amen hallelujah there you go that's uh that's christianity 101 hello but it's a good foundation for the for take sacrifice because you see when you take this route when you take the way of the lord's despised few you are sacrificing popularity you are sacrificing friends you are sacrificing your prestigious stand with with groups and many many many many people over the years have walked away or they just don't want to be around you there's all these things that happen but are you brave enough to follow the call of god are you brave enough to follow his call amen hallelujah so it says here um that you may present your bodies a living sacrifice wholly acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service amen and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god amen you know there's different modes of sacrifice when you you know right now it's we're not really conscripted to any battles maybe if you're living in the middle east you would be because there's a lot of war always going on in the middle east right so you would get conscripted you would be forced to sacrifice you're forced to a life of sacrifice do you think the damaskians the syrians and damascus do you think that they are living a comfortable life right now easy no no they're forced to a sacrifice so there is a sacrifice of war it's a physical war in the flesh you see wars begin in the spirit and then they come forth into the flesh and depending on the foundation of that society and the nature of their ethic whether it's judeo-christian jewish or whether it's buddhist islamic or hindu or whatever it may be that that will determine whether that war comes flesh or not you know because that there's reasoning and there's ability to go you know what that's actually ridiculous and if you're based on a say if you're based on a democratic judeo-christian foundation the idea of going and creating a big war in the flesh is just like the absolute last resort and you will do everything to avoid it right but then you get other foundations that will just run to it because they're called in their religion to fight you know there's just different ideas in different ways so the sacrifice that is made when the war is in the flesh now follow me the sacrifice that is made when the war comes to the flesh is physical and you have to sacrifice a lot of things you'll end up sacrificing most likely your job your business will become a gun place that makes guns or some like night vision stuff that's technical you know building all these like little testing things and stuff or whatever business you may be you sacrifice that by by force it just happens and it's all written down in the business laws and everything that if there's a war you are going to give that business up and your cars the soldiers can take everything to use for the betterment and for the you know the for the country and so there's a sacrifice that is made physically and spiritually because you will end up maybe losing loved ones and all these things because there's a war going on and you see that war because it's out in the flesh but god has called you to a discernment today there is a greater war happening that's even more ferocious than world war ii and it's already well and we know world war three is coming but world war iii has begun let me declare to you world war three is here it's in the spirit world war three is happening in the minds of all these people world war iii is happening inside you right now you know that because the end of world war three is armageddon right who knows that armageddon finishes world war three because christ comes to earth and says that's enough i'm taking over you guys have stuffed it up satan you stuffed it up get out you know that i'm just paraphrasing now that's not biblical language you stuffed it up satan go you've had six thousand years to prove that the civilization will work you failed he failed who believes he failed you know i don't think he didn't think he wanted to fail he's trying to prove that this monetary system and this economy would work but it didn't because man is evil because of the fall because of corruption so this whole thing shall be taken over and all of the corruption shall be finished amen i let i'm just going to stop there for a minute because i'm getting ahead of myself we will revisit this very soon hallelujah just just remember the sacrifice of war when it comes into the flesh then you really realize it but you need to discern right now that that same war is happening in the spirit because what will end world war three in the flesh is actually ending the devil in you spiritually speaking right now because you see human beings have been trapped into flesh and for and i'm talking about true believers right from the time when the holy ghost was poured out on the church they have always battled the flesh they've always battled the devil and their old nature ganging it up on them you know the devil knows your little complexes and things that's in your family and he knows how to scratch and he knows how to push the right button to get you to do a failure to get you to fail to get you to say the wrong thing to get you you know he works against you and you your old nature just happens to team up with the devil sometimes and get you in trouble and make you down and make you think like you don't even have the holy ghost to make you think this and that and everything else but just remember just remember world war iii is happening right now but are you willing if the people are willing out there to sacrifice if there's a big war on and they get they get patriotic and all of these boys and young men they want to go and fight for their country and they get their guns and they go and they're happy as and then they go and they get shot up and that's the end of them and they're willing who's willing who's brave enough this morning who's brave enough hallelujah to let go of your comfort to now i don't say you don't have to be comfortable man but just hear me out to let go of your routine to let go of your systems to let go of your your habits to let go of those things that make you good make you happy to let you know we want to be comforted we want to have comfort in our life and and we what we do and i've called these in here self-made comforts i think i call it that let me just go down here i made a list it's called self-secured comforts now human being wants to be comfortable we want to have cool things technologies we want to have our little thing and i like watching people build tables i love watching them build tables you know like woodwork and stuff and woodturning it's a little relaxation but i'm willing to i'm willing to let that go not that i'm going to if god says let it go i'll let it go and i'm willing to do that and he can then tell me to do it if i'm willing hallelujah but if you you you know you we get so caught up in something so caught up in a comfort that we get from you know an external source you know when you send an email and you're in an organization and it warns you that you're emailing out of your organization and it says you know be careful of this this this and this and this and it puts a higher level of security on your email that's the same thing now you when you are getting your comfort from god that you're in it's an internal affair amen there's no spam or anything that can get in no no malware hallelujah amen am i speaking today's language there's no malware it's all good but the moment you begin and i'm not saying you can't because we can it says that we should be in this world but not of this world but the moment you begin to derive your comforts from external sources all the warning stuff starts coming up be aware of spam be aware of your affections being taken out and being pawned off like rehabs you know i'm using that as a term so it doesn't sound too bad but you you pawn yourself off p-a-w in you pawn yourself off to the pawn shop all your affections oh i get my i love this i like this novel i like this romance i like this tv series and what you're doing is you're falling in love with these imaginary people you know that you're actually divvying out your heart to imaginary people when here is your family these are the people that god's called us to love he's called us to love his people he's called us to love him he's called us to love his word he's caught these are real people with real lives that are more interesting than a fantasy this is just one aspect you know one aspect but we've got to be careful because yeah especially you know and i only really caught this earlier on this year when the chosen came out and i thought man this is a powerful series because you actually become acquainted in your heart with the people and with jesus on there you're giving your heart out in a portion because now you know them and now i thought wow when when you get to know a person in a series and it's because a movie is different a movie is just this big and you're impacted and it's then it's finished but when you when you watch a series you're building a relationship with all the characters all the people you've got ones that you don't like and once oh man when i was young my mom usually used to get passionate oh this one and oh that one and all mine i just think man she's really into this you know and it's the same thing with the series you become a que you become in a relationship now with these people and i thought man when they crucified jesus in the chosen it's going to be way more impacting than any movie ever made because of the relationship that people are forming with them through that character and you just pray lord am i is this the right thing to do i like watching them i'm not saying don't watch them okay so this is something you need to be led of the holy ghost because if you're someone that can let your heart go like that you be careful now i give that illustration to show you that how our heart as a human being can be given away to something that's not even real you know these music pop stars and all that stuff and their their narrative and the think their image that they portray and you begin to infatuate with it and you begin to love that and you're like man your heart goes out to it it's an external email watch out spam malware um whatever else where all those things begin to become a reality there warning external so it's and so tread carefully because you see the enemy as a roaring lions worketh about seeking whom he may devour to try and devour you what he's not going to try and destroy you and put your boils all over you unless you really get down and do something i don't know but what he's trying to do is take your affections he's trying to take your ability to love god properly to ma your relationship with god that's what he's trying to do and it's very now i shouldn't say it's very easy because nothing can separate us from the love of god that's in your soul that's in your heart that's the very inner man the bible calls it with terminology is terminology but what the bible calls the inner man the one that's the real part of you that is inseparable to god but that's your it's the other parts of you your emotional realm your mental realm your physical realm these realms of you that are can be pulled away and your affections and your what you love and like you see when you begin to enjoy something you begin to receive it deeper into you you know when you just love something and you're just like i love this i love hearing this and it it it actually impacts you deeper than surface level so you you you allow things in deeper when you begin to enjoy it that's why we're protected when we go to the supermarket and ac dc is playing or eminem is playing or whatever they play in some shop but you've got to be there you haven't decided to put that on and you you you walk through it the demons that are on that don't come at you right they they don't they don't they're not just got a free course within you to attack you and to come inside you but if you put that on or let's say you because you you don't enjoy that thing you're not enjoying the spirits that are being expressed there so you're just protected but the moment you begin to enjoy that and you're like man i really like that you know you start dancing getting into it [Laughter] and you're just like man i really like what this guy's saying you're opening up to the spirit and this is how tv series is and and all these like fantasy novels and romance novels and all those things they they win your soul they win your spirit they win your emotions and they begin to take away your relationship with god because they they you you only have so much bandwidth i'm just speaking out today's terms i'm sure everyone knows what i mean maybe uh sister maggie might struggle with bandwidth but omar do you struggle with bandwidth okay so what that means is there's only so much that can happen at one time in a human being there's only so much affections that you can have there's only so much that you can you can you can think about at the same time right and so that's your bandwidth that's the width of your ability to do interact and be conscious in whatever realm it may be whether it's yeah so man i'm sounding like a scientist i need a helicopter on my head a helicopter hat you know mate we're right in the tech team's department now matt's laughing behind that screen oh mate okay so and when we divvy that out when we begin to give that out you make that decision we decide i'm going to give this out and you begin to lose the bound worth for the things of god and i'm saying that there will result in a lack of bravery that's going to result in an a glitch a bottleneck or a blockage for you to give yourself to god and allow god to take you into the unknown to take you beyond anything you've ever dreamed to take you beyond anything you could imagine greater than you can imagine his purpose for you is greater than you can dream because you see he built you for that he saw you before the world began and he said i'm making this person for this and he builds your dna to and all your gifts he placed in you and all the things that he gives you the talents that he places within you is exactly for that and then you become connected to it and then it becomes exactly what you are made for and you think you know when we go about our way and we go to study and we go down that route and we find it's just not really the fit but it's a job i'm going to go do it anyway because i need to make money that's just a trap you don't need to do that are you are you brave enough to say no are you brave enough to say no you know what i put that on the altar this morning i'm going to put my routine on the altar this morning i'm going to read a list if i don't read this list we will never get anywhere down from the first page so i'm going to read the list this morning are you willing to on the altar that's been restored and it's there and it's powerful let me just read this before i go there and this is a practical exercise who likes practical you know you get theory then you get practical we're going to do some practical stuff right now if this was sunday school i would have some things up here some props but you know i was touring with the idea i thought man i only got a day's notice so i i'll do this in sunday school sometime so hebrews 10 19 to 22 it says having therefore brethren now i want you to realize the power of this altar the power of the blood of jesus that was spilled on the altar and it's fresh like it was yesterday like it was now because remember he's the i am not the i was not the i will be the i am so if he's the i am then the blood is fresh if he's the i am it's still speaking freedom deliverance healing restoration rapturing faith it's still speaking your positive outcome hallelujah the blood speaks it says in hebrews that the blood of christ speaks better things than the blood of abel the blood of abel right at the beginning when cain killed him called for vengeance but the blood of jesus calls for your health calls for your safety calls for your peace cause for you to come into a kingdom of heaven cause for you to be healed from all your sickness spiritually and physically oh my that's a good voice that's a good calling hallelujah says here having and that's what i want i just wanted to magnify the power of that blood so right now in this practical session is an opportunity for you as i read this list for you to lay that on the altar and see what god can do see what his blood is speaking for you amen it says here hebrews 10 19 it says having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus by a new and living way which he has consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh hallelujah maybe after this we can sing that song i'm a king and priest of god hallelujah to the lamb i have passed the outer court oh glory be to god by the spirit's power and life i am living day and night i i am living in the presence of the king is hallelujah hallelujah i have passed the riven veil do you know that riven veil and this is just powerful is the body of our god the most ultimate sacrifice that could ever be made oh if i could if i wish i was 10 foot tall so i could feel that much better the ribbon veil oh my we you know we sing these songs and we sing going beyond the bow and you sometimes forget to remember what that actually was and is it's the very sacrifice of god that manifested in the flesh the son of god the bravest one our hero our champion oh my man he braved it out he stood there and why did he do it and this is the bolster of the whole thing love his love for you you hallelujah for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross and despised the shame hallelujah the joy there was a joy of knowing that you would be there it was a joy of knowing that he could save you there was a joy of knowing that whatever day 26th of december 19 2021 that you would be delivered of something when you put it on the altar or healed or whatever it may be hallelujah says here buy a new high levels that is to say is flesh and having a high priest over the house of god let us draw near with a true heart and full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water so here is where we're talking about conscience now conscience in the king james is desire so today if there's a dis if you've got desires and we've all got desired the flesh man don't be condemned by your flesh the god god knows you've got flesh and he knows that there's evil things in there hallelujah that that need to be dealt with and little by little he'll give you the land not everything all at once he said to israel you know when they took the physical land he said just a little bit i'll give you one day at a time and you'll get the capacity to handle it and it's the same with your inheritance in christ just little by little but today may another one happen you know i'll just read it now because i want you i just read these things so you'd have good confidence in the blood and good confidence that there is a restored altar where fire comes hallelujah fire comes why and water water to sprinkle your conscience to cleanse your desires who wants cleanse desires to cleanse you from the desire to do those things that are taking away your affections taking away your marring your love your relationship with god oh my do you think the devil ain't going to leave us he's going to leave us alone he ain't going to leave us alone he knows the things that you like and he's going to pull you he's going to begin to try and tempt you that way pull you that way to take away your worship but i just want to speak a mandate over you hurt not the oil of mine satan hurt not the worship and the revelation let these people be stimulated by the revelation of god hallelujah that's under the third seal it's said to hurt not the oil and the wine you know what that means that means that you have liberty to worship you've got liberty to have revelation liberty to have faith if god didn't say that we would be in a very sticky situation because the devil would be able to hurt our worship but he can't but what he tries to do is tries to divvy out your affections too far until you're busy and all your your creativity all your affections just goes all over the place oh my to the point now now let me say something here when you divvy it out too far you become hot between two opinions and you become hot between 20 opinions even and you just become hot between and you become lost in an ether of unsurety and you and all of a sudden all your affections have been divvied out so much that you've got one percent here seven percent there nine percent there six percent there one percent it's all every doubt all of a sudden you've got no real like center of worship you've just divvied yourself out like harlot like rahab spiritually speaking just divvied it all out this is where we've got to be very very vigilant and very discerning the bible says judge righteous judgment judge the spirit behind the man not the man the spirit behind those people the spirit behind that show the spirit behind that book the spirit behind it may even be a good thing you might be reading an atlas but you might get that oh my maybe you you might need a helicopter hat and it was a dictionary maybe who's read a dictionary before you know i want to just learn some words today i've done that i did that when i was about 12 you know i was like man i just want to learn a new word so you know you just dipping those things out what happens all of a sudden your human emotion just becomes flat and there's a form of depression because why you got nothing to enjoy you've got to reel it all back in hallelujah there's the sacrifice there's the altar you're the sacrifice but not a dead one a living one hallelujah lori these are the things now i'm just going to read it out now these are this this is if something's coming and knocking at your door the altar is there amen the altar is there and it and it's been restored i'm not saying this is the physical altar i'm talking about the restored altar of approach to god the access to the full power of his blood hallelujah the access to the full power of his healing the full power of deliverance the full power to change you just what did it say there to sprinkle your evil conscience your evil desires and your bodies now so that's spiritual and then the physical is that our bodies will be washed with pure water let me say something here we'll get to the list i promise we've actually dealt on the list quite a bit already anyway but um you know you because we are a triune being just like god is a triune being and we are a soul a spirit and a body and or an inner man a you know i don't know innermost man in a man in a out of bed out of court or you know the three of the tabernacle the holiest of holies the holy place and the outer court so there's three parts of us one part is redeemed saved and is sealed in by the holy ghost but these two other courts are actually subject to the fall and those are the those two places there work together so when you go into a situation and it makes you happy then there is a subconscious inside you a spirit the spirit of your mind that says in the bible that's in there creating chemicals to make you feel like your body to register that you're angry or you're happy or whatever it's registering that emotion it's registering it's reacting to your environment so they work hand in hand so when you are having an emotional time and you're going through something that emotion that experience that's coming in at you and it's stimulating your senses comes into your mind your mind begins to cause hormones to go and all sorts of things you know maybe you see the one you're going to marry and all of a sudden what is that love hormone called there's a hormone that makes you feel happy i don't know what's called oxytocin is that right oxytocin so there's actually hormones that give a physical registration to a spiritual environment to a spiritual encounter so those two things work together now they work together the reason they work together is they're very entwined but let me tell you this that the atonement by his stripes we are healed amen the chastisement of our peace was upon him so just as much as there is a atonement to heal your body if you get a cancer or you get sick or you get something that's wrong with you and you're and you've got the you've got the courage to stand in christ and say he is my healer on your body what about your spirit what about your emotional realm what about the realm that actually affects your body so much because what you are you what you think you really are and if you're a negative person and you have negative thoughts all the time your body is going to be negative you know that and i'm not speaking about like the secret positive affirmation type of um psychology thing i'm talking about this is real they've just tapped into something they've tapped into humanity and they've realized in the science world and in the you know the airy fairy pie in the sky stuff they've realized that you know that doesn't mean it's not true it just means that there is a biblical foundation to actually thinking positively it says that life and death are in the power of the tongue but the words come from a thought so if you're thinking like life or death think life if you begin to get a narrative in your head that's negative you cast it down the bible says every single exalts itself against the knowledge of god cast it down cast it down discern it and say that's from the hell i don't want to have that in my mind i don't want to be a negative person i'm sick of being negative because when you're negative your spirit comes into your flesh and it all just starts to cause negative things to happen to you they say that people that are stressed all the time and angry and just contentious they always more susceptible to things like cancer and all that stuff because of then the narrative now that is fairly general it doesn't mean it's everything it just means it's more susceptible there's also genetics there's all sorts of other reason but there is a very very clear demarcation you could call him that if you uh if you've got negative chemicals running through your like if you're if you're an angry negative person and it's causing negative chemicals to go through your body we're not made to have those chemicals go through our body constantly and you know when you're constantly in something that's just negative your body actually closes down your spirit that go becomes closed and then you get depressed and then you find you've got no emotion at all depression is not sadness depression is the void of all emotion you know that people think oh depressed people are just these sad if they're sad they're in a better condition than than depression clinical depression is the void of all emotion but sadness there's nothing wrong with being sad there's nothing wrong with being you know down you can be down because that's going to draw you closer to god the purpose of all of this roller coaster of this life that we call it you know is to get us closer to god and so no matter what you're going through whether you're having an awesome time and you're on the mountain and you're rejoicing you're getting closer to god or whether you're down in the dumps and you're going through the hardest trial of your life you're getting closer to god that's the purpose so when you go through hard times and when you go through trial and you're going down and it's all just everything's against you oh my and even yourself you're just oh my you just oh you know that don't let that be an opportunity to go further down and out get closer to god hallelujah when you found yourself in a in a mild depression it's there's a purpose for it don't despise it say god why am i here and while i'm here i'm gonna look around while i'm here i'm gonna discover what's the purpose because god will never let you go into anything that you cannot handle and he'll always provide a way of escape amen who believes that hallelujah so all of this is opportunity and today there's an opportunity now as i read this list i feel like i should read it now control who's brave enough to put control on the altar who's brave enough is everyone brave enough here you don't need you don't need to raise your hand but you can because some of us love to be in control of others of ourselves of whatever it may be they love it and they can't help but there's a desire there to be in control whatever causes that is between them and the lord and it can be healed that's and what comes under that is routines and consistency and surety you know things that's always the same you just need to be in control of that thing there's the altar human rights you know god purchased us with a price his ultimate sacrifice paid for us in full you are not your own but you are bought with a price therefore as a lamb the nature of a lamb a lamb will forfeit their right to all their human rights to him people think they have their human rights and really they've already forfeited it to some ideology of the devil oops i'll leave that financial security is a big one oh my everyone likes to have financial security but are you willing this morning to lay financial security right there just put it there on that restored altar where the fire can come and consume that are you willing to let god take you into the deepest of poverty just let go of your finances now i don't mean be frivolous and go and just waste anything don't do that but are you willing to let god take that this is a big one financial security we all want to be safe to be able to pay our bills and live a nice comfortable life but actually and sometimes we can fight against the call of god to do that many many people at the judgment seat of christ i believe will have that that that there will be a big one where people have chosen their own financial security over the calling of god to be called to do a certain thing and they just can't let go of their job or they can't let go of their aspiration to be a doctor or to be a whatever professor you know and there's this thing that we just have to be willing now i'm not saying we should just go and do it and go and live in the mountains i'm saying that this is an attitude of the heart where because you see when that goes on the altar then god can lead without hindrance you won't veto the holy ghost does everyone know i think i'd explained veto one time didn't i veto override see the holy ghost can be overridden by our own will because he will not touch our free will therefore you've got to be very careful in the sense of are you willing to surrender your will are you willing to die to your own ambitions and all of these things so human rights as lambs you know the lamb nature as the holy ghost you know see the jesus was the lamb of god he depicted himself as the meekest earth animal he became the lamb of god who's forfeited his right to be a man forfeited his right to marriage forfeited his right and he had a right every right he had a right to be married he had a right as a man to live a nice life and to be a carpenter in his father's stepfather's house and he had a right to do all those and he sacrificed it sanctified himself for our sake as a lamb the meekest land animal and and at the river jordan when heaven and earth kissed as you could you want to say when the when there was a point there where john said behold the lamb of god which takes away the sin of the world and here comes this man meek and lowly look like just anybody else walking up and john dessert here is the lamb of god the meekest earth animal an animal that can be led an animal that would submit to its sharing would submit to the farmer but as soon as you pick up a lamb they just they're still they're no fighting you try and pick up a turkey you try and pick up a rooster man those things are pecking you and scratching you and but you pick up a lamb just it feels safe and this is the thing this meek and lowly just gentle he depicted the nature of the son of god as a lamb right there not always he's a lion as well amen but that's that's after now so here's this lamb and at the river jordan when heaven came down and kissed the earth because he was a human remember and here is a great event that took place where the dove the meekest flying creature the meekest animal of the sky the dove and the lamb unite and that union was a was a powerful union where the two meekest animals depicted now would come together and that lamb nature god is calling us to have a lamb nature so that we can have the dove land upon us but the thing is this flesh is a wolf nature this old nature is a wolf nature and if you let it rain if you feed it if you begin to strengthen it and bolster it up and go out there and do external emails to all that other stuff out there you what you're doing is you're building up your wolf nature and how can you have fellowship with the dove if the wolf nature is right up in the top front page of your brain and just you know you're just all busy and you know for me mate i have seriously i'm preaching to myself because you know i i'm quite busy so i'm i'm constantly interacting with different people and fast busy doing stuff and you know i've got to really fight that too you know so i'm not just preaching at i'm preaching with this is this is something that we're all got to work through is that this lamb nature you are willing to forfeit your right as a human being to everything that humans have rights to no i don't mean i'm not just talking about the geneva convention and talking about all the world rights i'll make that stuff's just corrupted as it can be but i'm talking about just the natural rudimentary rights of humanity if you are willing to forfeit that as a lamb you'll have fellowship with the dove that doesn't mean you you won't have that it's just the willingness to let go and let god completely have his way are you brave enough this morning to lay that on the altar hallelujah are you brave enough to lay financial security on the altar he's jehovah jireh amen are you willing and brave enough to lay self-secured comforts on the altar easy living chemical fixes and i'm talking about pharmaceuticals and drugs and all that stuff you know covering up trouble covering up problems all the time you're always just covering it all up you know sometimes the problem is of spirit and you've got to deal with it stop covering it all up and and and just putting all your faith in the chem in the medical world now i've got nothing against the medical world okay there's a blessing there and and i believe that god has used that and and there's definitely um strength and and all that from there but but are you willing if god calls you to trust him trust him with your depression trust him with that that spiritual trouble that you're taking drugs for trust him with with uh you know those headaches or those migraines trust him are you brave are you brave enough because you see now it's an attitude now this is the we're on a balance here and so and you you know if you're trusting that you're over here and you're not trusting the lord but he wants you to get here and when you're here then he can say he can call you to a position he can call you no no all of these things i read here come to the middle don't lean over this way or lean over that way unless god calls you he will he will never call i don't believe god will call you to lean away from him he may call you now there's different people there's people that have a gift of faith there's people that are just bulldog believing and they just say it and it happens and they pre pray and the rain stops and you watch it stop they say clouds disappear and it disappears stuff like that right powerful gifts but that doesn't mean we all got that you know and so you're going to do that he caught god's called them to that god's anointed them for that so he's pulled them over like that now if they're balanced they will not try and bring everybody there you know what i mean because you can't just pull everyone into something it's a god thing it's not a man thing it's a god thing it's a god balance what god wants from us and this is the purpose of this whole thing today is that you would be in the middle so that he can lead you he can call you to something when we go extremeness extreme down or just out of balance it's hard for the spirit of god to get attention but he wants to get your attention this morning he wants you to be brave are you brave enough because in that balance your rights your comforts your everything is all on that altar and you have had the bravery and the courage to trust them to put it there to and leave it there takes a bravery it takes a real man or a real woman not some coward not some boy but a real man a tough man you know someone that's got gumption character a man measured by his physical muscles he's mentioned by his character and his you know when god calls men he calls them to these things and you look at that and you think oh it's such a good story you put yourself there you go do what moses did you go face a government like pharaoh and egypt the whole mate you know he started off there and it's a very similar story in type to the type of of christ you know coming to the earth because here he is this man who was just meant to be pharaoh you know he's gonna be the next king of the world and he's been trained up in all the things of egypt and he was called now in his heart something was calling moses you're not this type of royalty you're a different type of royalty see moses look out that window and moses looks out the window pharaoh's looking out the window and they're both looking out the window and moses looks out the window and he sees royalty barrow looks out the window and sees a bunch of mud daubers a bunch of slaves but moses looks out the window and something within him is resonating there's royalty this is the real thing and he began to neutralize and he got to a place where he says i'm willing and you know what he got called out hallelujah 40 years later he came back amen he was willing to sacrifice he was brave he took bravery real bravery to let go of the splendor of egypt's riches and all the treasures and all the wisdom he was trained as a military man probably knew all of the ways and was trained in judaism and trained in all of the abrahamic government covenants everything trained in it all but he sacrificed it all to be you know be found as with one of the lord's despised few are you willing are you brave enough are you brave enough this morning son of god are you brave enough this morning daughter of god to come to a place where god can call you to come to a place where you can receive commission to come to a place where he can take you higher hallelujah to be in a place where you won't veto the holy ghost anymore we think we sometimes wonder why have i sat here so long and i haven't had a calling or i haven't had any direction personally but i'm watching all this stuff happen all around me just watching it all happen maybe there's a desire in your life that's vetoing the holy ghost and this morning the restored altar the stones are untouched this morning don't go touching the stones while we're speaking don't touch the stone don't reason now you know don't go reasoning let's not let's let's let's not reason against this this reason for it amen because what i'm telling you is very very sound very clear very brutal it's elementary bible experience and i just want you to lay it down just lay it down hallelujah you watch what happens stand still it says and see the salvation of the lord hallelujah easy living chemical fixes and which are temporary they don't fix the problem they cover the problem instant gratification this is another self-secured comforts there's a lot of things that we do for instant gratification one of them for me and i'm going to get to it here is junk food you know or for sweets and sugars and easy stuff oh my you know you eat this thing and you immediately you're in a happy place oh my you can be having the worst day ever and then you go and you begin to eat tim tams and you suck the coffee through the tim tam you know and you chew and you just eat that and it's just like wow and all of a sudden all your woes are finished for about 30 seconds you know now that i'm not saying there's anything wrong with doing that you can do that but if that becomes your you know you that becomes your comfort source you're going to get fat man and you're going to get unhealthy because you've let that become primary hey let it be a secondary tertiary thing there's nothing wrong with god created our mouths to produce happy chemicals when we eat actually that's why i cook and i think people like my food because i kind of understand how the happy chemicals work so i start putting in stuff that makes the happy chemicals flow you know oh man that's true that's exactly what it is i mean these fast food outlets they take it to the extreme and they study it out and they make sure that there's enough of this and that and everything so that when you eat this thing it's like whoa man i'm an euphoria and you don't know why but you just like it and then you go back and you keep going back and you keep going back because there's things in there it's engineered food engineering they do it but what i'm meaning here is let that not be our primary source of comfort are you willing now here's the altar the blood is there it's speaking your freedom now it's speaking your deliverance now it's speaking exodus you know israel was called out of egypt hallelujah and these are the things of egypt these are the things of the world the garlic pots the nice food that they had israel had to be willing to sacrifice it amen moses was willing to sacrifice the good goodness sacrificed the royal spread he sacrificed the royal spread he sacrificed all that prime entertainment sacrificed it because he knew maybe he didn't know but we know that those things are trouble for his spirit trouble for his faith trouble for his affections you know if you just called in now you know um consolidate if you consolidate all of your affections back and you give them all to god man you're just going to be living in rapturing condition you're going to be living in a place with god oh my i'm telling you now like this morning like this is a practical thing now and i i save here but it doesn't mean it's there i'm just using that as an example that here is an altar and on that altar is the blood of jesus that it's restored but and i'm sorry i may oh the blood has been shed so that you can fall on that altar and and these things that i'm bringing up place it there and believe it's not rocket science it's not something complicated we don't have to crawl up the stairs of the saint peter's basilica on our knees with a rosary bead we don't have to do any religious thing as far as that is concerned physical penances and things we all we need to do is believe that there is a sacrifice that's made for us and he came and that great sacrifice he's wanting yours as well he's saying come and meet me in the sacrifice meet me at the altar hallelujah take these things that have been troubling your affections take these things that you've been leaning on for comfort and put them there and bring your balance because you might be getting comfort from it like this it might be just you just feeding on that thing and naturally you'll just get worse and worse and worse and it's saying now bring it to the altar bring it here and let me lead you to where you need to be amen so that you can come out of that thing hallelujahs it's just just as simple as you believing as i'm telling you now it's a practical lay it right there instant gratification idols pop music romance fantasy tv series and i talked about that already it just came out john 14 15 to 18 it says if you love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter i just want you to i want i want i want you to put your name in this because you see jesus he speaks these things not just to the people he was standing around but to you this evening this morning he's speaking that to you i will give you a comforter amen he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever he will never leave you nor forsake you right even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth he's talking about himself now obviously in third person and i shall be with be in you because now he goes from a third person perspective as that he shall send because it's a it's a it's a portion of the father's will so he's talking about the father's going to send the comforter and then he but he actually as he's as he's talking he actually becomes the comforter so you know he's personifying himself to say i will never leave you i will be in you to the end of the world hallelujah amen that's god he's talking to you i want to be your comfort when you're down i want to be your your your strengths when you are weak i want to be your joy when you're happy i want to rejoice with you around the sacrifice oh yeah amen glory you know see it's not just a one-way thing it's not just us having a worship you know when you really enter in and you realize what's going on and you begin to dance up man you're rejoicing and you're having a good time i believe you know god is there and he's rejoicing too because he knows that you know this is a good thing we're just about going into rapture now you know this is why i just pray that as a result of this that our um connection with god will be just a bit brighter you know if there's something marrying you now don't over condemn yourself now and go if he's read that listen every single one of them's mean because there will be a portion of all of these in all of us because we have flesh hello we've got bodies that are subject to the fall that have inherited sins from all the way back to adam can you imagine all the bodies and flesh and everything is corrupted that's why god says i will bruise the seed of the serpent i'll bruise his head all his influence all that darkness i'm going to give you power over it i'm going to raise you up so you give dominion he said to the disciples i'm going to give you power to tread on the serpents oh all that serpent nature and all that evil doctrine and darkness i'll give you power and what did he do at the calvary hallelujah the greatest sacrifice the greatest bravery a man who could feel all the pain had to feel the pain took it all for us hallelujah he broke the back of the enemy now the enemies on the ground cannot do anything other than lie i think i've said that last time remember that who remembers that i said if he's he he's just lying and if he's not lying he's lying on the ground and that's it he's lying underneath your feet mate my mouth is dry if your mouth is dry it starts foaming you know if anyone's preached they'll understand [Laughter] the front people at the front are going man brother andy oh my well we're just people you know we just have a good time amen and so he gives us power over all the darkness power and today it's power for you today it's power for you to hop out of yourself go beyond the camp today go beyond the camp of your discomforts go beyond the camp of your rights go be on the camp of your creature comforts go beyond the camp of those crutches that you've held onto all your life to give you comfort to give you peace when the peace giver is saying come to me come to me if you want my peace that i give that the world cannot give let that go so that you can have my peace it's a simple transaction but it can be very difficult because you get so used to the routine that you have where you do your thing then you do that thing and then that thing and then that thing and then you go to this and you you the the aspiration the knowledge that i'm about to go and get comfort from this thing and you sit down and it's like you just feel pulled towards it because it's the way the human nature works but today are you brave enough to put it there who's brave this morning hallelujah true sacrifice is for the brave true sacrifice will call you beyond the camp hallelujah true sacrifice called out jesus beyond the camp of jerusalem outside the camp he was crucified hallelujah breaking sins power loosing the holy ghost upon a people that would believe to give them dominion and he said to them look i'm going to give you power to treat on the serpent i'm going to give you power over the darkness and you're going to prevail hallelujah amen i will not leave you comfortless he says he see even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it sees them not neither know him but you know him for he dwelleth in you and shall be with you and shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you hallelujah amen and so when your balance comes back to the center and you call out because see the lord is waiting for you to be neutral he's waiting for you to quit the extremism to quit the humanistic um enterprise quit it just just let it go the ultra's there for you to be separated from that you know you know um it says in ezekiel 16 and god's talking to israel and he's typing them with a woman that was found in a pool of blood and left for dead but her umbilical cord was still on tied to babylon or whatever it was and and she was just left you see when you begin to source feed from mother rome or babylon this world mystery babylon and what it does is that you've got an umbilical cord there but may today the power of the blood sever that seven the umbilical cord that you're getting comfort from the wrong thing sever the umbilical cord that you're you uh you're a creature that needs to have control consider the umbilical cord that you can't give up your human rights severe it so that god can lead you so that you can actually have real peace so that you can have real joy because and he can really lead you and you can really go to places and you've got the bravery for god to call you to something that sounds seems very scary you know because the unknown to the human being is scary right we can be scary but you don't have to be scared you think gideon was you know he started off scared but then he had a visitation from the angel and see the angel he he he he spoke over gideon hallelujah he spoke you know gideon he was a man that was scared he was hiding his wheat behind the threshing behind the wine press he was scared and all the midianites would come every year and take all his wheat but then there came a one day hallelujah and maybe that's your day today hallelujah where the angel said thou mighty man of valor hallelujah amen he didn't say thou fearful man hiding your wheat behind the wine press what are you doing no said the almighty man of allah and i want to say that to you today the mighty people of our mighty sisters brothers of valor hallelujah calling you from fear calling you from being scared of the unknown calling you from being scared to let your finances go hallelujah don't be fearful don't be fearful fear not let put it there don't lean on it bring it back to the center when it's in the center you lay it there you watch god can call you now he can start to commission you because you're not scared it's one of the biggest things that we can be afraid of when god's calling us to a calling oh he's calling us out and the children too you have to be careful you know you really want to make sure that you're not leaning on these things because you see god doesn't need that he doesn't need that you you we need to be at a place where there's nothing in the bank and you've got bills and you've got to pay those bills but you just have to trust the lord because he called you to a place where he says no no just give this you know there's giving ministries and god when you're in a place where he can actually tell you he's not going to tell you if he knows you're going to say no why would he do that he wants you to be neutral he wants you to have absolute trust in him so that you can be free so he can call you higher he can take you further and give you the things that you've always needed amen hallelujah delight yourself in him and he'll give you the desire of your heart amen you know that delight is the delight of a wife to her husband hallelujah i don't want to get off subject i'm nearly done hallelujah the blood is speaking popularity is one of the big ones people don't want to give up their standing in society but are you brave enough do you think um you know joshua and caleb do you think they were brave enough did they have the bravado to stand against the rest of israel when they saw what god promised and faith it was registered in them that our god is faithful and even though i see the enemy so big and so strong god promised that i am not going to care what all my friends say i'm not going to care what the people at school say i'm not going to care what all even anything and all all the other pastors all the other leaders no god told me to do this god says he promised that i'm going to go regardless of popularity whether i get the people's vote or not this is where god is calling us to a place now now he's not calling you to extremism that you go you know there's people that go out there and they're just you know they're they're out on their own and they're just a rogue you know like he's not calling us to a rogue calling it's per se but it's a balance of where your desire for popularity is gone and actually you know you're already accepted in the beloved amen so you're already popular you're popular in the kingdom of god in the economy of god you're popular hallelujah you're popular in heaven there's a great cloud of witnesses who believes that we're surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses you know they love you and you're accepted you didn't earn it you were given acceptance hallelujah you know at school and it worked and in the world you've got to do something to get accepted you've got to be something got to have something but in christ you are made accepted you're already accepted and you're already popular so you don't need to desire it you don't need to prove yourself you don't need to be something great you don't need to be something anything you already are popular hallelujah actually to try and be popular creates less popularity in the kingdom of god you know you just get yourself fixed up and you get yourself in a fix and and you know like you get complexes in your mind because this one doesn't like you because they look to you like that and everything but if you just believe and you're at peace you actually create an atmosphere that people want to be around you know you don't have to try and prove anything you just rest and all of a sudden you're in fellowship with god and then people want to be in fellowship with you all the time because you you just have an atmosphere and they know that if they come there they're going to get a word from the lord or they're going to get if they pray you know you and people have confidence in your prayers because you're not seeking after something or there's no ulterior motive it's just pure that's the kingdom of god that's the way of the king the way of the master that's our way that's why you don't have to seek after popularity and actually be willing like joshua and caleb and the face of all the other spies in the face of everything they stood up they ran their garments and said no god is surely able to give us the land and everyone else was against them and they were going to stone them and then god took over and said because you guys have unbelieved you shall not see the land but joshua and caleb will preserved them and then 40 years later they were old caleb says i'm still the same strength so the same power that kept us close all thing i believe that he was still strong same power you know it's a resurrection life you can please god by not being going with the crowd don't go with the crowd hey there's nothing wrong with rejoicing with the crowd rejoice at the crowd if you see your brother having a glorious time have a glorious time with them you might not have you're not not feeling anything but praise god they're having a good time i'm happy for them and then all of a sudden the glory comes on you too it's a chain reaction in those cases but then maybe the crowd has known nothing but you god is working on you and and you you just you know especially the children with all the pressure don't worry about what your friends think you rejoice hallelujah you rejoice if god is touching your heart young children then you rejoice don't worry about what your friends are rejoicing or not you rejoice if the girls you know they're all the girls coming up at camp and they're all there you know i trust that they were there for their individual reason they weren't following a crowd they were there sovereignly with god young girls little ten nine-year-olds crying out to god screaming out under his power at camp you know like that's that's powerful but you see maybe that hasn't happened and then one of those girls you know it was just her and god's working on her and she comes to the front she's not doing it for popularity she's doing it for her because it's god god's working on our heart and it's the same thing with us you know we really need to make sure that we're not re we're not reacting or acting upon what other people just because of other people that's not the reason the reason is we have come to a place where we're not seeking after population we're secure in ourselves we don't have to secure our place we don't have to secure our position no where the security is god here's the security detail hey man he's the bodyguard not you you don't have to secure anything you don't have to secure your finances you just had to be diligent faithful but you know now this is just coming there is out of balance diligence too where you're controlling it where you've become the law of your own diligence and you it becomes an idol and i've seen i know people not on the message not here in the church but people that i do work with and stuff and their diligence with money is an idol and it's everything and it's even more higher than their human relationships they will go it's all about well it's not but it is you know because it's all in the name of diligence so i don't want you you know we should we've got to be very balanced when it comes to diligence even don't let diligence become an idol that's higher than god and you've got to be super diligent with all the stuff and if someone else isn't then and it's not up to your level of your own humanistically created diligence and they're not and you start to condemn them because they're not like you don't that's all the way over here now in their extreme humanistic legalistic vision you've got to bring it back are you willing to lay that on the altar are you brave enough to lay your diligence on the altar hallelujah hallelujah the next one is justice are you brave enough to lay justice your reparation retribution contempt resentments self-harm you know you can resent others but generally there's people that don't resent others as well they resent themselves and they harm themselves and they do things to themselves they punish themselves don't punish yourself why are you punishing yourself mate you get we've got enough against us to punish ourselves you know we don't want to be doing that man you know it's true people they get into a ploy it's a spirit that people begin to harm themselves even you know and they find comfort in cutting their arms and cutting themselves and all these different crazy it's a it's really bad but it's actually something that they do to feel comfort that they've actually done themselves a a punishment because of how useless they think they are but really this is a place that we need to get out of that are you willing to lay self-contentment today lay it there stop getting angry at yourself stop doubting yourself stop stop you know condemning yourself for your own failures because that there is pulling you out of balance it's pulling you in a place where you high expectation of yourself and when you do fail you actually pull yourself out of fellowship with god because you get angry and you begin to swear you begin to get frustrated at the things that you're doing and you call yourself names all that sort of stuff just just lay it now you know right now the power of the blood is there to free you and maybe it's someone on here on that video there just lay it down be free from that because you see that thing there is a bondage and it's those things there are we brave enough to let that go are you brave enough to let contempt go holding grudges all those things let it go let it there and be free in the name of jesus christ hallelujah lay it down right now hallelujah amen ambitions who are you really you know we have ambitions and you see we're born in the world and we've got brothers and sisters or maybe we're the only child whatever it may be or we've got parents and they've got aspirations and they've got ideas and then we go to school and we have friends that have got ideas and then we go through some things and we think oh and you see something that strikes you and you think wow i've got to help that situation so then you tr you push and you go after that and that's your whole life's purpose it's an aspiration now who are you and this is the question is that the real you or is that the one the you that's been shaped by circumstances that's been shaped and impressed by situations over your life impressed by parents that that would push you in a certain direction or impressed by your own uh insecurity but really there's a real you the one that's waiting for you in heaven you know it says that with this body be dissolved we have one already in heaven eternal in the heavens that we will go into this body so there is a part of you that's already there somehow an eternity that you will go into now that one there i believe is the one that god saw before the foundation of the world that one that part of you that was in his mind that he thought of you that's a perfect you now he's we're in this end time we're being called to come into union with who we really are and our true self and our true nature and our true purpose come into union so are you for that to happen and i think this is very serious for that to happen are you willing to lay all of your ambitions are you brave enough who's brave brave enough you see you could there's nothing wrong with having them but just bring them back to the middle have them right in the middle if you put them over here he's not going to pull you out pull you into the middle you've got to choose he sits before you today life and death this is death because it's you it's it just isn't him but coming into here you don't throw it out don't throw anything out unless it's evil if you know it's evil then you know it's evil you get rid of it it's fine but if it's just a normal human thing or a job or whatever an aspiration of life that we have to kind of participate in right now then then bring it to the middle let god call you because when you're in the middle benny can call you to wherever he wants you to be but when we drive ourselves and we drive it into the ground and we put a stake down and you put a you put a rope around the tree and you begin to what's that thing called in the car where they went they you're winching yourself to that purpose of your own imagination it's dark can't do it you can do it but you won't get any rewards for that you see at the judgment seat of christ all that all that was his will will be everything will be tried by fire and only that which he is called to do will remain so you can serve all your life and have all the stuff that you've done and it may not even come through the fire because really it was you that did it and it might be something that would help people might be a blessing to people but it wasn't actually the plan of god so this is where it's so important are you willing to lay your ambitions there are you willing to lay your aspirations that your dreams your visions amen what people think you're good at gifts in your life put them there hallelujah are you brave enough this morning to put them there i believe you are i ask the question but it's really between you and the lord are you brave enough teenagers are you brave enough to let god give you are you brave enough to let go of your own thoughts and let god show you who you really are oh yeah amen it takes a real man a real girl hallelujah a real woman lady hallelujah amen hallelujah pears expectation parental pressure collective spirits matriarchal spirits you know groups entities you know these big groups that people form and all that sort of stuff it gets a spirit over it and it begins to pressure people to be a certain way and if you step outside you know like you could say israel had a matriarchal spirit because it wasn't god's spirit that was leading israel the all of them that unbelieved it was a matriarchal spirit a collective spirit of human beings together then the devil got in there and a matriarchal spirit took over and began to pull them into unbelief but are you willing like joshua and caleb to say to defy that are you willing to defy the collective spirit of shekinah tabernacle i know that sounds pretty harsh are you willing to defy and especially the children are you willing to defy the spirit of your skull and stand up and say i'm a son of god and i'm ready to stand and i'm ready to walk and i'm i'm brave i'm brave enough to lay it down and let god be in me and let god lead me are you brave enough now nationally speaking the message of new zealand are you brave enough to stand against it because this evil spirit's going on lots of them that have been from the past and hang-ups and disunities and all sorts of politics that's a matriarchal spirit trying to keep everyone in the wilderness but there's individuals like joshua and caleb that are ready to cross over that have crossed over that are walking in victory amen are you willing or are you just going to stay in the status quo and float around and be everybody's friend were you willing to make a stand for your convictions and have a real bravery are you brave enough because you see if you get to a place where you're neutral and god calls you you're going to need to be brave you're going to need to be brave because this guy you're going to lose popularity someone's going to speak this against you you're going to get criticized that you because anyone that amounts to hillary beans that does anything for god that has been called out to do something we'll go through critics we'll go through all of the gauntlet we'll go through the trials they come face to face with the devil because you see they're not ensnared in that whole collective bondage don't be led by a community don't be led by culture don't be led by your your your family's culture don't be led by your church culture be led by god amen bravery but it takes a sacrifice amen but you see when it's really god and he's really leading you it's not rogue it's not it's not extreme it's gentle it's lamb nature it's dove leading lamb amen can't the musicians please hallelujah merry christmas should i say god bless you this christmas amen you see christmas is about the greatest sacrifice that god would be born into the earth and he would he hit the sacrifice of leaving heaven and sometimes you may be in a very good place right now you may be having a very easy time right now you may be having can we do we all know that song he left oh we're going to sing that song can we just first sing he left the splendor of heaven knowing his destiny it was the lonely hill of golgotha where he laid down his life for me if that isn't love the ocean is dry do we know that song do we have that song does everyone know that song or is it is it an oldie aldi maybe we're just singing that first one i said [Music] that was i passed the outer court you can stand [Music] just before we sing i have to finish this there it is all your any hang-ups that you may have or any things that have been brought to your attention i believe it's already gone i believe there's been deliverance today and if you believe it it will happen hallelujah so that you can stand against all of the spirits and all the things of this world with meekness not going out there is some corrective ministry that corrects everyone that's wrong that stuff is you're wasting your time absolutely waste of time it's better to talk about the true than to expose the false all the time nothing wrong with having a bit of you know discernment but if you focus your whole life on trying to get trying to expose the devil all you're going to have is darkness because all you're doing is raising darkness and putting darkness over the people they all know all about the darkness but what about the light what about jesus what about the one who saved us what about the true sacrifice now if he was willing to sacrifice it he was brave enough to leave the splendor of heaven and come down and and sacrifice himself the true christmas story then are you willing who's willing this morning who's willing to sacrifice themselves to sacrifice all of these things so that you can walk in his calling come to neutrality come to the center come to the center of the road saints hallelujah we're going to sing and then we're going to pray together and right there maybe you need prayer then we're going to pray together and you can lift it up before the lord in his presence and let him work on your life amen hallelujah i believe the true report hallelujah to the lamb i have passed the outer core oh glory be to god i am all on jesus i i'm the out to sanctify to the world and sin i've died hallelujah [Music] [Music] where the glories never failed hollande i am living in the presence of the king i'm a king and priest of god hallelujah to the lamb the cleansing of the blood oh glory be to god by the spirit's power and light i am living day and night in the holiest place so bright hallelujah i am [Music] i am living in the presence of the king [Music] oh glory be to god i am sanctified to god the power of the blood [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] just give him glory give him praise glory's never failed hallelujah [Music] hallelujah i am living in the presence of the king amen oh jesus by your sacrifice lord that's by his sacrifice hallelujah let me read a quote here i just want to read this quote i believe it's very pertinent right now just as the music's playing what is the ultimate solution for this human question it's love friends i'm not no little boy no more i've seen so many attest but i've never seen nothing yet could override love it just takes everything out of the way love conquers wild animal love conquers it's the most conquering force there is because it's god what is it love conquers all things love the lord with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind with all your strengths hallelujah amen it's a big one now and faith will accompany that love it says now notice abraham had to believe god in order love god to believe him you love him and more you love him the more faith will accumulate love is the connection that permeates love is the real issue of life love projects god's reality love is our anchor love forges our point of contact to god love has stems of connective gravity love is a hub of grace love is opportunity love is our place of momentum love builds our walk love conquers all love is progress love enables us to trust love enables us to surrender hallelujah love is reason god moves in nature love conquers everything and when love is projected grace comes in to help it then it's real conquering love so all of this my brother my sister that you've heard today is all bolstered with love if you're struggling with something then right now as we pray raise your heart lift your heart up to god and say god let me love you more help me to love you more maybe you've had trouble with love in your life and you've blocked up love channels then right now the altar is here for healing that you can be healed of that love trouble so that you can really love god because if you if you struggle to love humans then that is also going to be projected in your love to god and i believe that right now love can be healed in your life right now because loving god is it all culminates it all comes and stems into love and if you struggle to give something up because you don't want to release it to god and you're holding on to it you're controlling it right now because it's giving you security then release that security to god and if you're struggling then ask god now as we pray for love to love him so that love because love works faith the bible says amen are you ready to let go hallelujah sacrifice is for the brave let's pray the heavenly father we are just going to pray in our own way lord lord jesus you know the things that i struggle with you know father the things that i lord lay on that altar with faith believing that there's a sacrifice for me and i'm laying myself i'm identifying myself on the altar that has been restored i come lord and lay down myself and lord this congregation i believe father that right now lord we can pray together and and just give it to you lord lord heal us heal spirits today heal our humanity lord that would struggle to love unblock the channels in our lives lord that we can truly interact and and love each other and and treasure the family that we have to treasure this family in
