lead me to the lord lead me [Music] lead me to the rock that is [Music] amen praise the lord so yesterday i was just looking through some different songs to do and i kind of i stumbled across some little african songs and then i then you know you start doing that on uh youtube and they all kind of then you get all these different um like suggestions and they're all it's all you sort of go in the same veins though i know and i thought what's this song and it was like i'd listen to it and i think oh that was the song that uh brother jeremy used to sing or well that was a song now do another one aside that's the song brother sang or or oh there was a song brother any effort then i came across a medley that had all of them together so i was like right let's do that it's um so but it's like a long middle i think there's about 11 or 12 verses so it just keeps on going and going and going but that's right we'll just that's how you do it in africa man you just keep on going [Laughter] so talia you may not know where i'm going to go but i'll just like we just go you'll figure it out i'm just going to open up this so i can i actually had good fun doing this i'm just going to i'm going to actually control it maybe i can control it from here tell you if i uh let's do if i've got my mind i've got my mind made up and i want turn back because i want to see my jesus [Music] someday

[Music] [Music] i [Music] fire [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] fire fall [Music] why [Music] oh and it's keeping me alive oh yes it's keeping here [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] we have an item this morning from brother um thank you god bless you i forgot my classes now lately i forget them and i don't know what's the meaning of that but i think the meaning is that that i must not use them i'm glad to see each one of you so the song the song that i'm going to sing relates to also what brother isaac the other the other uh stanza that spoke about a fire on the day of pentecost so if maybe sister tell you i've i've trans my wife translated not me my wife helped me to translate it just for you to follow what it means um or you know that's the closest translation we could get but i'll sing it in my mother tongue and because i believe god is not limited by language language barrier those are the things of the devil language barrier is the things of the devil that's why we can speak of heavenly tongues here and the spirit of the lord just makes us one language amen there was there was only one language before they went to the to the tower of bible isn't it sorry i'm not preaching um so thank you for that song that stanza that that spoke about uh pentecostal fire because this song when that pentecostal fire you know splashed when it splashed and bursted some of the sparks fell there in africa somewhere some of those parks they fell and landed somewhere in africa and that's where some of these songs that i'm seeing now emanated from those missionaries went out there although they had some ulterior motive some of them but some i believe they were guided by god because this kind of songs could not just come from the devil and that's why i'm here today because of those kind of inspirations amen so the song if kira can help me i just told him hardly this morning so if the boy can't play it well just bear with him but i believe he can catch the inspiration it says saying oh [Music] a [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] is that quite an old song brother brother-in-po yeah very old okay then that's got the six eight one two three one two three that the time tempo you know they say that maybe i think the amazing grace tune was actually an african tune for me because it's me [Music] because the guy that wrote the song didn't put the tune to the words he just wrote the words but they say that it was an african tune um let's stand this morning and just sing some worship songs to the lord amen [Music] just before we call up brother andy we just enter into a spirit of worship this morning [Music] you can bring the song up tell your evidence [Music] verse [Music] all throughout that's wrong [Music] again all throughout my history your faithfulness has walked beside me [Music] the winter storms may wait for spring in every season from where i'm standing [Music] i see the evidence of your good [Music] i see the promises [Music] i see the evidence of your goodness [Music] see your promises and fulfillment all over my life [Music] help me remember when i'm weak [Music] fear may come [Music] you are my strengths [Music] is [Music] is [Music] all over [Music] all over my life [Music] i see the evidence of your goodness [Music] is all over my life [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] the empty grave [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i is the evidence of your goodness [Music] i see your [Music] the promises i see the evidence of your goodness [Music] i see your promises [Music] cause you're the father of creation you're the risen lamb of god you're the [Music] liberty and i will walk with you every night and the father you're the father of the creator [Music] people free [Music] every night and every day [Music] to sing a song for you a song [Music] so now i'm just not giving [Music] you're the one who [Music] set your people free [Music] [Music] and you're the one who walked away from the empty tomb that day and you set your people free [Music] and i will walk with you every night and every day bye those storms of strife sail me without warning though they try to steal my joy away i will find rest in knowing you have saved me precious jesus rock [Music] though they try [Music] precious jesus rock of my salvation oh my jesus rock of my salvation [Music] [Music] and oh my jesus rock of my salvation

christ's name amen and amen hallelujah amen thank you musicians god bless you hallelujah amen hallelujah want to speak this morning amen on the key to a supernatural life amen who wants a supernatural life hallelujah who's got a supernatural life amen amen hallelujah you know we know each one of us knows where we're at on the supernatural scale hallelujah and so let's get into it i just want to um we want to read now but we all know the scripture so we don't need to turn in our bibles okay this is a little task it's a test hebrews 13 8 who knows hebrews 3 8. hallelujah amen well we're just going to read it but we're all going to say it okay are you ready amen jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever amen god bless you may be seated hallelujah jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever the key to a supernatural life is to have a revelation of that sameness that that he is the same and that what he did back there he does now he doesn't change his ways amen and he'll forever be the same he's consistent amen who believes that this morning that jesus christ is consistent and he loves you and if you meet the same conditions by believing his word like the saints of old did you'll get the same results amen if your life reflects the life in the book of acts you will have a book of acts written in your life it doesn't matter where you come from it doesn't matter what your family lineage is it doesn't matter what limitations you think is on your life that the blood of jesus christ brings an annulment to your old nature the marriage to that old man that old husband of fear terror lust whatever it may be that's held you down it is time for an exodus it is time for a divorce because the blood of jesus is in the house the blood of jesus is here speaking liberty over your lives speaking freedom don't look at the natural look at the promise jesus christ comes riding out of history out of the pages of the scripture into your life to fulfill his promises so that you can have a book of acts that you become a book of acts you want to see miracles you want to see miracles then become one amen hallelujah i got a quote about that later on so i like that amen if you want to see miracles who wants to see the miracle working god amen then he says you become a miracle yourself hallelujah we need miracles amen we can't exist without miracles and we see miracles amongst us amen hallelujah hallelujah i'm just going to lay a little foundation and then we'll get into it the key to a supernatural life the key to a supernatural walk now of course there's many keys and there's many different ways um that we can but you know what the lord has focused in on today we'll just be blessed by that amen if you pull and and you have faith then you'll get what you need if you ever need this morning let it just just pull on the lord and he will meet that need hallelujah whatever is in your life that you need deliverance healing restoration guidance whatever you need of just pull god will meet your need this morning because as peter spoke the words the holy ghost fell upon them amen why because they were under expectation man there's an atmosphere in here today hallelujah you know the founding scriptural basis for our claims to a supernatural experience i find in john 14 12 it says jesus speaking verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also who believes that amen who's read the gospels hallelujah what did what didn't he do amen hallelujah he went to funerals and turned them into parties hallelujah he turned death into life amen he even was killed himself and rose again amen he conquered death hell in the grave amen he healed the sick amen he raised the dead he cleansed the lepers he set the captives free if you believe the same things will happen in your life don't look at yourself don't look at your own limitations oh i'm this and that and everything else no don't look at that look at the promise he that believes she that believes amen and every now that people might tell you oh you don't believe because you've got unbelief you've been given a measure of faith he dealt to every man a measure of faith amen who's a human in here well you got dealt some faith hallelujah lots of faith faith of the master seeker move a mountain hey man what about a faith the size of a pumpkin what about the faith that's larger than life that's the faith of the son of god amen and you just have the right attitude towards his word and you watch god's faith take over you watch his faith come on our little faith is just but when we reach up and his faith comes down there is nothing impossible the omnipotent and the omnipotent bring forth the creative power amen hallelujah and greater work shall he do than these shall he do because i go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the sun if you shall ask anything in my name i will do it hallelujah amen just work with me we're going to go somewhere i've got a few questions here that we answer throughout the service so first one is what has god done to provide a way for us to always walk supernaturally amen and i put a note here don't preach these scriptures you just be good amen we'll get there hallelujah ephesians 2 13 just just let me read but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of christ now we're made near amen hallelujah this is a reality a promise a truth this is something that happened and established it amen just believe it receive it amen hebrews 9 11 to 15 it says but christ being coming high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle than the old testament tabernacle amen everyone's quite refreshed on this because brother adrian just preached on these things so amen you can just remember it's the same thought okay but more more perfect by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building it's talking about christ jesus in his flesh the true temple neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us amen for if the blood of bulls and of goats and of ashes of and here for sprinkling the unclean in the old testament judaic sacrificial system sanctified to the purifying of their flesh how much more now catches how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god he just says believe it believe what my blood can do for you you might be struggling but believe what my blood can do for you believe the liberation that comes from the voice of god oh my lord the blood speaks the bible says the blood speaks in hebrews 12. better things than that of abel it speaks freedom liberty restoration the dead being raised it speaks a resurrection it speaks a rapture it speaks chronicles coming home it speaks restoration amen it speaks light glory oh just believe it believe it today and you can receive what it says you can have it it's yours it's your children's it's your family hallelujah it's for those out there that need him however you need a burden for the lost the blood speaks a burden for you hello because it cries and it reaches to the highest mountains and flows to the lowest valleys crying come home hallelujah can you get in the spirit just one of these days get in the spirit in your closet in your prayer room in your workplace wherever it may be in church that's a good start get in the spirit and church amen that's a real good start amen hallelujah and you'll begin to feel the burden of the spirit the conscience of god will come upon you and you'll hear the voice begin to burst something in you commission you place you hallelujah i said i wasn't going to preach these words these scriptures but romans 8 1 hallelujah glory there's a lot of inspiration in that one how much more the blood of christ who through eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament hallelujah they which are called might receive the promise of internal inherent eternal inheritance for where the testament is the testament is the voice of the new testament everything that came out and is written by paul and james and all of them and the voice of god that would speak freedom and liberty the voice of the blood the testament the bible came out of the blood amen and and you know in the in the lord when uh will because he had a will and an inheritance that would be given to the people and and say to your rich uncle or your dad or someone they pass away and and they've got a rich bank account and a huge house and manner and and it's to you now now when they die there's a lawyer that comes and he bequeaths that to you saying this is the will this is what he willed to you he wanted you to have this it's an inheritance and so when he's passed on or they've gone then their voice still speaks through the cleaving agent through the lawyer and they give you the inheritance and you take it and then you go and use it and you enjoy it amen but this is a different one because the very one that died for you he rose again and now he's here to give it to you to ensure that you get it amen amen get in the spirit this is the keys to a supernatural walk you want supernatural who's sickened the devil just running rampant and letting things happen to children and letting things happen to you and your family you say why oh god i want to just have such a great standing in your presence where when i speak it happens this is our destiny not too many days hints that will be in full measure start claiming it now that's the truth start fighting for it hallelujah because the battle's already won for you but just like israel they still had to take up a sword and capture every demon they cut through humans but we cut through demons hallelujah hallelujah israel stayed in the natural they rejected the messiah but our war is against the devils but control the people hallelujah and you've got great authority over those things hallelujah amen amen hallelujah so just remember the voice of the blood speaks but the very testator himself doesn't need another lawyer amen it's him a prophet came on the scene and he said i must decrease and he must increase the seventh seal himself the mighty angel of christ comes to personally to you and says here is your inheritance i'm going to make sure you get it i'm going to make sure you claim it i'm going to make sure that you walk in the supernatural thank you hallelujah whatever it takes who's that who's there is everyone there whatever it takes long you're so surrendered and you trust him that much where you can say to him whatever it takes it might hurt amen but whatever it takes now that doesn't mean you're just going to get bombarded it's all in god's timing because you trust him right hallelujah romans 8 1 says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit hallelujah and just this last one on this particular vein ephesians 2 4 to 6 it says by god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sin has quickened us together with christ for by grace you are saved and has raised us up together and made us hallelujah you've been made to sit you've been created you've been together in heavenly places in christ jesus oh my no wonder the devil doesn't like you no wonder he's jealous of you no wonder he seeks to destroy you and find any leverage into your life whatever he can see he'll try everything that's why this is what he wants to do his prerogative is to dumb you down so that you ain't supernatural you don't have supernatural manifestation there's no miracles in your life i'm not saying that is but this is what he wants to do he wants to make you a mute now you want to be a mute to god but the devil wants to make you a mute to god and open to him so you just start speaking the tree of knowledge speaking conspiracies seeking all the world knowledge and what this one says and that one says but what about being a mute only to god and the creative power see when you speak all these other things all the time and it's just willy-nilly out this and that and emotions and whatever then how can god put creative activate that creative power in you how how it's so important amen and you see now these carnal things come from a life that isn't consecrated and you're up and down because the spirit realm in your life is just it's been powered it's been empowered with all sorts of philosophies and and and and all sorts of things that you watch and you tantalize the taste buds but god calls he's calling you he's saying come into the secret place he said to the prophet you know in 1956 he said and what is a vision he took him up into that place and he saw that tent and he the angel lord said this is the third pull and he says and the pillar if i went and stood over a wooden building amen an earthen building and said i'll meet you in there and the prophet says what does this mean and he says isn't it written in the scripture don't you remember that when you pray in your closet just go into secret and your heavenly father will meet you in there he's saying that the the final move of this ministry and the message calling us into rapture and condition is is going to be centered around a supernatural communion with god in the secret place without that you ain't going nowhere ain't going nowhere so next time you sit down to pray and the devil's fighting you and making you not want to pray and trust me i know because he does it to me then you just tell him where to go and you fight amen just think the israelites you know when they came up to ai and they were all getting beaten down and acan came and he took those things that's what the devil wants for you he doesn't want you to take ai hallelujah so he wants to fight you and that's why it's hard to pray and then when you do praise fighting you oh just finish now finish now you know you just it's too long or you can't pray that long just go get there get out of it i'm going to play more like david when he when he was dancing around the ark and mccall was mocking them oh and he just said just watch this then the next day he danced even more hallelujah devil tries to mock you for getting in the spirit you just say watch this then and go even further go deeper the next question what would hinder or prevent us from a supernatural walk and i just listed these things out as a lack of consecration selfishness no no desire to sacrifice no fear of god [Music] condemnation for those that are wanting to do right and are have the fear of god so you see you can go both ways you can be someone that's gone and conscious beside your conscience and you it begins to become easy for you to do things that are besetting you in your walk um and so then you because of that you are dumb down the devil's one temporarily he's just got you in a little thing you know that stops you from communing with god it just pushes the presence up there on the post you know who's heard the story about the how the spirit the dove waits just a little bit away he just you know that's the supernatural walk you know there's the supernatural walk right there and and he's just waiting just make it right i've made provision for you my blood's made near you near uh you know you know you go back to this um scripture here which i thought was just quite tremendous about ephesians 2 how it says that why we were yet sinners he gave himself for us and he called us if he will call you as a sinner how much more will he restore you as a believer that's fallen amen you don't have to stay away he loved you when you were a sinner so if he loved you when you were a sinner how about small does he love you and still love you and want to keep you and bring you up every time back straight away no crawling on your knees up up to the altar no penance no rosary beats no works just faith and belief and repentance for a true believer no fear of god and then condemnation for those that have a high conscience it can stop your supernatural walk because of fear and it breaks your faith complaining and murmuring oh my god oh man we've been going through that children's bible again and they really really i can't it's unbelievable how much israel just complained murmured and just got in the spirit of jealousy and carnal let's not get down that road hey man help me lord place a guard on my tongue david said that i wouldn't sin against you complaining not only makes the lord upset but and and brings things down to whoever you're complaining to lowering the atmosphere into a carnal condition but it also brings you into a state of amnesia because you're complaining and you're com murmuring and and you know just just just got a negative testimony oh my oh god help us with that don't ever say that and i'm not going to repeat brother adrian's service because that's what he would he hit that hard amen who appreciated that amen hallelujah idols is another thing and i'll tell you you think you're you know we're in the message and we've got the sermon and we're discerning the antichrist spirit but if you go and comb through even let's say you know i'll come through my children's stuff and books and you watch idols come in the house it looks real innocent and you start reading and i i don't have time to read everything but you've got to have a discernment because all of a sudden you've got homosexual books in your house promoting homosexuality you know that yeah stuff like that in your house someone picks that up and a homosexual spirit comes on your child then they start girls liking girls and boys liking boys why because a spirit came in spirit came in and how did that happen to israel we think oh israel you know they fell all the time and had idolatry come in and they married and this is what happens to us too you're not exempt from that you have to be vigilant real vigilant do you think the enemy is not trying everything and you think he's not i mean he is dumb anyone that fights god is dumb but he is pretty smart at infiltration and he'll try everything through the children through us through just letting little things in and what happens is the fear of god disappears and then all of a sudden you've got idolatry going on in your own house just like that and then idolatry happening in the church you think that you know this is how it happens that's why it's so important that you have a supernatural walk from the pastor to the janitor amen hallelujah every part of the body of christ should be walking in the supernatural then the devil can't come in because the spirit of prophecy will rise up and prophesy against it or a tongue's an interpretation will say hey sister watch out for that because that's coming into your house that son or that daughter has got this or this uncle is going to come and die and bring this and it looks all good but it's not good get rid of it and ananias and sapphira bring it on hallelujah oh god you know there's a we want the supernatural everyone wants the supernatural we are supernatural and we have miracles in our midst collectively but what i'm not gonna look at anyone but what about you are you riding on the testimony of the church and thinking you're okay because you are in a church that has supernatural and this brother's gone this and that one and we have a supernatural testimony how god can deliver young men and you think oh we're so good because we're in this church but what about you what about you where's your miracles 40 years ago 20 years ago what about now we we all spoke it jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever when i first got saved when i am now saved and when i always will be saved hallelujah the same supernatural god hallelujah the next one is unconfessin hallelujah i don't need to go too far into these things because i know that we're all sincere people and i can list these things out and you guys can search your own heart search your own house search your own motives objectives search your life and discern your own heart amen or let the word do it and don't be proud and just let it go flying over if peter was proud and let it go flying over do you think he would have stood in the prison when the angel of the lord said stand up i said no i'm okay all these bonds and chains all over him down on the ground tied down he's proud i don't need your help it's like somebody in a service when the word comes across them and it's conviction and it's correction and they say oh no that's not for me that's for nancy oh my no it's for you yes it's for you are you going to stay in the shackles are you going to stay on the ground hallelujah or are you going to get up under the angel's advice are you going to walk out under the angel's advice amen hear the voice of the angel do not just don't do not push it away hallelujah for the voice of the angel brings a present day reality you know that do you know that under this message of exodus we have an angel a mighty angel hallelujah halloween the fullness of angel the angel of his presence the angel of the covenant the angel with your inheritance christ himself as a messenger an angelic form hallelujah hear his voice he that's the angel that will set you free that's the angel that will give you present moment day help you know that you look through the scriptures you look through all the old testament when the angel came in the new testament in the church he directed them hallelujah amen churches that fire are churches that reject that voice help us lord unconfessed sin is the next one don't need to take anything on that curse is left unresolved amen this is where the supernatural these things i'm writing here to show you these are things that will stay there and not and not be dealt with properly if you don't have a supernatural testimony or a supernatural life with god or your home ain't supernatural where you're having powerful moments in the presence of god in your life in your prayer closet with your family at church when you're driving hallelujah anywhere oh those things get dealt with when he's there amen i always say this to my children what happened because you know we go through things what happened to aaron's rod in god's presence amen that turned back to its origin it's all about restoration god restored the stick that had been shaped by man judgmental caused all these destructions just like our life can cause destruction shaped by man dry legal resentful no i'm not saying aaron's rob was resentful but we can get like that when we get into a dry condition but then you get that stick and you put it in god's presence oh my god and you know what his blood make us die and actually in other scriptures it says that he's torn the middle wall of partition he's ripped the veil from the top amen from from heaven to earth the veil has been ripped now do not bask on the other side of the veil just because some glory's spilling out like reuben and gad and manassee did on the other side of the jordan you know you just get excited sitting in a church environment where it's all good and it's all nice and it's and everyone out and there's people entering in and getting into their promise and getting saved and you're just sitting on the other side of jordan where there's greenery all spilling over because you're but you're in the wrong side come through come through ask god to discern your heart why are you not coming through what are you holding on to are you willing to sacrifice are you willing to lay on the altar a living sacrifice amen hallelujah near the final one curses left unresolved in families in regions amen hallelujah and i've got a whole sermon on that so i won't actually touch on that i'll speak on that one time but um yeah the lord's opened up a few things there but just remember if you we're dealing now with principalities and powers and rulers of darkness we're we're dealing on a spiritual level our war is not in the flesh amen when you get mad at your brother or your sister just remember the war is not in the flesh hallelujah you can't get mad at your brother and sister in god's presence oh my hallelujah you're just full of love man love covers a multitude of sin amen hallelujah they can do no wrong in his presence you know that do no wrong why because the blood is still there the blood speaks perfection the blood speaks greater things than that of abel abel's blood smoke vengeance his blood speaks mercy his blood speaks come up higher come out of your own church ages and come up into revelation 4. come into the throne room you're invited all of you are invited right now and many of you have taken the invitation but there's people in here that are still in the church ages in their soul their soul hasn't been brought up into the throne room yet hallelujah hear the voice of the god of jesus christ amen come up here he says he says i heard a loud voice i heard a shout yes hey man come up here come into me come in here come and see hallelujah that's the message that's our message come amen hey man hallelujah next question is what promises of reconciliation has he made for us amen to chronicle seven to 15 so remember you can fall as an individual the church can fall as a local body and the region can reject the gospel and fall into a state of many different states but one of the states is obviously a state where this feat has been shaken of the dust as jesus said to do if that town rejects the gospel and that state can get put into a state of judgment but but but an area can also be placed in a in a state of fallow ground right everyone knows that fallow ground and that's deliberate removal of god's of the garden growing of the farm of the cultivation remove it stop harvesting the let it grow dry let it go hard i need to break the cycle of death break the cycle of all the pests that have come into the church or the pests that have come into that region and it's causing trouble just let it sit for a few years let it sit let it go dry but then what happens next now god now after solomon dedicated the temple and second chronicles seven um he says now now now solomon are dedicated to temple and now it says now thus solomon finished the house of the lord and the king's house and all that came into solomon's heart to make in the house of the lord and in his own house i love this he prosperously affected amen it really happened you know it prospered because it was under the direction of the holy spirit amen and the lord appeared now i love this because it's not just solomon praying this next this course of scripture it's actually god speaking this is a promise amen and he's the same yesterday today and forever and it says and the lord appeared to solomon by night and said unto him i have heard thy prayer and have chosen this place to myself amen for a house of sacrifice god has chosen you for a house of sacrifice amen a living sacrifice where you are dead on the elijah altar amen dead to yourself dead to that old husband that's selfish that has no fear of god that is idolatrous that it comes from babylonian background hallelujah dead to those things on the altar so the fire can come to bring you up to call you out of the church ages to call you out of darkness to call you into a ministry to call you up into a revelation of jesus christ hallelujah to take you higher and you just surrender everything like rahab do you think rahab did much when her house was crumbling what could she do trust someone said trust that's all she could do that's all you can do when god's dealing if god's dealing with you right now let the past crumble don't run around with fomo who knows what fomo is fear of missing out oh i better take that back oh i better have that back oh i like that oh no no amen don't do it don't do it let it fall let it fall i can't express that enough and i'm feeling very impressed hallelujah i believe we struck a chord there hallelujah amen glory to god as brother brown says i feel religious [Laughter] glory to god amen he's chosen this place i've chose i love that it's so personal i've chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice he says if i because remember now there will be times when we make a mistake there'll be times when a region falls there'll be times when a church fails it says now if my people oh sorry if i shut up heaven that there be no rain or if i command the locust to devour the land or if i send pestilence among my people then he says this and we know this one very well if my people which are called by my name hello mrs jesus christ more than anything that israel ever had right now mrs jesus christ marriage union amen if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land amen amen all of a sudden my prayers will get answered again all of a sudden i have fellowship with god again amen all of a sudden there's miracles happening again in my life in the church in the region amen amen oh glory this is what happens amen has he promised it i will forgive their sin and will heal their land amen you know wellington had a curse over it do you know that and when we first started the church way back over in the other building amen and there was a service going on and we were having the spirit was moving in a mighty way and the lord came down in tongues and interpretation and said that over us and remove the curse that was over wellington for whatever wellington did that's between wellington and god now i'm not talking about the city and the civilization i'm talking about the spiritual land the elect land hello and your house and where your desk is at work that's your land amen you can have ethernet condition right around your desk amen and when those guys come over and start talking filth they get convicted because the spirit of god comes and says not in my eden hallelujah amen glory oh lord amen foot princess possession amen amen and then he says here in second chronicles 7 15 hallelujah now mine eyes shall be open and mine is a tent unto the prayer that is made in this place glory you know the other day when i was preparing this well i wasn't knowing what i was going to preach properly and then uh i was just praying when i when when this came i thought man lord i really you know because this is my this is the burden on my heart and i want what i'm preaching now i'm preaching to myself too right i'm not saying i'm the big high and mighty one that has all the miracles you know there's miracles there's things that happen and we have a glorious time but there's always a greater calling and a higher calling right and you can and there's more and we have our frailties and all those things right here so now i'm like praying oh god i want your shekinah presence because now i'm going to read some quotes now and and and it was convicting me a lot because i thought man you know you can go out and you can do all these things and you can have a a great ministry but unless you're in the shekinah glory of god unless you've got an abiding presence within your life it's not going to do much you can preach the best sermon ever but if god isn't in you and behind you and anointing you what is it going to do and so i was praying oh god lord because it's my the burden of my heart is i just want to be able to just if someone comes to me and they're sick they don't leave sick amen you know that this is for all of you people don't leave us sick ever and if they if there is a reason you the lord will speak to you and he will give you a word or the church will rise up and you'll know there's a reason why this is happening and you'll be delivered in such and such a time whatever right so you have the vision of god and we're in the tune of the spirit of god and you you don't go and cast off stuff that needs to be there for a minute or you take judgment off something or someone you know you get these prayers and prayer requests over the whatsapp and you think pray for this one pray for that one prayer and i'm wary about that and that's just me you pray and i and you should pray i pray that the lord will be done and he would open the case and bring clarity but you know sometimes we just go and pray demons off or pray something that somebody's under judgment somebody's under correction and you don't know them from a bar of soap and you're going and you're going against god's plan just by praying willy-nilly you know your mouth just speaks out all these things superfluity of naughtiness because you're just speaking but then that's why you know we don't get access to the supernatural like we want to because our mouth is just frivolous we just speak everything out but you know the lord is calling us to a consecration where we speak his mind we have his will and you begin to say what he says say and when he nods you go when he says when he if there's no answer you stay amen fully obedient prisoners to jesus christ that's a sacrifice and it takes control it takes temperance but we want this who wants this amen hallelujah help us lord and i and me especially you know my mouth can just speak a whole bunch of things as you know everyone knows who i am you know a sanguine style person that can just speak out and you know i just prayed lord help me and this is a testimony and i said lord i really want and desire you know just to have your kind of presence so thick and tangible in my life i just want to see the the the full measure of my inheritance i hate it when i pray and nothing happens i hate it amen and i will never accept that and i want to know why i'm sure everyone wants to know why what is it is it a lack of faith is it a lack of you're not praying the right thing are you touching the spirit of god are you in tune what is it right and now i'm going to answer these questions but remember it's not a direct answer just for every individual you you still have to find from god but these are some of the reasons this is why i've enabled this the key to a supernatural life because we want keys right keys open the door faith is the key and christ is the door right amen and the word we're going into the word now amen amen so i'm praying this and i'm like and anyway every morning usually um on a regular morning which is pretty often i asked the law for a psalm or a proverb or something you know i just kind of pray and just just wait on the lord and just whatever he impresses on my heart i'll just go read and so i got psalm 36 and i went and read it in the king james because use i read the king james first and foremost but i do read other translations to try and get a more you know sometimes it's a clearer word because some of those old words are quite hard to understand and i read it in psalm 36 verse 1 and the king james and it says now the transgression of the wicked saith within my heart that there is no fear of god before his eyes and i was like man i really can't understand what he means by my heart my heart and i'm like i'm sure there's something funky going on here like i just don't understand that and i think oh it's that old english thing again you know how they put things around the other way and you're going ah i know i don't speak english in self-defense right i speak it as a normal language and i'm thinking what's what is this and anyway on my bible it's got a little commentary on the side and it says in four manuscripts it doesn't say that it says this some word and i thought okay so and so i went over to another translation and it said this it says in in the same verse it says now now the transgression aggressor that he may sin says within himself that there is no fear of god before his eyes and i thought wow man and i was felt directed to this you know because i read the whole psalm and the sun's beautiful you read psalm 36 i'm going to power i'm going to just drop down it says for he has dealt craftedly before him to discover his iniquity and hate it then i drop down to verse 7 it says now how how has thou multiplied thy mercy oh god so the children of men shall trust in the shelter of thy wings they shall be fully satisfied with the fatness of thine house and thou shalt cause them to drink of the full stream of by delights and that word delight goes back to eden so you he will he you see this is where a lack of fear brings you out of that presence but when the fear of god is restored when the fear of god is restored and the spirit is like the conviction of the spirit and when you hear the word you're convicted and you change because you're so convicted and the fear of god puts a fear on you and you really repent and you really get right with god because you don't want to transgress his laws you don't want to transgress his commandments because you're sick of walking in a natural state sick of being defeated hallelujah you want to walk in the supernatural you want to walk on your inheritance you want to see miracles in your life and your family's life hallelujah never need a doctor again imagine that never need medical because you've got the tree of life that's the greatest doctor the divine physician even for esther you never need a dentist again my teeth falling apart lord jesus restore these teeth in this perfect teeth you know you've got perfect teeth in your theophany why not just get a download now why not just get perfect teeth now why not just get a perfect mind now why not just get a perfect spirit now hallelujah amen why not get deliverance instant so what is holding things back what is it lori are you with me amen so in this testimony i said lord i felt like you know in my own life i'd you know under all the pressure for the last 10 years in business with isaac and you know not because of isaac but just look it's been a wild ride it's been a wild ride of pressure and heaps of things and my and i've loved every moment right but but it has been um stress right and into that what's really in a man has revealed and so obviously to see all the good and the bad is revealed and the conscience and that process gets said and you begin to for me i was beginning to speed on my car because i'm always late for everything not anymore though christians are never late anyway that's what they say anyway that's what brother chris andrews says you can you can ask him what he means so anyway i i i start speeding and then you know now i'm so busy i'm texting while driving and speaking on the phone and so i'm slowly moving through those things and getting technology that allows me to do stuff legally and all of that but in the process you still see your conscience you lose the fear of god because your conscience is the very contact of fear of god where it becomes hard to sin becomes hard to take that social drink becomes hard to go and lust at that woman or that man or whatever becomes hard to swear when you're angry you know becomes hard to do those things because of a conscience and you see it in any way i got said and you know in my past i lived a very as you know a very simple life and so all of the things and trappings when you get into a state where you see your conscience then more things the devil's just like got an inroad right i thought i just said lord i i just and i you know every day you repent of your sins and you go through the motions to a degree of whatever you're led to do in prayer but that day i was like i just thought you know i haven't really kind of been specific too much on what i've repented of so i said lord i just repent of speeding in my car i repent of lusting after woman if i seen a woman or if i was in a bad state i repent of um the you know like texting while driving i repent of getting angry you know and those things and then all of a sudden it just changed the whole atmosphere changed and and the that's that presence of god it was so and i thought you know what i'm going to share that testimony because some you know you've got to be specific in many many cases it's like you can just say have a blanket repentance but where is the the real penitence in that you're just making a blanket it's like well lord just rep forgive me of everything i've ever done even if i haven't done this type of thing and that's alright in some cases maybe you don't know and generally don't know and he will get rid of those things that's way down deep or he will show you yes he can show you things he's shown me things before and the same experience happened years ago where i was proud and i got arrogant and i and i didn't realize it and and then i repented of that on a prayer you know like the presence of god came but it sort of hovered over me and and didn't come right in and and this thought came that you've been proud and i've repented of it and i laid it all down and then the presence came right down into me and that's because you'll see he's watching and waiting and so i was like lord i just want this anointing for my ministry for my fatherhood for my my my husband um ship whatever you call it as a husband as a man i want my anointing and for every one of you man brother sister child you have an anointing amen and god has made a way by the blood for you to stay in it no condemnation you may make mistakes but you're walking after the spirit and i walk after the spirit my whole life is for the spirit but yet in the humanity i sometimes make mistakes but if i walk in condemnation because of those mistakes i've the supernatural won't happen in my life i won't have miracles i won't have his presence his anointing won't be there like it should be god's word is anointed you can say something and you might not be in a very good condition and it will still bless the people and it might still deliver but when you're in the right place and you're consecrated and god speaks through you and you and you're anointed and the power of god is in your life you watch the difference and when someone comes to you for prayer and you pray and they get healed from leukemia or they get healed from whatever condition that they've had all their life or their limb grows back if they've got an arm cut off or something amen do you know what will happen even your from that moment the word will get around and even your shadow will cause people to get healed because people realize that there's an anointing you know that hallelujah and i've always said lord it kindle it you know it's got to start somewhere and we think all this revival has got to start what about you this is where it starts you know you think oh lord our church needs a revival no you need a revival you need a revival i need a revival right amen amen we need revival hallelujah amen hallelujah so i read those things and anyway this that presence came in i was like well and it wasn't like a huge like out of this world kind of experience but it was enough to know that there was a little like kind of little you know like a little easement on the title a little blockage in the land that was just holding things back and so the flow just came amen amen you know i got a question have you been getting proud offended or jealous and then lately i want to this the lord showed me this because it was happening in my life you know this when none of us are exempt right peter wasn't exempt brother branham says always listen now notice always listen and be conscious of your littleness you know if you realize how little you really are you'll never be jealous you'll never be offended and you'll never get proud if you feel misjust like someone you've been an injustice you'll never feel proud because you realize you're nothing and you're little and you realize you don't even deserve anything really it's all his grace right it's an absolute it's like grease you know it cures all hallelujah real true now that's a very natural comparison right everyone that knows brother branham's life story knows what grease is that's what their family used to cure all you know it's like our rollies in new zealand we have rollies and it just goes on everything hallelujah unless you've got a nurse for a wife then you have all the right chemicals and hey man rollies congress or realize that you're nothing your littleness now when i say that i don't mean in christ's eyes you're actually a treasure right and you're as bride and you're as queen and you're called up but in this flesh and in your you know what what you deserve very little the prophet says this he says who are you this is an influence in 63 he says who are you stick your finger in a bucket of water and pull it out and find the hole you put your finger in then say that was me you're nothing you'll be not be missed after a little while after you're gone they'll have a funeral procession out there and that's all but your influence will live on and on and on who wants to you know just you know footprints in the sands of time who might you know it's a believers desire that your footprints are anointed that if someone walked in your footprints they would get saved i always say you know like people that are so paranoid about letting google know what they're saying and all that stuff i'm like really google does not care what you say they don't care you ain't no monarch or king in this world they don't care i said you know what let them hear everything they might get saved amen let them hear it amen hallelujah amen now obviously if you're doing missionary work in you know china or places that are not allowing you would be more wise but in a in a country like this it doesn't matter in the free world with big emphasis on this it's very much a bound world amen so now i've just the final kind of section here is the cry of the believer and on an individual level it says here now and let's read in judges 6 11 to 14. i want to i want you to persona make this personal right and there came an angel of the lord and sat under an oak which was an offer that pertained unto joash now this here is the sermon now we've just that's we've built to this this is this is now we're going to nail it hit it home and we're going to have a have a jubilee in christ amen by the word of god and that pertained unto joash the abia is right and his son gideon threshed wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midianites because he was scared right he was under fear because of the circumstances not knowing that inside him oh my how many people living under fear not really knowing their identity not knowing the potentials that lay in them oh my hallelujah living by mega fear living under their privilege warming a church seat and not knowing the potential that's just inside them oh my until an angel comes hallelujah one day an angel came and broke away these chains amen and the angel of the lord appeared unto him i love that and said unto him the lord is with thee amen now he's starting to declare his true identity not what he feels not his circumstances but who he is and this is what the mighty angel has come down in this generation to declare to you thou mighty woman of valor the mighty man of valor glory and gideon said unto him o my lord if the lord is with us why then is all this befall in us this is a good question right and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of amen i believe that gideon asked a real good question amen saying did not the lord bring us up from egypt and now the lord has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the midianites and the lord looked upon him and said go go in this thy might and thou shalt save israel from the hands of the midianites have not i sent thee shekinah tabernacle have not i sent thee thou mighty church of valor each one of you your true identity is mighty as valiant soldiers hallelujah oh glory hallelujah amen millionaire means contention and brawling hallelujah god has sent his angel to take you from fighting to take you from brawling each other to take you from sitting in a church with mind battles against this one and that one and this one and that will cast him off i know it happens to me you don't need to say oh no it's not for me it is for you because the devil is the devil and where his enemy is and he doesn't want you to enjoy the service so he wants you to sit there and think the wrong thoughts oh my and he knows your life and he waits and he sits in here you tell him satan i bind you i'm not just regardless of this regardless of circumstance gideon hallelujah no more fear i'm not going to fear in church i'm not going to lust in church i'm not going to think about my own life in church i'm going to think about him hallelujah i'm going to pull on the gift i'm going to hear from heaven glory oh my fight the good fight of faith take the shield of faith in the service and get rid of those flaming arrows those darts you just kick them out and if they come on thick you just go harder you stand up and you say second boy hallelujah when you feel down you just stand up peter stood up and he got out of jail amen amen amen you might hear something that's for you stand up and walk out hallelujah glory because the angel of the lord is here with a voice to speak to you that angel caused rahab's walls to fall amen that angel caused prison doors to open for peter glory that angel came to gideon and removed fear of his life removed idolatry out of his family you want idolatry out of your family stand up gideon hallelujah oh yeah stand up gideon fearless mighty warriors fearless in battle moving forward in the name of the lord hallelujah amen oh glory amen don't take bondage for a constant not it's not our inheritance hallelujah gideon stood up he heard the voice of the angel and the voice of the angel is speaking today amen speaking stand up thou mighty woman of allah stand up hallelujah and obey that voice specific to your life specific to your family's needs specific to this church he is the specific voice to our generation to us tune in amen tune in you get caught up you get in the spirit on the lord's day like john you're going to be hearing that voice that john heard you know that you'll end up out of lab to see you you'll end up in the throne room you'll end up under that influence like isaiah i saw him high lifted up and he put an anointing call on my lips and he changed the way i speak he anointed me and commissioned me and placed me and now i want reverend humble election i saw the seraphims i saw the reverence and the fear of god was restored in my life because of an influence not from man not from ministry of man but from a visitation because i got in the spirit on the lord's day praise the lord get in the spirit on the lord's day hallelujah and find me you'll find yourself out of laodicea you'll find yourself up in the somewhere in heavenly places you'll find your seat on the throne hallelujah and you'll find yourself with john he went on a journey and his end time message hey man he got taken up into a place where he saw a mighty angel with an open book he said john stand up thou mighty man of allah come and eat this book come and take your inheritance for in this is your deliverance and this is the healing of your life and this is your family salvation for you and your house shall be saved and this is communion with god hallelujah like esther she heard the message of her guy and he closed in the very heart of the king you know that esther got clothed in the king he knew what she the king loved it was like the message of malachi 4. and together they brought esther out of her old life into a life of a queen and when she appeared before the king she was clothed in everything the king loved and you realize that this message is more than just clothing and clothesline and how to do this and that but it's very much a very powerful thing that's right hallelujah you think oh man we just look all like this and limited and what we wear and can't wear this and can't wear that but don't worry about that esther didn't worry about that all those other women in the harem they were all for the same king right all the denominations all the other churches they all use what they wanted they all wore the clothes that they thought was good they all did the things and their intentions was right they had a right motive these churches have right motives but they don't have a hair guy they don't have a messenger praise the lord has the message of the king you got the message of the king he said do this wear this put this perfume on walk like this talk like this act like this and you'll have a book of acts in your own life amen a book of acts a book of acts dave a book of acts marion hallelujah amen your life as a book of acts is a reflection of the heart of the kingdom your life is a book of acts people on the camera is a reflection of the heart of the king amen when he sees you he stands hallelujah amen the prophet says this if god was this is now talking of gideon he says if god was with us we're all his mighty miracles because we because because we understand listen now how scriptural gideon was and otherwise he said if we understand that god is a great god of mighty workings he is a great god of miracles and appears for us and if he is with us and he is the same yesterday and today and forever where can i see his miracles where can i see this god in action where is he at if he is for us amen i want you to personalize this because i know that this church has miraculous but what about you because you're part of the church this church is made up of individuals we can't just have some miracles on some people it needs to be you own it don't deflect it don't duck it you can't get away from it discern your life and do what gideon did what did he do he heard the voice of the angel he acted on the voice of the angel and he went down in the night and he destroyed the altars of baal if there's any ulcers of baal in your house destroy them destroy them if you want supernatural in your life destroy them if you want your children back destroy them if you want god to act on your behalf because your prayers aren't heard until you do you know that he says if my people turn from their wicked ways turn from their idolatry even if you think it's okay if there's a question on it bring it to the altar [Music] hey you might be happy walking mediocre you might be happy having half a christian life but i'm not not me i'm going in a rapture hallelujah and i'm sure anyone that's going on a rapture believes the same hallelujah amen now don't go be legal on yourself don't go be a pharisee in your home get the presence of god back that's how you do it by god's glory by god's presence by the anointing of the spirit start with yourself and then move through the family hallelujah glory to god amen i'm going to preach my notes flat now so we're going to go completely oh it's 12 o'clock normally anyway nearly anywhere so we'll be all right amen glory i mean my battery's about to go flat so we're just going to go amen hallelujah amen he says here thou mighty man of valor could refer back to the old word and know it's right because he know this that god is a supernatural being and wherever a supernatural being is he'll do supernatural signs because the supernatural is in him you just can't get out of it how can you stand in the face of wind without having it wind blowing how can you get in water without being wet water is wet that's the chemical of it that's wet and when you get in water you're going to get wet right and when you get in the presence of gold the supernatural there is going to be supernatural signs amen and a supernatural workings of a supernatural god amen hallelujah amen what is a supernatural walk amen if jesus jesus answered the sound of them have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore i say unto you whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them hallelujah you know later on it says here of the disciples when they couldn't cast out that man that demon out of that man who had epilepsy you know i want to show you how you can get unbelief out of your life because no one wants to have unbelief but looming over their life amen hallelujah because the disciples couldn't cast them out they said lord how do you cast this devil out so easy he says this kind only comes out by prayer and fasting and it's because of your unbelief these people have been raising the dead cleansing the lepers preaching the gospel healing the sick and the getting results and then all of a sudden they couldn't do it why because now there was a higher level of demonic authority and they couldn't have the faith to cast it out they said no lord jesus says this kind only comes out by prayer and fasting so he's saying if you want unbelief out of your life you need to have a consecrated prayer life it's time to have a consecrated prayer life amen and you know what when you begin to get a concentrated prayer life god will begin to put fast over here amen hallelujah and you will begin to get closer to god hallelujah amen there's three things that are going to help you in your supernatural world first one is that you love the bible that you love the word that you enjoy your relationship with god through the written word of god read your bible amen and not just read it to get it over i'm done with but you long you're hungry you just want to get your bible thank you and you this is how you feel hallelujah oh god i love your word i just want to just pouring it into myself oh when you read it and you love him and you're looking up to his word and he begins to speak to you because you love it this is communion this is communion this is what he wants to bring in your life he wants you to have a relationship with him through his written word as well amen hallelujah the prophet says see the bible is a supernatural book it's written so that it's hid from the schools of theologians how many knows that jesus thanked god he said i thank thee father that thou has hid it from the wise and prudent and revealed it to babes such as would learn it's a book of love when the love of god comes into the heart then you fall in love with god then he reveals himself the bible meaning the interpretation of the bible is god himself interpreting his promises but the bible is written between the line hallelujah you think how the prophet always brought out about that stamp that boy found a stamp in the attic and he goes and sells it for a dollar just this little piece of paper and then that that stamp gets sold by the stamp clip for 500 then that one takes it to on a national level and it's five hundred thousand dollars for a little piece of paper with ink on it now it wasn't the paper that was valuable it wasn't the ink that was valuable it was what was on it right now this times a million and this is what the word of god is it's not the bible book it's not the ink it's the word that is on it and god is calling you to have a supernatural communion with him through the word the second one is communion in prayer and i've touched on this already but just remember how jesus said by prayer and fasting that you will have greater victory and unbelief will leave your life completely jesus was always on the mountain he was always on the mountain fasting and praying the prophet was always on the mountain fasting and praying for healing yeah how do you think he had so much success do you think he just walked in because he was a prophet no it was more than that he fasted and prayed and consecrated himself if you want a supernatural life it's time for sacrifice it's time for fasting and praying under the leadership of god under the leadership of the holy ghost offer yourself on the altar offer yourself come down offer yourself and see what the fire of god will do he'll begin to use you he'll commune with you he'll begin to take you up amen and you will begin to see what jesus saw what the disciples saw jesus doing that they couldn't do what william branham did that you see that you want to do those powerful meetings he fasted and prayed for days a prophet with a great gift like he had he still fasted and prayed for days amen hallelujah now i don't want to put a legal binding over you where you feel like i've got to just go faster offer yourself to the spirit of god see what he does with you yes amen you express you wantness you want the supernatural you want to be able to pray and see results then you have to have pay the price of sacrifice prophet says listen to come down usually before we come for that anointing for the prayer line i have to stay shut up fasting and praying but when you don't have to do that i'm coming down to just speak you just feel different you know it's the same spirit but a different operation but god's gift now is a different quote it says but god's gift is the spirit of god that came down in the form of an angel now he didn't have wings he looked like a man i heard him when he walked in brother-in-law's just as that walked on the floor walked right over just as a normal as any man and talks like any other man he comes time after time through the room and different places when i'm fasting and praying there's something about it that changes your atmosphere so that you become sensitive to the supernatural so that you can come to a place where you're abiding in him his words are abiding in you then you can ask what you will because it's an abiding presence to know the will of god there's a quote i'm just quoting a quote it's the an abiding presence where you are abiding in him and his words are abiding in you and you begin to understand the plan of god for your people for the people around you for your children for the land for the ones around there and you get commissioned and you begin to hear hallelujah oh my the supernatural begins to take place in your life if jesus had to do it if brilliant brandon had to do it then you if you want it it just depends what you want what do you want hallelujah amen can i be musicians please glory to god what do you want lord hold this battery prophet says you see the failures of the church the pentecostal church the methodist the baptist and all it's a failing just play something sweet hallelujah maybe a god of miracles you know a miracle working god we can play that the it's failing to that abiding grace of god tonight you'll shout and clap your hands and dance in the aisles and speak in tongues that's goofs this is no good unless you're abiding in the shekinah glory see those things are fine i have nothing to say against them they're of god shouting and blessing god is wonderful speaking in tongues or translation of tongues or i mean interpretation of times it's the same but all these other things gifts of healing prophecies and all these things are marvelous but they're no good they're not fruitful they can't yield the right unless you're living in the presence of the shekinah the atmosphere around you is godly that's the reason that men and women are not permitted to these things that's what i've just been speaking because you'd go out here and call a blessing over something god has cursed or cursed something god has blessed here we are it's an abiding presence to know the will of god then don't look at the world's going to say about you it's what god thinks about you then you're living in its presence the privilege of every believer to live in a shekinah to have miracles to be a person that people can have trust and confidence that when you pray god answers purify my heart jesus sanctify me lord i offer myself as a living sacrifice to you hallelujah that's all you need to do if you want results if you want to see your family truly walking in the resurrection start with you hallelujah final quote here hallelujah this is here these so-called churches around the countries today well where is all the miracles we'll give a thousand dollars for anybody that will permit will produce a miracle you poor deliberated backslidden twice dead plucked up by the roots how are you ever going to see a miracle until you become one he's talking about how they were making a market out of the miracles of god glory a miracle of god's grace to take an unbelieving doubter and fill him with the holy ghost jesus said except the man be born again he can't even see the kingdom of god if you want to see a miracle become one young people if you want to see a miracle become one we need a miracle to see a mirror [Music] let god work on you first he's got some overhauling to do some different lenses to put over your eyes because you are blind dead in sin and trespasses spiritually blind double dead right god has to give you life [Music] touch your eyes so you can see perform a miracle and make you a miracle and then you can see the miracle working god let's stand if you need your miracle [Music] you've heard many things today that's been challenging not just for you but for myself and for those that are on the tape out there in the youtube let's call god for a conference if there's something in your life that you know needs to be dealt with we can pray land on the altar you see when that when it's laid on the altar there's fire ready there's fire ready and god knows when you really mean it you he'll give you a total total deliverance total so like gideon no more fear no more threshing that little mega fear behind the wine press scared of the midi nights scared of contention scared of brawling with the family or scared of opposing something no no more he stood up as a mighty man of valor and god is calling you to stand up as a mighty woman of allah to see the supernatural happen in your life in your children's life in your family's life in the church hallelujah we're going in a rapture let's not let besetting sins beset the church no more i can't let the days of ananias and sapphira dawn upon this church where sin cannot exist i'm calling for it in the name of jesus christ and i'm calling for a supernatural revival hallelujah glory help god have your way in this place lord and as we sing saints this is your testimony you may think it's impossible what lies before you to change your
