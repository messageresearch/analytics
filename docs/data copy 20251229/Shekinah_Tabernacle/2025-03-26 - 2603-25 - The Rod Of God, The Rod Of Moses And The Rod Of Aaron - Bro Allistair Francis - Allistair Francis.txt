redemption in this last day father words would fail us to tell you how much we appreciate what you have done for us and that we are your called people that stand here in your presence in a time where gross darkness is covering the Earth and all the people Lord your word is more than salvation to us it is the breath of life that we breathe it is the joy of our Salvation it is the strength of Our Lives it is more than life itself to us father it is that which has drawn us from all parts of the earth as one family to come into your presence and know who we are and who we were from before the foundation of the world you have drawn us to a place that we might know our origin and given us purpose to life more than just going to work and paying bills and managing families you have given us purpose beyond all purposes that man has produced Lord we are truly grateful that we could be a part of this Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ what we serve is more than just religions Lord this word this open book that you have presented before us that you have put in our hands is more than Man's power it's more than power that governments can hold or Mighty Men of this Earth or qualified people of great stature and intellect we are just simple people called by your grace taken from the Sheep coat given the wisdom of almighty God Lord we pray that we may be found worthy in This Time Lord Lord to take this precious word and have it manifested in our lives father we pray for this congregation these your children the pastor the deacons and office holders and the children the youth father God may you instill in us the desire to be more than what life has presented may this word give us father the direction that we need for this time that we might not be found idle people just living the life of traditions but that we might have a real hope a real ambition a real goal we pray Lord that this service may be just a reminder a simple reminder because all the Mysteries are revealed we have nothing new to present but Lord to bring back the memory of what it is that we need to be doing father God we pray that you may bless the reading of the word bless everything that will be said and down we are just mortal Men We depend upon you in all things we pray Lord that your Revelation may come before us today and open up these precious Words of Life to us we appreciate the scriptures oh God these words of life that have been passed down from Generations we acknowledge the weight that is behind it we acknowledge the lives that it took to push it from from generation to generation we acknowledge the blood that was shed the sacrifices made so that these words could be printed for us may we never lose focus of these things father and walk with the responsibility of this word today bless us Lord we pray we ask it all in your precious name with much praise and thanksgiving amen and amen while you're standing we just want to read our uh scripture um before we take our seat I want to um read just this one verse a simple simple subject and trust that it'll be a blessing to you also recognize that it's a work week and uh I had many other thoughts on my heart but I I preached this last night in in Oakland and it worked out well because it didn't take long at all I'm usually a preacher that preaches for about two hours and our church is used to that but I'm in uh a different place and I want respect the uh the way that you do things here so I trust that it'll be a blessing to you Exodus 4:20 says and Moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass and he returned to the land of Egypt and Moses took the rod of God in his hand amen the Lord Lord add a blessing to his word you may be seated praise be to God greetings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and good to see all of you it's really a special privilege for me to be in New Zealand and I was first in Australia uh for the last weekend and uh for me it's the first time on this continent part of the continent and uh this part of the world and to see this beautiful land and the wonderful people but more than anything to meet the Saints to me it's the greatest privilege and the greatest honor to meet the Saints and uh whenever I come uh I don't go sightseeing whenever I travel I just uh I've got work to do and I got to see the saints of God Fellowship as much as we can and just enjoy the the The Treasure of the family of God Amen so I appreciate brother Ben uh today was the first time we met and uh I appreciate his family having me in their home and the wonderful Fellowship that we had today just for a few minutes it was busy rockus and hilarious and uh but just normal and wonderful and that's the way Believers should be so we appreciate all of you very much so uh I'm I'm here on the invite to brother Al I'll be going there and doing his uh family camp this weekend so I appreciate got to say appreciate brother elry for the invite to come over and I think he arranged things with brother Ben and the brothers in ockland so I just uh trust that whatever we say tonight will be a blessing amen so like I I said you know uh there isn't anything new that we that we can give to you I believe that the prophet's message revealed everything and none of us are going to come here and give you some great Epiphany that's going to make you Star Struck and enter the dimension of Heaven just by the way we preach or how fantastic we can explain things so that's not at all what we're going to do and um but I believe that the human condition is that when you look through the scripture it's very easy to stagnate it's very easy to get stuck in a certain place and remain there um so like for example if you're traveling from from Wellington to some other place and this is kind of like what Christians doing unfortunately a lot of message Believers uh you're traveling from one place to another and then uh you see let's say you're traveling from Wellington to Oakland and um it's a long drive and then you see a signboard that says Oakland so many kilometers uh do you stand at the signboard and shout and celebrate that you're in Oakland no but that kind of is what people do when it comes to God you stop in an experience and you have a Revival around an experience but you haven't reached the destination and our walk with God is a walk it's not a stop and sit down it's a walk it's a journey and so really all that we're doing as the ministry is to encourage you to keep walking do not stagnate do not stop at a certain place another part of the human condition is forgetting where we came from and if you forget where you came from you forget the purpose of why you're walking and where you're going to so that's why I want to speak on this subject today which is the rod of God the rod of Moses and the rod of Aaron so it's just a simple Old Testament type for those you are familiar with a quote from the uh Christ is the mystery of God revealed the prophet said when he speaks about the coming of the Lord the Thunders the the half hour silence he said the mystery is hidden in the types and shadows you can go through every type and Shadow and you're going to see The Mystery of the second coming of the Lord you're also going to see the mystery of Christ in there like the prophet says in the same message if you read the message or you read the Bible and you don't see Christ go back and read it again but also if you read the Bible and you don't see yourself in there go back and read it again because you are in Christ you have to see yourself in there amen so I want to begin with oh so that's what this message today is going to be about it's taking a type and making you understand who you are why you were called and just giving us a bit of direction as to not stopping and stagnating around something or movement uh let's be frank we're tired of tradition in the message we're T tired of churchianity we're tired of religion we're tired of pettiness we're tired of uh infightings um those things should end when we grow up and become adults and uh I'm one of those who are outspoken about this because I've grown up in the message I've seen all the nonsense that went on I've seen all the greatness that came came out of it but I think we're tired of just the immaturity we need to to come to this place where we see sons of God uh come to full manifestation uh where people are not making excuses for life and for problems in the world we are the ones chosen to be the Overcomers amen and that's I I believe we need real strong men and women to stand up in this time and manifest that life so uh we want to first begin with the um definition all right so a rod does anybody here use rods no nobody uses rods unless you use it for building brother nobody walks around with a stick maybe if you're from Africa we we have a knob Kiri or something you know or something like that but the rod that was used in Moses day is obsolete really doesn't exist anymore nobody walks around with a rod anymore which means what I'm saying is it's actually meaningless to you you really don't understand what it is and why it was even necessary right it's not something that you can uh associate with today amen so rod in the Bible has many different definitions the first definition we can look at is judgment chastisement and Punishment so if we go to the scripture let's go to 1 Corinthians 4:21 what will ye shall I come unto you with a rod or in love and in the spirit of meekness so there the scriptures basically telling you would you like me to come to you in harsh punishment or chastisement or in love in the spirit of meekness so do you see the definition in the Bible is that a rod means punishment chastisement in other words it's not a nice thing right uh it's not something to be cherished it's not something to look forward like God is actually telling you oh this is Paul saying do you like me correcting you with harshness or you rather prefer me speaking to you with meekness and kindness Ezekiel 20:37 says I will cause you this is the Lord speaking to pass under the rod and I will bring you into the bond of the Covenant that means uh I like you to be keeping my law I like you to be keeping the Covenant but if you're not going to do it then I'm going to have to judge you and chastise you to make you do it right if you look at the next one which is correction we can so I'm going to get through this part of the theory quickly and then we get to the message right uh Proverbs 22:15 foolishness is bound in the heart of a child okay this is going to be a little sensitive for New Zealand South Africa is still catching up so forgive us but but this is why we're good people we we came under this foolishness is bound in the heart of a child but the rod of Correction shall drive it far from him if a child is being foolish the rod of Correction will drive foolishness away from him has your Bible children take notes Proverbs 23:13 says withhold not correction from the child for if thou beatest him with the rod he shall not die few more amens might help he won't die if you beat him with the rod what you're going to teach him wisdom that's not the subject of what I'm talking about the next one Proverbs 29:15 the rod and reproof gives wisdom you know U there was a brother from South Africa who said you can talk to children as much as you want to you can tell them you can shout at them you can try to get the truth out of them but God made a special place from here to the brain as soon as they get that smack over there it's like the truth comes out yes I did it no they understand the rod and that's wisdom tell the truth right so it's like Paul is saying don't let me treat you with uh with harshness why not just just seek to do the right thing right but you can see from all these scriptures we're looking at bible definitions of Rod so far it's not great it's not a it's not a nice thing it's not something we feel good about right uh look at what job says job is crying out to God let him take his Rod away from me and let not his fear terrify me this is even more uh expressive like this Rod is is really something harsh job doesn't want job is pleading he and if you look at what it means you know the story of job he's just going under so much of judgment he's telling you that that Judgment of God is a rod is that right take your Rod away from me not that there was a physical stick beating him but the trials of his life is symbolized by Rod and job 219 their houses are safe from Fear need neither is the rod of God upon them so this is important because here we have job literally using the phrase Rod of God so wherever you see the word or phrase Rod of God in the Bible it speaks of judgment chastisement punishment so what is our subject the rod of God the rod of Moses the rod of Aaron we are going to define those three terms because they are very important to something we need to catch another meaning of Rod which is not all that relevant right now but it is a branch of a family or a tribe for example Isaiah 11:1 and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse this is very simple a rod meaning a branch that is coming out of a tree it's a sign of a family lineage right and a branch shall grow out of his roots we know this is a prophecy of Christ so it also means a a line of a family or a a branch of a family are you with us a few things we don't have to go and look in the scripture about uh the rod was actually one of two of a shepherd's uh the shepherd's tools so the shepherd would walk with a rod and a staff you know that in Psalm 23 right the rod and the staff they comfort me we just went through the rod being something bad how can it be Comfort because the word comfort in the Bible is not really what we see as comfort today comfort in the Bible is the advocate the lawyer the comforter is the advocate brother Ram says in in the uh the the series on the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost he's a Mark he's a comforter what is a comforter an advocate who fights on your behalf so what is the rod then is one who's going to fight on the behalf of the Sheep so the staff is a long pole that goes up and it's got a hook at the end uh you know sheep are well you have a lot of sheep here in New Zealand they're the dumbest creatures around always getting in trouble always needed dogs to hound them bring them back in they get lost so quickly they Panic so fast they've got anxiety like off the chart and they get stuck in pieces of rock and he needs his long stick with a hook to pull them out by their horns I mean they can even see him they can think I can make a way for myself no the anxiety is too much got to hook them out and pull them in and then there's long staff it's like when the shepherd is walking over the hills and the shepherd walks and you know there whole 200 sheep there and then the shepherd disappears over the hill instead of saying well let's walk straight cuz that's where he last was they have instant memory loss so he has to have his long stick there so he doesn't disappear from their sight they see the stick moving and then they come over the hill as fast as possible that's what the staff is for but the rod of the shepherd is also to prod and poke and keep the sheep in line amen so then the the last one we find in the Bible is the rod was also used by uh Wizards and witches and of the old times it was a rod of divination you know like they would use the viers of pharaoh we'll speak a little bit about that or the the different lands they would have their their wizards of every place and their wise men they would carry these very fancy staff with like a jewel at the end and they would use it to to tell people they're casting spells on them so in case you didn't know because of Moses and because of what had happened um in the holy land they had Rod Cults they had Arc cults because the children of Israel had an ark people needed an ark it created Arc Cults can you imagine after all that great signs and wonders that happened with Moses how many people were walking around now and became wizards they must have worshiped it right so this Rod became a legend an idol almost amen so we're going to show you so first we're going to go to and and open up what does Rod of God means we already have a certain part it means judgment it means punishment it means chastisement you all with me now we're going to prove that so we come back to our scripture and I want to start with something very important so Moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass and he returned to the land of Egypt are we all together amen and I want you to notice that the Bible does not write things for nothing it says and Moses took the rod of God in his hand now hold on a minute the rod of God when did this become the rod of God now this stick Moses most likely picked up the stick in the wilderness when he was escaping Egypt before God spoke to him right so he must have been walking through the desert got really tired his legs must have been failing beneath him I found the stick and start limping over before he came to Jethro's place is that right how how is it then a a rod of God it was a dead stick from the Wilderness he was there you know there's actually a quote where brother mam says God found Moses walking around the mountain at ease he was having a soft life when God found him walking around with the same stick which had no power over him right so he could have picked it up when he fled Egypt wandered through the Wilderness and then we see something that happens when he meets the burning bush let's go to that okay and Moses answered so this is the Lord he sees let me turn aside and see this great sight when he saw the burning bush are you with us and Moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the Lord had not appeared unto thee and the Lord said unto him what is that in thine hand that proves to us that it was in his hand before the Lord called him right so he came up to the mountain so in case you said well this Rod had like magic powers he broke it off the burning bush or maybe he found it there in the presence of no he came up with the rod so he's saying uh if I go to I want you to get the picture listen I love the scriptures it's it's it's the the most amazing thing to me on the planet is the Bible and I when I read it I read every single phrase as if it means something more than what it says so don't miss this what is the context Moses is complaining that people are not going to listen to him and then God offers a solution like uh if he says but they're not going to listen to me they're not going to obey me they know who I am they knew I murdered that Egyptian you heard what they said to me the last time you just make yourself a prince over us what what makes you think they're going to listen to me he's making all the excuses that every normal human will make what is God solution God's solution should have said you know don't worry I'll just zap their minds or something and make them wake up and believe you were no he said what is in th hand God's solution to the people not believing him was a rod in Moses hand right and he said a rod praise be to God so he already had this with him which means from Exodus 4:20 that after the burning bush that Dead stick became the rod of God Amen right after the burning bush experience that Dead stick becomes the rod of God Amen let's look at a quote here from take the rod and gather the people love brother bram's titles you know how much you can make from that take the rod and gather the people and the rod that Moses had in his hand it was not the rod of Moses it was the rod of God God's judgment Rod Moses held it out over Egypt and flies came up he held it out and fleas came up wherever he dumped this Rod it was a judgment Rod he brought judgment Upon A disobedient people are you with us so Moses you get it this is the prophet saying it was not the rod of Moses it was the rod of God but what is important is he's pointing out that wherever Moses used that rod in that part of the journey going to Egypt there was just judgment wherever he used it it was just judgment chastisement are you with us so he Journeys to Egypt with this rod in his hand and he Wills the power of God in the 10 plagues and the rod became a legend an icon probably would have been much more of an idol now we're going to see because when the children of Israel watched Moses moving through they actually looked at this rod and began to respect its power and like most humans they turn it into an idol I mean we they should have realized the power is God's God's power not the rod right so what but what do they see think about it if you saw that you saw this man walk and put this rod in the water and starts turning to blood what would you immediately think right and then he raises it to the sky and then frogs come out and lice and flies and merrain and then boils and blaines and then fire and hail and Thunder From Heaven and then Locust that eat up everything 3 days of darkness and then finally the death of the was born of Egypt I mean any normal person would today would think that's some great magic right there yeah and they would have looked at that rod and some people can you imagine some people would have think if we could just get that Rod away from him yeah you know that's exactly how people think so after that display of of plagues the rod became a symbol of judgment amen you love him Saints now watch what happens this is exactly what I'm talking about because this this shows the condition of people including message people which we will bring in in a little while here was the war with the amalekites now you know these amalekites were like the most ferocious Warriors at that time and um there was this war that broke out the the amalekites came and took some people captive and the Israelis went back and and had to go and um uh uh recover and and fight against them and of course while fighting was going on uh Moses said he to them I'll stand at the top right so Moses s to Joshua choos us out men and go fight with amalec tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand notice the rod of God he doesn't say my rod the rod of God so whenever anyone talks about this they always speak of Aaron and her holding up moses' hands as if it was Moses Mo hands that had the power in them but Moses had specifically pointed out the rod of God in other words they were holding up Moses hand but it was the rod question I would ask is what if the rod was not there would the people have had Faith so somehow during the Wilderness they kind of built up a kind of faith in that Rod God had given them that Rod as a symbol to understand that his power was with Moses but just like all humans they look at the rod the people believed in that Rod so they knew the battle would be lost unless her and Aaron now I mean what if Aaron said you know what you take a break I'll hold a rod those men wouldn't dare we'll hold moses' hands up he's got the authority to hold that Rod right so he had two men holding up the prophet's hands all right so do you see that so far all the examples we see of this Rod of God has to do with judgment you agree so we can conclude that the rod of God is symbolizing the Judgment of God so for example we we use it today you know like when we talk about the vials or the trumpets or judgments upon the world we can easily say you know that's the rod of God hitting that right and and by that we mean judgment so let's go to the rod of Moses and we'll begin with Exodus 14:16 are you still with us amen but lift thou up thy rod now notice this is Exodus 14 this is long past the burning bush there's some places where God when he speaks about the rod he calls it the rod of God in this case he's identifying it as Moses Rod lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thy hand over the sea and divide it and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea you might think oh brother alist making too much of this no I'm not I'm going to show you a whole lot more at this point he's opening up the sea to the children of Israel there's no judgment so it's not called the rod of God whenever it had to do with judgment it was called the rod of God whenever it had to do with something else it's called the rod of Moses or thy rod Moses right so here Moses is opening up the Red Sea why because there are Egyptians behind them chasing them and he's opening up the Red Sea so what is this salvation the rod of Moses is salvation when you break that down further who is Moses why is Christ called a prophet like unto Moses Moses types the son of man Ministry what is the son of man Ministry it is salvation to mankind amen so that's what when you look at the rod of Moses you're speaking about salvation now when you look at that Exodus 14 he opens the Red Seas and opening the Red Sea can be seen as the part of the journey that has to do with the church ages why because Exodus 15 they come out and sing the horse and his rider hath he casted into the sea the Lord had Tri triumphed gloriously his right hand is all powerful the horse and his rider had they cast into the sea that means something to the church because there were horse riders four horse riders that were going to keep the church sealed up and it had to take a son of man Ministry to destroy those horse riders and this is exactly in the types and shadows if you read the whole song through Exodus 15 it means so much to us as Believers as the church because this is destroying the horse and his rider praise be to God Amen and that is the four horses of Revelation 6 all right all we're showing you is salvation right it is the ministry of Christ by the Holy Ghost bringing salvation to the church don't you love him Saints all right let's move to the next one which is where he tells Moses to speak to the Rock numbers 20: 7 to1 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and Aaron thy brother and speak you unto the rock so what is God's commandment you know this very well God told him speak speak to the Rock God didn't say go smack the rod the rock with a rod he knew it from the last time that this could be done but God was one him to move past that see don't stagnate on that move further speak to the rock those of you who read the message you can apply this to the prophet's three polls where he told him I told you not to do that with the second pull it's time to move into the third which is speaking the word but you feeling sorry for the people and you're extending the second pull and it shall give forth so speak to the Rock Before Their Eyes God wanted it to be a spectacle to show why I believe God is actually wanting Moses to move past cuz the people are already idolizing this Rod they need to recognize the difference in the ministry and instead he's still using the rod because he knows how much the people respect this rod and so Moses uh it shall give forth his water wonderful the RO is a he Thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so Thou shalt give the congregation and their Beast to drink are you still with me and Moses took the rod from before the Lord as he commanded and Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the Rock and he said unto them hear now ye Rebels why Rebels he's speaking to the Believers which means already they were along the journey and stagnating forgetting staying they wanted more miracles right this should have been the time where you speaking the word you're believing you're maturing you're Rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock it's almost like like I tell you see reading the scriptures by now those people should have went up to the Rock and spoke to it themselves after having seen what they've seen this is where we should be in the message right instead we become branhamites go up this is what look at the question must we who the prophet in the ministry must we fetch you water out this rock and Moses lifts up his hand and with his Rod smites The Rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their beasts also all right hold on God told Moses speak to the Rock Moses of his own will took his Rod the rod of Moses and Strikes The Rock twice right the prophet said that was a type of the crucifixion now this is where it gets really interesting right because he all always said it was mysterious because Jesus was only smitten once then the mystery became apparent to brother Bram that he was going to be smitten again in his own time time you know this is what he says this is what surprises many people now notice this is the works that I do bear witness of me Moses smoke the rock the second time representing that Christ should come to Earth and die again when die again Christ should come to Earth and die again son of man Ministry see how many people would say he needs to come back he's going to come back in that Corporal body if they take this quote that's not what's going to happen Christ is not coming back to Earth in a Corporal body to die again it became apparent to the prophet that they were going to reject his message and he knew the son of man Ministry in his ministry was Christ and it has to be thoroughly cruci ified and rejected which if you haven't been awake has been happening now they're crucifying the cloud the messenger the prophecies everything that he said it's being cut to Pieces how about this he'll tell you exactly where I don't know if you can read that he says think of it the hardest pierces comes from the pulpit that's where his new Calvary is at they crucify him the word at the pulpit that's right how how they do it by their forms of godliness that's exactly Crown from The Audience by scoffers he's got a new Crown of Thorns scoffers pierced from the pulpit crowned by the scoffers is he crucified again aresh striped by man-made Creeds teachers of denomination against his word they stripe it in shame condemn it that means what Moses did was correct it was going to happen Christ was going to be crucified twice just didn't recognize do you understand what has happened today in the message why there is Judgment coming upon the people they have rejected him again he was what he is the one that Gentile church was looking for this revealed word this book is what the church was supposed to be expecting of course we know the scripture in Hebrews 9:28 so Christ was once offered to Bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation without sin what he was not going the second time he would come would not be born Bor of a virgin would not be born of a woman amen so he's he's going to be coming the second time to complete salvation not being born of a woman not bearing the sins of many this time it's going to be in our day the son of man Ministry properly and thoroughly rejected and crucified and the ones who would do it would be actually those from behind the pulpit imagine the crown of thorns today is caused by by scoffing God help us this scripture tells us that there are two comings two crucifixions the first one was to bear sin the second is without sin unto salvation that means after the second time salvation is a complete work did you notice something the water only flowed after the second strike before that it was in part throughout the the church ages they had the holy spirit in part the Holy Ghost in part the word in part but after the second crucifixion that's when the water flows by the ministry of Moses a son of man Ministry this is why there is living water in the bride this is why the bride can never become a denomination because this is where salvation is completed after the second cruci conviction which is when the water flows praise be to God the types don't lie praise be to God do you see salvation by the rod of Moses amen so let's go to the rod of Aaron this is where it gets even more interesting are you interested glory to God Exodus 79 to8 and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron saying when Pharaoh shall speak unto you you saying show a miracle for you then shalt thou say unto Aaron take thy rod and cast it before pharaoh and it shall become a serpent do you know how often when we talk about this we say Moses threw down his rod and his Moses rod turned into a serpent but the Bible said it was Aaron's Rod say unto Aaron take thy rod but here's something interesting it doesn't say Moses went with a rod and Aaron went with another Rod it's the same Rod I'll prove that to you it's exactly the same Rod there's no Moses rod and Aaron so these two men were standing there one with his rod and the other one with with the other Rod how do you know right did you notice how we always refer to it as Moses Moses rod and yet it the Bible specifically says say unto Aaron take thy rod because the rod the same rod in the hand of Aaron is a different manifestation Exodus 7:12 what is it in the hand of Aaron exposing the fakers we're coming to something uh verse 12 for they cast down every man his his rod that's Janice and jambus and they became serpents Now open up your eyes again but Aaron's Rod swallowed up their rods don't miss it it doesn't say Aaron's snake swallowed up their snakes it says Aaron's Rod swallowed this is very important Saints why it identifies aon's Rod Aaron's Rod has got something to do with when there's a contest of rods that's the only time it's called the rod of Aaron when there's a contest of rods when it's got to do with judgment it's the rod of God when it's got to do with saving Israel it's the rod of Moses but when there's a contest of rods it's called Aaron's Rod I mean if there was something else to when they went to the the River Nile and they there was no contest of rods when there was time for lice and frogs and all that there was no contest of rods but now there's a contest of rods what is those contest of rods Ministry what is the rod of Aaron about about showing which is the right Ministry amen so that Rod of God Rod of Moses was never a contest about Ministries it was never a contest of rod in this contest with Egypt eypt which types the world or denominational systems what What's Happening Here Egypt types the denominational systems what are what is we proving the the ministry the dominance of Moses Ministry of the ministry of God in Moses and Aaron the dominance over the ntional ministry that's what's happening his ministry swallowed up their Ministries in fact the prophet says it in in some some one of the messages he speaks about Moses what he says it swallows it up it swallows their rods up into itself he's just different terminology are you with us so it shows that Aaron's Rod swallowed up the others into itself that means their Ministries were overshadowed they had it no more it was done with amen this shows the dominance and what it does is it exposes the fakers they were fake Ministries those are magicians of of pharaoh were they were using slight of hand they were fakers they were not the genuine article what was it proving there are bogus dollars and then there's a real dollar it was showing which was the real dollar right and which was the bogus so the rod of Aaron seems to be about manifesting who is the real genuine article praise be to God now it doesn't stop with Egypt and Egypt's Ministry and denominations then we move on into the message halfway through the Wilderness there's another contest of rods number 17 these people were murmuring so much they're like yes Moses but you know we dream dreams too we prophesy we have visions we have uh gifts uh we should have a little bit more you know power and Authority and murmuring against Moses and Aaron the Lord said enough is enough the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel and take off every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers of all their princes according to the house of their fathers 12 rods so where's the contest of the ministry Happening Now among the Believers because they're thinking they can correct the prophet they they're feeling relevant right and now every man's name upon his rarden what is a name an identification it's an identification of your ministry and thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi for one rod shall be for the head of the House of their fathers and thou shalt lay them up in the Tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony where I will meet with you and it shall come to pass that the man's Rod whom I shall choose shall Blossom and I will make to cease from me what's this going to do stop the murmurings this whole idea of the contest of rods is to stop the murmuring right and I will um where am I uh and I shall come to pass that the man's Ro whom I shall choose shall Blossom and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel where my where by they murmur against you and Moses spake unto the children of Israel and every one of their princes gave him a rod a piece for each Prince W according to their father's houses even 12 rods and the rod of Aaron was among their rods and Moses laid up the rods before the Lord so who takes it the prophet takes the rods in behind the veil right and it came to pass that on the tomorrow this is uh verse 8 to 10 went into the Tabernacle of witness and behold the rod of Aaron not the rod of God not the rod of Moses the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded this this Rod didn't just Bud it budded and brought forth Buds and bloomed blossoms and yielded armonds so it budded it produced branches It produced leaves It produced flowers and fruit in the presence of the Lord praise be to God and Moses brought out all the rods before the Lord so here comes all the Ministries and one has blossomed and they looked and took every man his rod and the Lord said unto Moses bring Aaron's Rod again before the testimony now watch this bring Aaron's Rod again before the testimony to be kept for a token against the rebels Thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me that they die not this was done to protect them do not challenge the real true Ministry of the open book again this is going to prove to you why is this important Saints because here we see a context of rods among Believers to establish leadership what is the rod of Aaron about it's about placing the predestinated son in his position it's about adoption it's about showing which one has the true Jean seed in him praise be to God and to put him in his rightful position when there is a question or a challenge against God's anointed so the rod of Aaron is symbolizing the placing of a son the rest the Sabbath of God it is the believer's position in Christ here's a beautiful question why didn't all the other rods Blossom I mean this is the presence of God I mean those rods came into the presence of eternal life they should have blossomed you think something that comes in there should it's coming into God's holy presence it should have had life in itself it should have blossomed it should have become trees for crying out loud which means even in the divine shakina presence of God that which is not chosen will remain dead why because there is no seed in it Why didn't it bring forth what does it show election this is important it's manifesting time this was about election amen and manifesting time the manifestation would silence the murmurings that's the whole point that's the context from now on I will silence the murmurings of the rebels this is very important for you today there's going to be many Ministries in the message but there's only one open book ministry that's the one that will produce the blossom there's so many people who use the message of the Prophet it's do you know how easy it is to take messages that are so brilliant with the greatest quotes and the greatest ideas any any person can just take a message book and come preach a message but one that brings forth the life that produces the right manifestation that challenges the heart of the believer that takes him behind the veil that proves that there's a jean seed inside one that brings a a Son of God to maturity that challenges him to become a manifested son that grows him up towards adoption there's only one message and that one will swallow up everything else the others will go into legalism and liberalism and elevation of some man's Ministry and make some great ministry in the world and Elevate some person and create an idol but the real Ministry of God is going to produce the blossom the but the flower the Armen when it gets behind the veil it will produce true manifested Sons you have to seek that message that is the rod of Aaron praise be to God everybody is claiming to be a chosen Ministry today but when the rod of Aaron is manifested everyone can see who is the true elected Ministry of God you know it's like religions religions produce robots it brainwashes people Everyone kind of acts the same walks the same behaves like Pious individuals coming to church they look like such traditional Christians they they are like programmed read the Creed and so on and the message Believers think yeah you know but we don't have the Creed we don't have dogmas we don't it takes 5 seconds for you to become a denomination to conform to something and you know how bad it is the moment you start conforming you start judging one another on who conforms the best that's got nothing to do with that we need to be far from that kind of life that's the reason why we end up hurting one another cutting each other up accusing each other of not keeping the Cod listen Saints if the length of your skirt had to do with Holiness then your skirt should be touching the ground right yes if the if the height of your heel sisters was holy had a measure of Holiness then you should be walking barefoot if the Holiness of the brother's hair uh had to do with how long it is then we should all go bald who's got the right standard who's the most holy but look at how Petty we become judging each other by who holds the best standard who prays longer who uses the quotes Lord you said on Christ the ministry page 28 paragraph This that's not a prayer come and pray here nobody asks you to preach a sermon while you pray take the needs of the children of God to to the throne speak sincere words don't be an act don't be a faker it produces no life it's just tradition you're no different from in 5 seconds you went to someone from the Sheep coat to think you're a professor of the message we were all noodies had it not been for this message this message gave us the wisdom of God how do we suddenly become professors in this message authorities to cut one another down this Rod of Aaron silences the murmurers no matter what you say it's going to prove whether you are behind the veil or not amen glory to God do you love him Saints so the road of Aaron is the placing of a son glory to God and here's the summary the rod of God was judgment and it's judgment to those who reject the prophet we saw that in the nation out of a Nation the first Exodus right the rod of Moses is a son of man Ministry which is opening the word like the Red Sea bringing salvation taking a church out of a Nation where are we why do people want to go back to Rod of God why do they want to go back to Rod of Moses God sent a prophet where are you at are you at manifesting time the rod of Aaron the placing of a son which Rod are you under this is adoption time this is the stage of the journey see what I was telling you about people stagnating over something the rod of Moses the RO of God is glorious it's amazing we can all stand there and brag and say look at my God just judging those sinful heathens that's not where I want to be I don't want to gloat in the world's suffering I'm not interested in gloating on God judging America those are people those are souls they may be living in sin they may be Hollywood people but their souls are empty they don't know what they're crying out for the soul of man is secretly crying out for God but they're filling it with tobacco and alcohol and fornication and all these kind of things but you have the privilege of standing behind the veil in the presence of God we should pity those people the Bible the prophet said the only sign and evidence of the Holy Ghost was a heart that sighed and cried for the Abominations that were in the city everything else was not an Evidence this was the evidence to find people that look at the others listen the white Throne judgment is not something for us to gloat about you are here for more than just to fill a church or manage a message Church there will be Mercy granted to People based on their interactions with you that's why that's a greater reason there are people that will receive white robes simply because they came in contact with you and recognized God in you that's a great thing this is where the bride of Christ ought to be amen so let's bring this to a su to a conclusion let's take this rod and personify it let's make it personal let's make it you let's first say that the rod is you right that means you can be in the hand of God in the ministry of the Prophet right let's let's look at it how let's find a scripture Psalm 74: 2 remember thy congregation which thou has purchased of old I love that the rod of thine inheritance who's the rod of your inheritance your people which thou has redeemed this Mount Zion wherein thou has dwelt so it's literally personifying the rod who is Mount Zion Mount Zion types the bride we are no longer come to a mount that can be touched we have come to the spirits of just men made perfect Mount Zion the bride amen let's make it personal Saints you are that Rod this is an application you are used to right did you see that the rod was actually one rod from the beginning I told you I'm going to bring you to this remember when Aaron cast that rod down and it became a serpent how do we know it was the rod Moses was holding because it happened at the burning bush that was the first place it turned into a serpent right amen so do you notice he gave him the first sign of his Rod turning into a serpent was with Moses and this was long before he even met Aaron so it's the same Rod all the way through just changing hands praise be to God long before he met Aaron so when they went to Pharaoh Aaron's Rod that became a snake was actually Moses Rod was actually the rod of God Amen but in Aaron's hand it was doing something different brother bam calls it Moses Rod that took its rods into itself yes he did but he understood this was Aaron's Ministry so when it was time to establish Aaron's Ministry in Israel because God said to them I want you to be a kingdom of priests he didn't want them to have Kings God was very upset with Israel when they chose a king you know this he told them you shall be a kingdom of priests you break that down do you know what that means God wanted them to be a kingdom of intercessors they chose to be a kingdom of judges that was not the right Ministry so when it was time to establish Aaron's Ministry it was the same Rod that went behind the veil Aaron and Moses were both of the family of Levi and the the name of Levi the was of Aaron was written on that Rod all right so are you following the story same Rod moving through different Ministries did you know that the reason God pours the vials on the Earth is because of the presence of the elect the judgments on the world is because of you of well of course the the judgments on Egypt was because of Goan was because of Israel they are being judged because of your presence you are in his hand that's what I mean it's because of you that judgments are pouring out on people because it's the judgments on Earth that's going to prepare the Earth for you to live in how about salvation Christ came to die for whose sin not theirs your sin my sin he was stricken he was struck he was smitten for you and me the Bible said Christ shall come to save his people but God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever so salvation is offered to everyone but he came to die for his people for your sin salvation was for you not them you are the ones who was who was in his mind before the foundation of the world you are the ones that came by permissive will you are the ones that he's concerned with it's your sin amen Rod of Moses how about the son of man ministering in this last day that takes you behind the veil how about what happens when the open book is brought down to earth what takes you behind the veil who else is it for it's for you right placing adoption do you love him says so what happens when you are finally behind the veil in the shakina presence you will bring forth the life of the attribute inside of you that's what proves that you are a son of God that's what tells you who you really are you can be at all other stages of the journey you will never know who you are you'll never know whether you're manifesting the life that was in his mind before the foundation of the world you look like any other denomination like any other church maybe just dressed a little different you sing the same songs You Preach like others you pray in jesus' name if you ask other churches well what's the difference then it's only your Prophet you look like everybody else you go to a church you have the same format you have the same setup you look like everybody else where's the difference you say oh it's our dressing no Prophet tells you the nazarin dress a whole lot better than us there's there's people in the world in in Orthodox churches that are so holy they outshine us exponentially they have prayer they have fastings they have devotions every day they have devotions several times a day they observe Christianity they outshine us they sparkle what's the difference then they are not behind the veil they are they are in ignorance everything they do is in ignorance but out of tradition you we a dead dry stick picked up by the prophet's minist R God took us from the Sheep coat Saints we were useless nobody saw any value in US we were in this prophet's hand in this ministry and God places us behind the veil and then we come out and manifest a life we know we could never have done no one would have recognized anything about us but when we come into this revealing of the seals the opening of the word he brings forth something and makes us into something that silences the murmurers amen as we close it let's look at the application for our day let's look at the rod of God so we can look at it two ways the first one was you as the rod but now let's look at the rod being the book the book where was the book first in the hand of he who was on the throne when the book was in the hand of he who was on the the throne there was earthquakes and Lightnings and voices and thunderings there was judgments there were the 24 Elders falling down and Casting Crowns and the beasts blocking their eyes saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which is and which was and which is to come this was what was happening when the book was in the hand of he who was on the throne but something had to change the book had to shift hands right and in as long as it was on the throne in the hand of he was on the throne it was judgment all was lost for mankind and a cry went out who is worthy why that book has to change hands again and if that book changes hands the ministry changes hands and it changes to a book of Salvation because it goes into the hands of the bleeding bloody lamb which is there the rod of God Revelations 4:51 but then it becomes the rod of the Prophet Malachi 4:5 and6 Revelations 56789 the seals being opened the lamb the son of Ministry taking the book breaking the seals revealing everything revealing all parts of the word amen and so we see when it was in the hand of God great signs and wonders upon the Earth cataclysmic life changing to the planet but when that word is in the hand of the invisible God there are trumpets there are vials he judges the Earth calling out his chosen people but when it moves to the hand of the lamb and he is breaking the seals he's manifesting the word he's bringing salvation to the church it turns the heart of the children back to the fathers it brings the revealing of the seals it brings water from the rock glory to God the second fold of the seven seal the book in the hand of the messenger a son of man revealing the son of man he said did you notice how phenomenal this week was it hasn't been a man it's been them angels amen praise be to God salvation to the bride but that's not the end that's right because it doesn't stop with the with that angel it now says to the bride go take the book what happens this is the rod of melchisedek who's melchisedek Kings and Priests and they sang a new song Heath made us unto our God Kings and Priests the last destination of the book is in the hand of the Bride what happens when the bride gets the book she eats the book and the book goes where behind the veil into the holiest of holies the soul of mankind in here is the change over from the ministry it's no longer in the hand of Moses the Propet or the son of man is no longer there in that Heavenly Throne it's now on Earth it's behind the veil it's now going to make the Jean seed manifest and grow and bring forth and what does it say now you must speak you must prophesy to All Nations kindreds tribes and tongues Revelation 5:9 he has made us under our God Kings and priest Revelations 108-111 the book comes down the bride eats the book goes behind the veil what happens when each individual believer takes that book and eats it she's positionally placed she speaks to All Nations what is speaking to All Nations manifesting blossoming blooming buding she intercedes for mankind she intercedes why because the mercy seed is in the bride she is the manifestation of the life behind the veil she has rest behind the veil and what happens rest from murmurings about her election people can tell you what you want after that there's no more question in your heart you're not looking for the rod of God you're not looking for the rod of man the rod of Moses you're not looking for anything else because the book has come to you and the believer is behind the veil you know the prophet says when a man is behind the veil he's dead in Christ you remember that he says if a man if a man is dead and you kick him he doesn't kick back he doesn't respond he says just like what a Believer is when he's behind the veil he's not going to have to respond to insults he's not going to have to respond to pettiness you know this something the wonderful the prophet says God has calling us to be peculiar not silly that's a quote message people have taken this message and made themselves Silly by it this is the truth this is a reason why people call us a cult because we act cultish remember those times we got all holier than thou we came out our lives are messed up we were fornicators we were drunkards we were smokers we're drug addicts we were gamblers were frauders we were everything then we got this message and suddenly we became the judges and we became silly we we wouldn't let our relatives into our weddings because they weren't dress right we wouldn't let them come into church because they weren't dressed right do you know brother brandham did not preach in Messi's churches there were no Messi's churches in brother bram's day he preached among denominations we came to the message and said you must not be with denominations how are you the salt of the earth the salt is meant to preserve the salt is meant to show its Savor what are you being what are you salting yeah one another whose lives are you touching yeah how do you make a difference if you actually don't interact with the world what are you afraid of this is the thing we became silly instead of peculiar young people I'm going to give you a secret and this is my this is part of my testimony I was young too believe it or not things happen in school this is what I did when I got to school I professed my faith from the very beginning profess your faith how did I profess my faith I didn't go there and preach the seals when I was in grade 8 I don't know what year that is for you from the time I got into my first year of high school and I I got into class and spoke to my friends and my teachers I told them straight away I do not swear please don't swear when you speak to me I do not date I'm never going to have a girlfriend until it's time for me to marry I do not dance I do not listen to pop music I don't watch television I I'm not going to enjoy your metrick balls and your dancers that you're going to have the school I'm not going to do it I spoke to to my principal I professed my faith from the first year of high school you know what happened my friends made me keep my profession If Ever I had to try and stay they say hey I thought you said like what are you doing here you professed it so um I think it was like when I was in grade 10 you in South Africa they took us for these political camps to the mountains they used to teach us in a negotiations and politics and there were special groups of children uh they would choose maybe six to 12 kids from every school in Northern ital and they took us to the drakensburg and they would School Us in how to negotiate in politics and we had this weekend of you of camps where they were teaching us all this stuff and uh at the end of the day they would have a dance they would have a all because it's so many schools together in this in in the mountains and they would have this dance so here am I in the freezing cold I refuse to go inside uh to the dance so I'm standing outside I'm only 16 so um there of course three girls come walking up to me and one of them wants to ask me to Dance Now girls from my school saw this happening they were already dancing they ran straight to these girl stop he's a good boy he doesn't do this I didn't have to say anything my friend and the girls in my school protected me because I didn't stop professing my faith don't blend there's nothing good that comes from blending tell them who you are tell them what you stand for they'll keep you in line but you try try blending go to work some guy there comes and tells you some filthy joke and you you laugh at him I tell him that's disgusting please please don't tell me that again it's not funny at all eventually they start apologizing they use some swear word and sorry sorry we didn't realize you were here that even happened when I was working my boss would apologize to me don't stop professing what you believe the Bible says You must profess it that's the part that people don't understand his strength because the Lord says you are defiled by what comes out of your mouth you know why this works with humans when something is a thought it's still okay right it's not it's not actionable but when you speak it it causes your body a a feedback loop where it it places the nature inside you it finishes the thought and it becomes creation inside you so if you profess the word you keep saying this is is who I am I do not believe this I do not swear I do not curse I do not speak this I do not listen to this I'm not going to watch this I'm not going to go to the dance I never had to come and ask my parents to say please can I go to the dance I had already professed to so many people even if in my heart which it didn't happen but if I felt like no way not happening too many people know what I professed already and I'm going to get crucified so I did the best I was head boy of my school so I helped them I was artistic so I helped them draw all the signs for the metrick dance the end of the year dance I did all of that for them and the day of the dance I was not there and they all knew no one's going to ask me questions no one's going to tell me you missed out on something it was so uh it was such such a great thing that when I got married one of my friends flew down and told my father I came to see if this was actually real nobody thought this guy was ever going to get married young people it works profess what you believe profess who you are it's real it's powerful it works the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth it's powerful the same way that humans are defiled by what they say you also purified by what you say praise be to God so let's close this down my last thought on this is don't get stuck on the rod of God and the rod of Moses let's complete the journey let's go to the rod of Aaron what does it mean by going to the rod of Aaron we must complete this journey by living behind the veil amen break that down even further I'm not interested in message Traditions I'm not interested in message denomination I'm not going to get uh excited with miracles signs and wonders they are good they are good for a church where there are people growing we need the gifts we need those parts of the gifts but I don't want to get stuck there I don't want to get stuck on God sent a prophet remember the elders in those days in the days of the message if you went out to preach to to spread the word to somebody there were three things they they spoke about God sent a prophet do you know what triple six is and uh let me tell you what the Judgment the oop and Seed those were the three things so uh uh God sent a prophet triple six mark of the beast and Su seed you can't tell people that today you can try they're going to shut you down straight away cuz they all have already heard about William Brandon he's a cult he's on the internet the moment you start with God sent a prophet sorry you know you guys are like the Mormons even your church age book looks exactly like them you know you got this blue book on the inside is a picture of your Prophet you're just like them you're no different you're a cult you can't even do that anymore how are you going to affect them today they must see the manifested life that's the only way that's the day you're living in don't get stuck let me give you an example right you are a tabernacle there is a veil of self-will that separates your soul from your spirit most Believers love to see the rod of God I remember the the days the elders in the message and the people today do you know what can can you believe it Believers got shaken up when brother Billy Paul passed away because it was like what about that prophecy about the Sharks and they got shattered there were brothers messaging me to say brother aliser what now did the Rapture finish did we miss the Rapture what happened about I had to tell them the truth I'm sorry brothers that prophecy is not in the message it may have been something that God told Brother Billy Paul to help him it was for him it's got nothing to do with me I'm not going to make any big deal about it I don't find it in the message it was his testimony and God must have shown him something to make sure brother Billy Paul stays in line with the message I don't know but I'm not going to make so much about it I'm not going to let it hinder my faith let me show you why most people in the message are going after watching whether California is going to sink what do I care if California sinks the Vatican the pope we're watching that we're watching Israel you're watching all that and your children are dis appearing that's right the next generation is disappearing but you're watching the Pope the Vatican California you're looking for the rod of God in the world and you're not getting behind the veil and getting you and your children and your family behind the veil and teaching them to love the open book the rod of God then the problem is people ran uh into people nowadays challenging the prophet right you can see it on the internet proving the cloud was false brother Ram's prophecies were false they can't cope what's wrong brother Alis what do we do the youth are panicking we can't talk to our friends look at all this stuff and believe the sign and seeking the truth and what are they saying about you know what it's the rod of Moses they can't survive unless someone's holding up the Prophet The Prophet's hands see what do you want our us message pastors to be apologist for brother brandham being an apologist is the worst place to be in I can't make up excuses for brother bham because he said this in this place and he said it differently in another place or because we got some guy who walked with the prophet making a testimony that is contradiction to something he said I am not interested in that I don't need somebody holding up moses' hands because I've received the open book I'm beyond all that the first and second Paul doesn't even matter to me anymore I don't care about anything if go if I'm behind the veil and God wants me to die of stage four cancer and doesn't want to heal me I'm okay with that because nothing is going to affect me I fear no death no pain no suffering no sickness no Peril no sword can separate us from the love that is in Christ Jesus you were a a dead stick once he gives you the open book he brings you behind the veil you become manifested if you're still in the hand if you're still under the rod of God if you're still under the rod of Moses you're still a dead stick no matter how powerful the ministry is no matter how many Ministries there are and how they're talking about the judgments and Israel and the Vatican and the pope and Los Angeles thinking you're still a dead stick unless you've received the open book you're still a dead stick nobody can tell they're just going to call you a cult but when you receive the open book when you receive the opening of the seals when you recognize his coming in you personally from there on it's like the woman at the well she was always a dead stick but she was a Believer she recognized Christ when he was there and she said we know that when Messiah comes he will do this I am he that speaks to you that was the end she had gone behind the veil come see a man who told me my life but look at those Pharisees and those scribes those learned men who are looking for that prophecy the same Messiah spoke to them and they were just dead sticks others love the rod of Moses God sent a prophet first pole Ministry second pole Ministry competition between message people and denominations preaching against denominations gets us what seeking after signs and wonders and all of these things convention meetings and great anointings and great jumping around and screaming and falling all over the floor and gets us what if you can't love your husband right if you can't uh love your wife right if you can't bring up your children what's the point of falling down and passing out under the anointing they find if you're under the rod of God and under the rod of Moses you find no growth you'll lose the Next Generation the Commandment of God to keep the Commandments keep means to preserve Preserve you shall keep the light of the Candlestick burning as a propitiation from now for your children and your children's children and your children's children's children never let this light go out what are we doing while we fussing about message traditions and Desiring the rod of God in the rod of Moses and making up the name of William brandom greater than anything else it's supposed to be bride time it's supposed to be now when you are manifesting the life of God to the public that's where we ought to be people should be thirsting for what you have people should see the sign of the Messiah in you they should see the The Compassion of God they should see the transforming power of your words glory to God hallelujah we're losing the new generation with they're sitting in church with pure boredom because we're going on with message buzzwords you can have services so powerful you can walk up and down and shout seven Thunders and peruja and this and that and message Buzz words and just watch the faces of the children they're bored they're tired they're sleeping they're not interested you're not even speaking anything that is relevant to them these kids are under a barrage of stuff from the internet social media horrible things we never grew up with words language pictures inappropriate stuff learning the language of a global system if you're preaching some denominational message do you realize how bored they are is there any message uh that you can preach that is more excitable than a cell phone to a person to a young kid huh anything they'll leave the church right now to play some game on a cell phone or do something girls with social media that you should see the youth camps if you not speaking relevant things that takes them behind the veil they're bored with everything you're saying they're like here goes that guy again the kid said I was a kid in church I know I know exactly how each brother prayed how he shook his leg when he prayed how the one would start we know exactly how he starts ask the kids they'll tell you what words he uses who's they'll even while they sitting oh no not him praying again I hate it when he prays that's how kids are they're watching you if you're not speaking relevant things you're losing them Elders if you haven't noticed are dying out all the Ministries that took the world the message to the world are dying out and many of them are are becoming irrelevant no one's listening to them anymore this is where we are right now you are becoming the elders you are becoming the ones who are supposed to have the answers to the questions there are questions they have today which were not questions in when when I was a kid to ask questions to my dad these kids have new questions I could tell you some of them today but we don't have time it's too much just go to youth camps and you hear it Saints you cannot survive under the rod of God or the rod of Moses any longer because each one has a time limit judgments only judgments are all in time right salvation is all in time it has to come to a point where you're not lost salvation is for the Lost there has to come to a point where but when the rod goes behind the veil it's eternity it's Eternal it's behind the veil you can't stay under those Ministries because there's a time limit and your your Revival is going to run out and it has do you understand why the gifts are dwindling do you understand why those anointings are dwindling God is allowing it you're never going to see great Ministries rise up again with sweeping healings and this ministry of the Bride is not going to go around healing on finding a cure for cancers absolutely not this is a different time Amen in closing you're still a dead dry stick if you're not bringing forth get behind the veil let the word get into the third pool phase or take you into the ark itself under The Mercy Seat where you can bloom and bod and manifest the attribute that is within you do you believe that musicians you can come forward you need to realize if you're behind the veil that that Rod went and stayed under The Mercy Seat never to come out again amen it stayed in there there was once it was in and it bed and blossomed and Bloom Moses was not going to use it again Joshua was not going to use it that that Rod would would stay in the ark and cross over into the promised land and go across the Jordan which is a type of the seven seal opening up the new land and if anyone had any arguments again it simply had to be taken out and say see this is it never to be used again what happens in the promised land the pull of fire the pull of cloud disappears brother Ram said the pulier became a man in the promised land the word becoming flesh glory to God do you believe him Saints do you love him do you know what this message means to us do you see what the simple type can show us about our journey and where we ought to be it corrects us it challenges us it pushes us away from the sign board and says keep walking keep going forward don't stop there we've got to do this listen I'm from South Africa I may never see you again if there one thing we can achieve tonight is just to pick you up and get you moving again then we've achieve something don't get stuck in a place not even in your family listen brother you can be a rod of God in your family you can be a a rod of Moses in your family or you can be a rod of Aaron which one do you want to be you can be an authoritative parent one is shouting and screaming and correcting and overcorrecting or you can be a a Salvation all the time you're never going to produce a real man out of your son the rod of Aaron will you move in stages you correct when he has no understanding you give Grace when he's a teenager when he's making mistakes but there comes a point tell him son you need to get the job done I'm not going to do it for you you there comes a time where you see it in the growth it's the same with a mother it's the same with parents it's the same with a pastor and a church it's not the pastor's job to be correcting you all the time do you want me to come to you with a rod of Correction or love and meekness how do I come to you with love and meekness you need to become mature it's not the pastor's job to create Ministries for you and activities for you to go out and manifest it is your job to do that you need to grow there needs to be maturity this can happen as ministers in the message we can deal like that with each other with Ministries we can be the rod of Moses we can be the rod of God to some of our brothers or we can be the rod of Aaron amen sons of God being placed men and Daughters of God coming to maturity we need to be those people praise be to God let's sing that song Mercy rewrote my life life as I invite brother Ben over can we take a little higher do you not know the song You Know It Mercy we Ro my
