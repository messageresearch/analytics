just one um I think um here we are a few verses here that um yeah we're going to read from verse 1 down to verse 11 oh yeah there we are amen trust everyone as well t tonight amen praise the Lord it says finally my brethren rejoice in the Lord to write the same things to you to me indeed is not Grievous but for you it is safe to rejoice in the Lord is safe beware of dogs that dogs there means men of unclean mind beware of evil workers Beware of the concision for we are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh though I might uh also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might Trust In the Flesh I more circumcised The Eighth Day of the stock of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew of the Hebrews is touching the law of Pharisee concerning Zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is which is in the law blameless but what things were gain to me those I counted lost for Christ yay doubtless I counted all things but the but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and to count them but dung that I may were in Christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead amen and we know if you keep reading in second Timothy Paul says I know there's a Crown of Life waiting for me amen so don't ever leave it hanging there where I might obtain he knew he obtained if you've been sealed into the kingdom by the baptis in the Holy Ghost you have arrived amen amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer tonight amen we got a few prayer requests am want to remember Sister tsa's mom in prayer she's had a fall and a broken her pelvis um sister uh Linda's mom as well down in denan had had a fall broken her hip and maybe her leg I haven't got an update and also want to remember brother it's Dad as well in South Africa amen and if you have a need just want to raise your your hands to the Lord amen gracious Eternal Father we're so thankful Lord that we can sing there is none like you we're so glad you found us Lord truly we could search for all eternity long but Lord I'm so thankful we don't have to Lord Jesus but you searched for us and found us and wrapped us in your great love divine we want to thank you dear God that we can commit all of our Lives everything we are into your hands we want to remember these ones Lord I've read Lord of these prayer requests of Falls and injuries and sicknesses father I pray Lord You' touch each one Lord Lord may you raise them up father and most importantly may all be well with their souls dear God father may you grant it in the name of Jesus Christ Lord I pray father they just wouldn't be able to physically walk again but may they spiritually walk with you and know you in the power of your Resurrection May you grant it father and all the other hands that have been raised around the building those who are watching tonight Lord that that are well as well father we just want to commit them all into your hands may you meet every need according to your riches and glory and may you be exalted and worshiped in our lives because you deserve all the glory and praise we thank you Lord be with us now take over the meeting Lord have your way in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats tonight so I want to take especially this you know I love it how the Apostle Paul says I just count all things but dung he could have boasted in all things but you know he he weighed it up knowing god or this natural life and he just threw the natural life away and walked with God Amen but you see this's this one verse that really jumped out to me uh this week that we are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh amen so we know that the circumcision that we uh Paul's really talking about is the true circumcision which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost which comes into our life and cuts the world out of our life that's the true circumcision it's not a physical one under the law but the true circumcision is of the heart amen as the Apostle Paul would say for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and ye are complete in him who is the head of all principality and power I like Colossians chapter 2 it's real I mean I know all the scriptures powerful but I think this is real powerful am mean in whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands and putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ buried with him and baptism wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins and uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross and having spoiled principalities and Powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it amen so the Apostle Paul is saying that we were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands amen so it's not human doing that cuts away the world in unbelief and sin but it's the operation of the holy spirit of God Amen but the circumcision we know know it was a covenant that God made with Abraham and his seed and you know with the children of Israel we know it was a you know a covenant but the thing is we are under the true Covenant amen they were just under the blood of bulls and goats and God lived in their lives and God did many miraculous things but it didn't take sin nature out of them it was just the circumcision was just an outward uh display of a of a promise that God made but we know under the um under the law it was if you will I will you know but uh but the true Covenant which is the same like Abraham was given is I have made you am mean so God told Abraham I've made you the father of many nations it was a faith Covenant am mean and Abraham believed God and it was a tribute to him for righteousness and then God gave him the Seal of circumcision showing that God had received his faith now it's the same thing with the baptism of the Holy Ghost God circumcises us or fills us with his holy spirit showing he has received your faith amen I trust this is not algebra this is very Mak sense right we have we have a true Covenant amen we are are we are the circumcision or you say we are the people of God am mean we are under his Covenant just like God said to Abraham I have made you a father of Nations yet he had no children he he and Sarah couldn't physically have a child but God said I have made you the father of Nations so it wasn't possible humanly for him to for them to have Isaac but God came on the scene changed their bodies made them young again gave them the ability and then they had the promised son and it shows that you know that humanly we cannot fulfill the word of God but God but but God giving us Faith amen and Grace to fulfill the word fulfills it in our lives so I think you know we can just rejoice in the Lord tonight amen you know if you're feeling done you're feeling feeling weary just rejoice in God trust in his ability let him let God be God as as brother impul said years ago just let God be God you be the believer and let God be God I think that's the right way to be because man takes things into their hands and they become God I don't want to become God no I'm going to let him be God God and I'm going to be the believer I'm going to let him do what he wants to do amen so so we are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit amen so it's so important as as the you know the Lord would say to the woman at the well that the father seeketh them who worship God in spirit and in truth amen so God was seeking you to worship him that way praise the Lord and he found us amen amen and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh so I'm going to continue going down but you see the holy spirit is our c circumcision amen it's God's sharp knife amen it separates and cuts off the surplus of the Flesh of the world from us amen so if you are wrestling with something let God do an operation lay on his operating table amen take him at his word say God take this thing from me I don't want it no more you see the problem is people love sin because of sin nature we're born with you got to hate you got to hate sin for it to be taken from you amen it's like people you know you the devil the devil you know the Devil Makes people love their old life or love what they currently stuck in and because there's an a spiritual attachment to it of an emotion you can't get free but when you really see it for what it is and it takes God to really open our eyes you know if you went to Saul before he became Paul before the road to Damascus and you said you're a blind man oh boy you have no promise with God the blood of bulls and goats don't work anymore you're worshiping a false idea of a denomination you're just with Creeds and dogmas he would call you a crazy man oh yeah if if if you really said you're in sin Saul you're actually up to hear in religious sin you need Deliverance he would think you're a Madman wouldn't C you agree with me amen but you see but when God opened his eyes and he saw what it was really he saw phariseeism for what it was he counted it all but D he threw he gladly traded off you know gladly got rid of it and it's the same thing with you and I when God opens our eyes and we see sin for what it is we see religion for what it is am mean we see the things of the world for what they really are we say Lord take it from me as fast as you can I I want no part in it amen I'm glad I got some amens tonight amen you see you see but it takes the Lord to open our eyes that's why it's so important to have an atmosphere of Faith amen amen have a loving atmosphere love the Lord with all your heart let him come on the scene let him change your thinking I mean because humanly you know we could have a testimony meeting right now and every testimony that comes we get and you'd say I don't know how I was going to get out of this who's had those kind of situations you're like I don't know how are you going to come on the scene it's human reasoning there trying to grip a person but then you say Lord I commit it to you and somehow God comes changes your thinking reveals the promise of his word to you and and and he gets you out of it you don't necessarily know how he did it but he did it right amen so Lord praise the Lord amen so it was a sign to Abraham I was going to read this now Abraham the promises made to Abraham has seed after him now God gave this promise to Abraham and his seed would possess the gates of his enemy after he had tried tried Abraham tested Abraham now after testing come then Abraham had already been converted we'd call it from paganism into God and then God had give him as a sign of the Holy Ghost the circumcision then after the circumcision then came the testing time a pretty a very pretty type here of the church then after we have got saved then we are um then we are give the Seal of the promised circumcision which is not of the flesh but of the spirit and the Holy Spirit is our circumcision it's God's sharp knife separates us and cuts off the surplus of the Flesh of the world from us the word of God sharper than a two-edged sword so you see come right back in the word of God is a thing that the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit uses not Creeds not denominations but the word is what separates us from the things of the world it cuts away our ideas and things yeah am mean and holy consecrates us to God and Jesus said if you abide in me and my word in you there you are then it isn't your word it's his word then you see if you abide in me and my word in you you could could ask what you will uh-huh see what is it it's not you it's you're not speaking your own word you're speaking his word amen now we know we're in a battle okay we're just going to go for a journey tonight okay we're in a battle let's have a let have a midweek boost go home praising God okay but you know we're in a battle okay David would come to know that his God is his Rock and his Fortress and his deliverer this wasn't just something he pinned while sitting in Jerusalem with his feet up on a couch he really experienced God being his deliverer he went through some real tight spaces he had some real difficult times you know of of when maybe he thought this was going to be his last moment upon the Earth but remember if I put it in uh the Apostle Paul's words there from Philippians but he he he was of the circumcision he had a covenant God made a covenant with him I mean just like God has made a covenant with you and I so David was given a covenant by God by the anointing of a Vindicated Prophet that he was going to be king of Israel right so he realized that God was going to get him to the throne when how what age don't know he didn't know but God he had complete confidence that God was going to get him there now he came to a spot in his life when he Sor I'm just trying to find that scripture again where the Lord where he realized because of experience that the Lord was his Rock and his Fortress and his deliverer am mean the god of my rock in him will I trust he is my shield and the Horn of my salvation my high tower and my refuge My Savior thou saveth me from violence I'll call on the Lord who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from my enemies amen so good you can keep reading the whole chapter it's very powerful I don't have it all there but you see now we have we have a shelter today now where I really got all this from as I was talking I was talking with Christine and we're talking about people people sayings and people you know and you know I've experienced this too you have a wonderful time in the Lord then you expect the devil to come and attack you but we're not playing a game of punch for punch with the devil have you ever seen that I'm sure you Brothers may be seen it on YouTube you two guys will stand there and they'll slap each other off you know they'll they'll have a turn one guy will slap him then he'll take the blow of the other guy what a stupid thing to do okay it's foolishness but I don't want to sting you but it's pretty foolish to do the same thing with the devil am mean to to you have a glorious time breakthrough and prayer wonderful time in the word you have a great time in church or camp or something and then well I guess I'm going to have a trial now and you know the devil's going to come at me yeah sure he probably will but do you have to take it see shamgar came to a point in his life realized I don't have to take the devil's slaps no more I don't have to put up with him coming season after season Harvest after harvest taking all my blessings away he realized this is not how this works I mean humanly you know before the Lord opened his eyes to it he realized well this is how it works you know humanly but then he realized no I'm a circumcised son of Abraham living in my inheritance I have every right to enjoy the blessings of God I have every right to enjoy the Harvest God has given me I have it's a god-given right God gave me the ground God gave me the ground God gave me the word amen he's given me Bountiful blessings to you a mountain of bread to enjoy Amen to to sustain me spiritually so he realized no I'm not going to take the devil's slaps no more but I'm going to kill this I'm going to kill these Philistines you know maybe the Philistines knew him on first name basis maybe he knew them on first name basis like some of us will know you know guilt and shame and resentment and anger and you know unforgiveness and buness and all these things we can know these Devils on first a basis but there's got to come a time in your life where you realize I don't have to take his blows no more amen but I can down everyone that comes against me I can it's been placed in your power to break the cycle of the devil amen because remember Shamar God wasn't going to come down without Shamar first stepping on the word of God stepping on his god-given promise remember you let the word of God put it put the word first yeah take him at his word first and then watch God come down and anoint that word in your life amen so he realized this game of slapping is going to end amen that's it come on what happened next season they didn't come back they were dead amen it was one big saw 600 men that's quite a battle against one but hey Shamar was the majority CU he was a what a child of the circumcision God made a covenant with him you're a son of Abraham I placed you in your Promised Land your forbears did not bring themselves here I brought them here I mean I birthed you into this land and this is where you belong and it's the same thing with you and I friends I trust you realize God's made a covenant with you that you'd be the head and not the tail amen you wouldn't be the devil's Whipping Boy am mean you wouldn't be his his his Target board or whatever you want to call it no you are the head and he is the tail am mean God has given you Authority by his word am mean to stand on the neck of the enemy amen this is what we have so so you know we shouldn't have the slap for a slap game with the devil amen amen we don't have to put up with his nonsense amen he comes he comes into your life comes into your children's life you just let it happen you shouldn't you plead the blood amen plead the blood say Lord you made a covenant with me that day on Calvary Lord I plead your blood amen your blood is the greatest barrier there can ever be amen it's the strength it's our it's our it's our defense amen you can plead the blood and you because God is waiting for you amen he does hasn't made you a robot right right he's put you on free moral agency and I think I'm just going to use my free moral agency to speak the word of God in faith believing he will fulfill it I me believing my God can come on the scene and can rearrange the whole picture I mean that I don't have to put up with the devil and go through how many people here have been a virus or sickness has come into your body you asked for prayer or pray you've been healed amen that is a perfect example of God interrupting the devil's plan amen because normally sickness it's got to work out a certain length of time based on your immune system and age and how bad it is sure but there's a time scale right that it has to work through but then what did you do you took God at his word you took God at his word you asked in faith you got prayer you believed however anointed of the world maybe you prayed yourself soone prayed for you and God interrupted the devil's plan am Hallelujah but what did you do you took God at his word amen you take that example for everything the Devil comes into your life amen he comes in a mind battle do you just let it go on a hamster wheel and let the volume turn up and turn up or do you say no Satan amen business hours are closed call someone else use someone else as a trash can don't don't use my mind I'm not no I'm not here for you devil my mind see sure the prophet said this is no man's land but if you look at World War I no man's land became occupied land hallelujah amen it was it may have been no man's land for a lot of time but eventually you know the Western Powers they drove the uh Germans and that whatever austral Hungary whoever it became occupied right so sometimes this can be no man's land a lot but there but there's got to come a time when it's God's land it's Emmanuel's ground amen where it's fortified by the Holy Ghost it's fortified by God's word where the things that once bother you don't bother you no more he say but they're being still bothering me hey World War I came to an end yeah are they still there in their trenches no right it's done right World War II done this Ukraine war it'll come to an end eventually somehow well the Millennium is going to be a thousand years of Peace A War's going to come to an end I'm not trying to be silly but I just want you to realize every war comes to an end it's not a Perpetual thing even this war between God and Satan Satan goes into the Lake of Fire we keep dancing around the throne eternally Hallelujah and he's not even an afterthought we just rejoice in the god of our Salvation so that war will come to an end amen this war against this flesh will come to an end when these bodies are changed amen so every war comes to an end amen so don't think you got to put up with the devil forever because no I read the end of the book there's a time when he's gone amen right so why not let the word of God take preeminence and let God take over that battle amen I think that's what we going to do amen because we have a safety zone and that SA zone is not a bomb shelter praise God Amen our protection is made out of feathers it's not reinforced concrete it's not steel plating it's not something like that with electronic warfare and anti- drone stuff no it's made out of feathers amen but it's the shadow of the almighty under his feathers is where we've come to find a place of Refuge amen it's far stronger than any any anything the devil can the devil can't blow it to Pieces that's right amen who's who who come under the shadow of his wings who's come to trust under the shadow of his wings amen trust is built because a relationship has developed amen so I trust that you have you have come to trust to hide under the shadow of his wings amen when Trouble Comes your way you're not trying to work it out yourself what do you do you go under the Shad of his wings under his word say Lord help me in this time of trouble guide me through these decisions during this time of insecurity show me my identity Lord what are you doing you're coming under the shadow of his wings praise the Lord that's the best place to be amen it's our safety zone Hallelujah see this is why we've got to trust him see amen see brother B says this and we feel like we're going through a great time of distress and trials perplexity of the time distress between the Nations and all kinds of things happening and sometimes I get engulfed like everywhere I look it's like a ship out on the sea I've been sailing a b being young I was in this in poverty band gbon over like 3 m swells some sometime you you can't see around you all you see is water you can't see land you can't see where even you're sailing to you just see you're at the bottom of the swell and all you see is swell but you know you get to the top you see where you're going I mean but sometimes life is like that all you see is storms and confusion and trouble all around you but you got to realize who's in the boat with you because this was the prophet even saying it feels like you get you know sometimes I get I I I get engulfed like says even a prophet saying this cuz he human too man of like passions like you and I everywhere I look it's like a ship on the sea I've been and I've um give charge of the boat how are we going to make it and here comes one with a white cap 100 times bigger than my ship but we'll Crest them everyone amen we are more than Victors through him the captain the chief Captain has got a hold of the string on the end of the ship and he'll pull it through we'll Crest everyone Hallelujah I trust you feel that way amen that doesn't take away the storm doesn't take away the problem but hey there's a chief captain amen who's got a string in glory and it's tied to your heart he's going to pull you all the way through Hallelujah so we can trust in him in every every circumstance amen this is why they it says here we of the circumcision which worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus amen this is this should cause a rejoicing amen where we think about where he's brought us through and where he's going to take us it should make us rejoice amen because our God is on the throne now praise the Lord just trying to find where I am amen so amen God made a covenant with us the Apostle Paul tells to put on the whole armor of God Amen that you may be able to withstand in the evil day this is the evil day the Apostle Paul sure was speaking of the Christian walk then but he's Al especially speaking about it in the evil day which is today you got to put on the whole armor of God now we know that the whole armor of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost our arm is on the inside amen it's not saying a bunch of prayers I put on the helmet of Faith salvation and different no no it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen but we've got to be armored but you've got to realize that we have a shield of faith I like this how it says above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all not some this is not like a even an Israeli Iron Dome that's a percentage get through or some anti-aircraft system of manw build amen no quench all the fiery darts of the wicked amen so you got to pick up that Shield of Revelation amen when the devil's firing thoughts in your mind you got to pick up that shield and and you got to you got to take those things and make it subject to the Revelation within your heart and when the Devil Comes you away and say your children aren't going to make it no pick up that Revelation trust us you know Hallelujah we'll talk about it later but you know I'm back at work this week I walk down the stairs where the Lord promised me years ago my children of M M Hallelujah I like those stairs I walk up the multiple hey upstairs is the lunchroom so it's always a good place to walk but I came down those stairs and it came to I haven't thought about it for years where the Lord promised be on those stairs your children are yours glory amen amen so I can stand so so every well it's just been a few days but I walk down those stairs I walk up and I say thank you Lord amen it's not the spot that makes it special it's the promise that makes it special but it's nice to go you know go back to these places and remember those things and the best place to go is not a stairs but go into the word amen and look at the promises God has given you am mean if God has quickened any promise to your life amen go and read it again go listen to it again it will encourage you it will strengthen you'll stabilize your walk because you begin to realize the one who called you is not going to lose you amen the one who the one who saved you from death and sorrow is going to preserve you and keep you amen but he says you've got to you got to pick up the shield take the shield of Faith don't take the devil's blows you don't need to that's why we got armor amen we don't have to put up with this nonsense you can you have authority Amen to deal with him amen you say well we're going to he's going to be punching at us every day yeah but you can bypass them punches and you can punch him back why just why just give them a tap on the chin and say do you like that no knock them out amen don't let them get back up see sometimes people just get a little bit of a blessing they think now the devil's down no no no press all the way in press all the way in and and when he's knocked on the ground stomp on him a little bit brother Ram said when he had the vision of the mumber he bound it in the name of Jesus Christ it turned into glass the life went out he said I mashed on it a little bit that's right amen so that's what we should do with the devil how do you masch on the devil give God praise amen really the Thunder that shakes the kingdom of hell is a Sanctified sold out life full of the love of God that's what shakes the kingdom of Hell amen so we shouldn't get up and say oh I hate you devil I no no just love the Lord am just Praise Him amen but we we have been given the armor to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked amen praise the Lord he was good with the sword speaking of Peter that but but he could Jewel the Creed just as good as anyone could that was in the garden but he when it come to spiritual courage he didn't have it so he failed right there now why he only knowed one thing as Creed but brother after he went up to Pentecost he put on the whole armor of God now watch him he's a different person now he put on the whole armor what was it that word that he had walked with was in him burning him up with fire in his flesh and soul he had the whole armor of God on that's God's provided armor he had the baptism filled with the Holy Ghost what is it God makes himself ever presentent in his own Army God on the day of Pentecost sent down the full armor of God for his army that was himself among you amen I mean so if God has filled you with the Holy Ghost your experience can be different we all have a different testimony but if he's turned your heart to have genuine faith in the word and you see it living in your life he all you want is him you got the whole armor of God if you had the if you got the true Bap baptism of the Holy Ghost because you got to realize now where it says that they rejoice in Christ Jesus now we know Jesus Christ is his word right more than just a nice picture of a uh forgive me if this sounds wrong but it's more than just getting emotionally caught up in a picture of a man dying on a cross that's right because because many people get very emotional they see The Passion of the Christ they cry Rivers right but then when it comes to surrendering themselves to the word they won't do it that's right so they have a emotional idea of a of a man but they won't submit themselves to the word of God and that's Paramount because Jesus is his word and that's why the True Believer rejoices in the word I mean they put their exper they put their present State way on the back burner and they take God at his word above all things and they let that word change them amen why because they love him but you see we've got to put the word first amen now Joshua would tell the children of Israel that are just about to cross Jordan and and he instructs the ark to go before them and he says yet there shall be a space between you and it that's the Ark of the Covenant about 2,000 cubits by measure come not near unto it that ye may know the way which ye must go for ye have not passed this way here to for they walking in a new season they had been 40 years in the wilderness they had gone round the mountain and round the mountain and had the same old experiences but this was a new season where they were going to cross into their inheritances amen where where the whole purpose of Moses coming to deliver them out of Egypt was going to be fulfilled but so he's saying we haven't passed this way before this is a new walk amen we're walking into our land of promise sure our forefathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob they lived in this land but we've never been in this land we've never dwelt in this land sure Joshua and Caleb they went in there as spies to spied out but now they were going to go dwell in it and so Joshua was instructing them keep the word before you because we've never gone this way before and I'll say it's the same thing in this day there's never been a time when a body of people around the earth have walked from this world to the next world there's never been a mass Rapture like there's going to be in this season and me this world's going to a Great Tribulation the world has never gone into a Great Tribulation before it's going to be burnt with fire and armag again and all different things this has never happened before I mean it's never been a day like this day where all these millions of demons been released out of the bottomless pit like has happened in this day this is a different season that's why it's so important keep the word before you let the word go first Amen to put the word before your thoughts whatever you do amen put it before your worries amen you say I'm scared what's going to happen in the future well I know between well I don't know what's going to happen between here and Glory but we're going to glory amen amen but so but put the word before your worries am mean take the word above your worries cuz worry has helped no one faith has delivered faith has brought Resurrection faith has brought healing and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the promises of God but worry has not done anything amen put the word before your imaginations this is a world where people have caught up in the imagination of their mind where the world has built aot people are living in lives of different entertainments and gaming and music and movies and things fantasy world has it ever been a day in the history of man where people you know it used to be when I was a kid people who loved that kind of stuff they were nerds and made fun of now everyone's a nerd but they live in this fantasy world they make cosplay and they're dressed like their favorite Heroes and all these things and you know why why put on a fantasy Persona when you can put on the whole armor of God and know God in his reality amen people love superheroes I tell you if you're a man or woman of Faith you are a hero am mean you're a hero of Faith you do things the world knows nothing about amen so why why get caught up in those things and we can be caught up with the promises of God so put the word before your imaginations put it before your fears put God first and everything and you'll be successful in spite of all the devil can try and do to you that's what brother Braham said amen so the so as soon as the priests put their feet in the Jordan and begin toart and they crossed over and it's so important that we keep the word before us we never we never forget the word amen we let him always lead us praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah amen because if he put the word first you'll have a Victory Day am mean notice now this and this when Joshua took the word first and put the word first he crossed God had told him I as I was with Moses so I'll be with you I'll not fail you I'll be with you no man is going to stand before you all the days of your life I'm going to be right there don't fear what's going to take place I'll be right there then what with a commission like that what could Joshua do but put the word first amen there you are with a commission from God put the word first and it brought a vday or a Victory Day have we not been commissioned to be the final voice to the final age amen a living voice for the word is put on flesh amen you are a lived voice amen your your life should be preaching wherever you go your life your conduct how you dress the how the way you act people that's a sermon I don't know if you realize it but you're preaching from from when you're awake to when you're asleep to when you're awake your life is preaching a sermon amen amen why it's the life it's it's the word on display amen but has he not commissioned us to take the word and preach it to Every Creature this gospel amen these signs shall follow them that believe the last Commission of the church has he not commissioned us to do it amen so if we've been given this commission which we have we put the word first it'll bring a victory day that's right Hallelujah it won't bring an Armistice Day or a day of peace or I mean I mean a Day of Defeat or you know signing surrender documents and capitulation no it'll bring a victory day and and we know in great Wars there's times where it seems like the one who eventually wins is going to lose but it's those who really stand firm and say no I see victory in sight we won't surrender we won't back up we will have the victory I mean you just listen to Winston Churchill sometime where he said a famous speech in in in the midst of World War II he just said never give up amen never give up never give up never give up that was a speech amen hallelujah a man of a incredible vocabulary D's speech he didn't say it just to fill in time he meant it with everything within him he embodied the British resistance of Hitler and the axis forces the thing is he released those kind of sentiments and what happened they were they had a vday amen amen in times when it looked like they were totally defeated that were going to lose the Nazis just needed to cross the channel and it was going to be all over they stood firm now how much more when it seems like All Is Lost and you don't know how God's ever going to come on the scene who's ever been in that way but yet you say no I'm going to have vict ictory cuz God has given me a promise and I'm not looking at what I see right now I'm looking to the end I'm looking to his promise Above All Things amen then you'll have a victory day you put the word first amen if if the word says you're more than a conqueror I'd put that first amen if God yeah if the word says I can do all things through Christ Jesus it strengthens me he's my strength amen if it says that he's my sustainer my healer my keeper My Redeemer my Fortress amen he's my way maker my shepherd my protector amen amen you put that first don't put your Humanity first put the word first amen amen let God be God Amen Mary had to believe for the impossibilities but God takes the impossibilities and makes them real when he's took it his word I mean the doctor M said you'll never be rid of that cancer the doctor might have said you'll never be able to walk again well it's impossible for you to do it but impossibilities Fade Out when God took it his word no matter what the doctor says he's doing the best he can but God is God Amen and his word is just like he is oh yes amen we think God is this Majestic all powerful allmighty Supreme one his word is as he is cuz he is his word amen and you take his word that settles it forever if thou canest believe and say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart it will uh but will believe that what you've said will come to pass you can have what you've said God took at his word I love that message Jehovah of Miracles he's still the same one today amen we know that he is his word amen the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God Amen his word pardon me is the most important thing amen God never places signs ahead of his word they were added for proof of the word but the word is first to prove it Elijah said to the woman bake me a cake first then watch the miracle happen come to the word first and then watch the miracle the seed word itself is what the Holy Ghost energizes so if you want the Holy Ghost to energize your faith take God at his word receive his word in faith and say Lord I believe it I don't know how you're going to do it but you're going to do it see he's the one who fulfills his word am you just got to have a believing heart say Lord I take hurt your word then what happens then God will energize the Holy Spirit Will energize that word and cause it to come to pass listen everyone had Faith to come to church tonight and even those who are streaming they believe right that's why you're here that's that faith is enough for the promises of God to be fulfilled cuz I feel sometimes people look at me like there's no way I could ever SE God fulfill things in their life because I don't have no faith that's the devil talking to you you say I don't have no faith you say God help my unbelief I believe just like the man with the son with the eptic spirit right but if we have enough Faith to come to church we have no faith to believe the Bible and pray don't you think God can do the rest of it amen if we take God at his word yes sir amen because because we must understand that our five senses are not made to contact god brother R said the five senses are not made to contact God but faith is made to contact God prise the Lord amen so we must not let our senses rule us I remember when Christine and I were in um in um what do you call it Christ Church there in the first earthquake place was shaking violently up and down we were praying by our front door and I wanted to keep my eyes open and look around what's happening but I said no I'm going to pray see I could have let My Five Senses rule but no watching the play Shake isn't going to help me that's right amen asking the Lord to help us is really the only thing because that that place could have fallen over if it wanted whatever but what watching your building disintegrate will that help you no but praying asking the Lord to help you helps you rightall so I'm saying is My Five Senses wanted to keep my eyes open and look what's going on I said no I'm going to close my eyes and pray and God came down we had a glorious time didn't we we a wonderful prayer meeting amen so many times our five senses want to rule us but let's let Faith rule us us let's Let God In Action amen let him come on the scene because we contact God by faith The Sixth Sense amen these five senses control this body but the six sense is Faith hallelujah amen so you see the thing is if we realize if I can just see the Apostle Paul said that we are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh amen and if there's ever been a day where we can worship God in the spirit is today am mean if there's ever been a day we can rejoice in Christ Jesus the word is today amen when when when um John saw the book open by being taken by the lamb and opened they said everything in heaven and the Earth under the Earth heard and rejoice am mean if we can if we you know if there's a people that can Rejoice it's us and if there's a people that can have no conf confidence in the flesh but full confidence in God it is US amen we can look at every Miracle every testimony every time God has come on the scene and we can now have full confidence in God because of everything he's done and when you think about it we're not like Gideon threshing wheat in secret saying where's where's the god of Miracles if God be with us where are his miracles see we're not in that condition we actually know God is with us and we see his miracles I mean we see his Supernatural power move am mean so we can have full confidence in God because if you think about it we don't worship man's ideas we haven't gone to a Bible school and they've got a academic board and saying this is the word and this is how it should be we don't have that we have thus sayith the Lord that's been supernaturally Vindicated amen so so we can have full confidence in the Lord and have no confidence in the flesh praise the Lord but you see the devil and and I'm just going to wind up with this but you see the devil want wants us to have confidence in the flesh see this this age we live in is very much the me I what I can do kind of an age but there's a people in the land who have no confidence in the flesh they realize like Jesus said I'm the vine and you're the branches amen so so those who are the branches bear the fruit but it's the life and the vine comes into you and produces the fruit where Jesus said uh without me you can do nothing we realize that yes praise God but with him we can do all things but we have no confidence in our own ability but you see I wanted to do this ages ago and maybe I'll take a sermon and do it later but you know you take the four uh first four seals you can actually make it personal how the Devil comes in to bring death into someone's life but you see the third seal the third seal here it says I heard the third Beast say come and see him and I beheld in L Black Horse and he had that sat on him appear of balances in his hand and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the fourbe say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of a barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine now in this here sorry I don't have it on the slides but you see what this is is this is when during the time of Martin Lutheran before that the church was charging money for prayer charging money for salvation charging for the things of life so what is it now man with trust in their own ability I can make the money I can get my now we don't believe in purgatory but they did but you know I if I give enough money I can actually prepay for sin yeah this is what they believed in you you give a certain amount of money I can rob that guy I can kill that person but I've already paid for the sin with my money therefore it's okay so what is that it's come into the it came into the church it's man's ability gets them favor with God right because if you have the money then you get favor with God and he'll forgive you of the sin and that comes right down into this day when man gets in his mind it's my ability makes me earn favor with God right amen this is true isn't it you see people who legalistic you know way out of balance in the word and everything they think of their extra what they call Holy with by human effort what they have gained favor with God and God's going to bless them this is this horse rider riding it comes right down into this age amen but you see there was a voice from the throne saying touch ye not the oil and the wine amen so there's a people in the land who are not depending on their human ability they have no confidence in the flesh amen that's what we read in Philippians was it not am me so there's a people that have no confidence in the flesh but they have full confidence in God I me it's where it says the voice from the midst of the four beasts that's a voice from the Throne of God saying do not touch the oil and the wine amen so Satan you can't you can't hinder the the oil which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the wine is a stimulation by Revelation am amen so there's a people in the land amen who are rejoicing in the anointing amen of the word and they're stimulated by the revelation of it what does that mean that we now rejoice in Christ Jesus am mean if there's ever been a people on the Earth that are drunk with the spirit I believe it is this age I mean why because it's not just a little drink and a little Tipple here and there and a tasting no the whole wine press of God is open the whole Winery is open have you H to say it we can get drunk brother and say man can be so drunk on the Holy Ghost every day of his life until he leaves this world Hallelujah we can be this way amen we're actually who's it well I'm sure you've seen a drunk person who's seen a happy drunk before I've been a happy drunk before their life can be absolute misery but they're happy why because intoxication makes them be desensitized by what's G on now being drunk on the Holy Ghost doesn't desensitize you to what's going on it actually brings your life into perspective yes amen amen natural drinking takes everyone out of perspective they can't drive they can't walk they can't talk they can't do anything normally because their senses are actually DED but this Holy Ghost and wine does the opposite amen we can see life really for what it is I'm on my way to heaven shouting Victory amen my trials aren't actually that bad Hallelujah why cuz God's on the throne amen he's in charge this is not the end this is not the end of my problem God's going to come on the scene how I don't know but I'm drinking Hallelujah I'm just happy being a happy drunk why cuz God's anointed me my cup for joy as David would say Amen so we can be so if you're so if you're feeling trouble in your trouble in your life just open the liquor cabinet I don't mean to be silly but just just just have a good drink amen have a good drink amen listen to the message and have a good drink say I'm all twisted up and who's ever felt so twisted up in trouble then you hear some real good music oh yeah you hear that you or you you hear a message you hear a testimony you open your Bible and all that trouble just kind of melts away amen what's happening you're drinking Hallelujah you're getting stimulated the problem may still be there but you're feeling real good amen what's happening God is pouring into you stimulation by revelation God is saying hey this ain't over hallelujah amen this is not the end actually everything's going to be okay hallelujah amen amen so don't let the devil get in your mind you've got to earn things with God yeah no hear that voice from the throne amen the oil's freely available amen the message releases the Holy Ghost upon the people amen you can be drunk you can enjoy the Lord amen amen you can enjoy good preaching you can enjoy good singing you can be drunk by yourself amen hallel amen I won't go there but you know naturally but you know you can be drunk by yourself you can be happy Oh Happy Day CU Jesus washed all my sins away amen if you've never been drunk on the spirit I highly recommend it amen you ever get drunk on the spirit you realize natural drinking is is just a cheap cheap cheap imitation to the because the devil only perverts what God already has so why why go for the copy when you can have the real amen and you can be drunk and there's no hung over you like praise God I want more hallelujah amen amen this is why we can rejoice in Christ Jesus amen and have no confidence in the flesh am me why cuz our full confidence is in him amen and we see if you're clouded over tonight just say Lord break it now may I be able to see things for what they really are Lord may I not just be looking at this trial the things that's in front of me this big mountain this big giant no look to the promises of God take God at his word get drunk on the spirit a bit be happy Amen Let Him change your perspective let's have the musicians please I feel like I'm just going on but you know we can have full confidence tonight in the ability of the of the Lord and we can rejoice in Christ Jesus like never before amen so let's just we'll just finish that there and amen Let's Just Praise the Lord tonight amen aren't you glad that we can we can Rejoice amen we can praise God maybe we'll pick it up another time amen amen I want to sing these songs that brother Marion had am mean let's sing praise him praise him praise him in the morning praise him in the in the noon time amen amen we have a right to praise God the devil says shut up your problems are too big I said no shut up devil I'm going to praise God Amen you have no right to stop my praise you have no right to keep me down amen you see we have a right just like shamgar did I can end this battle am how about you tonight you can end the battle you can you can take God at his word you can let God reveal to you who you really are already remember shamgar did not become an overcoming Victorious circumcised son of Abraham living in the promised land because he realized it no he was that that's
