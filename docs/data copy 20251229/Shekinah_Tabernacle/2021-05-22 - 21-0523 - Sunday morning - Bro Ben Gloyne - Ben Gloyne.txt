you um we have lunch next door as well um directly after service as well and then let's go to psalms 127 if the slideshow's there good to have everyone here kerry good to see you god bless you good to see you my friend amen amen um psalms 127. amen um we're just going to read the whole psalm then we're going to go to romans 8. it says accept the lord build the house so i see this working except the lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain it is vain for you to rise up early to sit up late to eat the bread of sorrows for so he giveth his beloved sleep so it's vain to get up early and start playing and eat the bread of sorrows you're nothing wrong with getting up early or even staying up late if you're a night owl but eat the bread of sorrows is the problem lo children are in heritage of the lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are children of the youth happy is the man that had this quiver full of them they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate now we're going to go to uh romans 8 and um we're going to go to 18. this it's either child proof i know is it working okay good it's working uh romans 8 and 18 just a bit of a context um i trust this all comes together um romans 8 and 18 for i reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature we know that word creature means the creation waiteth for the manifestation which is the revealing of the sons of god for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth and pained together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body hallelujah amen let's um if you have a prayer request this morning you just want to raise your hand to the lord we have a few if brother dan reed and his son matthew who are lost in the bush inland from brisbane they've been lost from overnight and my work colleague eleanor uh unexpectedly her husband passed away on thursday night they were married 44 years so it's a big loss in the family i want to pray for little name

jesus we just want to submit ourselves under your divine hand may your anoint speaker and hear it one more time we thank you in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning i'd like to speak this morning on the revealing of suns now when i speak about sun's being revealed i'm talking about this is not just the male side of the you know this is sons and daughters but a sun is a position and so now we read here in in um in romans and and the scripture in uh psalms it will it will become more apparent uh later but you know we read in the scripture where the apostle paul was looking forward in time where there will come a time where there will be the manifestation of the sons of god where the whole of nature is groaning and travail until this happens and when the sons of god are revealed then then all of creation will be liberated under under the curse of sin because just as man fell under the curse of sin the whole of nature's fallen as well and we can see that this travail is going on now this is why nature is falling apart this earth is going through birth pains amen and so there's a struggle going on nature is groaning it's it's it's waiting for a people to come to their god-given position it's waiting for a people to be revealed in the end time now i just want to um start from the beginning you know we are already sons and daughters of god the scripture tells us and we'll get to it that we are now sons and daughters of god right but there has to be something on the inside inside of us that comes out now you know i have slides but i'm just i just feel bad at putting trying to put notes together but can we go back to the sorry yeah someone needs you lord come by here amen i need him this morning amen but we read here how how you know an arrow so i just put this here because many times we think of this as just as natural children but i want to take it a bit of a if you give me a liberty this morning i want to talk about god's children you take about arrows you know a weapon is the potency of a weapon is only manifested when it's put into use you can have the greatest gun in the world it can be it can be deadly accurate you know it can shoot a certain distance it can whatever more take out of whatever target but it's only when it's fired and the bullet hits the target you see that gun actually works otherwise it's just a piece of decoration just a showpiece you know you don't know the potency of it it can look all very dangerous and powerful but when it's put into use that's when you see its power now it's the same thing with the sons and daughters of god you know we were attributes in the mind of god before the foundation of the world god had attributes in himself that he wanted to express and the power of those attributes is only manifested when they're put in flesh amen where where god would god would prophesy of a people that would you know down through the ages his children have been upon the earth and when they have come into manifestation the power that's in them is revealed you take moses moses was moses was i'd say an arrow in the quiver you know god's quiver and god fired him into the earth and and there was a certain path his life had to take but it had to reach a target and that target was to manifest the prophecy that was allotted to him he was prophesied when abraham was told by god your seed is going to sojourn in a strange land 400 years but i'm going to bring them out with a mighty hand they're going to be afflicted i'm going to bring them out with a mighty hand when god was telling that to abraham god had had in his mind moses was going to be the one that god was going to use to bring them out with the mighty hand right so he was an attribute in god's mind but when he was put in flesh and time and he was commissioned he was anointed he was sent forth then the power that was in that prophet was manifested the power that was in that attribute of that son of god when he went to you know he said let flies come or let frogs come or you know raise his staff or aaron did a certain thing though now nile turned to blood plagues were poured out on egypt you know your deliverance came the red sea was parted mighty things happen that was the power of that attribute of that son of god amen right so you know it's more than just when i talk about arrows in the you know hand over as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are the children of the youth happy is the man that had the quiver full of them you know we're not we're not decoration because it's easy to talk about history but i want to talk about you right now we're not decoration we're not on a mantelpiece we don't have some plaque next to us explaining some historical event that we're in no but no but we are putting god's fired us into this age and we have a target we're going to hit hallelujah and we're built to hit that target we're built to pass through any obstacle where you know our our flight path may be a bit wavy but it will hit its target who's ever fired who's ever taken a coke bottle and made a made a water uh water rocket who's ever done that that's funny but what happens when you try and put fins on it who's tried to put fins on the rocket you know if those fins aren't balanced then you see the rocket will fly like this so it's yo yo it's trajectory will look all crazy now it's the same thing with you and i if our life is not balanced in the word of god if our emotions are not balanced then our flight path can be like this we're still on target we're gonna get there right but our life can be all like this you know but but but if our emotions our spirit is balanced what if our walk is balanced in the word doesn't matter what crosswind comes our way we're going to go through amen hallelujah so we are now see so here now jesus said all that the father has given me shall come so he had a certain number now if you see us staying on my back well william just left his calling card this morning so you know that's too hot to hold that carrot you know and so you know so he says all that the father has given me will come so he has a predestinated amount of people that has already been given to him and said they're going to come to me hallelujah so when jesus died on calvary he didn't die in a haphazard way thinking maybe someone will feel sympathy for me and they'll give their lives and follow me no when he was on the cross you're on his mind i mean he went with you on his mind he knew i've got attributes i must redeem i mean i've got to wash them in my blood hallelujah that that when they come to the earth now when i talk about arrows and the you know god's quiver i'm not talking about the outside appearance you can take missiles you know you take you take modern weapons they can look real small but they can blow up cities so they cannot look very intimidating but when they go boom it's the inside when it goes boom you know when the explosion happens the chain reaction happens that's when oh boy that's a potent thing you know so it's the same thing with you and i'm not talking about the flesh man this guy will disappoint us he will rob us of victory he will make all you know brother man says we have a sticky nature that we still have even after the new birth and so i'm not talking about this guy i'm talking about the gene seed of god on the inside of the inside of us i mean she says all that the father has given me shall come to me and all that and him that cometh to me i'll know why it's cast out how this is no excuse you say well i don't know if i'm one of his if you go to him he won't cast you out hallelujah for i come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the father's will which hath sent me that all which he hath given me i should i should lose nothing hallelujah he's talking about me in that verse he's not going to lose nothing and i'm part of nothing is something hallelujah you know he's not going to lose me amen but should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone that seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i'll raise him up at the last day now when he says when he saith the son he's talking about present tense seeing he's the present god not just looking at a historical god but the present god when you see that god manifest himself see the sun manifested and believe on that what god is doing in your hour amen now we're we are seated if we just now the book of ephesians tells us our position in christ it's a very powerful book just as joshua placed the israelites in the land in the old testament so paul and the inspiration the holy ghost places this is the believer believe his position in christ and now notice this now it's not us trying to sit in heavenly places in our own ability he says and he hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus this is god's doing he says i've got a position for you i'm going to make you sit there and that position is far above all devil demon power all unbelief trouble humanity whatever it may be that's we are seated in heavenly places in christ jesus he has made us has raised us up together so it's not in the future he says right now you say well i'm still on terra firma no this is your spiritual business position in christ but we're going to operate from that position we we're not here to operate from a position of carnality and reasoning and argument whatever more no we are ordained to sit in a position in heavenly place in christ jesus we're to operate in that position what is that walking according to the word that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness towards us through christ jesus amen now john says very clearly here behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the chilled sons of god sorry therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now we are the sons of god so i'm not talking about a future event right now everyone say right now i'm a child of god hallelujah i mean so right now we are the sons of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for he we shall see him as he is now we understand in this end time the prophet's ministry was to declare he is here right that's what he says my ministry brother braham said is to declare jesus christ is here that all he was in the days of his earthly ministry he is the same today but his corporal body is still up in glory but the same god is present upon the earth that's why you know we'll people didn't stand wheelchairs i mean cancers were healed you know demons were cast out people received the holy ghost revival fires were lit on every hill on every you know around the world people saw that jesus christ is not a man of history but he's alive today and his word came open the word came open in this hour to reveal who we are in the book hallelujah now if you know who you are in the book if god reveals if this word comes open you know we have a lot of catchphrases the seals have come open the books come open it can just become jargon but the whole purpose of god taking the book taking this and making it is no longer sealed that you can actually see clearly what it means and what it says that's the book coming open now there's a purpose of that coming open is that you will see where you're going to hit the target brother brown would dramatize when the lamb would take the book of revelations chapter five and we know john was caught up into the eternities and he saw that you know the book was sealed up on the right hand of the original owner you know and he whipped much because he saw no one was found worthy to take the book but then one of the elders came and said weep not john for the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed but when he looked he saw a lamb coming because you know the reason he is called a lion is because he's a judge he's a king he's going to rule the earth with a rod of iron that's one attribute he has but he's not just all all lion he's not all judgment he's also a lamb hallelujah so he's also he's a lamb he's a lion he's many different things but to john he was a lamb so he wasn't some angry god that's going to pour his wrath out upon john no that was not john's relationship with the lord jesus no his relationship was this is my sacrifice this is my husband this is my mediator this is my intercessor this is my this is my lamb this is my all in all and here he comes walking forth to claim the book and then brother brahm says now when the when the book came open and it says that all heaven yes so john went from weeping to rejoicing he said all all of heaven all in the earth under the earth heard me cry out glory blessings honor be to the lamb and strength and power and hallelujah and brother man said john got next to himself because john looked past the curtain of time and he saw john so when the seals came open to john he saw himself already in eternity even though he was upon the earth physically he saw he was already in eternity so he realized now that he's good at the target he's going to hit is he's going to end up in glory his his trajectory was going through life remember we come from god we go back to god right we don't remember coming from god but then god reveals to us who we are and him when we realize i came from him that's why i've given my life to him i've become a believer and now i'm going to go back to him i mean so the seals came off the book john got real happy because he saw john on the other he saw himself already overcome already already overcome the devil hell all all trials and trouble you think about where john was standing right there on the earth he was in prison on the isle of patmos right so that he was a man in prison going through hardship but yet he could rejoice because he saw himself over the curtain of time he saw he had overcome any pressure the devil could put upon him the religious systems whatever government whatever systems would try and push him down he could rejoice saying no no if i i've seen i've made it i'm going to make it hallelujah and that should be the same thing with you and i when this word comes open to you when the book comes open i trust i'm not talking i it's an experience when the word comes open to you hallelujah that should cause you to say i see myself over there hallelujah so now we have our destination assured hallelujah hallelujah amen but he says when he shall appear uh when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is now brother braham says very clearly he has appeared in these last days his spirit working among us is part of his appearing and we know the appearing merges into the coming of god right but now that's why the holy spirit moves is that that's his appearing hallelujah so the same one you think about brother man said yo that's why we have the photograph there on the front not because the prophet because the pillar of fire over his head and that's more than just a photograph god proved himself that that was him there right but that same god is still present with us today he's not a historical one he's the same jesus the same one that met paul on the road to damascus the same one that met moses should meet you right because he's the same god and so now here he is appearing among us we may not see him but we feel his presence just like a blind man who had never seen the sun he can go out there he can feel the sun rays on his skin and he can say what is that feeling what is causing this feeling on my body and someone who has eyes can look up and say blind man that's the sun that's the sunrise striking you that's why you feel this way and that's why we had a prophet come in this end time who said can't you see that light can you see he's here now everyone felt his presence but many didn't see the pillar of fire but he's declaring he but he has given prophetic eyesight to say no he's the one doing that he's the one speaking to you he's the one that's just anointed you whose hair has healed you right that's the same thing here we may never see the pillar of fire visibly but we feel his presence oh church can't we just rejoice i mean to know the one that's appearing among us amen is to change our mortal bodies it means he's appearing among us that where we shall see him we shall be like him now in order you think about our god he's a mighty conqueror that same pillar of fire cast the devil out of heaven in the beginning revelations 12 right and then now the the devil is cast out into the earth god actually pursued his enemy down to the earth hallelujah sometimes we think well the devil's just got free reign no no god's here god has been chasing his devil all the way down through time and now the devil's roaring like a like a lion or whatever because he knows he has but a short time hallelujah but the lord is appearing among us and we sh when we shall see him i mean we shall be like him if we shall see him as he is now if he's a conqueror we'll be conquerors right that same attributes in him will be in you and i so if he was an overcomer we'll overcome if uh you know you know we're built to turn down the devil's lie you know we were actually predestined to turn down the devil's life hallelujah there's a spirit that came off of god amen that was on the angels you know in heaven and they turned down the devil's line that same anointing is on you and i we're actually built to turn down this lion this time hallelujah amen that's why now we are seated together in heavenly places in christ jesus the position that christ was in and he cast out devils he is led by the holy ghost to do exactly what he said i can do nothing till the father shows me what the father shows me that i do likewise right so there's a position the believers in now this position god has put us in are we all together on this hallelujah so now if i've been put in a god ordained position i should use that position you know what would the use of it becoming the president of the united states if you're not going to use that office or any any any position in leadership because there's certain perks of the job responsibilities that come with it right so that's the same thing now this is not a job this is who we are right so you know we're actually built you know you're built to be the bride of christ you actually built no i'm not talking about your natural flesh i'm talking about the inside of the inside of you the real you hallelujah now brother and says and god of this evil age and when the entire word of god is incomplete was headed up in a body human body called jesus christ and their god made me pay for my sins in him there then he rose me raised me up with him in the resurrection and now we are seated with him with power and authority over every devil i mean so whatever is fighting you right now you actually have been given power and authority over it every means every that doesn't mean there's a group that's not included that's every devil oh if you could only believe what god has given but if you're not seated there you don't have it and if you're seated there and don't believe it and afraid to move you'll never use it but if you're seated there you will use it for your ordained to do what you do hallelujah so you're actually ordained our life's trajectory remember an arrow that's being fired this is just you know give me a bit of liberty you can say you know you just go off on things but you know you know the trajectory of our life is all different and we all have a different job we're not god doesn't make cookie cutter christians he doesn't make us all the same we have different callings and different you know things we meant to do right within the body of christ so now if we're ordained to do what we'll do then that means we're we will do what we're ordained to do right whatever that may be in life are you following me right remember we're you know we're not here haphazardly this is not like pumping up a you know a water rocket and seeing where it's going to go god knows exactly where we're going to go hallelujah so we're ordained for you for your ordained to do what you do so if you're seated there you'll use it hello hello people seated together in heavenly places in christ jesus this is not no when i'm talking about that i'm not just this is not about a sunday from about 10 till 12 or wednesday evening but no no this is every day every hour this is where you're seated hallelujah amen hallelujah we must re this is amen brother band would say in shalom 1964 now i say to the church shalom god's peace peace the very true every true hebrew which he meets another shalom in other words good morning god be with you god's peace i mean god's peace go with you it's a good morning how do you do it's breaking day church it's darkness upon the people but it's good morning to the church christ is appearing among us shalom peace hallelujah shalom you say this world is a is full of trouble it was prophesied to be full of trouble in the days of trouble you know king david would prophesy that in psalms 27 right this is an hour of trouble but to the bride it's peace shalom hallelujah now in ephesians 3 he says that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints which is the breadth and the length and the depth and the height so what he's saying is this is not just a two-dimensional kind of a walk there's a depth to it there's a breath to it there's a height you know you know there's a length you know there's a fullness of god there's a depth in the word there's a depth in our position there's a greater you know it's more than just coming in and sure we have to repent and be baptized name the lord jesus christ for remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost then after your birth into the kingdom is now now what am i what am i made to be and then god as you walk with him he unveils who you are in the scripture saying no no you're a conqueror you're not mean to be defeated no that complex has been through your family no it's going to come to an end now that generational problem whatever that spirit of lust or whatever has come down through your family lying or stubbornness or unforgiveness it's going to come to an end hallelujah because you're ordained to overcome this thing amen oh that devil is roaring around no no he's the tail you're the head amen you have power to bind them power to lose them hallelujah i didn't save you to lose you i saved you to keep you amen you're one of my attributes here it just expands out and that and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of god he says now unto him that's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us and to him be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all ages world without end amen hallelujah so there's a lot more to the christian walk than you know many people realize and so now if we're ordained if there's if this is the hour of the revealing of sons then what god is going to do is he's going to show the true potential of his children right he's not just it's not going to be theory it's going to be it's going to be practical it's going to be manifested right it's not just going to be an idea or a doctrine it's going to be it's going to put on flesh hallelujah now we'll go back to here he says here except the lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain it is it is vain for you to rise up early to sit up late to eat the bread of sorrows for so he giveth his beloved sleep now the reason i was talking about a water rocket i want to go build one again but you know the reason i was talking about a water rocket is that this bread of sorrow this word sorrow means a a sudden it means a pang a sudden sharp pain or painful emotion it means something grievous it means an idol or a labor or a sorrow now if something is a bread it means it you eat it food it becomes a diet so he's actually so the lord is saying it's vain it's actually a desolate empty thing for us to eat the bread of sorrow now this does not mean that we will not have sorrowful times in our life but it's what becomes your diet in your head what do you feed upon well you know he says it's actually a vain thing to eat the bread of sorrow so it's so it's you know bad things happen to us we're not exempt from any trial we're people too okay there's a part angel group here there's some people here there's a person here but you know so maybe i'll just talk to us but yeah um you know but we're all people the same the same troubles that happen to the world people who don't even know the law those same troubles were not exempt from it we don't get any free pass from it but it's what we do with it is is what matters and i'll say the bride of christ has the ability to overcome it not suppress it but to overcome it because remember you think about a trial or a temptation to remove the temptation out of your life does not give you overcoming power it just means you remove it but the but the bride of christ by the spirit of god has the ability to actually overcome that thing that is no longer a problem but it's a trophy in the cabinet hallelujah amen now to worship something in the bible it means to prostrate yourself to bow down or do reverence and if some if someone worships anything when they're around that object their body language will change their posture will change they'll either fall you know they will they will become very attentive right because they're around their idol you know how they talk when they you know where you know when they come to the presence of it their whole dementia will change and that's because they worship that thing now you can you can people can worship their pain of their past painful memories you know bad experiences bad conversations they can actually worship those things and now their whole demeanor will change why because they're eating those memories again we're not meant to do that friend you know an idol can appear to be a very small thing there's a temple in south america i can't remember which one i think is in the incas or one of those but the temple itself is massive but right the top of that temple is just a small wooden idol so it was actually a very small idol but they put in this very big temple there was you know as one of their gods and something can can be very small in our lives it doesn't matter how big but it can be a very big thing to us but we're not called to prostrate ourselves down to any complex or our past we're not built that way amen the devil will try and make us worship you know the devil wants to always serve us up the bread of sorrows amen he's he's a baker he wants to he wants to he wants to cook up your your past maybe put a lever in there make it make it grow look bigger than what it was turner turn a molehill into a mountain who's with me right now yeah you know he wants to take something just you know blow it up into proportions you know i mean out of proportions rather so but we're not ordained to prostrate or bow down ourselves to our past or to any complex never let those things rule you it's not our past that rules us it's our future that rules us right it's where we're going that rules us that should be our defining part of our identity i'm going to heaven where are you going i'm going up there why because the lord called me to go he's fired me from his bow and he and this is just the path i find myself in amen never let unforgiveness or resentment rule you never let that become the bread of sorrows free why because it's a vain thing has worry ever helped anyone right well what what can faith do brother i'm asked what's the point of you know believing he said well faith may deliver me but why he never helped anyone amen that's why we're instructed by the apostle paul he says though we walk in the flesh you do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations now this is this is actually this is something we're actually responsible for casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalted itself above the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ this is this is your daily job what are you doing today i'm bringing every i'm casting down imaginations every imagination that is that is that is contrary to the word of god is being cast down amen and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of god you think the devil wants us do you think he would fill our minds with imaginations of the holy ghost falling in church do you think he would fill our imaginations with supernatural healings that could take place in prophecy and people coming to the lord and he doesn't he doesn't fill our minds with those things he never will i mean he will fill our minds with negative things things that have no value that cannot help yourself or or anyone else amen so we're but you know so we're ordained to cast down imaginations you know never ever you know when it comes to thoughts we can't stop thoughts coming into our head but it's what we do with them that matters right so we must never let negative thoughts land in our in our spirits because a thought a a spirit is attached to a thought right there's always a spirit behind a thought or behind a word and so if we let negative thoughts land then a negative spirit will come in behind it it'll begin to fill our mind our imagination our reasoning our conscience our imagination our affections you know you know this you know the day we live in i was doing a um a little bit of research so your headline um caught my attention you know the use of of of you know this world we say we're so connected in this day but to connect over over social media or text or whatsapp or instagram whatever it is do you know it's actually lowers empathy in people people actually have lower levels of empathy in this day because of them of the devices they use you know there's a you know christine had a dream and i didn't ask her the details of it so i'll probably get it wrong but you know she had a she had a dream a while ago where where she saw this i think man or a girl and they were they were walking around by this big pit and this being came out of the pit and and tried to get this person's attention just like the devil right and then and when when this person walked over to talk to it this devil grabbed her and threw her into the pit and then she began to be tossed to and fro from from different devils so yeah because the devil always wants to get our ear what happens you know it begins maybe well i just feel lonely but that can take you down a very bad track and then that goes to loneliness to depression there may be suicide there may be hatred strife and then this person is being tossed to and fro from demon to demon then they tried to climb out of the pit and they thought they were there then they got dragged down again you know we need someone stronger but you see that's the problem with this world that we live in it's so easy the devil you know he's so available right unfortunately but we have one greater than him we can turn down the devil's lie hallelujah that we're not you know i was thinking if i if if a negative thought or something negative on the internet whatever catches someone's attention and a demon spirit begins to drag them down different places how much more if we really listen to god's word and instead of being dragged and tormented down into a pit we get lifted higher and higher into the heavenlies however there's not being dragged down told me there's more joy more peace more love going higher and higher in the spirit all the time hallelujah you say well does that kind of thing happen well i'll um yes but i'll yeah i'll share this so this is physical healing this is quite a few years ago this is from papua new guinea there's a sister there sarah sarah madam and she had um cervical cancer now up there the medical system is shot you don't go to a hospital to get well sadly anyway so she was she was there in the ward there was no treatment for her there she had cervical cancer she was diagnosed and then she began to have a series of dreams and the first dream was that she was um dragged down into this pit and then and then the next dream was that there are all these big powerful animals around here like the demons got worse and they tried to get into her body but she said because she was properly dressed they couldn't get in and the next dream she had she raised her hand up and a light came down took her by the hand and lifted her up out of the pit that's why we need someone stronger to come and get us it's not us trying to climb out it's god reaching down hallelujah further than we think he can reach down he lifts us up takes us up out of the pit and then the last stream she had is actually brother brown came along and prayed for her and after that she was healed she had no cancer now you work that one out i don't know but i know she doesn't have cervical cancer anymore that was about five six years ago that happened amen so you know if that can happen in natural things how much more mental oppression hallelujah but our god is able amen to deliver but we have to recognize now if our position is in heavenly places in christ jesus we don't have to tolerate the devil's nonsense we don't have to put up with him i have no time for satan that's how we should be you know there's a problem sometimes we invite him to you know he'll take pain that's real pain real hurt in our lives and he'll manipulate that and then just open a door and just like you know he just takes advantage of it you know we should never give him a second hallelujah you know i think i've said it here before but you know i love how the millennium is actually the devil is bound by a chain of circumstance he has no one to work through not a single being upon the earth he can he there's no one to work through there no he say well in the millennium we'll have peace we can have that peace now i mean when he comes knocking on the door he's like a salesperson just shut the door in his face some negative thought came along to shut the doors now i've got no time for your negative thinking i mean it will not build my faith it doesn't make me love my brother or sister doesn't help nobody and just shut the door to him that he has no place to work through imagine if he had no place to work through this morning i mean there was no unbelief there was no trouble that people's minds weren't somewhere else but his faith just being built yes lord yes you're the same lord amen lord i believe your word and god begins to draw closer and closer all the time hallelujah amen but wouldn't that be called the devil comes along says no i just can't get in there that person yeah it's easy i tell you what the door i mean the whole wall has been ripped off it's real easy to get in there you know it's like uh yo says in proverbs i believe it is that a person who has no rule over their own spirit is like a city without walls so if you don't have any rule over your own spirit you have no defense hallelujah but you say well i don't have any walls i'm just tossed to and fro by emotion god can start building he's very good at construction amen and and he does all the compliance and stuff there's no leaky homes with god hallelujah amen so you take loneliness for example loneliness lonely feelings are not from god they are not from god they are safe from hell when when when people when when people are going to think no one understands me no one knows my struggles no one cares i'm all alone that anointing comes from the pit of hell because when when when lazarus when jesus would tell the story of lazarus um and the rich man you know lazarus went to abraham's bosom after he died and so abraham was with him there in abraham's bosom he had fellowship he wasn't alone but the rich man it doesn't record anyone around him in hell it'll be the most lonely place in the world some people say well i'm going to go to hell because all my friends will be there that may be the case but you won't have any friendship there because there's no friendship there's nothing even positive down there everyone will feel alone so never ever get that in your mind because that is the devil trying to dag you drag you into a dark place brother bram says i'm blind bartimaeus sorry i don't have it up here but um he says now he says just around no well the scripture says that god is a very prison help in time of trouble right so what you say well i feel alone but he's a prison help in time of trouble amen he says i'll never leave you nor forsake me that means wherever you go you're never alone god's there you're brushing your teeth god say you're at school god say you're at work god say you're in the car god's there with your family god's there you're a church god's there you may be alone somewhere on a desert island god will be there hallelujah amen brother brahm says just around the corner when you get to thinking about divine healing you get to think about christ keep him on your mind if there be any praise if there be any virtue the bible said think on these things if any thought comes by um it says well maybe it couldn't be so maybe it get that off your mind right quick think on things that's positive never let a negative thought pass through or just don't let it stop i'm not a bus stop for the devil i'm not a stop it's got to keep going anyhow if it starts through just keep your thoughts positive about jesus don't think sitting there here in a wheelchair that you're in a hopeless you're helpless you're not don't let that negative thought ever pass through or don't let it anchor you can't help it going through your mind but don't let it stop like the old farmer said i can't keep the birds from flying over my place but he had a double barrel shotgun i can sure keep them from roosting so you can do the same thing you two see don't let them roost let them pass right on through and here's a double barrel shotgun to use both old and new testament amen it's double barrel it's barrel straight it'll hit the target holy i say even the shots that fire are more than laser-guided hallelujah they'll go to the killing place right away i mean if it's yielded with a hand of faith you'll yield down the devil i mean but if the devil thinks that his weapon is equivalent to yours he's got you but he doesn't have a weapon he's stripped he stripped that down calvary he's nothing but a bluff amen he says i tell you it keeps them all away hallelujah now we're back here low children are in heritage of the lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward now it doesn't say it's the parent's reward it's his reward why because his children are his inheritance that's why word heritage you know that is that is then from the word inheritance and he fell heir to all things amen so it's also that his reward happy is the man that hath a as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are children of the youth now you think about a mighty man someone who's a mighty man that word also means a warrior a man of war someone that's valiant so it's not some rookie that's just been marching up and down the parade ground he's been in battle he's a mighty man he's proven himself now you think about our lord jesus he's the mightiest of the mighty man he doesn't have an equal he doesn't have a peer amen he conquered hell death in the grave i mean napoleon has nothing on him alexander the greatest not so great compared to our lord amen they went as far as they could they were defeated they lost but our lord jesus didn't just conquer on earth he cast out every devil that is led to cast out he had dominion over nature dominion over death i mean lazarus wasn't too far rotten from to come back alive again hallelujah sickness sickness had to bow to the name of jesus christ he conquered and he didn't just conquer here but he went down into hell and conquered hell death and the grave hallelujah so he is the mightiest one that's ever been in flesh is our lord jesus christ amen he is a mighty man and the bible says he's a mighty man of war we think sometimes jesus is some hippie jesus just walks around saying peace and you know chill out man and everything's not you know you take the bible the other cartoon bible things that girls watch sometimes just hippie jesus everything's all nice and flowers and but he's a man of war he's not afraid when the devil makes a challenge he's not afraid to accept that challenge hallelujah he is he is more than able to meet every challenge amen but he will use you and i he'll use his arrows to meet the challenge hallelujah you take david david was in the quiver of the lord he was fired into the earth and goliath made his boast hallelujah but this arrow was going to prove what it was built on amen david had a revelation that goliath was going down he says today i'll cut your head off didn't even have his own sword hallelujah but he had a revelation brother ram said that the rest of israel knew it could be done but it was revealed to david that goliath was going to die and that he was going to do it so here was he was an arrow now and he was going to show this is what i'm built i'm built up i'm built on revelation hallelujah and we know what happened goliath became two pieces david was still alive hallelujah amen now an arrow has an intended purpose it's not just for decoration but you only know the potential and the potency of a weapon when it's put in use i mean god's attributes which are his children are incredibly powerful you know you you're the most powerful people in the world you are the most powerful people in the world you are not the u.n not the us military chinese russian whatever all their bombs you're the most powerful people in all the world hallelujah you have a weapon they know nothing about amen we are built to turn down the devil's lie and not only to to discern his antichrist spirit but discern and withstand it hallelujah so it's not just identifying there's the devil on the radar no we can withstand him amen when he comes to try and come in and make us formal lukewarm and powerless i mean the bride of christ is able to discern that and withstand it amen we we are not here to become formal lukewarm and powerless god bless you brother indeed i'm glad someone's agreeing with me hallelujah amen we are not here to be just just just have a form of religion just go through the motions well it's sunday i guess i'll go to church it's what i do that's not what we're here for i mean we're not here just to have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof we're not here just to be lukewarm which is a lacking conviction just well i guess i should i don't know and this and this no we're not we're called to be on fire amen and not powerless but powerful amen because remember if god if jesus conquered hell death in the grave and that same anointing's in you well what's gonna what's gonna happen in your life you'll overcome all things the bible says that we are more than conquerors so not just conquerors more than conquerors hallelujah you talk about a one-sided battle hallelujah because we're more than conquerors it's not going to be a close run thing we're going to walk out of this world as an overcomer hallelujah now arrows or any weapons they must be designed and constructed a certain way and from a certain material not only to fly in a certain path but to but to hit the target and to pass through that target what good would an arrow be just like we go back in the dark ages and and we're a bunch of archers right and i know we're fighting whoever's doesn't matter because everyone fought everyone eventually you know you know so we're there and we've got these arrows and they look real good but we've got to fire at the enemy and it flies like this all crazy and then when it hits the enemy it just disintegrates that ain't gonna work but if it was built from the right material it will pierce the enemy's armor and it will go to the killing place it will kill the thing right so it has to be built a certain way now just as an arrow must be built out of a certain material to to not only hit the target and pierce that target it's the same thing with god's children amen we are here we have been built out of a material which is indestructible which is the word of god amen if he is the word and the bride is part of the bridegroom so she is the word also as you receive the word you become the words it's less of your humanity and more of his deity in you i mean so we are actually built of a material that is indestructible i'm not talking about your flesh and bones because we all are very aware of those limitations i'm talking about the seed that's within you hallelujah that we are built with a material that will pass through all trouble it will pass through all unbelief what's good having a perfect arrow that will fly straight but the arrowhead's made of wood and you and you have to pass through something that's metal that ain't going to work right your arrowhead's got to be sharper or stronger whatever they can actually pass through the target amen so we are built of the revelation of the word of god we are not built on a knowledge of the word of god we're built on revelation that's the material that the church has built from is the revelation of the word of god where it goes from a memory verse to a reality we all need the memory verse but it's going to drop down to reality because we're not built by a mental understanding of the word but when it's revealed to you just like i said about john it was revealed to him he was beyond the curtain of time hallelujah amen amen so that we are designed now a child here in the scripture it means a son or a as a builder of the family name that's what it means to be a child you're actually building the family names you're constructing something maybe it was just blueprints but yes like a house or this building it was once blueprints now it became material however as children of god we are not here to build a church brand right this is not about church brands and i go to this church i go that's that's actually irrelevant no but we are part of the body of christ and we're all part of the construction i mean that the family name would be built it would be established it would you know it would be erected it would be built up i mean just like jesus told his disciples he said these signs shall follow them that believe he's going to show this is how you're going to build the family name and we know the family name is the name of jesus christ all in heaven and earth are named by his after his own name we're called by that name hallelujah that's why we're baptized in his name not in the titles of god amen so he said these signs shall fire them to believe in my name thou shall cast out devils why you got to get rid of a squatter to build right just like with healing there's a squatter on the land you got to cast it out speak in new tongues i mean god takes over any if you drink any deadly thing it shall not harm you lay hands on the sick they shall recover that's the instructions of every believer this is how you're going to build the family name hallelujah amen amen as i said now a while back if you're if your rocket is balanced it will fly in a straight path now james i would say in james be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he received the early and latter rain be also patient establish your heart for the coming of the lord draweth nigh grudge not one against another brother unless you be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door so saying here to establish your heart now this means to establish means to sit fast to turn resolutely in a certain direction hallelujah so if you make up your mind jesus jesus forgave me a great big debt amen i had a debt i couldn't pay he had a debt he did not owe but yet he freely forgave me without money or price he didn't hold it against me his blood was attributed to me i mean he paid my debt now if he forgave me all things cannot we forgive each other little things amen we should establish our hearts which is our emotion it should be fixed in a certain direction i'm going to serve the lord i've i've gone beyond the point of no return it doesn't matter what comes or goes i'm going to walk with god hallelujah amen because you think about our emotional realm or no rather the fruits of the spirit they are all supernatural take one for example joy joy is not joy is the fruit of the spirit is not a human joy it's just not based upon circumstance it's not based upon how big your back balance is or how good your holidays are or you know your new car or or a job promotion or how your family's going that is not that is not joy of the fruit of the spirit i mean but the joy that's in the fruit of the spirit is the joy of the lord amen and the joy of the lord is actually god's own joy put into you amen as david would pray lord restore unto me the joy of thy salvation not my salvation but thy salvation so lord restore that joy amen the joy that your salvation has fallen upon me and i'm saved by your salvation how this it's a supernatural joy where we can rejoice in even the greatest trouble why do you think the apostle paul and silas could sit in a prison you know and they weren't looked after you know they had just been beaten maybe just thrown into the inner cell in stocks you know maybe in the worst spot they didn't just they didn't begin to eat the bread of sorrows oh but the lord called us and you know he's the greater mighty god and why do we have this trouble and look at what this person did no they begin to sing i've got a home in glory land that outshines the sun i know what songs they sung but you know they begin to rejoice why because the joy the lord was bubbling up hallelujah and god came down and shook the place and set them free hallelujah so now so just take that one see joy is a supernatural fruit just like all of them are hallelujah amen so now the believer as i said is built of the revelation of the word and they are part of the lord jesus who is the word the believer is that manifestation of the word that's no longer just ink on paper but it's put on flesh in them hallelujah remember we have we have a we have a word to fulfill brotherhood says in the rapture god allotted his word out to each age and each one of those ages has to manifest that and he also for ordained men for that age to fulfill that word every time he allotted his word he allotted a man for it when he allotted moses time he allotted moses to it when he loaded a lot of the time of the son of god to be born he allotted him to it every age he's allotted as man four ordained as the bible said so even in this age you know we are fulfilling scripture we are fulfilling revelations 10 8-11 to take the book to eat the book to prophesy again that's actually our part of the scripture i mean to actually speak out the context of the word hallelujah amen that a life would be lived amen of the word amen when the word talks about liberty that liberty should be manifested when the word talks about a divine love the capstone coming upon a bride i mean that should be manifested in a people i mean overcoming power i mean forgiveness of sins whatever it is that's in the word there's a liberty in the church today how that we are actually in the liberation of the sons of god and where people's eyes have come open to realize we do not belong to the to the devil hallelujah amen amen says according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world i'm going to wind this up soon that we should be holy and without blame before him in love now this is the flight path we're to go through having predestined us into the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so he's predestinated us unto the adoption of children now we know in the scripture that adoption in the scripture is different to adoption today and in adoption today i could take a child who is not born it's not part of my family it's not my child and i would sign some papers i'd legally become my child that's adoption right but that's not bible adoption bible adoption is the placing of a son or daughter in a position of power authority within the family so they're already born into the family now there's going to be a place in where there'll be place and power and authority hallelujah so we have been pre-dis this is your this is your flight path who's ever flown overseas and you got on the map and it shows you where you're going and time to destination and you and you and you're in your mind you're thinking this is going way too slow and but but there's a flight path that planes fly they don't just say well australia's this way and they turn and there they go no they've got a they've got a flight path and but it's a it's a pre the flight path has been predetermined it's already been set hallelujah and the pilot yields to that flight path and flies that flight path it's just like our walk has been predestined by god amen it's already been set we just have to yield but yeah yo the apostle paul said whatever state you find yourself in right now be content hallelujah rich paul whatever whatever just be content and where you are right now because this is the will of god concerning you hallelujah so now our our path has been ordained that we would come to an adoption of children so if you've been born into the family of god you will come to your position because it's been predestinated hallelujah and we know that even even many people think they are not in their position but god has already put them in that position if you've got the baptism of the holy ghost actually i see god saying you're in your place hallelujah so don't wait for some future event just use what you got right now amen and and we know the fullness of adoption is actually the change of our body how this is not just to be filled with the holy ghost and place into the body of christ but the fullness of adoption is the change of this body where we read there in romans 8 for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travails and pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body so our flight path has been set hallelujah now it may appear very bumpy you can look into all the believers lives through the ages joseph had a dream he's gonna his family was gonna bow to him he had no idea the turbulence that he would go through to get there amen david was was anointed by samuel you were gonna be king he had no idea the turbulence he had to go through to get to the throne right samuel did not sit him down okay he said listen you're going to be an outcast you're going to act crazy before the king of the philistines just to save your own skin you're going to do this and you're going to take bathsheba and this is going to happen you're going to number the p no none of that was was was told right but his flight path was set now how can we be arrows in the lord's hand well i'll just take this brother braham says in paradox about samson picking up the jawbone of the of the donkey he says that he you know he downed a thousand philistines with that jawbone and then the prophet says if we could only just be jaw bones in the hand of god there'd be another paradox he says yes it was he said well we can't be arrows in his hand yeah we can but if we're just a yielded instrument god can use this as he wants now i'll just finish with this quote because i feel time has escaped now jesus christ he says no matter if he was in a storm and a gale is knocking uh as knocking the boat from one side to another or he was standing in a uh in a face a mess of demons if he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he walked right on just as calm and quiet as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear or anything around him that's right whether it was going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he knowed it was going to happen because god said so he didn't say oh have i prayed through wonder if i fasted long enough wonder if i did this he just walked right on unconscious that that's right he believed that god what god said was truth the words must be fulfilled and he knowed what his life was to fulfill them that's right do you know your life is to for to fulfill a rapture do you know that we that's our prophecy they which are alive and remain will not you know hinder those are asleep but the dead in christ will rise first and then we which are alive man we caught up to meet them together in the clouds to meet the lord in the air you know we are part of that rapture cycle the lord the sitting with a shout the voice of the archangel then the trump of god you know we're part of that prophecy when the you know when god inspired the apostle paul to write that he had you on his mind god did because there's got to be someone to fulfill that word that's allotted to this age right so he so jesus could walk on no matter if the devil was there no devil trouble no trouble storm no storm because he knew what god said was right and he knew that he was there to fulfill that word and you're here to fulfill it too just walk unconscious affair walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious enter the world now remember he's not saying uh you can only walk this way if these things are not there no just walk unconscious of it don't let it grip you don't let it trouble you amen walk as you walk in christ walk with him not paying any attention the right or the left hand just keep moving on if something comes up in the church walk with god hallelujah if sickness strikes you walk with god if the neighbor don't like you walk with god just keep keep walking on with god enoch one day walk like that you know what he'd done he walked all the way home with god amen got so far up the road he didn't want to come back anymore hallelujah amen walk with god doctor says you're going to die walk with god yeah doctor says you can't get well walk with god just walk with god that's all for god has promised you i'll never leave you nor forsake you i'll be with you to the end of the world and he took an oath by that covenant that he'd give you that he would confirm it just walk with god you'll have your ups and downs don't worry you've got to go through briar patches over sharp rocks over bluffs down over hillsides up through the mountains over waters just walk with god yes sir there's so many hills to climb upward you've heard the old song but how little it will seem when you get to the end of the way oh my just look at there it's all been look back at your footsteps it won't be very much when we cross over into the eternities all of life's struggles will won't seem very much hallelujah why because we've got to the end of the way i'll say this if the lord has opened this to you if the message has gone from doctrine to a person it's become a reality what's the lord telling you you're over that you've got a a theophany over there you actually have a target i fired you into this world not for you to stay in this world but to go from this world into eternity because that's the target that you're gonna hit hallelujah sure there's lots of things you know you know the arrows there in that scripture means something that pierces hallelujah and we don't just just hit the devil and get stuck in him no we go through we go through unbelief we go through trouble we go through hardship we go through misunderstanding we go through trouble we pass all the way through quiet why because that is not our end destination our end destination is eternity hallelujah amen so you say well jesus i'm going through that's why complex comes up don't put up with it unforgiveness comes up don't put up with the devil troubles in your mind don't put up with it just keep walking on with god pass through that thing hallelujah hallelujah amen we have the musicians this morning amen but you've got a predestinated walk hallelujah we're arrows in his quiver but he shot us into the world alec why because he wants you to see he knows what you're made of hallelujah but he wants you to know what you're made of hallelujah hey we're fearfully and wonderfully made now i'm just not talking about naturally i'm talking about spiritually hallelujah amen amen let's stand this morning um let's just sing my god is awesome then we can have our seats again isn't he awesome though he's the savior of the whole world heir of giver of salvation by his stripes i am healed he's my comforter he's my waymaker amen he's the peace giver

even see the intestine but it's working very hard 24 7. so with this we be able to appreciate the gift that god has put in our midst to lift your brother up not to bring him down praise the lord so um we convert your prayers and say please um remember us in your prayers and and we remember it too and together we'll make it to glory so just to be very brief i'm going to leave a word with you that is keep pressing the battle amen because we are actually in a very very fierce world war you don't see these devils but they're there so um on tuesday jesus testimony before i read the quote about 7 15 i was driving on the on the city in in the town wakatani um so it was like a quiet evening i was driving 50 kilometers per hour and then um i had a noise a noise like a bang so before i could say what's happening as a dog flew right into my front and i hit that dog and um the car was you can imagine was a you know damaged so it's actually with with the um car repair so we we don't know um what tomorrow holds but one thing is sure we'll know him that host tomorrow and we have that confidence so president battle rob said the other morning i was laying on my bed and i had just walked i walked from the sleep and i placed my hands behind my head and relaxed my my head on the pillow then i began to wonder what it would be like on the other side hallelujah so when you're thinking about the other side you have no time to hit anybody you can only forgive 24 7. amen praise the lord i mean you love everybody man so i realized that i i have lived more than half my life and i live to be as old as my people and i wanted to to do more for the lord before i left this life and i had a voice saying you are just starting press the battle keep pressing and i i lay there pondering the words i thought that i just imagined that i had heard a voice and again the voice said press the battle keep going keep going still i was still on believing i thought that probably was possibly i spoke there was myself i placed my lips between my teeth and i held and held my hand over my mouth and listened the voice spoke again just keep pressing if you only know what is at the end of the road like god spoke to us today your life shall be planned and we see the end from beginning god said malachi 4 go when before the the world began brought on mystery i said this is who you are amen this is your destiny okay so um so you know the story about that the testimony about be beyond the curtains i'm not going to go to that but um after i told this story so um and he said the the voice spoke to me this experience um that's what you preach that the holy ghost is perfect love nothing can enter there without it praise the lord and in conclusion i am more convinced than ever in my life that it will take perfect love to enter that place there was no jealousy no tiredness no sickness no old age no death only supreme beauty and joy whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get perfect love get to where you can love everybody even every enemy no matter if the plane is rocking the lightning is flashing or the guns of the enemy are upon you these things do not matter get perfect love god bless you thank you [Applause] you know i'm bored you want to say a few words though thank you god bless you everyone um thank you so much for what you have all been to us the very first time we were here it was peter dave and i that was on the 16th of october 2016. so over four and a half years ago um i really want to say thank you very much brother ben because we were in new zealand for two years we didn't know where to fellowship we didn't know any brethren we were hooking up to london so one day as we were on hookup i saw that it was a brother preaching by the name of brother freddie eso and he said new zealand i was like wow new zealand and it was such a wonderful message he preached so i contacted the pastor and said you know what i didn't know that there were any believers in new zealand please can you put me through to this brother i saw preaching in the church so that was brother chandler he connected us to brother freddie and uh brother freddie said where are you i said we're in wellington he said okay even wellington go to brother ben and he gave me details of two people i can go to anywhere around here i emailed the first personal response i emailed brother ben and i got an instant response and it was so warm and open and welcoming and he was looking forward to seeing us so i went back and then it was in taranaki it was me and the kids so i went back and told them about this brother this pastor that just emailed us that we are going to the service and um jeremy and pal weren't too sure but peter dave is the bravest he will always get it so granny said let's go mom let's go let's go check it out so we came to church for the first time on that date we sat here and robin preached such a wonderful message and it was a bit different from what you know i've been in the message since i was a child but um when i had brother ben preach brother ben i'm sorry you don't like people saying thank you to you but i take a different view i like to give honor to her no it's due and i like to say thank you you know and appreciate people you know so after that message it was wonderful we took the testimony back to the two other people that weren't too sure and then they said oh we're going we're going to go so we went and jeremy was still growing in the lord at the time you know so we came jeremy i'm sorry i'm going to give that testimony about you jeremy comes to church and one hour's service is too long for you so what he does is he goes to drink water he comes back and he sits not one hour we have more than one hour maybe two where we came from [Laughter] sometimes six hours sometimes okay so he's often you know but the first time we came here he was sitting there and he did not move like throughout the service he did not move he was an hour long and he did not move and he was whipping and that was because he saw the message in simplicity you know so that was that was wonderful and immediately after the service people that did not know you before were so loving so welcoming so i did not i could not believe it you know everybody wanted to invite us over and it was simply amazing and i saw the love of god among the brethren and that was what kept us through the years so brother ben i want to say thank you so much for giving to the lord so that the lord can use you to bless us thank you and sister christine such a wonderful sister in the lord and all she does [Applause] and we thank everybody for your support your love and the wonderful friendships we formed from all of you especially brother andy and sister bronwyn
