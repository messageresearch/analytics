in the valley of refuge and when david inquired of the lord and said thou shall not go up but feature compass behind them and come upon them over against the mulberry trees and let it be that when thou hearst the sound of a going in the top of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt bestow thyself for then shall the lord go out before thee to smite the host of the philistines and david did so as the lord commanded him and smote the philistines from giba until they'll go down to gazia amen hallelujah so and let's go to psalms 47 we're going to read the whole psalm together um amen psalm 47 yep and we'll start from verse one here amen say amen when you're there or you've either turned or swiped or whatever you do so psalm 47 and verse 1 says to the chief musician assam for the sons of korra oh clap your hands all ye people shout unto the lord with the voice of triumph i mean for the lord most high is terrible he is a great king over all the earth he shall subdue the people under us and nations under our feet now remember we're fighting against demon powers principalities and high places right so keep that in mind when we talk about the people shall be under our feet while the devil is going to be under our feet amen he shall choose our inheritance for us i like that don't you the lord chooses our inheritance it's not us choosing it it's him choosing it for us the excellency of jacob whom he loves sila god has gone up with a shout the lord with the sound of a trumpet sing praises to god sing praises and praises unto our king sing praises for god is the king of all the earth sing he praises with understanding and we know that this day we can sing with understanding amen god reigneth over the heathen god sitteth upon the throne of his holiness the princes of the people are gathered together even the people of the god of abraham for the shields of the earth belong unto god he is greatly exalted amen may the lord bless the reading of his word you may have your seats this morning um so i'd like to continue on uh where where i was speaking last sunday about of of a of a sound of a going and and david was instructed when he heard that sound uh of a going uh in the in the top of the mulberry trees that's when the time it was for him to to bestow himself and go and strike his enemy and we understand that we have heard the sound of it going that this message the rapture is really a secret going amen right is it coming but it's a secret going brother braham says it's actually a secret catching away of a bride amen and we understand that you know there is a people upon the earth that this will pass them by and they'll never know what happened but there's a people upon the earth that it won't pass them by and they'll be caught away hallelujah and i believe that's why we have gathered under the sound of the message amen in this days because we've heard the sound of it going it stirred us up amen and we understanding that we've been he's come to take us home hallelujah so now the sound we understand that every sound has a significance right every sound has a significance you know even even the whales when they call to each other it just sounds like a bunch of whale song to us but they're talking to each other the elephants trumpeting the birds chirping you know the beatles doing what they do you know everything has a significance every sound has a significance i mean it is it is it is speaking something amen and and the apostle paul would would speak about this you know i want to go into today we've heard the sound but you know what it means are you trying to hear the sound right because you know there's a lot of sounds you know there's a like like at work there's heaps of alarms there's alarms for freezers there's alarms for auction detectors there's alarms all kind of alarms but if you don't know what that alarm is for it could be catastrophic like get out of the building something's going to blow up you know but if you don't know what that sound is you just hear this you could just continue on but if you're trying to know what that sound is someone had to come along and say this allah means this this allah means this this sound means this and if you hear this do this if you hear this do that but if you don't know you just continue on in your daily daily daily life right so we need to be and and i pray that the lord would would would give us an ear to hear amen i mean what the spirit says to the church right and it doesn't become common to us we don't shut down to it but we're attentive when god speaks amen so so the apostle paul says in first corinthians 14 and 9 he says so ye so likewise ye accept ye utter by the tongue words easily to be understood how shall be known what is spoken for ye shall speak into the air there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without signification so there's many voices and there's many more voices today than there's ever been in the world i can well even now people have an internet connection they have a device they can watch the service and they can actually have subtitles going google youtube is clever enough that it can actually translate what i'm saying real time with subtitles and i know how many different languages it's about 95 accurate even with this hillbilly kiwi accent that i have right it can actually translate it so you know there's there's many voices today but we've got to be trained to hear the voice i mean because there's one voice that has the most significance in this age and we and i pray god remember this is not a human training there's a holy ghost training right and i pray the lord would train us so we're attentive and and i believe i'm looking at a tent of people they're they've heard the sound of a going and now they're ready to act upon that sound amen amen so every everything has every sound that is made has a reason for that sound he yo he also says the apostle paul would say in that same chapter he says others in verses 7 and 8 and even things without life giving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or harped for if a trumpet given uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle now we understand that the apostle paul in his day is that on a battlefield or even even even outside the battlefield orders were given by by music you know there'll be a trumpet blonde even moses was commanded to to make the silver trumpets and a certain blow would be sounded on the trumpets it would be now let's march or make camp or the enemies here or do this you know it was that's how it was projected the message was given by through an instrument but if you didn't know what that instrument if that instrument did not give a certain sound then how could you prepare yourself for your you know for battle and and in the apostle paul's days i said that that orders were given in an army by by music now because you've got to remember imagine if we were in the roman legion and we're fighting the gauls or the huns or we're fighting somebody and we're up there and we're you know we're just the soldiers on the front line you know as the battle's going on we can't go to julius caesar and say julius what we meant to do again we can't go talk to him we've got to be standing in our rank we're going to be fighting when we're called because we know in a battle it's a fluid situation the plan that normally starts is not normally the plan that is finished with right because the enemy will do something you do something you know they do this and you gotta react accordingly so if we're not trained imagine if we're on the front rank you know and then and then we're told you know the captain would say okay boys you gotta hold this hill but then maybe there comes a time where we're gonna move from that hill but if we just stood they said no hold on we got told to stand here if we're not trained for that trumpet sound because that's how the orders would come from the general would be through a trumpet sound right and if we're not trained to hear that sound we wouldn't know okay now we charge or now we march forward or now we pull back or now we do this or you know we can't you can't go to the general and say now what are we doing again you had to be trained to hear the trumpet amen in the heat of the battle you could not ask the general what was the plan but you had to in the midst of the battle you had to keep your air out for that trumpet to blow even as you're taking some gaul's head off and you're fighting and deflecting sword blows or whatever more you had to keep your ear out because because the change in orders could come right and if you don't hear that changing orders you could be stuck and basically no man's land and be taken out but if you could keep your air open for that trumpet sound right if the order comes on now we've got a withdrawal then you withdraw with the rest of your unit amen it's the same thing in this battle you know we're not in a picnic i trust you've you know came to that realization we're on a battlefield right we've been we are the soldiers the soldiers of the lord amen hallelujah but we've got to even as we're fighting devils and you know overcoming every day we must keep our air open amen for the trumpet amen hallelujah amen that's right we have to do that brother brown would say and and trump it gives an uncertain sound it's a paul he was talking in corinthians 48 of of training of a soldier he's trained to assound that soldier if he's a trained soldier he knows every sound of that trumpet just exactly what to do and the infantry had to had they had certain trumpets and the cavalry had certain trumpets and you can't be an infantryman listening out for what the calvary is going to do because there's a bugle-blowing charge and if you charge with them hold on you're not meant to be doing that so we've got to be really lord make our hearts one with you so whatever your word says to do i'm just going to walk in unison with it i mean so so he's trained to astound that soldier if he's a trained soldier he knows every sound of that trumpet just exactly what to do he's trained to that trumpet when that trumpet sounds he he said if a trumpeter gives an uncertain sound then the soldier don't know what to do because he's only trained to the sound of a trumpet he knows exactly what to do because the trumpets telling him what to do he said now if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound that he don't know what to do now that was training a natural soldier and the christian soldiers trained to a trumpet amen a sound of a trumpet that's the gospel trumpet the gospel the sound of the word of god the gospel trumpet and if one never knew the sound of the gospel trumpet he would get a bit confused if he didn't know what the word said and what the word taught just what the church said he'd be a bit confused when he heard the sound of the trumpet he wouldn't know how to prepare himself and i think that's what we've got to the world today the trumpet is sounding exactly with the gospel and the people don't know how to act they don't know how to stand in line and make ready to battle they're confused because they've been listening to different trumpets creeds denominations secret sectarianism which is what we see in the world today this faction and this faction this political party this faction this movement it's all broken up all kinds of stuff he says and when the true gospel with the true word made manifest proved in there that people don't know what to do amen so we're living in that day so we have to be trained you know to to hear the sound of the trumpet now brother brown makes a very interesting comment where you know in that message we listen to the contest i trust this all kind of ties together you know it's kind of like cooking a lot of different ingredients and it goes in the pot then here it is so maybe we're cutting some carrots now but you know we'll get there now he says in the contest heavenly father as we stand here so many thoughts is dying out in our hearts and of the mistakes of last year and as we're approaching the death of 62 in the birth of 63 oh god may we be one step higher up the ladder until we see jesus and his program it's very vital that we see jesus and his program because if we don't see his program if we don't see him and we don't see his program we don't know what to do that's right where are we in the battle lord you know how's the campaign going you know you don't know what's going on but if you can see his program if you can see him in his program you can see this world through scriptural eyes and you won't get caught up in what's going on in the world and you can walk on with god hallelujah now now to say that you know we need to know see jesus in his program this is not a vague thing now this is actually for this is dessert for next sunday i just want to give you a foretaste but i want to get thinking about these things now to see god in his program or to see god in his word which is his program rather it's not a vague thing but if we fail to see it then we'll wander off into other things now the program of god for this age is laid out in a pattern from the ministry of john the baptist until the destruction of jerusalem that is the program of god is in there and and we're going to go into that maybe next sunday you see the political fighting of the jews with as titus was coming in everything going on that's just rinsing repeating as today but if you're caught up in what's going on you'll end up like the jews in jerusalem massacred but if you hear the gospel trumpet you'll leave when you hear when you see the voice of god the bible being manifested you'll run out of it as fast as you can and you'll be safe what's that running out a rapture so that's next sunday that's it thank you you know brother brown i've been i've been you know um he says that you know he he he relates dreams and visions there in services the time of the end 1962 around the same time and he says that you know i think junior jackson had the dream where brother bram took that crowbar that wrecking bar and pulled the top off of the pyramid and it was that white rock that that sunlight never shone on and he said to the people look on this and then as junior jackson was was was watching brother brown he he went west he went somewhere and then a lot of people said where's the prophet gone where's he gone and many of them stopped looking on this and they wandered off they weren't looking at jesus in his program where's the profit gone oh there's a delay it's been 60 odd years what's going on and people wander off but they don't understand that it's all part of god's program but if you keep looking on what he told us to look at look on this look into the law of liberty right then you won't wander off and you won't just go off in people's opinions and ideas and what's pulling everyone around so we need to be lord train us to hear the trumpet amen amen so just like a natural army we need to know what the sound of the trumpet means is it to charge to retreat hold the line to march make camp break up camp you know what does it mean but we also have to have confidence in the general that gives the instructions to the trumpeters to blow the instruction right if you had no confidence in your general how are you going to fight in the army because you wouldn't trust his decisions you wouldn't trust his tactics you think this guy doesn't know what he's talking about and we're all going to get massacred right you have to have confidence remember because you because the front line troops they barely ever saw the general they were their captains their corporals whatever they didn't see the fire you know you're the four-star general in charge of the campaign quite often but the orders came from headquarters now this is what we've got to do so we have to have confidence in the general that gives the orders now brother rahm says in the greatest battle ever thought the brains of the army lays in its captains the intelligence romulan germany was the brains of germany not hitler rommel that's right eisenhower military men patton those men who were at the front it depends on which way they gave the order if you fought you follow your captain if he's the right kind of a general if he's a right kind if he's a four-star general if he's proved if he's been proved to be right follow him though it may seem wrong to you go on to the front do as he told you hallelujah we got a five-star general spell j-e-s-u-s placing five stars on us f-a-i-t-h he never lost a battle hallelujah he conquered death hell in the grave get the devils out of the way he's the great chief captain so the devil isn't even in the picture remember our general's been this is not his first rodeo this is not his first campaign he didn't just walk out of military school and here i am a general no no he's been fighting a long time the first campaign he fought was in heaven against satan and his angels amen anyone hallelujah then he came down to the earth he pursued his enemy down here amen and then he told he told moses go down into egypt another campaign now get them out i've heard the cry of my people i've come down and i'm sending you to do the job and we know the result of that devil zero hallelujah got two amen he won again it was a decisive victory amen hallelujah now now now it's time to take the land here's another campaign they came out now they've got to go in amen josh was wondering what to do that same general came down said joshua i i defeated satan in heaven you've come out you've seen me bring you out of egypt now i'm going to take you into the land amen and joshua said hallelujah you know what you're doing i mean you give a certain sound and they took the land that's right hallelujah won that campaign hallelujah amen i mean many times in the times of judges israel's back was against the wall i mean but but the five-star general came back down again because it's amazing how quickly people forget their orders it's incredible how you know one generation revival then they call off they get cold and a little bit formal they get comfortable the enemy comes in then there's another deliverance happens and it's amazing how that just happens and the cycle of revival and death never ends oh but we're in the bright age brother ben no that may be so but that cycle of revival and death can still happen but there'll be a people upon the earth individuals right that will actually god in them will break that cycle of revival and death they won't just have a glorious camp and then cool off no they'll stay on fire irrespective of the enemy what he does what he says is most they will stay they will break that cycle and i'm so glad if you read through the book of judges every time there was that recycle of revival and death israel just called out and many times god's just waiting for us to call out to him oh god remember when you yo well i was dancing on the hallelujah highway everything seemed fine i was everything was glorious in my soul restore me back to that amen amen and he does and he does i mean so so so he went to gideon the five-star general gave some orders they won amen hallelujah king david comes to the throne they took the whole land amen hey man you guys yo our god's been in the battle for a long time and he's never lost one amen hallelujah he conquered hell death in the grave he says boys i'm going to show you how to do it hallelujah i'm not just going to be you know i'm going to come myself amen hallelujah hallelujah he never lost the battle and he has not lost the battle yeah it's amazing the devil said i'm going to get your seed god i'm going to get your sons and daughters i'm going to bring them to hell and god said no you won't that's right and for i know how many thousands of years god's still saying you haven't and you won't hallelujah you won't get one of mine hallelujah that's what god said to the yeah that's what he said to the devil you're not getting one of mine not a single one and we can look through history and say he didn't get that one he didn't get that one he didn't get that one he didn't get hurt didn't get him didn't get this one didn't get this one and here we are in 2020 we and god still the same saying satan you ain't going to get one not a single one hallelujah because he can't lose a part of himself that's why he never lost a battle he said the war's raging looks like we're going to lose hold on just like brother cadre preached here many years ago to be continued we're going to continue hold on this is not the last page of the book this is not the final chapter in the episode maybe there's some suspense building you know when you used to sit in front of a tv brain dead and watch some kind of drama and come to the climax of it it seems to be continued what's going to happen you know there's suspense builds maybe some suspense is just building in your life hallelujah but that's when god loves to come upon the scene amen when shadrach meshach and abednego they said to the king we're not going to bow either he'll save us either he won't but we're not bowing to your image and you say to be continues what's going to happen because they made up their mind i'm sorry i'm not bowing to this thing this thing you've crafted with your mind this thing you've made hallelujah i'm not bowing to this image and there's and then the suspense just built and all the while god's watching down from heaven and yeah brother brown dramatized it he tells michael and wormwood you can't go down there and even though you could if i let you but i'm going myself and just as they were about to step into the furnace the son of man stepped into the furnace with them they had a jubilee meeting there hallelujah hey man sometimes that there's that suspense just be steady just be steady walk with god harley walk with him remember he never lost the battle amen amen he's always on time his timing as brother you're a singing member patience hallelujah amen he knows what he's doing but if we're on the front line in the roman army julius caesar knew what he was doing he knew what he was doing but if we were little you know whatever legion were on the front row just whatever if we if we just decided mate this guy has no idea they're outnumbered many times the romans were but he knew what he was doing but they had confidence in their general if they could have confidence in the in a natural general you know how much more supernatural gender how much of god that knows the future doesn't just predict it because he knows human nature and what the enemy will do he knows what the enemy will do he knows his next movie knows what he's thinking he knows what he thinks he can do hallelujah amen so the trumpet this gospel trumpet today is such a certain sound this message is not an uncertain sound it's not a confusing sound it brings clarity i mean it brings a real stability i mean we know we know that they you know you know that the marching orders of the army are not man's opinion because if you think about it if the general you know the general says let's make camp here and we look around and say i don't think this is a good place my opinion it should be there and then he goes away with bill camp there he'd get mad he said i want camp right here now we don't have to necessarily understand why camp should be built here he has his reasoning maybe there's more water maybe he's a better defensive position you know it's the same thing with the word well you know some things you just got to take it by faith take him at his word remember this whole bible is not man's idea you know faith you're the faith of the fathers what was it the bible's always right god's word is always right it doesn't matter how we feel what we're going through our opinion whatever else things there's got to be a faith restored to the bride that god's word is always right hallelujah and i believe that's been restored how are we doing today everyone how's everyone good hallelujah you know normally the little boys perk up talking about swords and fighting and you know but yeah it's all good for us all anyway amen so we have to have confidence that our general knows what he's doing and he sure does know what he's doing hallelujah this gospel trumpet this message trumpet is a certain sound it is no longer man's opinions it is thus saith the lord amen thus saith the scripture now the sound of it going here as i yeah i think i touched on it last sunday but it signifies also it's an awakening to a position david when he heard that sound remember he knew it could be done he'd seen god do a lot of things but then here was a season now where he was going to defeat his enemy and you know you know in this particular battle but but that sounds signified you're going to win this battle so you're not defeated but you are the victor that's why we read that psalm sing with the voice of triumph i mean praise god with the voice of triumph not with defeat not with is it going to happen you know with triumph hallelujah that means a victory has been won amen so so the sound of it going it actually in this day begins to reveal to a people their position in christ you think how incredible that this message is where where where god is so come down and shown us who the bride is right we're you know we're not just church members we're not just part of a club this is not a club there's no joining fee there's no membership there's no put your name on a book this is not a club this is not a place we gather because we just like each other this is not a good yeah i mean i mean i mean this is not a place we gather just because the food is good no it is right amen it's not a place we gather just because we get along this is not what this is about this is about god has revealed himself on this day and he's gathered a people to himself i mean to become one with him that is why we have gathered i mean this is why we've come under the shadow of his wings hallelujah in this place not because we get along hallelujah but because he's called us amen and there's a reason he has called us is because he wants us to recognize who we are amen so so this so the sound of a going this message is it has released a power into the church in the end time that we begin to see and understand by revelation i mean that we are sons and daughters of god it's an actually incredible thing when you realize when god tells you i'm your father i mean i'm your father i'm not just someone else's father i'm your father amen your show your natural parents i allow them to bring you here but i am your true father amen because you realize remember he cannot lose remember a child is a part of the parent and god can't lose a part of himself hallelujah amen so we begin to see by revelation that we are sons and daughters of god and that's why the scripture tells us uh paul would say in galatians because you are sons you receive the holy ghost i'm just paraphrasing a little bit but it says you don't become children when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost the reason you receive it is because you are because you are you don't become you are amen hallelujah i mean because you are sons go read the book of galatians you know he's trying to get all the legalism out of that galatian church that came in it's not because you've earned it and it's your human effort that has done it it's actually because you are sons he's gathered you because you are not you don't become you are but you need to recognize you are i mean not all one day i will no you are amen and if you're a son or a daughter then you have rights i mean you have more rights than anyone else hallelujah and those rights you've got to exercise those rights hallelujah and it is time remember this age is the age of people's rights lady hosea writes to the people and every group under heaven is rising up saying this is our god-given rights what about the bride of christ remember because that's just in the negative what about in the positive what about now there should be a people on their feet and i believe they are saying this is my god-given rights this is my identity this is what i this is where i belong and i want my rights amen we shall write the protest against the devil satan give it back satan get off my ground this is my this is my ground this is my ancestors ground get off it you've been squatting too long hallelujah and we have rights remember it's not just us as you're pushing for something no heavens behind us pushing how are you going to realize if you're part of an army you're not by yourself i mean we're not by ourself in this war halloween there's more than just us in this war i mean angels have gathered you're amazing it would have been to be gehazi or whatever the servant of the prophet was walk out there there's syrians around the place he's panicking you know he knocks on the prophet's door get up quickly we're in trouble maybe the prophet just go yo elisha or your wife desire says i told you to put the milk bottles out at the front door what's going on you know brother brown says he dramatizes you know because people used to put milk bottles out by the front door once upon a time and you know what's wrong and maybe he stretches and you know the other servant's panicking we're surrounded we're going to die they're going to take this place look at that come look and drag them out of bed and maybe you know in the prophet don't worry about that amen don't worry about that what do you mean don't worry what do you mean don't worry can't you see the obstacles can you see their shields in their swords and their and their siege equipment and their army and you know we're toast don't worry about that and he just prays lord open his eyes open his eyes hallelujah remember the prayer didn't bring the armies of heaven down they were already there they were there before they woke up they were there before the assyrians turned up hallelujah and then the servant was more shocked by the armies of heaven than a natural enemy but but but he had to realize hey this army of heaven hasn't come to get me it's come to get them it's come to protect me hallelujah it's the same thing with you and i friends yeah we're not alone in this walk we're not alone in this walk you know the scripture tells us that the angel of the lord and camps about those who fear him and delivers them now many people will just take that as the angels of the lord but the scripture is the angel of the lord so if god himself encamps around his bride he himself said whole where's she gone i'm going with hallelujah i won't leave you i will never leave thee nor forsake thee i'm gonna make my encampment around them hallelujah and we go through our day and think well we're just fighting this battle ourselves no no heavens here it's more than a natural fight more than a natural argument to try and turn a person's heart to the lord no god can do it amen hallelujah amen the scripture would tell us in romans 8 that nature itself is travailing until there be the manifestation of the sons of god it says enough children then heirs ears of god joint is with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature then that word means creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god nature is groaning nature is groaning for for a people to be revealed hallelujah for the creature was made subject to vanity the creation was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of whom who has subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travail them pained together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body who gets that kind of groaning that longing i'm so homesick and blue i want to see jesus i just want to hear those silver bells chime or let me look past the curtain of time you're there why is that because god put something in us to groan and nature is groaning you know if nature could preach yourself imagine if the earth could preach a sermon right now imagine if it could what would it be it would be addressing you it'd be saying come to your position we're under this we're under this bondage of corruption until you come to your place we want to be free people want to see the earth you know we want to be predator free by 2050 whatever it is you know we'll be really predator free day right why when when when creation has been i've come under the glorious liberty of our lord jesus i mean by by the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god hey i have a trap in my garden i haven't got a rat yet but i want to get one right i actually have one there maybe i'll trap a rat here trap a devil amen so you know i'm not against those kind of things because i have a trap myself i was excited when it turned up but anyway we'll get him one day we'll get that rat hallelujah you know but but you know you really wanted to be predator free wait for a millennium wait for a new heavens and a new earth but the only way those things can happen is when us when we lay aside our humanity and our feelings so for ourselves and what we perceive as our troubles and we just walk with god and just enjoy his word and just worship him and love him and just doesn't matter what's going on in life i'm under a heavy load but the glory that shall be revealed in thee how there is nothing compared to the problems of this present age hallelujah hallelujah i'm going through a bad year hold on eternity is going to be awesome i mean it's going to be real awesome we're not going to get bored up there you know sometimes we think what are we going to do it's going to be awesome it's going to be far greater than what we can think and the novelty i don't believe is going to wear off we're not going to look for anything else to do it's going to be awesome hallelujah amen now as i said the five-star general came down and called israel out of egypt and then and then on mount sinai god would give them a word and he would by the sacrifice of blood of bulls and goats he it says he enjoined that word with the people he connected them by a sacrifice and he was doing this because the people had to understand that their identity was in that word their identity was no longer in the scars of their slavehood right their identity wasn't they were slaves their identity wasn't the word that was received and and the reason that word was received is because remember in egypt they were already the children of god they didn't become the children because they went through the red sea they already were the children of god as as hosea would say this in in hosea 11 um i'm 11 1 that when israel was a child then i loved him and called my son out of egypt now we know that scripture has a compound meaning you know for one son that was called out of egypt was israel but the other the greater son was christ himself right i mean but but there was a call god was calling his sons and daughters out of egypt because he wanted them to see this is not really what you're meant to be you're not meant to be a slave under these whips of these task masters you're not meant to be here in the world but i want to call you out and give you your inheritance remember he has chosen our inheritance for us hallelujah amen so there was a call he said i'm going to call you out of slavery that you're no longer being pushed and driven around by those task masters but you're going to be living in my presence and the inheritance that i have chosen for you in your rightful position which is the promised land i mean and we know that is what he has done for us hallelujah it should make us happy i'm no longer a slave to fair i'm a child of god i'm no longer i mean serving a bottle i'm no longer serving computer games i'm no longer serving hollywood i mean i'm serving god now i'm no longer serving the god of sports hey i did basically everything right but i don't serve it no more why because i heard a call amen he saw me and said son this is not your place you think this is your place this is not your place come up higher come out of that stuff amen hallelujah i mean because so that's what he did for us he called us out of the world he cast the devil out of our hearts and turned it from unbelief to faith in the word of god amen as the apostle paul would say in first corinthians 6 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolatrous nor adult um idolaters nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves of mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revelers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you amen you were so paul's saying what i've just listed you were some of you were like this some of you were actually living out what i'm saying right such were some of you but ye are washed but yes sanctified but yeah justified in the name of the lord jesus by the spirit of our god hallelujah so god came and washed him called them took those things out of them he says you're that way once but now you're not that way anymore i mean you've been sanctified you've been washed you've been justified hallelujah amen hey that gives us you should give us something to shout about are you just trying to make us happy hey we have something to be happy about hallelujah we'll be happy now we'll be happy as the bodies yeah after the body changes we'll be happy in the millennium we'll be happy in the new heavens and the new earth we're just going to be happy amen why because the lord has called us out hallelujah hallelujah i mean if we look at the parable of the prodigal son he came to himself in the pigpen he realized his position wasn't meant to be in the pig pen hungering after the slot that the pigs were eating that wasn't his remember he actually he was so hungry he came to such a desperate place that through those scraps he was feeding to the pigs he said if only i could eat this food you know and there has to come a time in our lives when we have to stop hanging after pig slop this world is pig sloth oh but it's so lovely and shiny it's pig slop really all the all the things that devil tries to give us it's pig slop you know brother brown would tell us now i don't know what this value is in in in today's um today's money but he says some time ago i was standing in a colosseum and i was looking at and and watching around looking at art and displays i've seen the analysis of a human body and there was two young men standing looking at this and it said that a man that weighed 150 pounds he was worth 84 cents in chemicals so if you take your body you take all the chemicals out of it all the hydrogen and you know and the carbon and the iron and the zinc and you know all the different elements that make up a human body the nitrogen all those things if you took that down this is in 1960 the human body is only worth 80 84 cents so this guy here this guy 84 cents and maybe today five bucks i don't know but it's not a lot you can't even really go to the dairy you know i can't even sell this body of chemicals and get many well it's not even five cent lollies anymore you know i know what it is but you know i can't get much with the value of this guy amen he had just about enough whitewash on him to sprinkle a hen's nest and so much that chemicals was worth 84 cents one of them boys looked and said well jim we're not worth very much are we i thought that's right this body's not uh worth very much but yet we'll put a ten dollar head on top of it now i don't know what that is in in today's you know you know but we go in and get hundred dollars worth of clothes and we think we're you know fancy fancy and a fifty dollar mink coat turn up our nose if it would rain or drown us see we think we're somebody dressed all up and pretty all up and go out and take care of that 84 cents you go into a restaurant and they hand you a bowl of soup that had a spider in it you'd sue the restaurant you'd complain imagine you go to some restaurant and there's you know flies and you know there's a fly in my soup and there's bugs in it and it's half it's not even cooked right you know people complain i ask for a medium medium rare steak you know this is medium rare you know people do that they actually complain about those little things right you're watching see he says you're watching this 84 cents but you've got a soul in there that's worth 10 000 worlds and you'll poke anything down it amen world lust anything else it's eternal and it's worth ten thousand worlds but we watch the 84 cents and walk away from the value of the 10 000 worlds isn't that something people give their whole lives they have their now nothing against fitness nothing is those things but they have their fitness program and they watch what they eat down to the detail and it's got to be organic and free range and whatever whatever whatever you know and it's got to be fed just right it's got to be all these things and it's just watching 84 cents but the soul is but yet people will watch all kinds of stuff and they'll pour basically garbage into their spirit into their soul they will pour all kinds of vomit are you with me hey we've got you know where's i don't have a pot but if i had a pot i'd put it here and say let's boil it down you know water can look alright now this is if i ball this water down it's fine there wouldn't be anything in it but if i took the finest quality stokes valley water out of the tap that changes flavor after you pour it in you know after a while you know no honestly because we've got a you know with um bottles and stuff we've got to sanitize the thing you put into the microwave you put water in it if you don't wash that thing out much there's like this brown sludge on the bottom of the sanitizer and that's not from the dirty bottles those have been cleaned it's from the water you got to boil it down yeah you say well do you still drink this stuff yes i do anyway you say well that's pretty dumb hey i need water but we'll take things we'll take things that look so wonderful that's so pleasant to the flesh and if you boil it down it's just brown sludge and it's 84 cents we're so concerned about but spiritually just brown sludge but your soul is worth ten thousand worlds you know we are very high value you should think the devil comes along tries to sell you you know some boy or some girl or whatever it may be you're worth more than that i mean you're worth more than that hallelujah yeah think about it our soul's worth ten thousand worlds why don't we look after the ten thousand worlds but that's right amen now the prodigal son would realize that pig slop is really not it it actually doesn't belong to him this is not his rightful position he had even his servants in his father's house had it better than him where he was right there i mean so so then he arose he went back repentantly back to his father he says father i've sinned against you and against heaven i'm no word i'm no longer worthy enough to be called your son that's the problem many people come to god that way they think they've been too wrong they've done too much they're not worthy to be a son or daughter of god but the father had no interest in a son being a servant this was never his purpose never his motive but when his son came home he said son you're going back there's being a son because you are a son amen you don't become a son because you said so and you come back you already were a son hallelujah so so so the son because of what he had done thought i cannot be a son no more but the father said you're still my son my blood flows through your veins you look like me now you're starting to act like me because you've come to your right mind hallelujah just like us we're a crazy people i mean being under the spirit of the devil we were mad that's right and i'm saying we because i'm very much a part of that week the crazy stuff but one day one day god came my way and i came to and i came to myself harlow said lord there must be a place and he didn't want to keep me a servant he never that was never in his mind no you're my son you're going to be restored as a son as the same thing with you and i friends he doesn't want to serve and he doesn't want a second-class citizen he wants a son and daughter of god hallelujah and he came back in his rags they think about the father the father didn't even respond at first when when the son says i'm not worthy to be called thy son but he says to his servants bring forth the best robe and put it on him put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet now i just want to ask you the question do you think that his rags that he that that you know he was slopping around the pig pen and they're all dirty and filthy do you think he had those on under that best rope no those would have been taken away so god just doesn't rob us in his righteousness but yet we still feel the old rags underneath we still feel the sin and the pains of guilt and you know all those things you know we don't pack that under us hallelujah but that's all taken away where you've been walking son or daughter i don't want you to remember it anymore i don't want you to feel the guilt of it i'm taking your guilt away i mean that's what the blood of the cross does it takes your guilt away hallelujah it takes our regret oh i wish i never did it he said no no i've taken care of it you don't have to walk with that guilt or that shame or whatever it is you don't need i've taken care of this hallelujah hallelujah amen and shoes were put on his feet he walked a different kind of way hallelujah walk in bare feet you got to be careful where you walk but if you've got shoes on you can just walk hallelujah ring was put on his hand signifying he had authority hallelujah amen hallelujah just like brother ram said the blood is a bleach it's a bleach hallelujah and when that drop of sin falls in that blood brother says it breaks down then the ink becomes bleach now i don't understand how that works but you just can't find that ink no more hallelujah his the prodigal son's identity was in his family was in where his his father said he was to be not where he had been in the world amen so the word so the word that was given on sinai was the identity of israel when they came out of egypt it wasn't their slave marks it wasn't the you know disappointments of the past or whatever happened the scars and the damage that wasn't their identity their identity was in that word you know it's been told when when when um you know the jews pardon me came out of the concentration camps in camps in um you know europe and so on that many of them when they got on the boats they went back to the promised land some of them still had their prison garments on but one of the first things they did when they left there and they came into the promised land as they were those robes were those those prison girls were taken off and they put on new clothes so the things that brought them there they were taken away now they are new people amen they weren't just survivors of a concentration camp but now they were living in their own land i mean and we've been called out of this concentration camp in the world highly but don't carry don't don't wear your prison garb amen amen god doesn't want us in stripes he wants us in the robes of his righteousness highly where everyone looks the same hallelujah amen so their identity now that was just israel in the natural who follows me remember their identity was to be in the word it wasn't to be but the problem is they started to look around to their neighbors and try and do what their neighbors did our identity is in the word of god not my friends not my community not even my nation though i love this nation i love my community love my friends but my identity is in the word of god this is who i am help us lord jesus amen amen now in this day we know the book has come open and it's to bring us back that we would realize that we are bible christians the the seals came open to reveal christ it's not doctrine it's a person being made known and we realize that our identity isn't our husband which is the word of god amen this is who we are we no longer have our own identity our identity is his identity hallelujah that's incredible when you think about how god would would come to us in this day because remember a trumpet gives a certain you know a true trumpet gives a certain sound and so god would vindicate a trumpet in this day and he would prove now this is not this man's opinion but this is me speaking through this man hallelujah that's why to me the message was over vindicated amen remember remember with moses he went down to the elder the elders of israel and he showed the sign and they believed and they worshipped that was it that's all that needed to be done but then it was meeting after meeting service after service doesn't matter what country it was in god came down and revealed the thoughts and tense of the hearts over and over and over again as a scriptural sign a scriptural voice so to me it's over vindicated but god had to do it in such a way to say this is me this is not him this is me this is not his idea this is me what's happening now that that gospel trumpet was giving a certain sound because god was saying no this is me imagine if we're in the army we're in the legion and you hear the trumpet sound and you know that's the cow cavalry charging and you look around and they don't come someone else comes you think now hold on that sound did not produce what it said would produce because instead of horsemen you've got some guys carrying water or something you know so so you would not have faith in that trumpet sound because remember if you're in the heat of battle you need reinforcements you don't be standing there just you know just us here our unit we need reinforcements especially the enemy's really pressing but if you heard that trumpet sound you could actually it would actually give you courage boys the cavalry is on its way holy and you hear that trouble then you hear the beating of hooves and then and then they charge into the battle and then and then you can win the day so that trumpet sound was vindicated by the horsemen coming you're following what i'm saying well it's the same thing with this trumpet that sounded i mean if the prophet stood there and said now i'm waiting for the angel lord and nothing happened you'd have to start questioning hold on i thought he's declaring he's here but where is he right and if he said now this message takes us back to a true pentecost but we never ever go to that pentecost well you have to begin to doubt is this a certain sound but then now when we see when he says now he is here and i think brother billy paul said he didn't even didn't even need to say that because such an atmosphere of god coming into the place everyone knew he was there or we could actually say when he says we've been restored to a true pentecost and we've experienced that pentecost who's gone up to the upper room who's received a true pentecost god indwelling you in his word manifesting out of your life you can say no that trumpet is certain highly so if those things have been made true now what he's saying about the future is has to be right because if the past is true that that must be true too how do we have confidence in the scripture there's many things that are not fulfilled yet and there's lots of debates and all those things about but we can say well this part was interpreted by bringing it to pass god did he'll do that as well that's how we can have confidence actually we are walking you know people you know when brother bran's ministry came on the scene people say bible days are here again we've always been in bible days we are still in bible days we are walking in the pages of the scripture but we need to say lord may i see jesus and his program lord may i see you and your program amen so now a prophet would come in this day now remember when the word comes open in any place it it gives people faith to manifest or god comes and manifests in their life the promise of the age so moses you know yo the word came down on mount sinai it gave people faith to take the land and they did right caleb and joshua they took the land because it gave them faith actually boys we're going to receive our inheritance jesus came the word came open and people went from a spiritual condition to the baptism of the holy ghost gave them faith faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god once they're under the prince of the power of the year but now they're walking in faith they're walking by the faith of the son of god hallelujah so now it's the same thing today this word that has come open in this day the books come open it gives us a rapturing faith it doesn't just give us faith you know you know the faith that the that the law gave gave them faith to take the land is everyone following what i'm saying it gave them the faith to do it right those who did not believe fell in the wilderness but those that had faith took the land yeah i think it's amazing that younger generation 20 years and down i believe it was isn't it incredible that they broke the cycle of unbelief you think about the homes that they were raised in some of them were never saw egypt but they were living with parents that were told you're not going in imagine the atmosphere imagine the atmosphere that somehow they broke through of unbelief and doubt when they actually begin to realize mom and dad the promise is not yours but it's mine and you can't stop me getting my promise there was an anointing in the camp that anointed the younger people now i'm not saying those who are 20 and older are not going in this is different this is a spiritual thing you understand but but they there was a younger generation there that broke the cycle because normally what happens you see traits in families stuff happens bad stuff happens and unfortunately the the children take on those things so bad stuff really happened there when they said we're not going in you think the children would just adopt just take on what their parents have taken on and they'd become stiff-necked and they'd reject what moses said you know and you know and they would not believe the promise but something happened in the camp where they realized we're going in you may have to die here in the wilderness mom and dad but i'm not staying here with you i'm going into the promised land because the promise is mine hallelujah and we're living in the same time oh lord jesus may we have just such a doesn't matter what the previous generation has done they've done what they've done let them do what they've done this is another day amen this is another season in the word may we go in and take every part of the land itself you know there used to be a great fear remember a trumpet gives a certain sound a real trumpet gives a certain sound i trust i'm not wearing you out with these with these comments but now isn't it amazing that that the prophet told us our position just like moses told the people of israel certain countries had certain borders moab had their place uh ammon had their place these ones had their place and then joshua defined the you know yo expanded on that a bit more and then now we have a ministry coming this time and says now okay the world that's their inheritance the foolish virgin they have their place right the great she's got her place this system's got their place but then he begin to define the borders or the inheritance of the bride and he would tell us in the feast of the trumpet speaking of the persecution he says the jews have their place you know he actually god used him to say this is everyone's place remember he's chosen us our inheritance hallelujah i'm just glad where i fall into aren't you hallelujah he says on the face of the trumpets now he says now talking about a a persecution that's here he says not upon denominations but upon the bride but here you'll get it the bride does not go through that time so speaking of the great tribulation you know many people thought that they would but the bible says not the church will but not the bride can't you see ministers can't you see that brethren you say well the church has to go through the persecution for the perfection of it you know many people believe that people still did but people did back then and they still do they think the church and the bride is just one lump and they all have to go through a tribulation but we had a certain sound in this day declaring to us and saying the church has to go through that because people say well people have to go the church has to go into the tribulation for its perfection but he says the blood of jesus christ perfects the bride a man who chooses a wife don't put her through a lot of punishment he's already found grace too with her she has found grace with him he engages to her and if there is anything but me he'll keep her from every place to turn her hand his grace is so great upon them and so will it be upon the bride and so it is on the bride we are worthy creatures deserving of hell but his grace holds us through it look how many lost and blind how many how many sinners was there in the world the hour i got saved have you thought about that amen god save me for a purpose and i'm determined by his will to do that purpose i don't care what anything else goes i want to do it so he so says that his grace is so great upon them and it will be upon the bride and so it is on the bride the other kind of grace we live under is incredible his grace is amazing you may think well it's not that amazing but when it strikes you you'll find it be amazing hallelujah so his grace is so great upon us that the bride cannot go through the tribulation he will keep her from that hour amen when the darkness of ours comes then jesus comes i meant to catch his bride away hallelujah he would say in the invisible you the invisible union of the bride of christ hallelujah now notice we're not only that but we're going to the wedding in the sky and you are wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmerited grace a wedding band of grace and merited of your own god did it himself he knew you before the foundation of the world so he slipped the wedding band on you there hallelujah you say where's the where's the engagement ring you were born with it amen it was on your he says he slipped it on your finger before the foundation of the world hallelujah there put your name on a book what a thanksgiving hallelujah praise our god you know that takes a lot of stress away that takes a lot of uncertainty away hallelujah you think about the grace that god is guys you know this is your inheritance you're not the tribulation is not yours we're going to look at what's not ours the tribulation is not ours trouble is in ours fear is not ours hey the devil might try and put it on us but fear is not ours sickness is doesn't belong to us yes holy worry doesn't belong to us we're gonna look at what doesn't belong to us yes hallelujah amen he says in the unconditional covenant that god made with his people speaking about abraham now then down out of babylon down down into china when abraham's father and abram he was abram first then he had taken with him sarah his his wife lot the nephew and while down china there perhaps lived a peaceful life probably out probably in the morning picked berries and ate them and went into the bush and killed his protein for food and then at night eat some more berries peacefully then one day abraham no more than any other man maybe as far as we know coming out of babylon perhaps an idolater but god by election god does the choosing we can't choose god does the choosing we have nothing to do with it man said oh brother i sought god i sought no man ever sought god it's not in a man to seek god no man at any time or any age sort god it's just vice versa it's god seeking the man not man seeking god jesus says no man can come to me except my father draws him right so here he comes now here's his here's abraham now he's called by god he comes out of babylon and then he and he's taken into the promised land so now he has received the power aiming to take back what the enemy is taking from him because he's now in in his inheritance amen now abraham we know he was just a farmer he wasn't a soldier he didn't have a trained army but when the kings and stuff were fighting and lot and his family were taken captive then he armed his trained servants i mean and he went and got back everything that the devil stole the enemy stole from him right but you see they were not soldiers they were just servants that were armed but the reason is the reason he could do it is because he was living in his inheritance i mean so many times we just have to fight with what we got that's right i remember it's not really ultimately it's not your size in the battle that matters it's god's size in the battle that matters hallelujah david will be anointed king i'm just going to skip through this maybe quickly but you know david david would be anointed king he was from judah the philistines would invade and that invade into judah so now they're coming into a son of god's inheritance so of course goliath's got to die you know when the devil comes on your ground he's got to lose i mean he's got to back off he's got to back down he's got to get out why because he's come on your inheritance just like abraham could get locked back because the devil came onto his ground and that was part of his possession though lot wasn't called like abraham was he could go get him back hallelujah so david was just a shepherd boy yeah it's amazing i was just thinking about yo god lays things in the scripture for a certain generation maybe if it was spoken maybe thousands of years ago but it's for and and and it can be a blessing and a strength for all believers down through but there's a certain people that will actually take that scripture and we'll and it will fully manifest you know i was thinking about that brook that david would would would walk across after he had spoken to saul and you know and and david would testify to saul how he killed the lion and killed the bear and goliath is just like them he's going to die too you know and and and saul was impressed by his courage and something and saul said well you're going to be our champion and he tried to put his armor on him and it didn't fit his you know fit him because an ecclesiastical intellectual vest armor doesn't doesn't match a son of god i mean so david went down and as he was going down to the battle it says he crossed the brook and he chose five stones now you think about those stones i believe god knew he'd pick up those stones so before the foundation of the world god knew those stones and he knew where those stones would begin and where they would end and maybe no doubt as god was forming that valley and forming that brook and you know he would place those stones there and and because he'd be thinking my son's going to need these stones he's going to need these stones so i'm going to put these stones here amen for his use now there would have been maybe many other people would have crossed that brook right he wouldn't be the only one who crossed the brook and maybe other people saw those stones and thought those are good stones right that'd be perfect for a sling remember david wasn't the only man who used a sling a lot of other but they were not inspired to pick up those stones remember david didn't just like grab a whole bunch of pebbles and stuff it in his bag it says here it says here if i can find it first samuel 17 and 40 and he took his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook so he actually as he is crossing that brook he was inspired to pick up those stones he chose them he didn't say this will do he you know he looked at goliath look at his weight you know what's the best stone and he was inspired to pick up a certain stone now i've got a point in saying these things so he was inspired because god knew before the foundation of the world that stone is going to end up in a forehead of a giant that's going to be its destination and my son's going to need it now in the scripture there are many verses that have just been an encouragement to people down through the ages but there's a people that come at a predestinated time and actually it's in their lives that fully manifest hallelujah just like those stones maybe others saw those stones maybe they thought they'd be useful but only one elected son of god picked them up hallelujah so i believe gardner's great wisdom and foreknowledge actually predestinated those stones who believes that i believe god you know god ordains a weapon for the age hallelujah and he thought to himself when he was forming the world my son's going to need these whitney when i send him to the earth he's going to use these stones and one of them is going to this particular one's going to kill goliath amen so it's just like the scripture is i believe in the scripture you know there's quotes in the messages there's scriptures in the bible that have been laying there for years laying there for years and many people no doubt they have read them or heard them spoken and they have given them strength and comfort to many believers down through the ages but there are certain people in a certain time that the full potency of that of that scripture will be manifested in their lives well can i have an example of that yeah sure psalm 16 9 therefore my heart is glad and mice and my glory rejoiceth my flesh shall also rest in hope for thou shalt not leave my soul in hell neither will thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption i believe many people would have read that psalm and they would have been encouraged by that psalm don't you amen they would have read that simon hallelujah my soul's not going to be left in hell god's going to take us out amen and my heart's going to be glad and all these things but this scripture was the one that jesus went to the grave with you know this was the scripture that he went to the grave with that by this one scripture he knew he would his body would not stand the grave so i'd say it's just like david with the brook many people saw those stones but david picked up that one stone they'll kill goliath and the scriptures laying there but there's when the right person comes at the right time did it have value before that it sure did did it help people before that it did but what to one it was the full potency of the revelation contained in it was manifested and jesus went to calvary as a man with this one scripture remember he had to believe the word about himself he had to believe it right and he went there he went to calvary with the scripture knowing that he his body would be in the tomb but it had to come out before corruption set in earlier brother brown would say the sin and god provide a place of worship 1965 he says now notice jesus was so sure of what he was he knowed he was the son of god he knows he was virgin born he know that every scripture manifested right itself through him he noted so perfectly till he said to them builders of the temple that day he said destroy you destroy this temple and i'll raise it up in three days think of that destroy it i'll raise it up in three days why it was written of him it was a written word of him david said i'll not leave my soul in hell nor lee sorry i'll not leave my holy one and hell not leave his soul in hell neither will i suffer my holy one to see corruption now jesus knowed what uh that that was he no question in his mind and he know that 72 hours the body corrupts sometime within that 72 hours he was going to come back to life again so he said you destroy this temple i'll raise it up again in three days why the word was written of him it was written of him because he was the manifestation of god's written word for that day well there's got to be hallelujah there's got to be brother there's got to be somewhere god's manifested word of god today and that's the same thing for he spoke of these days and he said what would take place in these days he has already told us we know what's going to take place and we see it being manifest and we see it manifested in you then you're in god's church outside of that you can call yourself methodist baptist or anything else it'll never work there's only one meeting place that's in christ jesus oh today oh how today i would uh that everybody would see that see how to get in being baptized the bride is part of her husband the church is part of the word the manifestation hallelujah so there's a he went to calvary with that scripture he following me so this i say there's stones in the bible there's scriptures in the bible and in the message that are for a predestinated people at the end time i mean many things brother brahm said it's for right now it's more current and actually real now than it was in 65. hallelujah now the word is not just a weapon but it also gives strength to the user now i'm just going to sorry i yeah i don't want to be too long but i just want you to think about this now the word is not just a weapon but it also gives strength to the user now samson samson would would would come to a place where his own people tied his arms up with with with flex and they and they actually gave them gave him over to the philistines but then when they but then when the philistines you know shouted against him it says in judges 15 then the spirit of the lord came mightily upon him and the cords were upon his arms um because it became his flex that was burnt with fire and his bands were loosed off his hands and then he found himself a new jawbone of an ash and put forth his hand and took it and slew a thousand men so there he is he's bound up spirit of god comes upon him he breaks the bands and he looks around and there's a jawbone a new jawbone of an ass yeah it's amazing the devil i doubt very much the devil when that when that donkey walked along and breathed his last breath and died i doubt very much that the devil said hold on boys we're going to get rid of this thing this is a weapon of mass destruction we're going to get rid of this thing because this is going to do my kingdom great damage you know you know the power of this word the devil doesn't really believe it if he really believed how powerful this weapon was right he'd say boys we've got a we're going to get rid of this thing he tried to in the past but he just let it go because in the hands of the predestinated maybe other people saw that donkey just said hold on we're just going to leave this thing alone others have seen the bible they say we'll just leave this alone but in a predestinated hand that jawbone of that donkey was a weapon of mass destruction and it's the same thing with this word not just in the hand but in the mouth of the believer this becomes a weapon of mass destruction and then so now samson picked it up and i don't know what the philistines thought of a man he's a man there's a thousand of them a thousand men and he's this guy just broke these ropes mother thought well maybe they weren't very strong ropes anyway you know and he picks up this jawbone of a donk and he starts running at them yeah you know maybe you thought well we just hold our spears on this he's going to impale himself but it wasn't long after that they were all dead they were all dead amen so that jawbone didn't look like much on the ground but in the hands of an anointed son of god it was a weapon of mass destruction as the same thing with this message in the and the mouth of the bride it's a weapon of mass destruction against satan's kingdom it'll do great damage amen it did great damage all the way down through the ages it'll do great damage today hallelujah so it was a weapon that defeated the enemy but then after this amen he says that it came to pass that he said he cast away the jawbone out of his hand and he called that place uh rameth lehi and he was saw a thirst and called on the lord and said thou has given me this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant and now shall i die for thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised saying basically you've given me this great battle but now i'm gonna die of thirst but but it says now but god claimed a hollow place that was in the jaw and there came water there out and when he drunk his spirit came again he revived wherefore he called the name thereof um in a hakori that's how he said which is in lehi unto this day so the weapon he used to kill the enemy refreshed him he said i'm not going through a battle i just i just get it refreshing hallelujah so so this word is a weapon against one but it's refreshing for the user i mean he went back to a source of power i mean i mean i mean i mean the weapon that was in his hand and he actually revived because god caused water to come out of it hallelujah god's word worked yesterday to defeat the enemy it works today to defeat the enemy and it will work forever to defeat the enemy hallelujah amen we know the prophet was instructed to store up food amen you ever use quotes against the enemy it's a weapon but it strengthens you hallelujah he was told to lay up in in the tabernacle tape load after tape load of barrel fulls of food oh thank you but god gave you a weapon but it gives you strength hallelujah amen what has this got to do with the sound of it going that's everything because remember dave was told to rise up kill your enemy hallelujah so that sound gave him strength right but but the lord went before him and killed the enemy amen so tape load after tape load see that's why you know we want revival we want god to live in our lives but if we don't give him any time apart from now how is it going to be if our minds are full of so many other things how's it yo sure we've got to think about our job we'll think about our family you know there's things we've got to think about but if we if we put our heads into netflix for the rest of the day rest of the week or games or whatever you know whatever it is if we put our heads into that how's god going to live when our spirits are so contaminated with other stuff you know we have a law of liberty we should be looking into amen hallelujah amen why did these tapes be laid up well same reason david you know god left that stone there for david my children will need this just like that donkey dying my son's going to need that jawbone hallelujah amen you see the lord did this because he knew that the word of god defeats the devil any place anytime anywhere and in his great temptation in the wilderness the lord did not use his great power on the enemy but he used the word he says now listen just a moment the word of god will defeat the devil any place anywhere anytime on any condition amen when jesus was here on earth the father was in him god was in christ to reconcile the world to himself we believe that all the fine qualities was of the father wasn't him but when he met satan look what he did he brought it into your reach and to yours and yours and all of you he never used this great gift and you get glad he brought this weapon into our reach doesn't matter how what we think about ourselves he says here's the weapon it's not you know you know this is not like a weapon that you've got to become a certain age whatever you use it no no if he put it in our reach amen when satan comes and says if thou be the son of god turn these stones to bread he said it's written men shall not live by bread alone he'd taken him up on the pinnacle of the temple jesus said it is written he took him up on the high mountain showed him the kingdoms of the world and said i'll give them all um all to you if you fall down and worship me jesus says it is written see always has written the word the word of god is a seed accepted in your heart believe it water it testify of it take it as your own personal need and god will bring it to pass hallelujah so the word is this you know the word that we live on amen is the same word that we use to defeat the enemy with hallelujah now we have to be very careful now no no i'm just going to finish with this you know the devil's like a big crow that comes along and he wants to build a nest he comes on it into our thought life and he wants to build a nest in our mind that all we think about is what he gives us amen but but we have a double barrel shotgun you know what you know what you know a birds build nest they don't build it overnight they take one twig or one branch whatever one at a time and slowly they're building and the thing is you may not be able to stop the bird flying over but you can sure deal with it you can stop it building the nest hallelujah so same thing with thoughts the devil put a thought in your mind are you gonna let him build it with another thought or you just gotta take that double barrel shotgun what's the shotgun we have the older new testament amen we have the dumbbell shotgun or the older new testament and we never it never runs out of bullets it's on fully automatic have you set it to that setting right and you have a right now to blow that bird out of the sky it depends who you allow on your land see you know what if david said oh goliath make us home here he would have made his home there basically get off you're gonna die i'm gonna kill all of you this is what's going to happen you say well what are you talking about a shotgun well brother braham says he says now if any thought comes by well maybe you know what happens is the devil anoints our emotion see we feel a certain way and then the devil takes that emotion and uses it against us you know i believe eve had a longing because she's built the way she wanted to have children she did i believe so but it wasn't the season or the time but the serpent came along and you know i began to talk about these things you following me you know this discouragement comes in the devil says oh this is why you're discouraged and he begins to get you to look at yourself he takes our emotion and then builds a nest with his thoughts upon that emotion you got to be very careful cast down everything that exalts itself above the word of god amen amen he says if any thought comes by well maybe it couldn't be so maybe get it off your mind right quick think on things that's positive never let a negative thought pass through just don't let it stop anyhow if it starts through keep your mind keep your thoughts positive he says jesus don't think sitting there in a wheelchair that you're hopeless helpless you're not don't let that negative thought ever pass through or don't let it anchor you can't stop it from going through your mind that's right but don't let it stop but the old farmer said you i can't keep the birds from flying over my place but he had a double barrel shotgun said i can sure keep them from roosting amen so you do the same thing you too see don't let them roost let them pass right on through now here's the shotgun to use both old and new testament it's a double barrel it's very good too i'll tell you it keeps them all away [Music] hallelujah we're not hopeless no case is helpless no cases cannot be done amen we've heard the sound of it going it's time to rise up recognize that we are the children of the most high god he has chosen us our inheritance and it's a real good one amen amen we're going in a rapture the bride is going in a rapture amen and while we're here on the earth anything comes into our inheritance get that double barrel shotgun and start blasting he said i'm not a good aim you'll hit him eventually you'll get him eventually don't worry about oh i'm using ammunition don't worry it doesn't run out the gun doesn't overheat just keep firing amen hallelujah amen if the musicians could come we're just going to land right there well how do i use a double shotgun go through the scriptures okay i need one no weapon formed against you shall prosper that's a good one don't you think so my peace i give unto you not as the world gives but my peace i give unto you hallelujah i never leave thee nor forsake thee the lord is my help he's my strength he's my song he's my shield when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i hallelujah you know these just just start to go through the psalms you'll see there's a lot of ammo go through the epistles there's a lot of ammo hallelujah amen amen let's stand shall we this morning there's stones in here you know you think about it when god had this word written he inspired paul to speak things had different speak he actually thought of us he says my sons and daughters are going to need this in 2020. and they're going to pick it up and their giants are going to fall hallelujah i want to sing amazing grace um not the change of god one the um yeah the other one i mean let's just have the words that is grace amazing to you his his divine influence upon your heart and his reflection in the life [Music] hallelujah [Applause] amazing grace
