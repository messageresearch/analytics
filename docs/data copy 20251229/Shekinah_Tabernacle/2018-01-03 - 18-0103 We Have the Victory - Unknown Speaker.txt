name we ask Amy Amy nobly thank you musicians amen good to have everyone here like a national gathering nice I mean god bless you all thank you for the specials as well though really I mean he's in this house hallelujah I mean let's just go to Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8 I know this is a familiar scripture to all of us and we're gonna go to revelations chapter 12 or so she's here now let's all read this together Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever one more time Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever amen so he is the same yesterday today and forever let's go to Revelation chapter 12 and some of my favorite scriptures revelations 12 and 7 and it's season there was war in heaven and Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not a lot that word not neither was their place found any more in heaven I'm glad that and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the and the kingdom of our God and the power was Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused us them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb this is where we step into the picture and they overcame him by the blood of lamb and the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives until the death rejoice therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them were to the inhabitants of the earth and to the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth he hath but a short time a men made Lord blesses word you may have your seats this night I just want to talk about victory tonight I mean I believe we have a victorious walk amen we are more than conquerors amen and I just really I just want to I just want to talk about you know we have we we have a picture here in Revelation chapter 12 but but as I'm as I'm going through the service just keep in your heart over in Hebrews he's the same yesterday today and forever he doesn't change maybe how he how he manifests himself or his physical form a change he's the same one he's the same God that was that was in the garden as the same God that was with Noah the same God that was all the way down through the Old Testament into the New Testament and we're still living in Bible days he's the same God today Alleluia so now there's something about you know God he always fails himself and we understand in the beginning you know he failed himself in a pillar of fire and he took on different forms but ultimately he was wanting to dwell in the soul of man he wanted to dwell behind human skin I mean he wanted to not just dwell he didn't want to dwell necessarily in a temple made by hands though he did dwell in a temple made by hands for a time but that was not his final resting place his final resting places the souls of men and woman hallelujah boys and girls that's his final resting place now what he wants to do now this is basically my whole sermon in a bottle as as brother Armando and police say he was defeated in heaven God he was defeated Satan was defeated in heaven and now he was cast down to the earth and God as I'd say it this isn't just my words God chased him down to the earth hallelujah and now he was defeated in heaven and now he's being defeated upon the earth and the same one that defeated him in heaven is defeating him upon the earth hallelujah he may be fighting in a different format he's the same yesterday today and forever and we have to have confidence now that when God has spoken his word it will come to pass Satan may try and hinder he may in stop you know he fights you he tries to hinder your walk he does everything he can but if you are part of the bride of Jesus Christ and he should say he's talking about me just now I mean nothing will stop you manifesting the promised word for your day and we know ultimately that promise word is is going to be a change in these bodies hallelujah we're going to go from this dimension to the next dimension and I trust you what you'll say when you step that first you know second in heaven you'll say it was worth it hallelujah every battle every burden every trouble every hardship every care that you cry out of desperation or pain or whatever it may be it will be worth it all I'm in that first second heaven hallelujah we'll be there amen it'll be worth it trust me it'll be worth it I'd rather have you know the worst day being a Christian I'd rather have that every day than the best day with the devil or a lifetime with the devil that's wonderful hallelujah amen so now God we understand if we go - we gotta flip Ian's chapter - sorry yeah chapter 2 Paul is speaking about let's go to let's go to verse 5 now God has always failed we understand there and he says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but he made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross now we know this word form in the Greek and and oh brother Georgia be able to pronounce it just right but and my and my butchered way of pronouncing it's a morphe and it's the form by which a personal thing strikes the vision the external appearance so he changed this form it was the same God that was in the Old Testament he was staying there before the scribes and Pharisees he said before Abraham was I am I'm it's the same one that spoke to Abraham was now speaking to them he just changed his form he became a man Alleluia so he changed his form selves the same God the same God all the way from before there was anything is the same God that was present among us I trust he's not just with you but he's in you so the very creator of heavens and earth is in the believer I mean - the same one that said let there be Sun Moon and stars you know they talk about a Big Bang I don't know how the Big Bang happened but here we are and God made it and God created it and this is so the same one that created all things I trust us in you Alleluia so he just changed his form now he defeated Satan in heaven and cast him out upon the earth and now God through his children has been haunting Satan he's been haunting him he's been he's been a tormentor you know this may sound maybe I shouldn't say it this way but a devil means a tormentor so the children of God have been a devil - the devil I'm just going to know because many times we think he's on my case he's after me I'm being tormented by him we got it round the wrong way it's totally it's totally the other way around we were not here we are not sent to the earth to talk to be tormented by the devil you have been sent to torment him hallelujah because he was here in Eden and he was determined this is going to be my creation I'm going to be like the Most High I'm going to be worshipped like him you know this was his purpose but then God God is not going to let him be you know have the final say I mean God always has the final say hallelujah the devil never has the final say God has the final say when I reach to the end of the Bible it says Amen hallelujah is the finality it's all done and before you get to the Amen Satan and all of us Pete you're his servants and his angels were cast into a lake of fire hallelujah but I keep living past that part I mean I don't go to that place I continue on hallelujah so he comes to his end and now he knows we read he has great wrath because he knows he just has but a short time and a time comes to an end haloo he knowses you know he's got a countdown clock he sees his incoming so he's got great wrath and then here you come and you're born and soon shaped at iniquity come to the world speaking lives totally lost spiritual amnesia have no idea where you come from where you're going you know and that but God before the earth began said I'm going to I'm going to send them I'm going to send them as as the final voice to a final age and I'm going to express them upon the earth and in my season that I choose I'll reveal myself to them and they will know me not just as their father but as their husband hallelujah is their comforter as their provider as their bridegroom I mean as they're all at all as their provider as their healer is their Redeemer hallelujah and then and you could say well yeah that's happened to me hey man hey we may also rejoice why can't we just rejoice oh but I'm facing all this and all this and I don't under the centers just rejoice I mean David was David was there Saul had had died on the battlefield you know and he's there and he's and he's there with his men and zyg leg who you know was I was a city that they had you know all of their wives and everything with taking office as as captives and here he is and his own men better followed him his own men that have become outcasts with him join themselves with him they they they begin to plan go read it they say it's stone him let's don't David and what does he do he encourages himself in the Lord that's how he got through that great big trough he just encouraged himself Lord I was anointed by your vindicated prophet as a 9 to 5 indicated prophet and the Spirit of God was more than just oil coming on my head the Spirit of God was with me from that day and you're with me to this day and he encouraged himself I'll be king because you've made me king I was anointed by Providence here I'll be king and his waist and fall to the ground hallelujah let's jump a few thousand years I mean we've been anointed by a word a prophet poured out an anointing in this age I mean the world is coming to its place but the bride is standing on her feet having to her position her Louisiana just trust I've been anointed by a word and that word says she'll be virtuous sinless perfect maintenance image I mean so much that husband and wife become one that the Prophet says she is him hallelujah and you've got to say that's me amen he's made me thus I'm becoming that hallelujah I think we should rejoice he delighted he encouraged himself in the Lord his own friends were turning against of he just encouraged himself in the Lord amen and what's the finality of the story he becomes king helu they possess the fullness of the promised land I mean his son builds the temple glory to God I mean we just got to encourage ourselves we have the most glorious gospel don't we know where the most glorious word Moses study says not a people has ever received a word like we have received and I I don't want to argue with with him but we have a far greater word we have a far greater covenant thank you very much we have a far greater word and promise Benna than just a natural law with a natural land Amen do we know we have a far greater thing you say well you know it's not how you feel my new year's resolution as I want to go beyond walking by how I feel we're not called to walk by feelings we walk by faith and faith is not feelings faith may bring feelings right if you really love someone you feel love if you're really happy you're happy if you're full of joy you've got joy it's not just words either words coming out of your mouth but the devil can take your feelings and beat you and beat you and beat you and you thought you're going to oh yeah yeah I thought you were more than a conqueror I thought you're overcoming why do you feel so down and depressed or whatever more and he just beats you we got to go beyond the feelings it see in Hebrews 11 it was by faith it wasn't by feelings it was by faith hey man Jesus said you know he perceived that they believed brother Brahim said do you believe you didn't say did you do you feel it do you believe it do you believe the promise in spite of what you feel and in spite of what you see in spite of what you may remember amen do you believe it and that's where it all hinges on do you really believe it and there's got to be something on you that says in spite of how I feel about it I believe it it's true God's proving it over and over and over and over and over again Alleluia his word is true if he said the word - now saying that the world is going to be destroyed and now I received that word and he built an ark saved this household all the animals they moved to know they're carried over to a new land that same word came to that same God spoke to Abraham and Abraham fulfilled his part of the word amen in the word came to Moses who evermore and then now God was veiled in Moses he says I have come down Exodus 3 I have come down I've heard the cries of my people I've come down to deliver them he hears your cries you got to make the scripture very personal he hears your cries he hears the burden the things you may carry he hears them he's mindful of them I mean though the answer may Terrier we'll come amen you just got to understand Lord you know everything why did why did the Prophet why did God use the use the Ministry of Elijah and the stay to tell people their address and where they're from and and and what they are wearing when things were yo things are happening in all these big details that's because God wanted you to know I know everything about you you may think no one knows but I know everything about you I'm mindful of everything you go through you're my child my eyes upon you hallelujah he knows everything about us and so now God came down he says I've heard the cry of my people and he says I'm sending you I've come down to deliver them and I'm sending you so God took a man and then he took this man that's a two year old man with a shepherd staff and he went into Egypt and it was God and and Moses and the devil was in Pharaoh and so now the same ones that are in heaven and now upon the earth it's just the mask has changed you see and so now in heaven the devil was defeated now what's going to happen on earth if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he was victorious there it is victorious there now he's going to be victorious here it's easy to go through the Old Testament but I'm going to bring it to our day but if he was victorious and now his his Moses let my people go they were God's people they weren't Moses his people that was God speaking first person through a man just like David saying and the sons my God my God was Alpha se caen me and he's looking right at Calvary and if you are sitting there in his palace and he's crying out those things you'd say why are you saying my God my God was hell for sake of me has he not established your throat has he not put you on the throne yeah has he looked after you but he was God uh speaking first person through me and so now here comes here comes Moses let my people go Satan says I'll not let your people go and then you skip a few a few chapters ahead and death strikes you know Pharaoh's kingdom and what happens there let go amen and you read even even before the plagues really begin to fall God actually tells Moses and Aaron death is going to strike this leg the firstborn will be killed he tells them before you go read it and so and so now here's the pattern and now here comes Moses comes the end of his ministry remember he's the same he's the mighty Conqueror he's the mighty Conqueror he's conquered everything that can be conquered hallelujah and now here he comes Moses goes off the scene and then Joshua comes into his position and the same God as I was with Moses so shall I be with thee hallelujah and they said now here comes Joshua and he goes into the Promised Land they come to Jericho what happens to Jericho at Falls what happens to AI at Falls what happens to here in the other city they come again at fault I mean because God said you're going to have this land and they possessed most of it in those days holy because he's the same yesterday today and forever I really want this to sink in because we're going to realize he doesn't change if he was an overcomer there and his children he'll be an overcomer here and his children hallelujah if he conquered the devil there he'll conquer the devil here amen we have to have that confidence this is the God we serve he's in control I mean we're going to receive our promise how part of the scripture how will and testament that he's laid down he's going to make sure because he didn't just die but he rose again Paul speaks about it in Hebrews he says down the you know hey this is my language you go read it but he says about how normally the testator has to die the one who late gives the will has to die and then someone else gives it but now if Jesus died he gave it inheritance but then he resurrected turn to ensure now what he what he laid in his will for you you receive it hallelujah there's what this open book is about that's what this word is about I mean that you would receive everything that God has for you amen oh well where is that I want to I want to have it he'll ensure you get it if you're surrendered to him who wants to go all the way I want to go all the way Alleluia and they said Joshua he said no man will stand before thee Alleluia and he and he tells the Sun and the moon to stand still a different you know things happen because here was God now in a man overcoming and you can go even through the book of Judges all the judges that raise up God is now manifesting himself through those judges and their deliverance to Israel and then you go into the Kings the same thing happens with the godly kings they saw the devil and it's God facing off it's the contest brother branham preaches a sermon called the contest between God and Satan and this contest is going on but who wins the contest you know brother Graham said about the token having the literal life of God God in you it actually makes you feel so relaxed and that doesn't mean you watch the world go by and what happens what happens but now you're in your resting place you're in your hiding place amen letting off the pressure I mean this is a pressurized age but he tells us that there is a place where we can let off the pressure and that place isn't just these four walls I mean this is just a natural building but the place we're really going to lay off the pressure is in him Amy because the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run into enter safe Alleluia and to those who's in the tower whose and him gotta realize either where's this place I can lead off the pressure I don't have to go to a City of Refuge I'm in my city of refuge I'm always in my city I get up in the morning I'm in my city now the City of Refuge is Jesus Christ you'd be like what are you talking about it's Jesus Christ is our City of Refuge I don't go to have to go to here Brodeur different cities in Israel I'm in my city and I go to work and I'm in my city hallelujah and we went out to all when I was in my city wind and Tara's in my city I'm back in wearing that I'm still in my suit hallelujah amen a says once you're in there you can lid off the pressure hallelujah we have to remember where we live amen where do you live I'm not talking about your house I talk about your spiritual where you really live hallelujah we can just let the pressure off amen we're going to remember where are you you're not oh if you're really you're if you are did in your life is hidden Christ with God then you are really hidden away in him you're in that City of Refuge hallelujah you got to remember where you live amen we're in a City of Refuge now we come all the way down through God was with Elijah who won the prophets of Baal or Elijah who won Jezebel or Elijah Elisha won just go through the whole Bibles to contest bring God and Satan who ultimately wins Satan does not win he's on the losing side he can't change sides we can change sides I mean we were born on Satan's side but by new birth hallelujah we go on the Lord's side that's the side we're meant to be on hallelujah amen now God doesn't just wanna I'm maybe jumping a hit but he doesn't just want to have this victory because he's a family man God is a family man and he's a husband and both those categories they love to share their lives with their family well they're your family family mentor husband spouse but this year there have experiences and and do things together build the relationship that's what he likes to do so when he wins the victory he doesn't just want to keep it to himself as I'm going to share this victory with my children hallelujah that as I overcame so they will overcome Amen that's why he that's why David David could write the Psalms and you know he could rejoice that the Lord is my rock and my refuge though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death amen thou art with me he could write these things because he had the experience and because God your God uses trials it's waiting to show himself in the trial he wanted the hardship and be going through hardship you say look you've allowed this to happen you've ordered my steps now Here I am in this place you're wanting to show a part of yourself to me in this and I what caused me to see it you have to be looking it's like going to a museum with the tour guide or not a tour guide you can maybe Google about the museum and the artwork and you can get a little bit out of it or you can go with the tour guide who knows all things that's in the museum and he can show you every or she can show you every part of the art and if every detail and you go out that museum saying Wow and you get the magnitude of everything in that place or you can just go and blindly oh let's go here today and just staggering staggering stagger out and you wouldn't get the full magnitude of what's going on you know that way as opposed to with the guide now we go through I'm not calling our life a museum but we go through life and different things happen who's been to a museum there's different different rooms and different art and different artists on so we go into this trial now he's your guide because all the trials that we are faced with everyone in the world has the same trust there's nothing that we are tempted you know it's nothing that we are tempted with it's all common to meet the same trials we have they have but the difference is now we have a guide and he's one to reveal himself through the trial you know he's like thee he's like the one in the museum who knows all about every different room and wants to explain it and show part of himself that's why trials are a blessing because God wants to reveal part of himself and that trial T are you going to be looking for him to do it now Jesus came to the earth John the Baptist and came Jesus God became flesh and dwelt among us he's the same yesterday today and forever nothing stopped him the unbelief of the people didn't stop him being misunderstood didn't stop him nothing stopped him from fulfilling his part of the scripture and he conquered hell death and the grave and now here comes so here he comes and then he ascends and then he says to the disciples wait in Jerusalem tarry in Jerusalem until I seen the promise of the father you'll be endued with power from on high and so here was a group of people now and their humanity they believed and they said will even die for you and all kinds of things but when pressure came on like Peter he denied the Lord the contest came will your faith hold in the and the pressure and his his faith because it was just human faith buckled amen even though he is a true believer he was sincere you know but he began to come under the strain of the trial ain't you a disciple no I don't even know who you're talking about but you're a Galilean you speak like no I don't know this Jesus didn't I see you in the garden no I don't know you know there's a trial because about identification identification in the trial and because now he didn't have the overcomer in him he failed in the trial but now he comes the day of Pentecost and the same one who was full of good know of the word bodily God here bodily there's now in 120 people and the same Sanhedrin now that that condemned Jesus to die has brought these disciples in front of them and they don't buckle under the pressure they said should we please God or surely please men now the devil thought he had Jesus there on the cross but then he come to find out the devil had him and the one that the devil tried to stop coming all the way from the garden the seed of the woman had come and manifested himself and did what he promised he would do hallelujah and here he was and now he thought he had him here but now the time had come where God had the devil and his thing was ripped out of him and he doesn't have the keys to his own house and he doesn't have the keys to his own house till he can't dictate when he goes in or out it's very frustrating when you lose your keys but the thing is when you know and but the key he has you can't duplicate it and he didn't duplicate it before he got them and the one who owns all things yanked it off the side and he can't get them back that'd be very frustrating amen but but he begins to understand now oh the prophecy of Isaiah where I'll be like the Most High but I'll be cast down to the pit this is an emotion you get worried have you have been in a real stressful time where it's out of your control and you don't know which you know it's going to go a certain way and you can't stop it going that way this is times up by a few billions and that's the devil today you think you get stretched he's stressed I'm not trying to sympathize for him in a second but I want you understand he stretched and all these Devils that listen to his lie and fell with them their stress - oh but Lucifer I thought this thing was going to work it's not working because you're here you're you are a torment and a Vicks a Shinto Satan and all of hell just like no way you say oh well I'm just with just a little group I'm only me you know Noah was a vexatious it at all meet just one man this world's going to be flooded get in the Ark and then his family believed eight souls were and even says that the and Hebrews 11 don't have it right here in my notes but says that his life basically condemned the world they condemn the devil and his work and so now the devil is a very stressed person he has a hard day every day he has a hard day every day I want you to think about this because we think we have bad days and here we are where he says in Ephesians I have caused you to sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus he has caused you to go above this world where you're once a slave and walking according to the spirit of the Prince of the power of the air amen but God rich in mercy came your way open your eyes you woke up in the chicken yard a made any real and you heard and you heard mama eagle flying over the barnyard and something and you said that's me I came out of this one this big powerful Amen predator hallelujah amen I may we may be sheep but brother brems said about an eagle and two little Eagle it's you know flies them down into the you know yo-yo onto the green pasture the eaglets get off they have a jubilee and and the mother flies up and keeps watch and he says you know if a coyote went after those went over those you're after those young ones that he'll come down and flog them to death hallelujah that's the same thing you know that the Devils got to be careful because when it comes against you he's got Jesus Christ on his head just like Esther Esther turn the wrath of the King against her enemy amen turn turn the Kings wrath against Haman I mean my life is in jeopardy in the life of my people and he gets angry who would come against my queen who would try and kill my beloved hallelujah and she just says it's him amen and the ones he was pointing to was now dangling here not too long enough that was the dangling hanging on a gallows that he made for her people amen for for Mordecai and yeah this whole world is a gallows not for you this lady of sin world is not a gallows for you it's a gallows for Satan amen gods allowed this to happen it's just like here comes Israel out of out of Egypt and they and if you go read it God tells Moses go here go here and now you'll hear at the Red Sea they didn't just stumble then just got all this run and runner and then here we are know God allow them to walk down to this place it was a death trap but not for the people of Israel this world is not a death trap for you it's not a death trap for you go read the scripture it wasn't it that God did not lead them there to be massacred by the ones that he just delivered them from he allowed them to come there as bait he allowed to come here as bait have you ever thought about this here's my bait hallelujah and then now they're there and they're panicking and even Moses gets where everybody prophets he says you see these Egyptians from henceforth you won't see them again forever he doesn't even know what's going to happen but he says don't worry about this and then now here we are well you know the end of the story what happens to the Red Sea parts over Israel goes to another land and then the enemy tries to follow and they drown and God closes the Red Sea wasn't much you know God uses Moses closer it seemed it was God's doing and then here we are the bottomless pit has come open amen revelations 9 is in fulfillment I mean that hundred thousand thousand demons have been released and they turned that they used man to try to annihilate the Jews in the Second World War in different things but those same spirits are here still upon the earth now why they here upon the earth because the devil knows if he can just wipe out the believers that there's no one that can contest you know you're enter into a you know there's no one actually upon the earth you can say this is mine you are living representation of Adams fallen race that's been redeemed and this earth belongs to you so here you are you get up in the morning you may not even own a single square meter of this earth according to this world with housing and whatever but it all belongs to you this whole world belongs to you Allu you the whole world belongs to you and the fullness thereof so that's just not the topsoil that's every part of it hallelujah it all belongs to you and sin anyway here we are and the God has allowed the devil to come out with all of his angels upon the earth because he thinks he can try and wipe you out but in reality it's actually you just bait but you're just bait is this okay yeah think about no no think about this we are on the winning side one of the favorite quotes from brother Bram I have is you cannot lose being a Christian you just can't lose being a Christian Alleluia and so now here we are all of hellas upon the earth all of heavens come down as well and heaven came down amen to take you with it back into heaven hallelujah that's why we're here that's why he's descending with a shout because he wants to he wants to join himself with the people my beloved I'll carry you away hallelujah and as he sits like Romeo and Juliet hallelujah amen glory to God I'm glad it's that way it's a love affair amen he's not gonna leave any members bright upon the earth win is the Great Tribulation but the devil will be trapped here and all and everything else will be trapped here we'll be having a wedding supper hallelujah and vials of Wrath will be poured out upon the earth and we'll be having a jubilee amen you think Miriam and her tambourine and all of Israel on the that's going to be nothing they're gonna have to sit down and I'll show you a dance I'm not going to try right now a million hallelujah amen hey you took about of deliverance hallelujah we had a deliverance hey man it was just from a natural ant or natural land it was from from the earth up into here hallelujah amen I think we should just have a shouting year don't you think doesn't matter what comes what goes the Word of God and jewels forever amen and he conquered he conquered in the disciples they didn't bow to the Sanhedrin or should we listen to you or listen to God there's a pretty flat answer I think but I think we need a bit of it should we listen to you or listen to God hmm you know you tell us anyway they beat them they did whatever they didn't they didn't hold on to that fear the devil tries to hand you a lot of things he's a very good delivery boy he does he tries to and it can be either through sickness or through a Vincent life try and put something in you to try and break your victory friends will not be bowed you've got to look you gotta look at that thing and say I will not be bad I will not you know it's like Shadrach Meshach and Abednego if he delivers us hallelujah if he doesn't hallelujah will not bow and I think we need a bit of that amen if we're victorious or if we overcome if he heals me hallelujah if he doesn't heal me hallelujah not bow I'll go in the furnace hallelujah maybe that furnace actually did them a favor they were bound but when they came out well actually it was more than just loosening of bands God came down I mean that was the best fire anyone ever been in hallelujah because they had a meeting amen the God that talking about said I'm going to join my children in this trial I'm going to join them in this fire hallelujah and the fire just loose their bands because when they walked out they couldn't even smell smoke on them and there and the band's there the world tied them up in those bands the devil tries to tie you up and a lot of things amen but he throws you into the trial you say glory these are going holy these are going and what happens then they go and your fellowship with your God that you love and the mess of that furnace and you walk out Alleluia I'm glad it's that way so now they so the devil I believe was in the Sanhedrin and he locked eyes because the same eyes kind of eyes he looked in Hebron had now become flesh and Jesus and he was looking at that he recognized a few be the son of God because he wasn't sure but he thought he was if they'll be and then he looked into the eyes of the disciples after Pentecost and he saw no doubt something I've seen this look before the eye color may be different the stature may be different but God has known by his characteristics one of his characteristics is he's he's victorious Amen if you allow him to be just yield yourself and he'll give you the victory so he looked and he said I've seen these eyes before and he was defeated and now here we come down 2,000 years and God has become flesh again hallelujah the same Holy Ghost the other day of Pentecost is now in his people once again amen that he's not locked out by the by by the doors of creeds and dogmas of man that's been annihilated and now God is fully in his people once again hallelujah and then the devil looks at you hey cease I've seen this look before you look at as wrong I may be jumping around but you look at Israel they come around Jericho they don't know what they're thinking about and Rahab tells the spies all of our hearts of the men everyone's heart is melted all our morale is gone we know we're gonna lose this is basically what they say because of you because of you because of what God did for you because of you Gideon is there around the camp of the people of the east and the Midianites and everything and they go sneak into camp and they hear what they're talking about and one soldier says here that I had a dream and this thing rolled down into the camp and busted up or whatever happens go read it and then and then they basically saying yes Gideon's gonna come and he's gonna wipe us out this is the devil's testimony you understand me this is the devil's testimony just like the ones on the walls of Jericho you know to the natural eye they look how big this Spezza and their helmets and look how big the gates are and their walls and everything there are big walls but in the heart of every soldier on that place they were scared they were done they knew their goose was cooked they knew it I want you this is and this is how the devil sees you because and and why are they feeling that way they weren't feeling that way before they found out that Israel was coming their way then they find out you mean those ones and their God and now they're here they start to get worried that's how the devil the devil trembles at you the life that's in you he's not afraid of you as a person but the very God that's in you he trembles at their because that same God that same God that kicked them out of heaven the same God that defeated him in the Old Testament and in the New Testament or whistlin you just but you know what I mean he's the same God here amen you got to look because what does the the Bible doesn't just reveal you it reveals Satan the message brother it says the seals opening it just strips all the layers off Satan shows him what he really is I meant and then now if you take that and you look into the scripture you actually see this devil when brother Graham said you're nothing but a bluff he was nothing but a bluff and he called Satan's hand and he said you had defeated that day on Calvary the angel the Lord is here the people are believing I'm believing you have to go and what happened he had to go hallelujah and this and Satan when he looked into the eyes their property recognized I've seen these eyes before I've seen this one that's when I thought I destroyed this but here he is how Louisan flesh amen and now just like the wave sheaf offering in Leviticus 23 the mature Pilar field was cut down I'm going to close with this maybe it was it was cut down and waved in front of the and you're in front of God by the priests and they are saying thank you Lord the rest of the field will come forth like this part of the field I mean Jesus was cut down over that Pentecost the life was waved hallelujah I mean because there were those in the field that had to come to the same maturity in life I mean when brother have preached it as the rising of the Sun I mean it wasn't just a nice Easter message it's a declaration it is the rising of the Sun the so8 has risen hallelujah and it's in the fullness of its strength in this day hallelujah and that was done that you would know that that ministry was demonstrated that you would know this is this is what I this is God saying this is what I do with the redeemed son who had a timber that could find a bus or wanted to kill people when he was young you all know the story don't you I mean he was born totally without God without anything but then God came and God took him and he gave his life and God filled him with His Holy Spirit transformed him amen didn't know no enemy could stand before he goes into India all the religions of India challenged they say this Jesus is nothing this gentleman come to the meeting tomorrow you'll see who's God hallelujah and he has the vision beforehand of praying for the blind man and he challenges them all if your God is really God you come and open his eyes they sit there like nothing and then he prays and the guy's eyes come open because he had a vision it was so this didn't happen thousands of years ago friends this happened in the 50s a man has been documented it really happened hallelujah and so God was showing this is just a bunch of religion this is the true and living God this is me and nothing could stand before him all the days of his life now we can't just put it off on the prophet because the same life does learn him I trust us in you and that same manger Lord that was with him as with his bride hallelujah I mean so that means now I trust when the devil looks in your eyes he says I've seen this before I've seen this before I don't like it I'm going to try and destroy it you know why the devil comes on your case because he thinks if he could just beat you back down then that'll be it what do you think this you know you know you because everything goes peachy you become a believer in this like you've just hit the hit the gravel and you're going into the ditch you know what's happening it's because when God is proving his salvation but the devil is allowed to do it because he's trying to because you have now risen up and you say down with this down with this this table he will not be my ruler is the rebellion going on there's a revolution let's restore it back to the people Alleluia and then now so there's a war what happens when rebellion happens you know the people are suppressed they're put in prison this shop there whatever more you know because he's a revolution going on and the devil tries to do that to you and the spiritual amen but then it comes a time where the King has office throne he's under your feet hallelujah and you're in charge you're in charge amen Jesus was in charge every step of the way of this journey even even even when he went to Calvary as a man he was in charge he said no man takes my life I lay it down and if I lay it down a little I'll take it back up again amen and you should be able to say the same kind of thing no man takes anything from me no man take my life I lay it down I'll raise it back up oh that's not too much I mean let's have some musicians to come let's have them come please amen let's sing victory victory is mine lujah now let's sing let's
