God take your shoes off Moses holy cow shoes off Moses you're holding I'm the Lord like [Music] how wonderful I wondered this morning driving here if there would be any testimonies today I think it's been at the wilds and we had a little open mic and some taste so many times so if you want to take your seats and I'll just ask that question this morning if there's any testimonies and in my heart I was expecting our Minister to be back brother bin and I was thought he would bring something wholesome Foss and I still think he would he's gonna so yeah I'll just I'll just open up will we'll have a little one hand out mic ready for there we go really for any testimony I see a hand god bless you brother hump off oh we've got the poop at my going as well so yes I mean god bless you I'm just hoping that brother man it's recording there so that brother Ben can also have a share of the testimony I will try not to be long but the testimony is about my car well let me say our family car not mine it's a family car and I I just want to say that you know everything that happens in the life of a believer whether is a physical thing or you perceive it as a spiritual thing or you perceive it as a physical thing it has got some spiritual implications and that is why that is what I want to base this testimony on that in as much as it was the vehicle that we were trying to bring from South Africa to here but there were some strong and spiritual influences or changes or things that the Lord wanted to do at least in my life or in my family life amen we we we planned to bring the card from South Africa to here and then we looked at the shipping company we call quotations and we booked it in and then from the very first day that the cow was supposed to be picked up in Johannesburg to Cape Town because Joanna's back is inland there were problems from the onset from the first moment you know there were problems so the car was supposed to be picked up on the 3rd of January it was not picked up it was picked up sometime I think in February or late and it was picked up late at night everything was just late Late Late Late and I even thought for a second that perhaps we took a wrong decision to try to bring the car here but little did I know that the Lord wanted to do something that will go way beyond just the car in my life amen taken it went to Cape Town it stayed in Cape Town for more than four weeks it was it was jumped by the shipping companies that were supposed to pick it up from the harbour one of the reasons was that there was just a stop at one time that the car was supposed to be picked up and loaded into their ship it was not picked up they said the ship could not even come into Cape Town the car was left second time they took cars and other like cargoes that came even after our car they took ours was left so you know those kind of things that to come and you pray and you ask God questions and you start to ask questions and the cars only picked up later and then there it left and then now I was started to worry the integrity of the shipping company I was worried about because I didn't trust him now I was not sure whether I must pay them or I shouldn't pay them will the car ever be here then the devil brings many things at the time that some ships some shipping cargos was lost some people lost how are some people lost cars and then the devil start to really come and be the tool that God created him to become in your life and he started to really come and you know work on me I think God was trying to do something in the end I saw that God was doing something then the car came it went all the way via a gr Singapore you know you can track it on the internet and you can see the next thing we were checking then we couldn't trace the car we couldn't we couldn't see where the car is we've got no idea there's no reception of GPS nothing because just somewhere in the middle of the ocean and you don't know when it is at that time when now you pray and say Lord you know I need this car and you are the one but the devil said no this was not supposed to come in the first place don't you remember then the devil reminds you things and he preaches to you he is at a time when you know you he makes you forget what the Lord said to him that no it is written it is written and you forget and we we spend so much time praying for that car until I I was studying to be worried and that's why the devil wants you he wants to stress you he wants to to to work on you on your faith to a point where you will start to doubt God and as long as he can get you there that's his will and as long as you cannot give him the the podium or to listen to him that is your win the Prophet says and look you can get worried you can get stressed you can get and whatever I want to be but the question is is that going to help you huh is that going to bring the solution towards your problem the answer is no so why then stress the Prophet says it only causes you diseases whether spiritual or physical it only brings more trouble for you to worry so if worrying cannot help you it can only bring worse then why do it that was one of the challenges that I had so okay the long and short of it and we check the car again we could see it now is in Indonesia Indonesia Australia Australia Auckland upland it arrives here the local agent who was supposed to help me he's the guy who'd never even call you you call him send him an email only then he can give an update all of a sudden the guy started to be the one calling me not me calling him and I said maybe the Lord is doing something here our excitement when the car arrived in Auckland It was as if our kai has arrived here it arrived in Wellington we're so happy clearing I knew that the MPI customs are going to to send the car for the second order you call the second inspection where you pay extra money it took it didn't even take the only stir weekend when when brothers wants two brothers and sisters West Auckland so the car was cleared in less than 24 hours they did not even intended for the secondary inspection I said my the Lord is answering and we're so happy we praise Him we worship Him we thank him for answering our prayer but we never realized that no we are not there yet when on took the luggage send a car in for registration that this was this was the pic now of my trial or personally my test for really to trust in God in every little detail what God does he does not do things in my country we say God does not cook and have me have me half million or half baked cake he prepares something to the end sometimes you have arrived you are to the edge to the very edge where you think I thought here I'm going to fall please help me he says no you are not going to fall just trust in me he says now I'm saying on the edge you are looking at the court you know you are looking you say Lord I'm going to fall he says no that's come he wants you to the very edge so that you can put your trust in me I'm trying to make you think about being on a high mountain on the very edge here is a four and youth he says no just raise your hands don't try to hold just leave everything in my hands he brings you there then the car came gave them papers give them everything all of a sudden of something that we never thought about they said they want something called a statement of compliance man that became a weight that I hated to hear because back in South Africa our Kaiser GM a vacant South Africa GM has left our shores so they don't operate the South Africa anymore nobody wants to hear them nobody wants to hear the name GM because they left the country people lost jobs the economy you know it had an impact on the economy even the people who were selling GM products are upset so you told GM they don't want to listen to you call South Africa I call my dealer call everyone nobody wants to do this thing now we check on the car the car was made in Indonesia no no not Indonesia where Thailand I called people from Thailand I sent an email they said no sorry we can't help you go back to South Africa as I am from South Africa they said you must come to you then they said no the car was designed in Brazil the designer and the designer authorities Brazil so go to Brazil I sent an email to Brazil they never even bothered now at that time the enemy you know his way c'mon you here's the car we excited it's just here in Lower Hutt it must be registered you know what it took the longest time in lo had then the whole time it lives on Africa that's where my faith was really tried and then it went on to and fro sending emails everywhere we praying every night I think I even brought my request here so many times that we must pray for our car then it happened one day that my wife just said you know what this car was made in Thailand I can hear you I think he didn't know that I called Thailand she just sent an email to the very same people that are contacted after an email that says Miss damper we cannot help you she send an email to them those guys they said okay send up the details of the car she sent the details and then they within four hours they replied with the document I was like what I thought I was dreaming because I called them and I've got an email saying here's the email this gave us the documents within 24 hours and they they did not sign the documents send an email back that please this must be on the letterhead signed and authorized by a designated person they did that and they send it to us as if all this time there was no problem then we send it to lower hutt then the car was registered so the longer showed about it is that the Lord have got a solution to every big or small problem that you have it is not about the problem the issue is not about the problem the issues about you and your faith in God so he can bring anything to trust you to ensure that when the devil comes before him to say ah but I don't poke does not trust in you that the Lord can confidently say no devil you a liar go and test you the Lord ones dead it's not about food or job or car or anything but he uses those things to try and ensure that in the end spiritually there is a positive results so I just want to give God the glory and the honor because the guy is here but after all it was not about their car it was about us and I'm happy that the Lord achieved what he wanted to achieve and that he can only take us from that point to higher levels through other temptations one of my favorite codes I like to talk about brother brother Beckett he's not a figure he said you know you must be Christians who who'll say God thank you for the child because it has made me a better person not Lord don't ever bring me that to me no thank you Lord bring more so that I can be better god bless you so quick another testimony is just there in Kiwanis and the no DA's fellowship last night and it just dawned on me again so a few a few Wednesday's ago I was I had a little mini Simonet and I was pointing out the distances that people can travel and all of a sudden is the same thought in the same spot on the other side of the of the world so well we we're about twelve thousand kilometers away from where we grew up me and brother Paul but me and brother Paul grew up about a hundred kilometers from each other and we are now on the other side of the world and I love him and man I love that guy Oh Luke Wallace is a special to us oh so now when we came out here we sort of took a step of faith and coming to Wellington and I really I always said if there's one place we'll never live in New Zealand that's Wellington coming here was quite hard and leaving the work that I was doing there and coming into the city it was quite hard and I didn't really know what to do so I thought I'll just take the first job that comes up on trade me and they hung them up and they said yeah come and start with us so I come up and I did my first two or three weeks and I hated it I absolutely hated it and I'm not very emotional and I think I only cried once and my dog died and I was to the point sitting in my decade that I was so worked up and frustrated that the tears were running down my face I was just so upset I just hated it so much and I was stressed because I knew the money that we were earning was not enough to support us and Wellington it was you know only just enough to buy and I was stressed about that knowing that we were living with Andy and another time and so they looked after us but when we go out on our own housing I so work that said I just need to listen and I hadn't been listening anything wrong so I just press play a reading from Joshua he not maybe not discouraged and see and wherever they'll go or so blessing we never come home Wellington looking for a blessing Jacob he never went for the blessing for the birthright we came to Wellington because we knew this was a good place to be we didn't I'm looking for the blessing that the Lord promised will bless you and it's just like a part and it's learning apart and it's received it's a part and God can pardon you but if you don't exceed the pardon it's not a pardon T and it's the same with us promise see dope Leslie if if I trust and trust in me and so after that I just said okay Lord I'll just trust you I'm here for a reason I'll just trust you and so I worked at that place for six months and he used me and ways to counsel basically was very very way with people which has been quite good and hopefully we can hold onto some of those friendships but then I seen a small head on the bottom of a trade me listing and I don't even know why I'm quiet about it but I just rang up and asked about it and I had a good feeling about it and I went and met the guy and talked about what they were doing and I said I yeah sounds good but it's a bit risky for me to come it's a new company and I said I'm not interested and so I left it at that and then two weeks later he rang me back up and he said I have you been thinking about the job and I sort of said I sort of had that the job was based on bikuni and I didn't want to move there and I didn't want to travel and stay away every week so I said I have I like the opportunity but unless you've got a full-time job in Wellington I'm not interested and he said I well and a couple weeks time there will be full-time work in Wellington so he said why don't you come in and meet the owner of the company as well so I went in and met them and they're both very professional type people and nice nice people and so it's a few random things started to happen so first off the guy said to me so why don't you come in and meet us and maybe it will be a match made in heaven and I thought that was quite funny coming from just a normal person and okay yeah fine so then I I rang someone up I might even be my dad or someone else I can't even remember who it was it was a mouth of somebody else and they said oh maybe it's a match made in here but I'm sure it was dead well someone random that would say such a thing so that was twice I was like okay what's going on here I've never even heard of this place our Coony so I ran Chris up to talk to Chris and asked and tell Chris about my job and and he answers the phone he's like ah hey bro I'm just some on the train going through our Coony it's like I've never even heard of this place before so I was okay there's something to this so I said oh that's the Lord's well when he wants me to be here I'm just going to lay out what I want I'm just going to ask for what I want and I just laid it out to them and they said yeah we'll give you the job and so I went back to my old employer and I handed in my notice and he got massively mad that I was leaving and told me to get off site immediately without my notice period so that was okay I went and told the new job that the boss had fired me for handing in my notice so he said okay that's fine we can start you but for the first week you'll have to govern spend a week in our County before the work in Wellington starts yeah just you know like you've got a lei there's so many promises in the Bible but if you don't receive that promise and actually have faith for the promise then you won't receive the promise so we just say thank you Lord are trusting for we're believing for a Nadine keeps saying to me as she was getting stressed with the money and we were taking money out of savings every week and she said you said the Lord was going to bless us here where's that where's the blessing and and just something inside of me was saying just wait we just have to wait we just have to trust don't worry about it like brother I was just saying don't worry about it because worries not going to do you any good he's made the promise just trust with the promise and the promise will come god bless you brother James thank you sing a song shall we and it's a song that brother James introduced to our little church oh what a problem me there is a source [Music] there is a storm in time the dreams might be [Music] free trial through everyday my savior stand the fair so when the road [Applause] leaves you tied and all you strength is gone and your heart feels tall remember God in the store take courage for the batteries and when the waters rise he calls my name and he fits me come how do he holds my head lest I should falter and makes me stay Oh [Music] when the leaves you tired and all your strength is gone and Hartfield stone remember God that's greater than the store take courage for the battle is the Lord's sing that again so when the road you are feels you tired all you strength is gone and your heart feels too it's greater than the store take courage for let's do verse 1 again verse 1 there is a sword in times of me that gives me hope that brings me peace in every try through everyday is my savior Stan my only the congregation when the roll leaves you tired and worn all your strength is gone on and you father you told remember God is greater than the storm take courage for the battle is alone amen thank you Lord Jesus and as we welcome brother Adrian to the pulpit this morning let's sing oh sweet Jesus let's make him feel welcome and let's enter in oh sweet Jesus take my life all its faith in Ling so let's try your the all only thing I've heard um that's right I sir completely wrap your surround me sweetly as I hear you softly say you let's sing that again whoa sustained my life all it's been so let's try the only thing [Music] [Music] amen racism [Music] god bless you Saints is a wonderful to be in the house of the Lord and I just look at that song up there and it says that talking about your strife sand and problems and may the Lord take those things from us and I certainly believe that he's doing great things in our lives as we sit here this morning he's done it's been doing great things in our lives all the way through our life but the thing is brothers and sisters we need to be able to recognize those things that he's been doing in our lives before we even come to the Lord amen you know this is the first time I've actually been in this building since you went from the earthly to the heavenly but it's a nice place it's a nice place and I just asked to was asked yesterday to take a meeting this morning I thought well that's just amazing isn't it one day's notice but I have to be out of here at twelve o'clock to catch the ferry to the South Island so I'm just passing through very very quickly so if I if I cut things short and I'm gone at 12 o'clock it's not because I think you're going to stone me or something like that I just have to be out of here and you know the ship doesn't wait for us so let's just bow our head chewy Lord Jesus we are in your presence Lord we're at or more gathered in your name Lord you said that you'd be in the midst of us Lord and Lord we are a multitude of people Lord different backgrounds and different experiences in our lives Lord but you're the one that's gathering all those particular varieties of people together to make up a great body that you'll take in a body change Lord and Lord we're living under the influence of our theophanies because Lord God you brought a message to us to contact that's theophany that's beyond and that great eagle anointing was the only thing that could come in our midst and connect us and Lord this new birth of this hour is to connect our soul to our reality because these bodies Lord you said is not our reality and our prophet could come and he said you have never seen the real William Branham because he was on the inside of that house of a flesh body lord I pray come this morning Lord God and I just pray that you take over the meeting and we want to remember to your brother being right now wherever he is and PNG I think of his Lord that you would anoint him you use him Lord in a mighty way Lord I know the people well over their Lord are such gracious people law they're such rule or respectful people Lord and I pray Lord God that you'll just bring the preacher and the people together there Lord God for a great blessing to flow Lord so Lord that they could come to maturity law we ask this for your glory in the name of Jesus Christ amen oh god bless you thank you musicians I really appreciate these my goodness we young fellows here okay thank you this is our hearing this morning and when I come into a meeting like this this is actually just a very very I would say altered version of something I preached in our church a couple of years ago and so I don't want anybody thinking this is a loaded sermon it's not a loaded sermon but it is loaded but there's not a loaded sermon against somebody and what we need to do is understand or what the Lord has been doing in our lives all the way through what he's doing now and what has expectation is for us as we're on this journey so if we will turn to 1 Corinthians this morning just a flick that up and my subject this morning is the husband meant is harmonizing his varieties amen he's harmonizing the different varieties that is in the body so by election God must bring you to an expected end is that right because of the genes seed that's in the soul God must bring that gene seed to know it's reality but the thing is were the gene C than the soul Satan has got all his demons targeted on you is that right and he's trying to get you to not be able to stand in your identification and stand with power and withstand those things he's trying to wear you down and what he does he uses the human mind in such a way to complicate you and let's just look this morning at the scriptures I'm going to read this up here and Apostle Paul he's the message of the first church age and we know that by Apostle Paul every star every minister is patterned off Apostle Paul's outright brother babe says I preach what Paul preached when he went beyond the curtain of time he could look right back to that church age where Apostle Paul who met the pillar of fire in that second Exodus he could say I preached what he preached because how could he do that because brother Branham it the same pillar of fire is that right and so here's Apostle Paul and he says do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from youth this is your only personal written in our hearts known and read of all men that's a letter for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US written not with ink but with the spirit of god the spirit of the Living God not of tables of stone but in flesh the tables of the heart and such trust have we through Christ to God would not that we are sufficient of ourselves amen no matter what you do not there's no merits of yourself that will get you through anything it's God doing everything for you and it's that you having to let go and let God take care of every situation that you're in because there is a law of God and the law of God has let go and let God but many times you want to hang on to something hang on to our personalities hang on to our past hang on to our complexes but God must break those things I met not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God is bow heads Emily Lord I've just pray you should take these words this morning Lord Lord I cannot finish the sermon because it's such a large sermon but Lord just give me the highlights that I need to preach to this church Lord well we asked us for your glory in Jesus name Amen my goodness be it you may be seated it's but dry up here now the prophet of God says that God is a God of variety amen so that means he is not going to be a cookie cutter God that is going to stamp everybody out the same way and you must understand that God is not interested in what you want to be he's interested on what he wants you to see us because when God looks at you he's looking at you from eternity he is not looking at you from the the the realms of Laodicea where people are trying to make themselves in the image of something that not meant to be now I've been in the message 35 years so that's a lot longer than some of you have been are born and I have seen many people pressured to be the way others want them to be amen and the ones that pressure these people are actually working against the Lord then you meet people brethren who become inward thinking because of their history their will go in history and they dwell on the hurts and the pains from the past and God must break those hurts and pains from the past because that is hindering him from taking you further praise the Lord excuse me I haven't got a suit on this morning I had to get on the ferry so I had to hip to be a little bit secondhand and many people they just fail to be able to grasp what the Lord is trying to achieve in their lives now the thing is there are seasons for everything in the Bible there's times and seasons and at least yes he says a time for this the time to live a time to die attempt to plant the turn to harvest there are times and seasons for all things there's a time and a season when God does not use you there's a time in the season where he does use you think there's a time in the season when he's finished with you is that right and you must be able to identify the seasons of God in your life because if you don't understand the seasons for you you'll get complexes and just think I'm no good now this person's bigger than me office minister preach is better than me you cannot go by what you feel about yourself you must die by what the Word of God says remember there was the time in the season for Elijah he had a certain time with God used them did he go to complex because everybody he thought everybody had abandoned him and then God had to lift the seal off his life and show that there was 7000 that help not bail their heads to bow in the same way as our prophet in choosing up a bride thought he was the only one left and God lifted the seal of his life to show that there was us coming in the future so that when the Prophet was finished with we could step onto the sea now season so the Prophet had his season now you've got your season and then that season is when God is going to magnify who you really are praise the Lord John the Baptist had a season how long did God train them for 30 years or something like that for how long six months and here was John watching prophecy oh I tell you something brothers and sisters as there every time we must watch prophecy is right now you cannot come to church and say well I'm just going to pick my bags and wait for the buddy change you must be watching prophecy and John knew the Messiah must come and so he is watching his ministry had been going for such a certain amount of time and then when the prophecy of the Messiah was coming into plain view he knew his time had come to decrease because now the fullness of the word was going to increase John had a light for his day but now the focus of the Shalom the rising of the Sun was coming for his day so we must identify what God is trying to achieve in you now I'm just trying to get myself into a place where I can see what the Lord's opening up to me now when you come into this work you have six seals of your earthly our pilgrimage everyone goes quiet you have your six seals of your earthly pilgrimage but when the seventh seal was revealed he shows you your eternal pilgrimage is that right because the purpose of the seventh seal Christ coming was to lift the veil on you you were walking around for a long time veiled but God had to lift the seals on your life and reveal to you your reality praise the Lord because we came into this world six seals affecting us until we met the seventh one and then when the seventh one revealed himself to us personally I meant not dispensational II now personally he takes us what he shows where we come from and he shows where we're going to and then what does he do by new birth he wipes out the record of those six seals in their lives is that right because you are born with a book of life understanding of yourself you were born contaminated with a book of life of yourself because place the profligacy is from the time you're born at the time you die everything is recorded of you but God must marry a virgin is that right and a virgin has no history oh my goodness me I hope you understand this now I virgin has no history so it does not matter what your natural pass was like path past was like God must bring you back into a spiritual virgin position and that is the pair of the blood and this day brothers and sisters there has never been a day with the blood of Jesus Christ is so powerful that he could break the fooders of just vacation and said you're never did it in the first place praise Lord you'll never get anything he puts it right back and abstract right back to the devil II says it slaps it in his lap easy you never did it that's my confidence that no matter what my past did I never did it now I'm a virgin to Christ I have no history and you could not go out to rehab and tell her that you've got a history as a prostitute and live in the face of Selma because what was Selma the Seventh Seal marrying a woman that once had a past but it was wiped away and revealed her name in the Lamb's Book it's time to look higher than our earthliness amen because the devil is pounding people and pounding them and pounding them and I get pounded all the time too but I tell the bag we need to concentrate on what God is trying to do the prophet of God says it's like Michelangelo had this big slab of rock and you could look at that rock and say that's rock that is a in front of us here as a rock that's none too flesh amen it was a bit of earthliness that was none too flesh but inside that rock was a vision amen but all of that God had to do was to remove the parts that were not a part of the vision if it's what God was doing is he reason removing the book of life parts of us that is not a part of the vision and sometimes you get chopped here drop there chop there chop do as I say praise God because inside of that rock of humanity there is a vision coming into plain view a vision that will take you in a body change because we're living in ladders here a time where there's so many pressures so many influences everybody's going around with their little cell phones and trying to be like some Dame in Hollywood or something like that but the thing is God has given us a message and he says look on this and be changed and how are you changed in an instant no it goes from glory to glory to glory to glory unto your in his glory in the glorified body praise the Lord because this is a day where God is brought a messaging you could hear from your theophany amen and you have to be dead developed into the image and a dark room get that that's why Satan's Eden is here is that right say all weren't such a bad place Satan's Eden must be here on the earth because you cannot develop the negative into the positive unless you've got a dark room to shine the light through so it's time to for us to stop grizzling about Satan's either and say praise God and then when the picture is developed God gets rid of that guy praise the Lord are you with me now this is matching time the prophet of God said and things that there are to be this is a time where God is matching you to your reality this is the only thing he's taking in a rapture is his character in you amen now you think about how that God is such an amazing creator that he goes right back into your history hundreds and hundreds of years all the way back because an eternity you have a perfect image a perfect body his hair right and then that body you might have blue eyes or you might have green eyes you might have certain color of eyes and certain color of hair and things like that and God who knows the beginning from the end he's been plotting the course of all of your natural ancestry to match you with something in another dimension now think deepness think deep all the way back great kick back take Benoit in break break break break gain there they got the eyeballs for each other and they got married and had kids and they're so they're married this one and this one married yet when kids were coming out all the way for hundreds of years is there right hundreds of years and you think it's a role in an accident that you're here in 2019 and ain't Amen because he must mix this with this to get the right color here and this for this to get the right kind of here if this was this to get kills in the hair this was this get right colorized this what this and is that right so you're not an accident he's been mixing these all together so that you could be in the image of that which you'll go to an eternity the only thing is it won't be 61 years old like me and brother and Nene here it will be a young body praise the Lord so here we are and bodies that has an expectation and I'm preaching to this body your time is going to come to an end soon and this pissed house this rubbish tin is going to be disposed of and we're going into our reality form and that's not the end of the story because the theophany is not the end of the story the end of the story is a glorified body in the Millennium and a new heaven and the new earth after that is that right praise the Lord so you are a privileged people to have your names in the book and he said he said then the scripture says my sheep hear my voice is that right and it's not the voice of a man he says ain't a stranger you will not follow now where did you hear that voice in the beginning you heard his voice and eternity because when he was creating the heavens in the earth you were in him is that right you were in heaven you heard him speak to speak to speak less and speak this praise the Lord he said when Jesus went to Calvary you were in him quote don't get quiet on me now this is a quote when he went to Calvary you were in him when he paid the price he you were in him when he went down into hell you were in him when he rose from the dead you were in him is there right so how do you know you were in him well that same voice was a creative voice that was in Jesus Christ because before he was a flesh man for the form of redemption he was in theophany form I met it from Elohim to Melchizedek to go and buy and from the locals create all things but you were in Han you heard the voice now when you were in him at Calvary and afterwards you were there paying for your sins back there in him now how do I know that I'm elect nor do I know I'm elect because when God brings the word for your day and something in your heart says my this is real that is proof that you are in him back then because the blood speaks of things to come amen and we're living in the time of the voice of the blood which is speaking greater things than the time time of El of Abel the bread is speaking greater things now then when Jesus was here 2000 years ago prays a lot but I say there's the same Jesus but he's just moved on and you must move on with the inspiration that the Lord is putting out in this hour and you must move away from how you see yourself and see yourself as how God sees you amen my where are we going with this praise the Lord I hope you're getting something so far because you've only got 50 minutes left now when we look at Saints in the Bible and the experiences that they went through it's easy to think that they were the end of the story and that there's no continuity of them we can accept what they went through to make them what they are a man I called this and the angel was there I want you to keep this thought the angel was there we can accept what Ruth went through say praise God for ease we can say look what Esther weighed 3 say praise God for Easter yeah we can see what brother Brandon went through is say praise God for brother Ben why just love reading about brother Brandon but do you like reading about yourself because I want to say praise God for a God is doing in my life praise God for what he's doing in your life because you are a continuity of what came when a prophet was here you must see yourself in a continuity because he said just near the end they'll come another surge of the Holy Ghost what to do to bring to your remembrance what was spoken back then and when you see what he was talking about coming into reality form now you anoint that word of the Prophet and you say Lord this is for me it's not for that person so much it is for me and I start anointing the word for the day that we're living in I'm not looking at somebody else I want to see what am i that anointing the word and bringing it to pass pays a load so when we look at something else somebody assets some these these are expressions in the Bible it can become impersonal to us and so too often we keep Jesus back in history come on there some people like to keep Jesus in history but Jesus is the god of the I am he is the I am in my life he is the I am he's not the I was in my life if he was the I was in your life you're still right now back in the denominational system you cannot have him as I was in your life he is the ever-present God and he's moving and he's moving and he's moving and you must come into a union with the I am part of the words praise the Lord so now we can often go we can go to the Bible we can quote our revelations ten one is a mighty angel coming down and we can see brother branham's part revelations 10 seven and his Melchizedek stepping into some Kentucky swamp but dust or whatever and he's speaking to us and he's bringing a word out to us and we can say praise God for revelations 10:1 revelations hits him and but what about revelations 10 8 to 11 Amen the voice of the Archangel praise the Lord what is God doing to you in this hour now think deeply now about the visitation of an angel we like to look in the Bible says yes this prophet had a visit from an angel and we rejoice in the visitation of the angel now let me just give you a quote which I haven't got on the board here brother Branham says and my son's been preaching on it a bit I think he just stole it from me action she's got a fresh from the throne evening when Gabriel came to Zacharias when Gabriel came to that priest what did he do he came at a specific time angel was come at specific times and seasons now the prophet of God says when Gabriel he introduced the first coming and Gabriel were introduced the second coming so when does Gabriel suddenly turn up Gabriel always turns up mainly at the time of the evening sacrifice now remember this word evening sacrifice not the morning sacrifice of 2000 years ago but the evening sacrifice so Gabriel comes to Zacharias and Zacharias is a man who is offering up and since at a particular time so he's offering up instance in the time of the evening sacrifice and bam he stands a man in front of Zacharias and he tells him that his wife is going to bring forth a scriptural prophet of Malachi chapter 3 and here is Zacharias listening to the angel a man six foot tall maybe olive colored skin and you know what I'm talking about saying when that meet the permit the prophet in Greensville techno cave and so the angel is speaking to Zacharias and Zacharias was a priest who should have known the Scriptures and he did know the scriptures but when the angels to him what was going to be scripturally for food through Zechariah's wife he didn't believe it now I want you to understand something why did the angel strike zecharias dum was because he did something wrong that day or well he did what did Sakurai's do wrong now remember Zacharias his wife Elizabeth I think what was an old woman there right so here's this old woman and this angel has come to tell them she's going to bring forth John now John is not a priest's name now write the name of a boy must come after the same name as a father but he gives him an unprecedent is this Zacharias and he should have said amen to Gabriel but he didn't because he didn't believe that God could go and bring life in an old woman like he did with Sarah and like he did with the Shunammite because he was a priest he knew the Scriptures amen he knew from genesis to malachi in the scriptures and he should have anointed the words of the angel oh my that's why there's so many dumb message believers because I know what is structurally there and they won't anoint the words of Gabriel in their own lives and they become dumb and it's a turn church week after week dumb and - there comes a time when God is going to use that same angel to anoint another woman to bring forth another life when when Elizabeth brought forth John it was only at that time that Gabriel could bring back his words to him but that same Gabriel when he went to Mary she had a wonderful attitude now with that angel Gabriel comes to you it's to give you an understanding of the scriptures that's pertaining to the person that angel is going to amen Gabriel is always giving a revelation to the person he goes to and then when he comes to that person they must anoint that word and bring it to life in their own lives that's why when he comes to Mary he finds a different kind of a person Elizabeth's problem wasn't here and Elizabeth they have had a problems just Sakurai's when he comes to Mary she says well this is an amazing thing the seals have just been lifted off my life amen he sir he's just a he said showing me my name in the book he's showing my name in our Isaiah chapter 7 verse 16 and she's she then she sees the angel up they take the scriptures and bringing those scriptures that around the earth for 800 years is that right prophecy went around the earth 800 years from the time that I Sai spoke it and there was a time and a season where that prophecy going around had to connect with a woman and then the angel showed her what she's fulfilling and she said be unto me according to your word she anointed the words and she brought forth the first coming of Jesus Christ and the prophet of God see see there st. angel what it did to Mary is the same way it comes to the bride at the end time nothing about this here's Daniel from the book of Dana of course and then you're he's a he knows that there there's he's been looking at the books of Jeremiah he met and he said there's 70 years that they are going to be down under the control Babylon and he knows this this 2 years left and he needs to have an understanding at a certain time the time of the evening sacrifice here comes Gabriel always at a certain time and a certain season he comes Gabriel and Gabriel goes and unfolds the mystery and Daniels life to connect them with the heavenly and given the understanding of the political world that was going on all around them and brothers and sisters don't you be too worried about the political world out there God has got it all under control is that right in the Book of Daniel chapter 7 I think he says and the heavens roll all things God puts into power who he wants to put into power God takes out a power he wants to put into power it is not the vote of the people that they think they're putting this person into power so you can go and complain about this person or this person to that cows come home God put cement so we shut up and say thank you Jesus amen I am NOT going to fight the politics of this world because God uses politics to fulfill his word for the bride praise the Lord so I don't care about rush I do not care about America I don't care about all those things I care about what God says is going to be pertaining to me in this era because God is going to use politics to bring a boycott upon us to even to activate the faith we already have you have to have perfect faith now don't expect the squeeze to bring it on you have it now how do I have perfect faith by knowing the Scriptures that pertain to me in the Bible praise the Lord it's not just a faith to believe that you're healed or the faith to take away your headache it's a faith by knowing what is spoken of you that's why after the seals were preached by the bed of preaches perfect faith because it's not pulsations of faith it's a perfect faith and perfect faith what comes from that love comes out of all that perfect faith praise the Lord we need to anoint the word for hell day my brothers and sisters this is not a time I know I don't all over the world shake every church up like that but I shake myself up to know he was I Daniel so when Gabriel comes to Daniel it is to awaken him and guess what with Daniel sorry when Gabriel comes to Daniel and when Gabriel comes to Mary what does he call them beloved oh my goodness he calls you beloved let's turn to Revelation ship that ain't aunt five might as well just forget about my notes it's a waste of time mister the Revelation chapter 8 oh my goodness me brothers and sisters I hope that you catch these things I just love it when the Lord opens things up you know just supernaturally they're right brother nd here's my buddy is by preaching buddy this fella and when he had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of a half an hour now where was the location of that in Revelations 10 revelations 10 was the reality of what was happening in Revelations 8 verse 1 they're right because it's seventh seal but what should the watch now and I saw the seven angels which stood before God and to them were given seven trumpets and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer watch these words now brethren and there was given unto him much and since at the time of the evening sacrifice incense was offered up unto God who was what was happening in Revelations 8 there was the evening sacrifice was now coming into operation and Gabriel comes in the time of the evening sacrifice to break the mysteries over your life and the Bible says in the evening time there shall be light so in the evening time we are living in the time of the evening sacrifice amen and Gabriel revelations 10:1 christ himself has come to show you how to anoint the word for this day by your prayers because instances prayers going back to the Lord to pray for things and season here must pray in season that's why Caesar the Lord's Prayer let it be done on earth as it is in heaven is that right so we must know what is heaven expecting of us now bring it down onto the earth if you understand now you must pray in season your past is not the season my goodness me can you get that brethren your past is not the issue your past has taken care of it's under the blood God don't see it no we must anoint the word for this error and Satan don't want you to do it oh look what you did oh look the complex that you've got here what God's will fitted back here is that right and we come and we carry these problems into a meeting and God is trying to do something with people but that bear down by their dark ages because because everybody's got seven Church ages in your life dark ages but God wipes away the dark ages is that right he puts it on there's blood and God does not looking at your dark ages he's not looking at your past he wants you to see who you are in this hour and start anointing the word and bringing it to pass and then a church comes into unity around identification praise the Lord my goodness me breath been preachers victory day now why would he preach Victory Day amen why would he preach Victory Day what did he preach victory day before the seven seals were preached amen he preached victory day after the seals were preached if he's the seven seals gardens and pressing in the preachers of the three day and you know wearing preached victory day at a place called Sierra Vista Sierra Vista they are how you could see the Mount I went looking at some mountains right now some mountains ions here amen and he's preaching victory day now why would he preach Victory Day well it's like this Redemption your souls Redemption was paid for at Calvary Amen but did you know that the Prophet said that you did not become a Christian when you gave your life to the Lord it goes quite when I say that he said you were always a Christian you were a Christian before the foundation of the world but when you gave your heart to the Lord you just recognized you are a Christian so what the Seventh Seal does he takes you back to eternity and guess what it don't matter what you do wrong by election you cannot be lost by election look you can do some any lick and do some things willfully wrong amen but he says you'll pay for every bit of it David was he left look what he did he knew he'd you know what he did eventually go into the details of what David did but David was elect God could not kill him because it was a man after God's own DNA amen you it was a man after God's own DNA he could look at his own DNA and his DNA was called his causing him somehow you know so about things around them that was not to flesh and when he did things wilfully wrong problems come into his family but it didn't take away his election you keep that in your mind brothers because the devil always tries to pick on your faults you say praise God I'm gonna serve God and then you trip over the cat and say some words that you shouldn't say just get back up again I meant you get back up again stop sulking get back up hey keep serving God and remind the devil that I haven't expected end and you haven't expected him praise the Lord you tell him his expected in he'll shut up right quick and take his flight give him six thousand volts Rangers hide Amen so brethren preachers victory day two thousand years ago he prayed the price for the salvation of your soul Redemption brothers and sisters does not mean that just anybody out there can be saved redemption means to bring back that what he already owned amen you can't redeem something that you didn't once own you put on the Mirenda in the pawn shop you'll redeem it Beckett sayers was always yours we were just born than the devil's pawn shop before sorry so Redemption can be expressed I explain some things to people like this let's just say that you're heading down a a a river and there's a waterfall over there and you're going to go over the waterfall and be toast you're going to be finished and somebody steps out and pulls you out of there of going over there those are they can wrecks there what are you going to feel about them you go to love them you can appreciate them and that's what this whole walk is about love and appreciation for what God has done for you you never deserve one thing but election fulfills at all he said I chose you you did not choose me amen he said he chose you has got nothing to do with your merits that's got nothing to do with how good you do and how nice if you dig you write and read your Bible that's not nothing to do with that I elected you I caused you I chose you it's all over but in the meantime he says I'm the Alpha and the Omega but in between the Alpha and the Omega he's doing some adjustments to your character praise the Lord he's doing some adjustments so for seven Church ages now watch this oh I love these deep things in the Bible you know if you understand in the Bible feasts you understand the seven feasts in the Bible the whole Bible opens up to you seven feasts in the Bible my half and the other half of my trips time flies when you're having fun there are seven feasts in the Bible Passover unleavened bread firstfruits their rights then the feast of Pentecost is the trumpets use of atonement Feast of Tabernacles in the Old Testament every one in Israel head to all the male's had to attend three feasts Passover Pentecost and Tabernacles now that shows us something with the feast of Passover there are two minor feasts that go with the feast of Passover unleavened bread and first fruits then there's a long time for the feast of Pentecost and at the end time comes the Feast of Tabernacles and the Feast of Tabernacles as a price of a change of dwelling place but with the Feast of Tabernacles comes the Feast of Trumpets and the feast of atonement now think about it now 2,000 years ago here's Jesus on Calvary thinking of you he's thinking of you and what drives him to go beyond his humanity he's thinking of you because he don't want to be alone he wants a part of himself to come into manifestation but Jesus went to the woman at the well he was not going to anything else but a part of himself is that right he only goes to a part of himself so when he goes and reveals himself to you at the end time he's coming to reveal himself to a part of him I just think however what we think he's coming to have to reveal himself to you he as he is going to reveal my goodness me the seventh seal is to reveal yourself to yourself amen he's revealing yourself to yourself because yourself has been blinded for such a long time but you must come back to yourself because you were born insane my goodness may is just flashing in front of me how do you bring a person back to sanity come on somebody tell me how do you bring someone back to sanity what you do is you have them look at familiar places is that right so what's your familiar place way back in eternity that's where I come from I got a look I got a look and I gotta look up keep looking at myself since where were you when I laid the foundations of the world joke when all the theophanies were shouting for joy looking for the day of the fullness of redemption praise the Lord's he's hid the body angel was trying to get Jobe to see you were one of those shielding for joy because in the time in the season those that were shouting for joy must connect with those on the earth now and come back into true worship are you with me now we come back into true worship so as long as I keep looking and looking and looking there's a dawning of a new day praise God I'm an eternal being and what God does as where as you're breaking into the dawning of a new day you look around you see all this all that deception that held me down the others horse-riders I thought that I was such a spiritual person but I was bound down by horse-riders where did the horse riders come in the horse riders came in and Genesis is there right if you must see in the book from Genesis to Revelation the whole seven seals their height good look this Eve Adams wife a part of Evan and she said she's walking around and an anointed one comes on this saying my god the president preach about anointed ones at the end time but it was an anointed one back then and what was their anointed one the white horse rider coming to annoyed her with words and lighter with images anoint her with anointing her amen amen the news media is anointing you with a white horse rider and to you're you're walking like one of these hollywood clearance instead of walking like a son or daughter of God but then the anointing changed it went from words to Cain killing Abel sick and seal their right first few seconds here and because Cain could not receive he did not accept the vision that God gave to Abel Abel yeah Abel he went away from the presence of the Lord and formed the denominational system in the Land of Nod an economic denominational religious system and we see it all out there third seal you comes down to Genesis chapter 6 you see the perversions of the earth haleh's come up on the earth programs his lair this here was replicated in Genesis chapter 6 fourth seal hell had come up into the human race subsea Enoch goes in I buddy change I met six seal the earth takes a tumble in the days of Noah seventh seal God comes down to Noah grace comes to know her here's a seven thunders and the book of Genesis and God was lifting the veil off of off of Noah to show him that you have another since oh my goodness you have another sense my friends a super sense and that super sense God is putting us through things to activate that sixth sense now a sixth sense is just believing what the angel said and then anointing it and then waiting that's why you said patience is a part of the stage of a perfect man long-suffering knowledge knowledge with the publisher of a perfect man and God must tune us in to what he's trying to to bring us to where was I thinking about him you must anoint that words and pray in season so what when the angel come to Noah it was to activate the sixth sense to refuse what the scientific civilization was telling him amen because you're anointed by a scientific civilization every day but their sixth sense does not look to the facts looks to the promise now when brother Brenner was preaching the sixth sense he shows some amazing things and I was having a rejoicing time the other day I thought my goodness in me so simple when you see it now you talking about people that get pray for there's talk about under the second Posse he said God he goes and prays for them does just go out and believe now one thing I always do when I'm overseas and I pray for a lot of people I saw when I went to Pakistan in 2017 I saw more supernatural in Pakistan there are ever seen in my life I can tell you something brothers and sisters the supernatural that was happening in Pakistan was as if you were in brother branham's meetings now I used to have a very negative attitude towards Pakistan but the Lord had to change my attitude because I was looking at the outwardness of people not knowing what was going on the inside of the people this way you do not look at somebody from the outside look at what's going on the inside and these people they had a faith that I had not seen and many people in a long time now a person would come and they asked for prayer now watch you must do it the way God does it they would come up and say brother I can't walk will you pray for me now I can't heal anybody I'm not a healer but God uses a channel it's okay okay so there was there was a sister now she's shuffling along like this she can't walk she says will you pray for me I said okay sister I meant will pray for your Lord Jesus me listen listen listen listen I pray for her it says now sister what you do now is you're now going to speak the word amen start speaking the word now God God is the high priest of your confession now you must keep that in your mind he's the high priest of your confession now you do not confess by going it's not confession the Bible also says profession but professing is something has to come out of your mouth so here's the high priest of your confession speaking it now this power in words Amen if you keep saying my car's going to break down my cars going to break that's going to break down because your speaking is going to break down if grandma's going to go fall over she's gonna fall over next year and thinks and then she deserves it was something like that she's going to do it you speak positive words about what has already been spoke and the Scriptures so it's just okay just go out now create an atmosphere I tell you something saying so she walks out his I'm healed Jesus has healed me she's walking shuffling along and like that like this like this first date nothing happens but she's not a faithless woman second day she's shutting down the street Jesus is healing and atmosphere comes rena and she has a visitation from an agent go straight through a poor flight then she walks there is El God and he says that is perfect faith that is that super sense to look at something that looks impossible and speak by the word that it's going to come to pass and P&G robbing many many times a pastor brings in his daughter 16 years old paralyzed I love these things she's paralyzed just be carried in by a daddy 16 year old Parag leaned up against the wall for five days while US brothers were preaching man she's been sitting here five days didn't even think about praying for her on the first day five days she's still sitting there on the fifth day is that right we're going to pray for this the sister so they lift her up and she showed me weighs about 40 kilos maybe not even net put it in the cheer she's hanging there that you're paralyzed as its sister do you believe in the power of the Roar she yes she's now the Lord can do one of two things I'm gonna give you a miracle or heal you over a period of time so we prayed for her it wasn't a miracle this is now go out and speak Jesus has healed me know do you really believe that says that she's yes and she really believed it so she started speaking one day speaking it nothing happens another day another week she's speaking it a month later and she's speaking Jesus has healed me the atmosphere is perfect and she's speaking it suddenly gets a feeling and a foot she keeps speaking and it goes up a meeting keep speaking it comes out he keeps speaking it comes up keep speaking that comes up and then she's walked perfectly back to school faith is the God of elm cognition you believe it so the same thing that is done for healing and that the first and second pulse must be the same end of the third pole because the first and second pulse is the earnest of a body change oh my goodness I tell you something my life got really changed in that nation my life got changed I'll tell you what softens my heart because I'm not known to be particularly I'm not a ballet dancer you know but what softened my heart so much was we in hundreds of woman came into the prayer line that could not have babies because they had put poison substances into the food and their whole reproductive organs shut down it was awful to look at just hundreds of barren woman and they coming up and look I can't heal any of them but they come up and it just breaks my heart I tell you something there's something about you know there's something about a righteous woman I don't know just hard to express what it is there's something about a righteous woman she wants to bring forth of life so I've got made a forward bring forth life and when you look in and when you look through spiritual eyes at them it just breaks your heart and I'm just in that coming up for prayer and I just about can't-can't I'm not an emotional person I tell you you need a search party to find my emotions but I tell you something that was causing some serious emotions inside of me when I was seeing these woman just wanting to bring forth life so they come into the prayer line I think I've talked to you this brother Anini they come into the prayer line and they've and they're looking at in their pleading from the Lord pleading and in one pass in the eminent look these parts of Pakistan they're seriously dangerous it is a seriously dangerous place in some areas because of the thing terrorists and things like that I've got to be guard with guys with machine guns and there's a whole street of them sitting on the street hundreds of them and they come up for prayer and because of that faith their expectation God was able to do something for them that was so profound they would come up and be prayed for in a Cell and you know virtue is strength it goes out from you you know what I'm talking about when there when the woman touched they touch the the the garment off of the Lord he felt something virtue in out from him and virtue is something that you all have but it needs to be tapped into because virtues that's something that's human virtue is something that's coming from the inside on the inside going out for that person and when and there's there's this is virtue going out for these people on my goodness me would pray for them and pray this and don't how many we prayed for just just hundreds of them I thought when I went back home I thought I better check up with these pastors what's going on say what this one's never going to have a child or something they're going to have a child this was no Kevin this was going to have a child this was gonna have a child this one's gonna have a child that's how God no you put that back and brother Brigham state uses all praise God for what brother Branham did but that's your portion and we're too often looking back at a God of history but it's a God of the I am and they must see Jesus Christ on this earth right now inside of you because that's the only Jesus Christ I go to see is the one and bright form and we must stop anointing this word oh my goodness me I've just got a few minutes that all girls finished for this I'm just so forget about the sermon you know just put it down one thing there was a man in Karachi pastor brought him around he was insane he was totally insane this marriage of busted the kids everything that's gone totally it was totaled and he comes around oh my goodness that it was a stunt he comes around to the pastor's house and passes look brother agent will you pray for this man so I pray for him so I started talking to him I said deep down in your heart what do you want not what your head wants what does your heart want he says I want the Lord now this is the strange thing I'm talking about his soul what do you want deep in your soul I want the Lord thin he's getting his mind better don't you do it don't you do it don't you do it but inside of him you saying I want the Lord this one's saying don't do it don't do it don't do it there's a demon he's possessed I said like you won the Lord says yes right you were going to pray for you now you want to baby be baptized the names Lord Jesus Christ since yes and then sexpert says don't do it don't do it don't do it so we get him in the cash straight away I don't miss around God wants to give us after the Lord we gon burn rubber to get to get him to the water don't mess around I'm not the same procrastinator it's got to be done do it even if it's last week you got to do it do it so we take him down to the ocean he gets out of the car says how you're feeling he says that they was telling me don't do it don't do it I said look just tell if you shut up what do you want to do I want to do it I want to go through with this and he's and he's we're getting Christ to the sea and it's screaming at him don't do it don't do it he's just hitting he just about in convulsions over this we take him to the ocean that's screaming in the CMC's but what do you want someone else give my heart to the Lord to be we baptize them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ comes out of the water and we now walk a few hundred yards back to the car says how will how you're feeling this is a the voices are going away the voices are going away there next night this is so profound finish on this when we were praying for all these hundreds of people up in front of me stands this man and his wife and his kids and perfect order [Music] is our God that is your God that is your creator or studio suspect some her definitely out you see vendors out Creator that is the dawn of the I am but do you believe it you must anoint the word if the Bible says I am revelations 10 eight to eleven I'm not going to walk around and I'm just revelations 10 8 to 11 place of God you know I'm the John who's prophesying again this if John was prophesying again what was he doing he's seeing the prophesy that the prophecy that has already been amen and he brings it up to the present tense by anointing it but by his own words he's putting power onto those words and bringing it to life and making it real around them right then and you know what no devil in Hell has succeeded in killing me in 35 years no devil in hell have tried believe me they've tried but the angel of the lord encamps of the believer and the angel of the lord is always revealing to you your position in the scriptures and when Jesus was on Calvary he knew what was coming next a met because he was looking back in Psalms because he was the word and those were those of those ones who wrote these Psalms there was David there was a CF and these ones they were under an inspiration that came from the one that's on Calvary so he's looking back to the ones he inspired to sing those Psalms to put it in the Bible and he's looking back it says now they're going to do this to me now and he's he's an expectation watching it what the kind of day they're going to do this now and this is this now I'm going to make this happen I thirst and they bring the vinegar to happen how did he make them do it he spoke why he knew what was going to happen and they did it do you believe it this is an error we're not just message believers we are living this message amen the message is coming to life and the ship is waiting for me at the port extend our faiths musicians would like to come for peace this bow here chewy Lord Jesus you are the author and the finisher of our faith what you started Lord you said that you'd finish Lord we don't have to fret Lord because we set your complete heads Lourdes bi-election Lord you nothing can stop us no divison hell no 200 million horse but nothing could stop your word from coming to pass they could not stop the prophet of this hour they had gunsights on him they could not stop the prophet of the hour and no matter what devils were trying to hinder him and standing in the gap and affecting his mind that did not stop anything because he came to his expected ends and he preached his last sermon he preached communion he preached I'm no longer the son of Charles and Ella Bremen but he came knew who he was an eternity Lord he knew he came from you and he's going back to you and his earthly pilgrimage was Charles and Ella Brennan but that was his book of life but she revealed his eternal being lord I just thank you and
