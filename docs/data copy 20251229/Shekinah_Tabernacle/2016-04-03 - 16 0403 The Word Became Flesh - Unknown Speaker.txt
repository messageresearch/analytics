Davidson bless you all brother Arman can you please come up it's good to see everyone out this morning amen amen praise the Lord um so uh as we all know um brother Aranda is our Sunday school superintendent so he's in he's in charge of of of all the Sunday school and I just thought I'd just make it official everyone knows what's going on you know um he really earned his stripes at the Youth Camp because we know it's more than just teaching kids it's really getting on their level and getting scratchy and you know becoming one of them and he did very well so yeah it was a real blessing see that so he did an excellent job so he's in charge just in case you're um just to go everything so so he's in charge of the entire Sunday school from the babies to the teenagers like the whole thing he's like the principal who's in charge of the entire school and so if any of the teachers can't make it I know we've already discussed this with the teachers but if any of the teachers can't make it uh he's it's it's his responsibility to to find a reliever so uh it's it's basically it's it's all his problem so so you know you y if you need if you need any material if you can't make it if you're sick contact brother arand he's a um he's in charge of that and it's also his responsibility to organize just say if s school takes a break over the school holidays it's it's it's his responsibility to to stop it and to start it again after the holidays and if any of the kids are acting up he's the he is the principal's office he's the mobile principal's office okay so yeah so so if any of the kids are acting up in class send them to arand and then and then if not then we get the parents involved then we bring in the big guns so remember it's all it's all his responsibility this is just a way that you know it's all on your shoulders and then if and then we have uh you know if we have any youth activities in the weekend or we're planning to go to any youth camps or anything of that it's brother aran's responsibility as well to to organize say days away or sleepovers or extra Bible STS or you know youth outings it's brother arman's responsibility so if you have any questions or comments or anything you'd like to raise about the Sunday School go see brother arand okay so don't um so this is the way that uh you know if there's any questions you have just see him you know because you see the principal in the school if you got questions so here's ours you know to to cover those things and then you said if any of the teachers you're wondering what direction to go for a topic see see brother arand as well so he's in control so that takes all the pressure off the teachers and puts it onto your very capful shoulders about any of those things thank you

well amen praise the Lord let's go to uh John chapter 1 thank you musicians thank you brother Isaac amen you know I think uh a certain family's been hiding a hiding a singing gift it's been exposed you can't hide it anymore who enjoyed that this morning amen that was good wasn't it amen praise the Lord I you just thrilled me amen let's go to John chapter 1 and uh let's read we're just going to read from down to verse 14 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and darkness comprehend it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear a witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear a witness of that light that was the True Light which lith every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which are born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen may the Lord bless his word you may you may have your seats now I want to I want to continue from uh uh Easter Sunday there from Shadow to reality but I want to speak about the word becoming flesh now we understand that the Bible you know I just it's just so incredible you think about it the Bible uh you know this is this is God in print form this is God in print form but we understand that it it can't just stay in print form it has to put on flesh it to become a Living Word it has to become alive and and and we understand that God in his in his in his great being before there was anything he had attributes that he wanted to express and you know because it wasn't you know we we read in Revelations 13:8 it says and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of the life uh Book of Life of the Lamb slam from the foundation of the world so the lamb was slammed before the foundation of the world before there was any Mills anything the lamb was slaying but then you may you say well I just read that and I thought well why why wasn't it not just good enough to be slain before the foundation of world in God's mind before there's anything but it had to become flesh amen amen God has attributes I'm just going to read a few he's a Healer he's a redeemer he's a savior he's a Lord he's a king he's a priest he's a mediator he's a judge he's a husband he's a comforter he's a father he's a protector he's a Defender he's a provider he's a counselor and he's a sacrifice he and he's probably many more besides but he had all these attributes in him but he but he had to express them they had to become flesh his attributes had to become flesh in order to be be fully expressed it wasn't enough just to him to have all these things bottled up in him but he had to express them I mean it's just like a person like a great artist or something it's not enough for them just to have the gift in them they need to express that gift and it's like all of us whatever however God has made us it's not enough just to bottle it all up you got to express the gift that's in you amen it has to really put on flesh and so God we know God in the Old Testament you know you know like the brass serpent in the wilderness that was a divine that that that that God put there as brother John said the you know the the rock that was smitten and the water came out and the manner that fell from heaven all those things were displaying a part of God but that was just a Shad of it when the reality come was a very great was a much greater thing amen so those attributes had to put on flesh and you can even see where where Moses you know God because I'll just throw this out here and maybe forgive me if you think this is too far but you know you can understand all things but when you experience like like you can learn all about cars and you can know you can become an expert on on every the most intricate detail of a car but it's one thing to learn it or know it it's another thing to experience it so you can know all about driving cars and how they work and conditions and all these things but when you get behind the steering wheel and you and you put the key in and you turn it for the first time then you begin to experience what it's like to drive a car now God he knows all things he knows the end from the beginning he knew where you'd be sitting this morning he knew you'd be here he's not surprised you're here this morning and so God knows the end from the beginning but he had to experience what it was like to be a man in other words to to to fully understand us amen you you know you see in the Old Testament there's times where God got sick of his people you know you take you take when Moses is there with his you know with with Israel in the wilderness and God just tells Moses basically I'm sick of them I'm going to wipe them all off as start with you cuzz he cuz he hadn't he hadn't took on human infirmities yet and then Moses threw himself in the breach saying Lord blot me out of your book of life instead of them and we know that was Christ displaying himself in Moses but God God because he' never experienced what it was like to be a man he couldn't put himself in their shoes so he got sick of them amen but then now when he he he bore our infirmities he became one of us amen so he could fully understand what you got through he he understands what it's like to be rejected to be to be misunderstood you know he knows what it's like to be made fun of he knows what it's like to be misunderstood and and Cast Away and made fun of and rejected and you know he knows what it's like he knows what it's like to be hungry because he lived through it all he suffered every Temptation that we suffer amen he was tempted on all points but yet he didn't succumb to the Temptation he is yet without sin but but he didn't understand that being this great Supreme Being he had to come down and put on flesh so he could understand you so to be a to be a mediator Moses threw himself in the Gap in the Old Testament but now in the New Testament Jesus throws himself in the Gap that's right because he knows what it's like to be a man amen now so you know you know brother R makes a statement in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he says he says now uh the first thing God wanted to reveal himself to the people he couldn't do it as great Jehovah God who covered all space Time and Eternity he could not he's too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious how could that great being that never did begin that after you went beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of light space and go out into the infinite into to Eternity and a great creature that is all that and still is see how do you you can't even fathom that with a human mind how can you how can you understand eternity cuz we're in time things don't change you see the end from the beginning you know you're outside of this thing we're locked in called time this great big being no wonder he'd say it's too mysterious that's why you know so no no one could fully understand God in the Old Testament because he's still a mysterious being he was veiled with you know you know in the tabernac in the wilderness he was veiled in the prophets and all these different things and but yet people couldn't fully understand him but yet now but what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way he could express it was to become a son of man that's the reason Jesus kept saying son of man see they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but now do you get it he wanted to express himself uh that was one of his three-fold purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in Christ and secondly to have preeminence in his body of Believers that is his bride that he might live in people so he wanted to express his fatherhood but he couldn't do it as this great big eternal spirit being he had to be he had to he had to that fatherhood had to put on flesh amen so he could fully understand what a real dad is like what a real Comfort it is like what a real Advocate a protector a Defender a provider all these things had to put on flesh all these attributes and now the word as I said the word had to has to be has to be veiled in flesh for it to live and we just read the scripture and the word that made all things that was God was with God and he was God made all things that word became flesh and dwelt Among Us amen and now I don't just want to put it back there on him because in reality the word has has to become flesh in you amen it's not just enough to quote the scripture know the scripture know the message and quote the message and it has to become flesh in you the scripture must live in people hallelujah amen but we understand that there's no you know there's no real battle you know the battle comes when the word becomes flesh amen yes and I'll just jump back you know there was a promise in the Old Testament one will chase a th000 two 10,000 that was a nice a nice posit POS scripture maybe someone would put up on Facebook but one day a man who had an ox go and he was sick of the Philistines taking his crops and his name was shamgar amen amen that that scripture became more than just a positive thing he posted on the internet it became a reality well he recognized why will chase a thousand and he recognized who he was amen and that word became flesh in him and he killed 600 armed soldiers just with an ox go the word became flesh in him amen hallelujah Moses Moses not out for 400 years the promise that Abraham gave his descendants you're going to go into a Strange Land you're going to be in bondage and slavery for 400 years but I'm going to deliver you out with a mighty hand no doubt they would have sat round and they would have spoken about that scripture saying Al forbear Abraham promised us that we're going to go into the promised land even though we're slaves here but then when the season came where that was going to be put on flesh when the deliverer was going to come that's when a whole bunch of trouble begin to flare up started to kill the babies the Egyptians they started to do all kinds of things because that word was becoming flesh and a baby amen amen that deliverer was born it was more than just a nice idea it became a reality amen hallelujah amen and it's the same thing Jesus no you got to John the Baptist no doubt they you know they would have sat around in their synagogues and you know when Isaiah he Isaiah spoke things and it was about 800 years later it became you know it became a reality he Pro prophesied a virgin shall conce amen amen he prophesied behold one crying in the wilderness to prepare the way of the Lord and no doubt they would have you know the rabbis and the chief priests they would have sat round and they would have discussed that scripture and they would have maybe put in their minds this is how it's going to work out maybe put it on a chart on the wall and you know maybe you know they would have discussed those things but before it became flesh there was no war there's no controversy there was no religious fight had broken out it was just all intellectual debate but then it became flesh amen and then and then things begin to be stirred up because the word must always the the battle is always when the word becomes flesh amen and so they would have no doubt read Malachi 3:1 behold I send my messenger before my face and he will prepare the way before me and whom you delight and even the angel of the Covenant shall suddenly come to his Temple they would have read that scripture they would have look forward it happening amen but then one day it happened amen and a man came out of the Wilderness saying repent for the kingdom of God was at hand and he didn't just do it out of just some good idea that scripture became a living reality to him we you you know we sung the song God interprets his word by bringing it to pass God doesn't need no interpreter he just brings it to pass Hallelujah you see John the Baptist he didn't need to explain it he just preached amen he just did what he was called to do that scripture he lived out that word amen he lived out the portion of the word for his his life and then then there was a great big kafuffle going on then the religious War started to there was a battle going on Amen it went from a academic debate then it became a real battle and then this one you say well how how did it end up that way well you look what happened to John the Baptist a little girl dancing he got his head cut off he thrown into prison it sounds like there was a bit more than just an argument going on Amen but the word became flesh in him amen and then Jesus let's go to um you let's go to Luke chap CH 4 now I'm going to come to your address but I just I just trust you know this Bible if this isn't living in people am we're not here to just quote it and say isn't that lovely and isn't that wonderful this must put on flesh am amen and that's not being a fanatic that's a reality amen that's right it must put on flesh this word and the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us well if he is the word and he became flesh and we are we become one with him and and you read about in Ephesians great is the mystery concerning Christ in this church husband and wife becoming one if the bridegroom became the word became flesh then the then the bride will become flesh as well the word will become flesh in her am yes amen amen he following me hallelujah what am I saying Jesus must live in you amen he must become a living reality to you amen it's not enough just to quote it it must live now Luke chapter 4 and this is another prophecy of Isaiah and we'll go to we'll go to Luke 4:16 and now notice notice where the see see I'll show you here and he and he came to Nazareth speaking of Our Lord where he had been bought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up forth to read so Jesus always went to church and there was delivered unto him the book of prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has a he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance of the captives and recovering of the sight of the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and if you go and read that in Isaiah he cuts that last scripture in half and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue fasted on him and he be to say unto them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears why it had become flesh and they all bear witness and wondered at the gracious Words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this Joseph's son and he said unto them now notice where this goes they're sitting in church having a nice time and we're going to see where it goes and he said un him we will surely say unto me ye will surely say unto me this proverb phys physician heal thyself whatsoever we have heard that in capernium so also uh do also here in thy country he said verely I say unto you no Prophet is accepted in his own country but I tell you the truth many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias When Heaven Was Shut Up 3 years and 6 months when Great Famine was throughout all the land but unto none of them was Elias sent save unto uh uh s a city of sidon unto a woman that was a widow and many lepers were in Israel in the time of of of of Elias the prophet prophet and none of them was cleansed sorry that's Elisha the prophet none of them was cleansed save uh non the Syrian and all they in the synagogue when they heard these things were filled with what Joy wrath amen he following me and Rose up and thrust him out of the city and led him unto the brow of the Hill Ron their city was built that they might cast him down headlong but he passing through the midst of them went his way so you think he came to his own read the scripture his own received him not you would think he comes into the church and he begins to read the word you think they would have rejoiced the spirit of the Lord is upon me this day the scripture is fulfilled you think I said hallelujah our God's Vis is us you know he's visited us with a mighty visitation but where does it end up we're going to kill this man why that scripture had laid there 800 years it had laid there but now it finally put on flesh and when the word puts on flesh the religious world hates it who who who organized Jesus being it wasn't the Romans that crucified Jesus that was just a vehicle to get it done it was the churches in that day crucified him amen amen and it was the churches in that day who tried to kill him when he said this day the scriptures fulfilled you think they would have rejoiced we're going to be set free the Brokenhearted are going to be bound up you know you know those who are blind are going to be given their sight it's now the acceptable year of the Lord right but they are filled with wrath amen because now brother John said it history repeats itself speaking of Moses and then and then Christ history repeats itself and so we can't just look at this and say well that was that day and that was before the cross and now in the you know now we're this time of Grace and everything's different history repeats itself man man was that way there and he's still the same today yes you know both the devil and God take their people but they return the same spirit that was on them back am mean Jesus was taken Judas was taken Jesus sent his Spirit back upon the earth and the Antichrist spirit and Judas came back upon the Earth John said there's many Antichrist already amen so there's a there was a war I trust I trust this really you know you know sing it's when the word becomes flesh not when it's just talked about not when it's just well what do you think about that it's when it becomes flesh is when the battle really happens amen so it goes beyond just you know it goes beyond a debate you see it and then and then we can go maybe I'll just go through this very quickly but but then we go to Acts chapter to and then that same God who is in Jesus because he says it's not me that doeth the works as my father dwelleth in me doeth the works so he is saying I don't do this it's the father that dwells in me he does the works and then he says and then he says that same spirit will come and dwell in you so now then you have to I trust if God really dwells in you I trust you can say well it's actually him doing the works it's not me living it's him living amen where your natural man would probably in times past would have gone a certain way you begin to react a very different way to things and you I trust you can look and say that's him doing the works that's him living and so on the day of pente Peter you know they come out you know the spirit of God comes and dwells in them and everyone outside says they they're acting like a bunch of drunk people and then Peter stands up and says we're not drunk as you suppose it's just being the third hour of the day but this is that spoken by the prophet Joel and and so that prophecy in Joel I'm just going to basically repeat myself with different situations but it's all the same thing see the word became flesh in the upper room amen those 120 there that were you know they had walked with the Messiah they had seen him done many great things they knew he was the Christ but that wasn't enough Amen to recognize him in this day is not enough you must become one with him amen amen he must come and dwell in you so it wasn't just enough for them to walk with Jesus Jesus had to come and dwell in them yes and that he would live his same life would now live out of them so they were in the upper room and they're waiting then finally when the day of Pentecost had fully come he came and dwelt in them and then they begin to rejoice and then they begin to quote Peter said this is this day he could have stop and said this day Joel chapter 2 is fulfilled this day this scripture is fulfilled because he quotes it that I'll in the last days I'll pour my spirit out upon All Flesh he says what you have just witnessed here and what we are doing is that scripture being fulfilled amen now did did did did all the people Rejoice did the Sanhedrin Rejoice did the church Rejoice what' they do drag them before the Sanhedrin threaten them beat them killed them eventually some of them amen why is that because the word became flesh the word became flesh in this and that's and you know you read like like Luke 4 where were you know I might be getting it around the wrong way but there's there's many times where they wanted to kill Jesus and Luke for was one of them where were the disciples when this was all going on I would think they were with him but there's no record of them trying to kill the disciples at that time why is that because the word wasn't fleshing them yet that's right amen Satan doesn't care how much how religious you think you are he doesn't care how much of the Bible you think you know he doesn't care how much of the message you you think you know he's not afraid of that it doesn't he he doesn't care about that but it's when that life comes in amen when the one when the Eternal God comes and dwells in flesh that's when things begin to get Rocky hallelujah amen he doesn't care about people claiming the cross but when the power of the Cross comes into someone's life many people claim the blood but there's no power in their and their confession amen and now I'm not looking down on those people this is just a day and age we live in we can't just talk about Easter we can't just talk about Jesus dying you know you know I might get the story wrong but you know my you know Christine is is witnessing to one of the preschool teachers she's a seek and she said to she said to Christine that other Christians have just told her that Christianity is basically you do something wrong and then you confess it then you keep walking on and there's no change in the life you just keep living on that's not the gospel that's not the gospel the gospel is you repent you confess it and then the life that's in him comes into you and changes your nature that you don't do those things anymore it's a supernatural nature change by God he comes and lives in you that's Christianity isn't it amen because it says in in Hebrews now if I can find it he says in Hebrews that a worship ER he says for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things that can never uh can never with those sacrifices this is Hebrews 10:1 never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers their un too perfect so what does that mean whatever caused them to bring the lamb they left with that same desire because the blood of bulls and goats could not change the nature of the person that caused them to bring the sacrifice in the first place for then would they have not uh for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more consciousness of sins so he's saying why were they offered every year continually because the very sacrifice couldn't change the people but that was in the Old Testament but under the under the blood of the New Covenant amen that blood that was shed can change you that life that's in in in him comes to you and changes you amen hallelujah that's right and so now they were so that life was in was the fullness of God had bodly dwelt in Jesus Christ and they hated him they hated him the devil hates the life that's right amen the devil doesn't care about anything else it's when the life comes in that's right that's when the devil really changes guns and that's why the disciples with Jesus they didn't try and kill him they didn't try and push him push push them off the cliff it was Jesus but then in the book of Acts what happens God comes into them they get beaten some of them get killed they get thrown into jail they get threatened don't ever preach in his name anymore why cuz the devil's trying to Snuff out the lifee yes amen and it's the same thing today all the devil wants to do is snuff out the life that the life of God is Not on display anymore or how thankful we are that God is alive amen amen and now let's go to John chapter 14 I want to read this John 14 and ver8 I think we read a bit of this before but just just notice this yeah the word interprets itself as I because you you may think well how can you say Jesus will come and dwell in them what about the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost and Jesus are the same the spirit of God is the Holy Ghost which is Jesus and spirit form because when Paul met the Lord on the road to Damascus what did the pillar of fire who did he say his name was Jesus I'm Jesus whom th persecutest amen amen Philip saith unto him Lord Charles the father and it suffices us Jesus saith unto him have I been so long with you and yet thou Hast not known me Phillip he that ha seen me has seen the father and th sayith then Charles the father believeth thou not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work sake verely verely I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than the shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever you ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if ye shall ask anything in my name I'll do it if you love me keep my Commandments and I'll pray the father and he'll give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also and that day you shall know that I in my father and ye in me and I in you he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he is it that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I'll love him and will manifest myself to him amen amen so he's saying I'm going to be in you I'm not just going to be with you I'm going to be in you amen the very works that I do you shall do also amen amen amen that's what he's promising now if God is in you I because I was maybe you know you maybe I spoke about this before but I was thinking last night what is it to say God is in me amen oh I have the Holy Ghost a lot of people say they have the Holy Ghost but what is it really mean to really have the Holy Ghost amen amen cuz the vast majority of Christians would say either that they have the Holy Ghost or the Holy Ghost Works in their life in some way yes amen but what is it really to have the real genuine Holy Ghost amen because if there was a promise if if if it has been promised to people then it's not just empty words that God's just put on paper to make us feel a bit better it has to be a reality amen amen amen it's either this is either true or it's not true if it's not true let's quit and do something else but if it is true we should give everything we have to it amen cuz it's Eternal things amen so if God is in you the very creator of heavens and earth is in you amen yes the very one who spoke the world into existence comes and dwells in you brother Braham says from the everpresent water from The Rock in 1961 he says and the power that'll raise us up is right in us now we are now in Heavenly places we are now in the power of the Resurrection if there was wasn't a law to that remember his word is governed his power is governed by a law if there wasn't a law to that Sons and Daughters of God would create in them a world I mean would create them a world out there and go live a private life on it you have power in you to do it who believes that if you have God in you you have the power to speak a world into existence and go and live on it amen oh no that's not true yeah it is is he all powerful that he make all things and he says I'll be with you even in you amen therefore you have power in you to create a world and go live on it you have the power in you to do it and he says if you've got a shadow of the power of God on you you've got power to do it if you've got a shadow I don't feel like I got a lot of faith I don't feel like you know I'm really maybe walking the way I should be walking if you've got a shadow remember it's not remember God is not you have to get onto this plane the spiritual plane you got to reach like a what they call a Buddhism like a Nana State and then you have visitations of angels then God comes down then he speaks you live to we it's not that way amen God comes to the meek and lowly God comes to the Wayward God comes to the Lost God comes to the confused amen God comes to the blind religiously blind people God comes to the indifferent he's that's the kind of people God comes to amen God comes to the failures God comes to the one hiped in sin God comes to the one that are in bondage and speaks to them and ministers to them hallelujah hallelujah that's how go because he says for sheep all gone astray Isaiah 53 he doesn't say we're all sheep perfectly walking in line and being a perfect sheep we've all gone astray how who does that Encompass all of humanity we've all gone astray you say but but I'm sheep I'm a Believer we've all gone astray but as long as you're a sheep as long as you're a sheep that's the difference yeah amen if you're a sheep God will go after you amen if you're a sheep God is going to get you amen it's like I think of you know maybe this is probably not a good joke but you know they say the Apache helicopter they say if you try and run from it if you're fighting against it you just die tired yeah cuz it'll just find you the missiles and stuff will find you same thing with God if you run you just die tired you might as well die not tired just just Just Surrender yourself but if you run you're going to die tired amen so what's the point of running that's right what's the point of running Hallelujah so God now we have the power you have the power now this is not the power of positive thinking it's a reality if if the very God of heavens and earth comes and dwells in you then you have the power in you to create a world and go live on it amen amen so there's because there's power there's life and death in the power of the tongue amen amen so whatever you are led to believe for believe it's yours amen don't limit God in what you think he can do you know it's nice you say you know you know you can look into the prophet's and you can say well it would be neat to speak squirrels into existence it' be neat to speak life back to a dead fish or it' be neat to speak life back to someone who's died in the you know you know died in the congregation or or a dead baby that's been brought to him or you be need to speak a storm out of existence or you know those things but we don't need squirrels to be created that's right amen we don't need those kind of things but we need life to be spoken amen we need life to be spoken amen but the thing is don't just put it off on well maybe someone else can do that what about you remember the word has to be put in flesh it's not enough for your mom and dad for God to dwell in them it's not enough for the word to become flesh and someone you know he's got to dwell in you he wants to use you amen he wants to use you for his work and so we shouldn't be afraid you know well how do I pray for something you get neutral you get neutral and then you pray because if you pray with your own Ambitions you know the scripture even says he'll give you the desires of your heart you got to be real careful balum the desire of balam's heart was wealth and God get yeah go I I already told you not to but he allowed him to go amen and many people they pray for things but it's out the desire of their heart they're not neutral and God says there you go there's a boundary amen and God will allow you to cross that boundary y amen and you may have to go down some big valleys and a lot of flames and deep water and things but he'll allow you to go that way amen that's why when you pray you got to be neutral in in in everything no matter how big or small amen and then he will come upon the scene and then it won't be you asking it'll be him in you speaking what you need amen hallelujah praise God now the scripture tells us in 2 Corinthians 3 he says but we all with it sorry but we all with an open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord I changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord so we're beholding him now he's the word amen remember the word becoming flesh as we read there it wasn't just you know it wasn't just words on paper it's a living being living being became flesh that same one led the children of Israel into the promised land the same one came and spoke to Gideon and all the different ones down through through the same one Isaiah saw high and lifted up and said W is me amen he's a living being and then he became flesh and so that same one that same so so we are beholding a living I trust God is not an imagination to you but he's a living person that speaks to you you speak back to him he guides your steps he counsels you he shows you your things he likes things he doesn't like he convicts you of sin when you're wrong amen he says no to sometimes when you pray hey yes and or no I'm happy with no if my life was full of NOS I'd say thank you Lord cuz at least I'm getting an answer amen amen oh I want a yes no I just want an answer I don't care what it is not my will but thy will be done amen amen isn't that what Jesus said so we're beholding a living being and as we Behold Him we are we are changed into the same image from glory to glory so we become we become him amen amen what's an what's an image an image is made out of something amen so like you like madam what was it Madam tau's wa you you wax museum that's right that's a whole bunch of images made right you know of real people and so it says now that we are changed into the same image from glory to glory so we are changed and that word change is where we get the word metamorphosis from means to transform that we are we are transformed or we we are under a metamorphosis process like a caterpillar that turns into a butterfly they're undergoing a metamorphosis they are being transformed from one thing into another thing and it's the same thing with the believer you're right now being transformed amen I mean from from what you once were you're being transformed into the very image of the living God Amen now I don't think that's too strong I just read it in the scripture this is Paul taken up with him one day amen he says we're being transformed into that same image and so you have to look at now well what was he he was the word made flesh a living being the Eternal one put on flesh and so that has to happen in you it happened in the book of Acts Church you look at them they were you know the same Holy Ghost fell there Falls today I've experienced it so I know the same God he's he hasn't changed in 2,000 years he's revealed himself he's put on flesh again he still fills people with the Holy Ghost like he did then amen how can he be the same yesterday today and forever if he changes and now it's just a social group there's not a social group it's it's people that God has filled and people that God has drawn to himself and then so now yes they didn't you know they didn't worry they didn't go live the same life that they did before the upper room they didn't go back they didn't go back they never went fishing again there's nothing wrong with fishing but they never went fishing again amen Peter James and John they never took up their Nets again the woman at the well never went back to her old life again those 120 they never went back to their old life they were different something had really happened to them that's right you know they never worried well I don't want to lose my social standing with the Joneses who cares about the Joneses if you really care about the Joneses you'll meet God and you want them to meet God if you really care about them yes amen we we youo we're not called to match oh I want to be in this bracket of society I'd rather be in God's bracket of society that doesn't mean you become a monk and live someplace on a hill you know we live everyday life but you don't want to be caught up in well what does this person think of me what does that person think of me amen amen amen that's all I'm worried about well they may kick me out he got kicked out he understands no one understands being rejected he sure understands what it's like to be rejected he was rejected far more than we could ever be rejected he was judged you know I found people I found Christian people now I don't have an ex to grind but this is just you know don't get me wrong but the only persecution I've ever received is from other Christians people who have no faith they just say that's great you go on you you know if you're happy that's fine but other Christians I say they got filled they get filled with wrath they get angry amen yep why is that God say the wood become flesh yes and there's a persecution going on right so now so the word is putting on flesh in the believer's life now but there so so the word has to be lived out as I said the lamb was slamed before the foundation of the world then that had to happen the lamb had to become flesh and die in order to redeem us back to where we you you know you know back to God he had to shed his blood physically in time in order in order for us to really know him as Redeemer it wasn't just enough for God to have it in his mind it had to put on flesh but there's parts of the the word that you would never want to live out amen you never want to be like pilate he says behold the man and tries to wash his hands of the blood of Jesus and and gives them to the Mob but you can't the only way you get the blood of Christ off your hands is get it in your heart you don't ever want to be the scribes or Pharisees hey they were they were playing out a role everyone in life is playing out some kind of role and so it's not always the Believers that that that the word becomes flesh and there's others that the word becomes flesh and are you following me you see you see balum you see the you know you know you see the king of Moab and you see Pharaoh they were playing out a role Egypt was playing out a role they didn't really fully understand what they're doing genes and jambre they playing out of role Cain was was was living out a role the word was becoming flesh in him but not I'm talking about God God wasn't becoming flesh him but part of the word was I mean because there's always the good and the bad Esau played out a role he didn't fully grasp what was going on but he knew he just needed food more than some Birthright that he couldn't understand amen so you never want to be like the scribes and Pharisees you say that was back 200 years ago we're modern now man is still the same amen I guarantee you the same attitude that they had then if they were transported into this day all they do is have websites and different kinds of other things and podcasts and YouTube channels and they'd be saying the same thing they said back there amen they'd be doing exactly because history repeats itself and what heaven back there happens again so we don't want to be the scribes and Pharisees because they so they are the denominations because scribes Pharisees they believe different things herodians believe different things amen one believed in angels in a re um um in a resurrection the others didn't I think the Sadducees didn't believe in a resurrection you read about the book of Acts they had their own list of beliefs what is that a denomination so they rejected the very God that they claiming to be worshiping you don't want to be Judas Judas was playing a role amen and then you never want to be the crowd saying crucify him cuz they're playing a role too amen we don't you say well that was then how do you you can't crucify a spirit you can crucify his word you can kill how do you what is murder murder is not just physically killing someone you can murder someone's influence and that's same as murdering them amen that is that is Premed people go out and try and murder someone's influence that is premeditated murder because they're murdering now that person has no influence anymore yes their their whole life is white you know tarnished now that reputation that's just been fabricated you shall not bear false Witnesses yes the law says does it not so you know people's lives are tarnished that reputation sticks on them even though it's not true and what happens that person has been murdered what do you think it happens with politicians they try and get some dirt on them then they blasted across the world that person has to resign or go to jail or whatever happens now if they do something wrong sure they got to pay for it but what's happened that person has found something that that person did and has actually murdered them now I'm not saying that that person was not wrong you understand but what's happened these people have actually gone out how can we destroy this person yes I can't go kill him cuz that's I'll I'll end up in jail but I can I can actually murder his influence murder his reputation that's just as good that's killing them so we never want to be that crowd you say well that was back then Peter said that scoffers would rise in the last day saying where's the promise of his coming someone has to live out that role you don't want to be part of that role Now history repeats itself now maybe I'm I'm just going to try and but there's but there's other things there's other parts that people had no idea really what they were doing there was a Joseph of arthea he built a tomb in a garden and no doubt he thought one day I'm going to be buried there and my children and things can come and come to my grave and put down flowers and all these things but when but when he was having that built he was actually fulfilling the word but he had no idea what he was really doing amen because it says in Isaiah 53 that he'll be buried with the rich and he was a rich man he was playing a role amen he was actually allowing the word to become flesh because that scripture had to be fulfilled and then so he built the tomb and then something in him because he was a secret believer it says in the Bible because of fear of the Jews you didn't you know openly say he believed in Jesus Christ and then so when Jesus was dead on the cross he went to pilate say can I please have the body of Jesus and then he found out he was dead he said yeah sure you can you know you can have him and then so he put He put Jesus in his own tomb that he had made Hallelujah he was he was fulfilling the word amen the word I'd say became flesh in him because he orchestrated that all to happen you say well I may not have you say I don't have a tomb but you've got a body amen amen you've got hands and feet you've got a mind and no doubt you thought well I'm going to use this hey Joseph R thought he's going to be buried there but Jesus didn't have to own it to him he just had to borrow a to cuz he wasn't going to stay there too long and it's the same thing with you and I you know we have these bodies we have this life and he wants to borrow your life he wants to borrow your body amen and maybe just for one instance or maybe six months like John the Baptist but as long as you're living out his part of the word that he wants you to do amen amen he wants you you say you say no that's that's just too arbitrary no it's not he wants to dwell in people I've heard this too much no don't don't don't diminish if God lives in you then you're not your own there's a definite difference between a Spirit-filled believer and a notp filled believer amen amen I'm not saying that the unfilled ones not sincere but there's a big difference if youve received the Holy ghost you can't think like you did before you met him amen amen there's something in you that just doesn't sit good if you even contemplate well maybe I should do this something in you just says no amen I do not want to and it's not and that's him that's him governing your life oh no you train people to be that way no you don't it's not a training it's a filling amen things things you once loved there's something in you that doesn't love them anymore am amen amen why what's happened the words become flesh the life of God has come into you and you're being transformed this is a reality amen the very God Of Heaven can come and dwell in you because of what he's done not because of what you think you can do it's because of what he's done hallelujah Joseph had a tomb you say well but the word became flesh in Jesus it has to become flesh in you amen where you can be a comforter amen you can be a guide you can bring healing healing healing comes in music it comes in you know it comes through prayer it comes through medicine it comes through sometimes someone just getting alongside you and merry heart doeth good like a medicine the scripture tells us and that's true depressed stressed people are more far more likely to get cancer than happy people why cuz because a merry heart doeth good like a medicine amen you can be you can be a protector or a Defender those things want to be those attributes must put on flesh Amen in you amen well I only you know I want to do my own thing no just borrow just let them borrow you and maybe for 10 years 10 minutes 60 years however long but he wants to borrow you wants to live through you amen amen we have to he wants to live in people amen now I'm just going to try and wrap this up there was never a battle I'll say this there was an never battle when people would go to Revelations chapter 10 and they would speak about a mighty angel coming down with an open book that never caused any controversy until a man would stand stand up and say I was there I had a vision of seven angels coming on a mountain and you know you know you know an Arizona Mount Sunset and then he said as it happened and there's the photograph of the cloud and all these things and then not only that but he goes back to his church and he preaches the true interpretation of the revelation of the Seven Seals and then and then now a big war breaks out because that scripture became flesh and then now there's never a there was never a big cont where where people would read Malachi and the churches used to look for an Elijah coming to restore the word as spoken of in scripture the Assemblies of God the Pentecostal churches say where is our Elijah they used to look for him and then now someone stands up and says if you can't believe me believe the works for they testify of me of the supernatural God there is no peer yeah the prophet of God he wasn't there was no equal you know speaking of his min Ministry things happen in you you know in that ministry didn't happen in any other totally different and the word became flesh that part of the word became flesh in him and that's when the big battle begin to fight is this okay you understand and then now people stand up and they receive the same God that he spoke about and you can hear about on tape comes and lives in them amen this this becomes a living reality to a people it becomes a Love Letter it's not stories it's not just a code of ethics it becomes a living reality and the god of the Bible becomes alive to them and then they begin to stand up and now they be they begin to recognize because there's prophecy there's word that has to be fulfilled where the scripture says and we'll go to let's go to Ephesians chapter 5 I just trust you'd go home and Ponder these things amen think upon these things now let's go to verse 30 Hebrews chapter 5 uh sorry Ephesians chapter 5 because the book of Ephesians Paul is prophesying of things as well we know Paul he was a prophet was he not he was an apostle but he was also a prophet because he prophesied a lot of things amen and then now let's just go to verse 28 so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies that he loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hateth his own flesh but nourishes and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and the two shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so Lover's wife even of himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband so he's not just speaking about just marriage now but he said this is how it should be because if God is in you men and woman if God is in the husband what did Christ do he came to where we were and he lifted us up to make us joint ears with him isn't that what the scripture tells us then so if that has to be put on flesh in men amen amen it has to be put on flesh so if Christ is in you then that act of redemption that he did for us will be lived out of you and your whole being and now when I think of this I say help me Lord but your whole being will be to that one purpose and everything you do if it's going to work if it's going on holiday it's how your house is your whole being will be Redemption that I'll I'll create an atmosphere in my home I'll speak and treat my wife a certain way I'll treat my kids a certain way that they'll become joint ears amen hallelujah they'll become joiners with me in Christ amen that'll be that'll be a husband's that's a husband's Focus I trust it is that's not getting a new car or a bigger house all those things are good and well but the main thing should be I want them I don't want them to be down here somewhere I don't want my family to be downtrodden and walking on eggshells I want to lift them up HJ Amen to be a joint ear because that's what that's what Christ did for us we are joint ears with Christ the scripture tells us what does that mean equal level amen he is the head sure but we're not downtrodden we're joint ears amen amen that's if that's if Christ is in you and then if Christ is in the wives now what do we want to do we want to lift him up that he can express himself in our lives and have free course not because of rules but because we love him because we're in a love relationship amen and so the wives will do the same thing you see amen it'll just happen it's not necessar the things you say things you do amen but words are important too amen amen amen but I trust I trust that's your that should be your focus I want my kids see I want my girls to love the Lord like I do and to know him like I do am that's what I want for them amen amen I'll support them in anything that you know if they want a you know career and all these different things sure but I want that the main thing that is the main thing that they would love him and know him like I do and if they do that I can say I've done I've done my job and all is well no matter where they go on life as long as they fall in love with him and he becomes their all in all like he is me then then amen I can relax amen hallelujah but he's saying here this is a great mystery concerning Christ and the church so they become one amen so if he is the word then we become the word and so this is not a an arbitrary thing as I said if God dwelt in him and the fullness God B dwelt in him then he'll come and dwell in you and he will change your nature to be like his nature because Peter says that we're let's go to Peter actually I'm going to read this and then I don't know what time it really is but um you know early this morning I accidentally put our clock for it an hour and then Christine said no no no it's back but of course it wasn't my cell phone so it would have been fine but yeah anyway but there's a second Peter verse you chapter 1 it speaks of the Statue of a perfect man yeah it talks about the stature of a mature believer that we're growing up into yes yeah remember it's actually the spirit of God comes and dwells in you and then he matures those attributes into you amen but the foundation is always Faith you must believe but there's also so this scripture that Peter's talking about here of a statue a perfect man he is actually speaking he that's actually a prophecy he says people are going to become this it's not just a nice idea people are literally going to live this out where they have the faith and The Virtue and the knowledge and the temperance and the godliness and the brotherly kindness and the Divine love it'll actually be put in flesh into people I trust you can say Lord I'm going to be one of them because of what you're doing in my life amen amen but there's also in Proverbs and we'll just go read it there's actually the statue of the imperfect man okay so we go to Proverbs Chapter 6 and then with this all close Proverbs Chapter 6 and 16 to 19 and then we'll go to um Proverbs 26 to see what the headstone of this is so Proverbs 6 and 16-19 these six things do the Lord hate yay seven are an Abomination unto him a proud look a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood a heart that devises Wicked imaginations feet that be Swift and running to Mischief a false witness that speaketh lies and he that Seth Discord among Brethren okay and then we'll go to Proverbs chapter 26 and 24 to 28 he that hateth dissemble with his lips and layeth up de seat within him when he speaketh fear believe him not for there are seven Abominations in his heart we just read about them who so whose hatred is covered by deceit his wickedness shall be showed before the whole congregation who so dith a pit shall fall therein and he that roll a stone it will return upon him a lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it and a flatter a flattering mouth worketh ruin so you can actually parallel those two together and the Capstone of this one is actually hatred instead of divine love I'll say this it says before the whole congregation these are religious people y amen remember Judas he was among the people yeah we don't want this to be built up in US amen this word people you say well that's just Proverbs it's still the word of God you know all the word all scriptures inspired For What doctrine Repro correction edifying and all these different it's what so it's not well this is the Proverbs this is the law is just history and this is what Jesus said so we'll take it above the book of Acts and all these things it's all the word of God yes amen amen so there'll be a people and maybe if we have some musicians come there'll be a people that will actually put this will actually embody these virtues of hatred just as a just as there will be a people that will be built up into the statue of the perfect man amen you say well how do we your choice your choice dictates which one you're going to be amen because God is a gentleman and he doesn't Force anything upon you he gives you a choice y there Comes A Time in life with anything you can be faced with a great situation and there's actually a moment before you can actually get angry and lose it but then you can choose actually to lose your temper and get mad yeah it's your choice and so if you say and then so with these things what do you want to become now you can't do it in your own strength but what do you yield yourself to because man people upon this Earth they reflect either of Two Worlds you see people you know what do we near get hit by that guy in the car or something I know just crazy driver on the street but he you know you know you know his uh his car was all like lowered you know they look like some rappers off MTV and stuff and you can say well you can see what they listen to because people they they behold things and they become it that's right amen you look at someone it's like at work you know you they have all the woman's weeklys and the new IDE and all these kind of magazines people people read those and then and then one of my colleagues who's who's moved on to another job she says I read these things I just want to buy stuff why because there all these ads and you know because it's materialism being pushed and then people will read those things while they begin to gossip and talk about other people why because they're feeding off these things and they become what they read amen and it's the same with people who idolize some star or someone they actually well I need to buy clothes like them and then they have their like them and they work out so they look like them and why because they're actually they're beholding an image and they become what they see amen now how about you just like the guys in the car you know you know they they they idolized you I wanted to be Danny Morrison when I was like six who knows who Danny moris he's a fast Baller in the Kiwi cricket team you know back in the day I wanted to be I wanted to bowl like him I wanted to run up like him and do the whole CU I was that was the image I was looking at amen and people want to be whoever I don't even know who they are these days but you know what are you looking at see I chose I want to be like him you know people see some star I want to be like them who are you choosing to who do you want to be like amen some people behold some we want to behold thisen and become make me more like thee Lord I choose it's my decision I want to be like you he doesn't enforce it upon you he doesn't trap you and and trick you into it he just gives you the option you want to be made in my image I want to make you in my image that's why he gives the invitation and it's up to us yes Lord take us as we are amen we have that song make me more like thee and then um and then we'll sing Amazing Grace my chains are gone Hallelujah the word has to put on flesh I trust when you get up in the morning you just recognize it's not me that doeth the works
