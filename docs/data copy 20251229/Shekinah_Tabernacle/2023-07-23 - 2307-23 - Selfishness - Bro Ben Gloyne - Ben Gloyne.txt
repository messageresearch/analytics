going to go to um we're going to go to Luke I mean so Isaiah we're gonna go to Ezekiel 28 first we've got three places to read if you don't mind so we're gonna go to Ezekiel 28. and then we're going to go to Isaiah 14 and we're going to go to James um so um you know the problem with me and slides is they never are in the order um that I put them in so we start some will end up somewhere else but anyway who's happy today everyone's good everyone's well everyone's victorious in the Lord because he's Victorious praise the Lord amen he cares All About Us amen amen so we're going to read here Ezekiel 28 and 12. Son of Man take up a lamentation upon the king of tires and say unto him thus saith the Lord God thou sealeth up the sum full of wisdom and perfect and Beauty thou have been in the Eden the Garden of God every precious stone was like covering the Sardis the topaz and the diamond The Bell the uh whatever that is the Jasper the sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle the gold the workmanship of thy tablets and of thy parts were prepared in thee in the day that thou was created Thou Art Thou Art the anointed cherub that covereth and I have set thee so thou was upon the holy mountain of God thou Hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee by the multitude of our merchandise they have filled they have filled the midst of thee with violence and now has sinned therefore I will cast thee as a profane as profaned out of the Mountain of God I'll destroy the occurring cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness I will cast thee to the ground old lady before kings that they may behold thee who are those kings we're Kings and Priests to our God Amen and then amen let's just read here in Isaiah 14. um amen so I'm just going to talk about I'm actually talking about selfishness today so we're going from here to selfishness so you may think how's this going to do a selfishness well selfishness is of the devil it doesn't belong to you and I it's not our portion it's not meant to be ours so let's throw it in the fire today amen amen this seems like an unusual subject but here we are in case you're wondering where I'm going how art thou fallen from Heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how about thou uh cut down to the ground which did US weak in the Nations for thou are said in thine heart I'll Ascend into into heaven I'll exalt my throne above the stars of God I'll sit also upon the Mount of the congregation and the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high yet thou shall be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit they that see thee shall shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the Earth to tremble that did Shake kingdoms amen and just just one more place of reading have been very good uh standing but yeah it's just so this is from the English Standard Version so just read it up here if you don't mind for where jealousy and selfish ambition exists there will be disorder and every vile practice but the wisdom from above is first pure than Peaceable gentle open to reason full of mercy and good fruits impartial and sincere and a harvest of righteousness is sown of Peace by those who make peace my I think that's just a power pack full of vitamins right then amen Less bowheads in a word of press one if you're gonna be remembered and prayed you want to raise your hand to the Lord amen let's all pray together gracious father we're so thankful we can say truly Fair as a liar Lord we're so glad Lord that you understand all of our pain and hurt the things

Lord we love you so much Lord we need you to come upon the scene Lord as we've read your word Lord we're asking may you anoint speaker and hear our lord lord speak to my heart today dear God father do

that's not of you Lord in our lives or in this place might be bound and cast out in the name of Jesus Christ Lord you can have free reign Lord we surrender the service into your hands now for your glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may have your seats uh this morning so I want to talk about um I want to talk about selfishness today now this may seem like quite a Quantum Leap to go from the heart of the devil down into man but we know that all these things come from the devil we know that you know it was really selfish ambition that made him rise up above what God made him to be when he came to a place when he realized he was the greatest one where he was the best one that was ever made and you know brother Brown would say he was God's right-hand man because he was the anointed cherub that covereth and you know he actually uh controlled the access to God of other angels and you know but there came a thought in his mind one day that that he could do a better job than God and he knew what you know but it really came because his whole ambition was here like I will be like the most high so I don't know how it initially would have started but it would have been like how how Spirits get among people you know someone starts with an idea which is inspired from an evil spirit and and then they begin to talk to their friends talk to their family create a bit of an influence and you know next thing you know our their true intention comes out you know so amazed when you think about you know there's a saying when when you cross the Rubicon and and that's saying I know if you've heard of it is when Julius Caesar would would cross he had to make a decision because no no armies no no Legions who cross the river called the Rubicon down towards Rome and once he crossed that point there was a point of no return where he had to go and take the throne and so he made that decision to cross the Rubicon and and we know Vladimir Putin made that decision when he invaded Ukraine he went past the point of no return Hitler did the same thing and many men have done that same thing as well and and the devil we know it all started in his heart where where no doubt here sit down with other angels that our fellowship talk about God or talk about different things and and and and his whole motive was was a selfish ambition to be like the most high but in order to do that he had to make the other Angels unhappy with their lot with what God had made them to be just like how you know Cora and Nathan there in the wilderness he made the people of Israel unhappy with the leadership of Moses is different things you know so it always happens down Through the Ages where it's selfish ambition causes people to come to a place that's really they should ever be in and and that and that we know uh comes from the enemy right any any negative attribute like selfishness Pride Envy malice Strife all those things came from Satan right and we have to come to a place where like the Lord Jesus said I have no pardon him and he has no pardon me so any part of his character is not mine I'm not signing up for it I don't want nothing I don't want to speak of it I don't want a shadow of it I don't want to trace I don't want nothing that that he is see but the thing is because of man and and and the fall and the garden where unfortunately we have received a fallen character from which actually came from the devil because you know we've got to come to a point and realize we need a new birth to change our nature amen that all that he is the works of the flesh even don't have dominion in our life anymore because we realize when the Holy Ghost truly comes into a person he changes their nature right what you once were I trust you can say and it's not because you quit smoking quit drinking just start coming to church that's not even it it's when he changes your desires your Natures that you will agree with every word of God Amen that you'll say Amen to every word you can't help it because the one who wrote the word is now on you amen but you see now remember Satan's ambition was to be like the most high so he wanted to be worship now it's amazing when you can see this trait fall in among human beings now we understand that when we talk about here for we're jealous for jealousy and selfish ambition exist there'll be disorder and every vile practice now many times we think of all practices maybe of people who dress like the world look like the world talk like the world but we know that Satan did not changes outward appearance you know of of of of dressing right acting right you know his outward manifestation didn't change he looked like a believer right he looked like a Believer so it was what was in his heart was coming out and that's what destroyed you know brought brought all the destruction that we know today so people can dress the part they can act the part they can look like they're walking a Holiness walk but they can be full of a selfish ambition and what does it do it brings in every vile practice and disorder all my and and so so what this produces is actually a disorder is what does that disorder against the word of God where they no longer walk at Harmony with God okay I'm sorry this is not a shouting service okay this is just where we are okay but we've got to say Lord examine us one put us on your sacrifice sacrifice your altar Lord I don't want to be any selfish kind of believer who thinks they're better than someone else and have a bit of a selfish ambition I don't want nothing of that in me I want to be burned out Lord that but that I made in your image see anything is of the devil is opposite or perverted to what God has made right so we don't want every vile practice where there's fussing and fighting and slander and gossip and hatred and Malice and strife and Division and Cults and Clans and clicks and trouble and we don't want any of those things I mean we want a real Unity I mean where where God feels welcome you know I was praying I was praying last night he said Lord may you just feel so welcome remember he he was invited to Simon the Pharisees house he was not felt welcome then but he went anyway because wherever he's invited he goes right but I said Lord me me just feel the most welcome that that that we are known as a people and as individuals and the families that that what we are known by is is in your mind we are the most welcoming the most loving of your presence we we put out the red carpet then the red carpet then the red carpet for you you're so welcome in our lives you never feel embarrassed you never feel you know uneasy you know God feels uneasy sometimes do you think Jesus went into Simon the Pharisees house and was all relaxed no I would have felt tense being in that kind of atmosphere he knew the very motive in Simon's heart than a vitamin there in the first place see so so I was praying Lord we don't want to be like that change our hearts Lord that that when you think of a man I love to spend time with my people then I love to spend time with that family I love spend time with that brother yo yo my son and my daughter I just love their because they love me so much they welcome me so much but you see the enemy wants to bring in a a a disorder and a vile practice where God says well they invited me so I'll turn up but I don't really want to go oh Lord help us amen you see now we I think I got everyone's attention just about now that's good amen but you see uh let's just find the see we live in an age this is our age there's no also than the last days perilous times shall come men shall be lovers of their own selves it's interesting that that is first first listed when God inspires the Apostle Paul to write this down would it be Covetous POTUS boasters proud Blasphemous disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affections truce Breakers false accusers and continent Fierce despise of those that are good traitors handy high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God so these people that that Paul is writing about he's not just talking about people who are atheists or you know got nothing to do with God don't care he's talking about Christian people I mean where where where they men shall be they'll love themselves more lovers of their own selves right lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God so it doesn't say they don't profess to love God doesn't profess that it doesn't say that they don't believe in God but they're selfish they love themselves more than they I love the Lord I pray that we're the opposite of this scripture I pray this is my life you know you know the opposite of this whatever the opposite of the devil is that's me because that's the law that's the word that's what we want to be I mean so so we don't want to fall into this category but we know that this anointing is upon the Earth you know it's all about the time of self and me and my and what I'm doing and all these things and you know we don't need to go into social media this selfie all those things it's all about me me me I I what about me but and and it's amazing how people have that at you being they're so unhappy yeah this is such an unhappy age but it's all about me see it's not about how it used to be you know just get up do your work come on do this think about this other person what about this guy you know it's all changed but people are less happy now with this kind of mentality than they were a generation at least ago but we don't want to get caught up in the same trap where it's all about selfishness oh my now I gotta find that as I said my notes are never ever in order but you see now we need to come to a place you said I mean always go to this a bit more see and the Lord would speak about in this day there should be signs in the sun and the moon and the stars and upon the Earth the stress of nations with perplexity and the season waves roaring men's Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken nice but this is the spirit of the age this one but that's not our portion just like to be a lover of your own self love is a pleasure more than lovers of God these things are here we can't escape it we're not called to live in a monastery somewhere in the bush somewhere and just you and your family and you know no we're we're in the world but we're not of the world Okay so we've got to realize these things are here but we need to get into the spirit of the word to overcome these things see it's so important that we that we don't just go through the motions of Christianity but we get into the Holy Ghost himself and then walk with him amen see it's so important that we get into the spirit first see if we're going to live as Christians brother but I'm saying we have to be in his Spirit John was not talking about being in his own Spirit when he said I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day that would not have brought these visions that had to be the spirit of God it had to be the spirit of God with us too or all our efforts are in vain Paul said I'll pray in the spirit I'll sing in the spirit I'll live in the spirit if there's if there is anything good that will come to me it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and made manifest by the results it bears as surely as John needed to be in the spirit to receive these tremendous Revelations fresh from Jesus we need to be in the spirit to understand the revelations that God has given to us to live by his word for it is the same spirit amen said look at it this way all too many people read the Bible where it says in Acts 2 38 repent to be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and just pass right on they don't see it if they saw it by getting in the spirit they would know that if they want to receive the Holy Spirit they need to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and then God would be Duty bound to fulfill his word by filling them with the Holy Ghost they never get in his Spirit or it would happen to them exactly as the word says pray to God for a revelation by his spirit that is the first step get in the spirit see when we get in the spirit then all of all of the things in our life that are not of God become revealed writers like when you're walking in darkness you shine a bright light you see where all the bugs are the Shadows are and you see everything for what it is now who remembers being young and there's some big Shadow comes at night time across the wall and it seems so terrifying but then as soon as you you know you call mum or dad and they turn on the light you say oh that's just some I don't know some some toy on the ground projecting that shadow it's really nothing you see so we need a light to shine to show us really what these things are and so hey that's actually doesn't belong to me well I think this thing is it's not mine and it can really reveal what it is amen so we need to get in the spirit first it is absolutely important you see now brother bear makes a statement there is nothing as such prevailing power as the revelation of the word amen faith is a revelation it gives you power over the enemy the world and yourself amen so that's why it's so important Lord give me Revelation of you reveal yourself to me in your word Lord I don't want to approach your word like a textbook Lord I want every relationship with you and your word that you can reveal yourself to me amen because as he reveals himself to you then he becomes begins to form character in you that's manifested in Trials amen you see it's so important that we that we don't ever get selfish in our walk with God see this world is a selfish world but we aren't called to live as a selfish people now what is uh the meaning of a selfish person this is from Miriam Webster the dictionary it says what is uh the meaning of a selfish person it's concerned expressly or exclusively with oneself seeking or concentrating on one's own Advantage what was Satan doing concentrating on his own Advantage I'm going to get these angels to follow me and they're going to worship me I want to be like the most high it's your selfish ambition in his heart that caused this chaos that we live in right now amen see concerning one's own Advantage pleasure or or well-being without regard for others arising with concern with one's own welfare or advantage and disregard of others it's a selfish act so selfishness is not about the other person it's about you I mean and that's what the devil's interested and he doesn't actually care about those who serve him doesn't care about the angels that followed him they just Cannon fighter in his books he's not even interested in their welfare he just wants to ascend to where he wants to be amen but God is the opposite of that amen you are the focus of his being right now you are actually his purpose right now is you and your welfare and you being gathered to him your Redemption and remember when when you when he was on the cross you were on his mind remember he didn't just die there haphazardly saying well someone will feel sorry for me one day and be a Christian no he knew you and he knew you needed Redemption that's why he put your own life above himself he was not selfish at all amen he put his own needs secondary to yours Hallelujah that's how our God works amen amen and you take any True Believer down Through the Ages they put themselves second and they put God's needs in the and and God's people's needs above their own amen because remember we've got to be careful what is our ambition to be a Christian is it too is it to have an influence over a group of people is it to be a celebrity in a little kind of part of society what is our ambition when when when I stand here or someone preaches or someone plays an instrument or sings what's the ambition behind it is the ambition to say look at me and look how good I am see we're not here to applaud gifts we're here to praise God right so so what are we what's our ambition I want to be noticed well that's selfish we want him to be known remember a mature grain boughs like this yeah a mature one is up like this it's saying look at me here I am I've done this and God told me to do this and all it's all about me right by the mature one bows in the presence of the Sun and when you see someone or something bowing you're like what is that what is that personal thing bowing to and you look at the thing you look at the object it's bowing to right so it should be the same thing with us like what is what is our ambition amen if our ambition is to see him live you can't be selfish right but if you're ambition is to be look at me and who I am and what I can do I think you got a trait you need to get rid of because it was in heaven and not in God now it's upon the Earth in human beings and so you know we've got to be very very careful what's our motive and objective is it to be a blessing or just to be blessed by Praise you know what is the yeah because it can look the same like I could stand here and you know try and point everything to me the conclusion of my sermon is I'm awesome you know I could do that right and then but then you just preach a different way a proper way and it's God's awesome you know it could be My Mind Is Awesome look what I've put together look at all this yeah but then it could be the same notes and look God is awesome because he gave it and it's him who's the center of it it can look the same but the actually the motive is very different see so we're going to be very careful in our Christian walk like even we compare families with families we shouldn't do that well my lifestyle's been in that my yeah but but what is the reason of that comparison to make you look better where did that come from that's not out of the Bible in terms of God that's not Christianity no that's that's Antichrist see it can appear so close this is the age where everything's so gray it's all mixed like this but God is black and white there's truth in this era but the devil wants to try and push into the truth and take most of the truth and make it error we needed a Discerning spirit I mean that we can look Beyond these things and say no I'm concentrating on his Advantage I'm just using those words I want him to live amen I want the Lord to be glorified say to be condescending is selfish in itself to be condescending uh towards people patronizing giving a superiority that is selfishness because you're contrasting comparing yourself to someone else and lifting yourself up and putting that person down see sideways remarks about other people and especially that's Satan we're not here to tear each other down we don't want to be see a selfish a selfish believer there's like the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff now that's uh that's not a that's just imposed there that's the Cliffs of Dover I think um you know England but anyway a selfish believer wants someone to fall and they actually trying to push them over the cliff by comments and attitudes that's selfish because they want to look better than them and then they fall and they say look I told you so yeah I had a feeling you know the Lord told me this would happen well if that was true why are you the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff you should be at the top of the top of the cliff stopping the person in love see look Jeremiah got a vision that the Babylonians gonna come and destroy Israel and thinks he didn't sit there when it happened said I told you so he gave his life saying turn from your wickedness Israel these guys are going to come and destroy us he actually had a burden of genuine care why because he wasn't the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff so what I mean by the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff now is when someone goes out into the world and then oh now we need to pray for them now we need to reach out to them well why didn't you reach out to them when they're walking up the top of the cliff and teetering and are they going to give their lives to Lord or not or you know we should be at the top of the cliff if you really cared for CeCe see it appears see it appears good when you say oh we need to pray for them because they're struggling they're in those troubles and they've gone to the world now that's just an ambulance at the bottom of the cliff it looks good but it's actually not right we should be at the top of the cliff creating an atmosphere and being warm and caring and loving creating a creating an environment that we can walk through these doors and say well at least I can relax in this place at least I can let off the pressure I don't need to be all tense and worry about people say about me but I can actually let off the pressure just worship God no matter what I'm going through the Troubles of my life the questions I have I can actually relax in this place praise God is that what you want that's what you want in your home don't you you can be facing hell day after they have trouble at school trouble at Job whatever but at least you have a sanctuary of your home right and that's where it should be and that's the reason you want to go home is like man I can just put my feet up you know I can relax sure you may be busy lots of kids all these things but you can actually just relax there don't we want Church to be the same way and actual an actual place where people can let off the pressure doesn't matter what they're going through you say well I'm struggling but just that's fine in terms of just come right we're not here to throw anyone off the cliff with discernment no a lot of it's just a selfish critical nature see we we never want to come to a place where all we care about is people leaving in terms of well I knew they'd leave where was the heart to go after that person where was the heart to be their friend and you know have it have a bit of an influence you know a real genuine friendship because you care about them right you don't want to appear some people they they they pick their friends based on because they're better than that person maybe they're smarter maybe they're richer maybe that's not real friendship that's a selfish ambition just to say well I'm better than these people around me we should never be like that who's with me today amen see we live in this perilous time now there's a there's a syndrome that goes around in this day and age called the elder brother syndrome it's a real bad syndrome it's deadly to the one carrying it it can look so good it can appear so right but yet it's a terrible thing it doesn't break out in scabs doesn't break out in big growths you know but but it looks so bad man I love looking for pictures though I just have a good time but you see here's the elder brother so so you see the one outside there's a protocol Sons come home everyone's rejoicing everyone's happy you know the father's happy everyone's happy apart from the this guy it's like what's wrong with you you should be rejoicing here's your brother he's come home he was dead you know he's dead now he's alive he was in sin he did all these things you know you remember the pain of when he left and took the inheritance all those things I'm just kind of filling in the you know what his father could have said to him you know why can't you be happy he's he's part of you he's your family he's got the last last surname as you he was raised with you he used to play together all these things but this guy is just not happy why because he came down with an elder brother syndrome wow and it can look so right but be so wrong see notice this you see it's selfish and he said unto him there so this is the father speaking now thy Brothers come and they um and thy father has killed the fatted calf because he hath received him safe and sound and he was angry yeah and would not go in that's an angry face in case you're wondering that's an angry face that guy's mad the greatest the greatest thing that could happen to the family outside of a wedding has just happened I'd say it's even greater than a wedding because he was lost and now he's found he was dead and trespasses and sins and now he's saved so it's the greatest thing I'm in the salvation of a soul The Prodigal Son coming home the answer to prayer is just walked in the door Hallelujah the prayers and the and the crying out the fasting and praying has just been manifested in their home and he's got an angry face why because he's selfish and he was angry and would not go in well he's throwing a tantrum I'm not going in there therefore came his father out and entreated him and he answered and said to his father Lo these many years now notice the I and the me and all these things Lo these many years uh do I serve thee neither transgressed I at any time my commandment and yet thou has never given me a kid this is not fair look see he's being selfish what what should I get out of this deal see you had to sell this Farm or you had to do whatever to give him his inheritance he spent it all he enjoyed it all I've never left I was raised in church I've always been good I've always been serving along and look someone else comes in from the world you make a big Fanfare what about me so I'll just bring it into today's language we should always be happy we should never have any elder brother syndrome we should have we should have the Father's Heart see see the elder brother did not know the heart of his own father though he worked for him he served them he had communication with him but he didn't know his father's heart see his father's heart was mercy and Redemption and that's what was the heart of the father and that is the heart of the father today our Lord Jesus Christ it's mercy and Redemption outside of that we have lost sight of why we're here amen and we should ever lose sight of why we're here that's why I say and you know we should never forget where we came from we came from a lot of deep dark pits but we didn't stay in those deep dark pits amen of Despair and pain wherever we're from the world trouble whatever it is but remember God can reach down further than we can even look up Hallelujah so we must never forget amen that where we came from they say well I feel so condemned by those memories no you shouldn't feel condemned amen you should actually be thankful God allows us to remember our past that we stay thankful not to hold us over us like a big weight no because remember you've got to go from those memories and keep walking maybe a few days until we felt where he found you and you're no longer that person no more amen Hallelujah amen see yet thou has never given me a kid did I make Mary with my friends but as soon as this thy son has come didn't even say as soon as my brother came you know or this thy son let's all be distant now and you know you know oh that's just a new believer you know brother Ram says that someone who's really given their hearts to the Lord come under the blood of Jesus Christ has more Authority with God than an archangel in heaven that never fell no he's just brother man come on come on what's wrong yeah we should just look at each other you're my brother you're my sister Hallelujah you know that's how we should die it's not all this thy son no let's get rid of that which has devoured thy living with harlots thou has killed for him the fatter calf so he's like look you didn't even give me a kid like a goat baby goat and look you're killing the fanica for this guy see if it was the other way around I think he'd be happier why because it's selfish ambition and he said unto him son thou art ever with me and all that I have is thine it was meat that we should make Miriam be glad for this thy brother was dead and is alive again and was lost and is found so we never want to be we never want to have the elder brother syndrome where someone starts walking comes back to the Lord or comes because they want to get back to him and we push them down we say you'll never make it you know some some young person who wants to serve God we should never kick each other down you're ordained to make one person a punching bag the devil you are just go for it have at it have at it as long as you want with all the feeling you've got just just give them heaps okay you just give them heaps but don't ever pull pull some Friendly Fire you know terrorism you know sleeper cells are a problem even today in Europe different things that you know they're worried about sleeper cells who know what a Sleeper Cell is it's a terrorist organization and they just plant people in a society and they blend in and they do everything but in their hearts they're going to do something very different and then there Comes A Time to strike and they blow stuff up they murder people do horrible things why because it was asleep but now it comes awake now we never want to be a Sleeper Cell where it's a lot of looks like Friendly Fire you know where where people start shooting one another instead of shooting the devil to me that's terrorism we don't want to be terrorists we're not here to shoot each other you know we should never have any Friendly Fire of well if you're really a Christian you wouldn't do this that person's pummeled on the ground are they alive I don't know you know and then they and then they leave the Lord they say well I knew that I'd leave they couldn't take correction but what's the motive behind what you're saying to them see it's amazing brother Brown makes a statement now it's amazing how much he talks about selfishness mate talks about it so much it's really really interesting now he says and I recognized the other day a selfish Spirit coming up in me of saying this man is wrong I ought to tell him about it that's wrong you say well wouldn't that be the right thing to do what is your ambition is your ambition basically the conclusion of your conversations I'm better than you I'm more Christian than you you know I'm more I'm more Sanctified than you if that's your ambition it's a selfish spirit because you're trying to make yourself look Superior to someone else a Silver Spirit coming up in me of saying this man's wrong I ought to tell him about it that's wrong God is the one who tells them about it that's it's none of my business but my business is to preach the gospel and love everybody and move on and love my enemies as Jesus Christ loved me when I was his enemy that's right when I was unlovely who remembers those times when you're unlovely very much I'll put both hands up because I remember those times sometimes I still think I'm unlovely but yeah he loved me to his bosom and anybody that's unlovely let me love them the same let the spirit that was in Christ be in US amen I love him I love him oh my so we must never get to a point where we just wreck someone over the coals because they may be struggling or doing something we you know we need the spirit of the Lord if you really care about someone just like yo you have children start acting up parents other parents don't put them under a put them in an interrogation seat and just just pour into the ninth degree throw the book of them if you really care about them talk to their parents right that's what we should do why do we yeah a lot of time people just want to blow someone up I feel better now I got that off my chest look at the Carnage you've just caused how was that the Lord no selfish ambition luciferian nature that needs to be burnt out see we should never ever have we should be able to recognize a selfish Spirit you say well that just grinds my gears when that person does that maybe it's something in you that needs to be ground out maybe that's something in you that you actually want to do but oh I'll look bad see we should serve God from our hearts say this is not a Conformity this is not a communistic idea where you've got to wear the same uniform and do all the same things no we live according to the word of God because we love him amen I trust that's not shocking to anyone no we serve him because we love him I'm not a Christian because I'm afraid of hell I'm not serving him because I'm a scared he's going to throw me away if he threw me into hell and I had the same spirit in me here that I have I'll love him now Hallelujah that's how I feel amen so we should never have a selfish Spirit coming in us now it's amazing we're we're even even motives let's just go here Brother Band talks about selfishness a lot go do a study it's very interesting then there's another little door he's talking about the door of a um of Hearts here that's right I'm around the corner another little door and that's the door of selfishness I'll let you in Lord I'll join your church and then just to see what I can get out of it that's selfishness I want the Holy Ghost why why do you want it that that that that you'll become some great person that you'll think boy or do you wanna you wanna see the Holy Ghost he can live in your life that he can be glorified not that you can be glorified that he can be glorified oh Lord I want a testimony why do you want to testimony that you can put yourself in that testimony because remember every testimony is God's doing like brother I'm upset about the Ohio River where the pillar of fire came down the voice spoke out as John the Baptist 4 on the first coming of Christ your message before on the second he said I was just there when God turned up that was that was the prophet's attitude I was just there when he turned up and I think that should be our attitude too amen amen well what happened at Camp well I was just hearing God turned up Hallelujah yeah that's how we should be that should be our whole testimony I just happen to be in the same place at the right place at the right time and and it wasn't even me leading me there as God himself for him to show up and do what he wanted to do so why do we want a testimony amen why do we want a Ministry why do we want a song we didn't do specials and play and things what's the motive behind it oh my God see and sometimes that gets into preachers you know they say well I'll be a minister if anyone if everybody Pat me on the back and say you're a good fellow if everybody patted me on the back and said I was a good fella I'd get to the altar just quick as I could because I know there'd be something wrong because the Bible said woe unto you when all men speak well of you see the world knows its own the world will hate you but God will love you and this little selfish you know how long we could dwell on that selfishness my you say well I just want to be loved by everyone you won't be loved by everyone yeah politicians try and do that it just doesn't work and we're not politicians this is not a parliament amen we're not a democracy in that way no I'd rather be kicked out of Earth and be accepted into heaven than be accepted down here and kicked out of heaven amen so you know let's just love the Lord eh I think it's real important now but you see even it's amazing because even the you say well I want to do something and it's according to the word but what's your ambition to do it because a selfish ambition will actually stop that happening the it'll actually be wrong I'm just going to read a bit because this is fascinating this is a Methodist Minister I was just sitting in the car a few moments ago that had come down with me very fine beloved brother and wife and family we were speaking about that just before coming into the building and he was saying I said the first thing that I always try and find out brother Collins was whether it was God's will or not to do a certain thing that's pretty straightforward yeah that's in the word if you stay in the word you're fine right it's not a what about sub Clause a b and second opinions 25 no forget that if it's in the word and the boundaries of the word that's God's will right um oh my where are we where are we looking here there we are right see um and I know it's God's will and I'm doing it for the purp it's the and if I uh sorry uh or was whether it was God's will or not to do a certain thing and then test my motive towards doing it and if I have no selfishness nothing and I know it's God's will and I'm doing it for that purpose because it's his will he won't fail you then so if there's not a selfish ambition behind it then God won't value I mean but if it's his will and you've got a selfish motive in it it's just the same as not being his will because it won't work isn't that incredible maybe or it can be it can be completely the word of God nothing contrary to the word of God but yet if there's selfish ambition injected God won't stand for it and it's just like you're actually outside of the will of God Amen because it just won't work that's amazing when you even think about people who start becoming preachers and pastors so on if they have us if they have a selfish motive behind what they're doing they'll never have a successful Fellowship it will never grow spiritually in terms of character I'm not talking about numbers because not even a numbers things about the character of Christ God moving his word manifesting but if their motive is well I've got to prove a point I've got to be somebody I want to show you that you know it's amazing how a whole church movements will start because people just get have a selfish motive King Henry VII of England started the Anglican church because he wanted a divorce oh but it's part of the Reformation brother Ben and God's restoring his word reforming no he started that church because he wanted a divorce the pope wouldn't give him a divorce that was his ambition that was his reasoning behind the Anglican Church that we see around the world today it started because he wanted a divorce that's selfish man yeah should be a unanimous amen right there amen but you see that will see his motive wasn't pure right it was see and then and that's just the yellow bit there and though and though we can see the wrath of man praising God in such events as Henry VII taking up for the reformation and the rejection of papal Authority it's a far cry from the truth of Pentecost and protection of an omnipotent God he was annoyed at the pope so he did his own thing people get annoyed at churches Ministries the word whatever they go do their own thing that's a selfish motive we don't want to be that way who's who's still with me today okay we'll be done soon you know just just just hold tight you know I don't know where this is going to end because my slides aren't in order anymore but we'll get off somewhere and have lunch okay or go on a Rapture whatever's I'd rather go and Rapture but you see we don't we don't want to have a selfish motive in anything we do how we raise our children we don't want to be selfish right we don't want to look the part because so we'll look better than someone else no one's last name here is the Jones Jones is a praise God if brother Jones comes in well hey we'll just love him and he'll understand but we're not here to keep up with the Joneses we're not here to compare and say well this church is like this so we need to be like this or this ministry is like this so we should have this kind of ministry no or this family's like this we should be like this or I'm glad I'm not like that that's selfish because it's all about you or me in the picture we've got to get rid of all that uh thinking now I'm not saying we have this but you know may we never be selfish amen because you know selfishness can come in it's a very it's a very dangerous thing now we know when Jesus was baptized John John said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world and the spirit of God descended upon the Lord Jesus like a dove now we know a lamb and a dove have the same kind of nature Meek gentle timid creatures right and so because they were the same nature they could they could dwell together now when we are born we are not born with a lamb or a dove nature doesn't matter how see someone can be very quiet but they can be a wolf man they can see be because the Bible says even a fool that doesn't speak much is counted wise right but anyway that's what Proverbs is right so even if someone doesn't talk much man they're wise they can be the dumbest thing out you know in terms of foolishness I'm not talking about how smart they are doing doing school work I'm talking about speaking Street wise in terms of how God works and how you know how the world is and different things right so we don't want to be fools but you see now we're born with a wolf nature and that's why we need a real New Birth experience that God changes our nature to be like his nature then the spirit of God the dove amen can come and dwell in our hearts and live in our lives but you see we have this thing where this body is not converted so there is a wolf nature living in all of us yeah amen I'm glad someone's honest there amen you know this flesh must be be changed and we're going to be happy when that day happens Hallelujah not because there's the creeks and the pains and things of getting older no because this nature that you wrestle with right but if the Holy Ghost comes in then God gives you power to subdue that nature I mean that's why we never live by our feelings your feelings will rob you of every blessing of God it can you feel up you feel down sideways you feel like there's no way you could ever be saved the next day you feel like man I'm going to stomp on every devil in hell and you know because you go up and down right we don't go by feeling we go by faith amen the word of God hallelujah so we walk by that but you see now what happens is we can let things come in you see now brother Brahm says if the Lamb of God would would have made the first snow like a wolf or would have done anything contrary to what the gentle Dove would have permitted the dove would have took her flight she would have left in a minute and that's the reason and that's the reason today that we're wondering what's the matter with the Pentecostal church I'll say what's the matter with the message because I love to bring these things into here there's no point just uh you know I you know I enjoyed being um you know spending time on my uncles and Friends Farms growing up but I never pitchforked hay and I don't want to start right I'm not here to Pitchfork I don't even have a pitchfork right so any of these kind of things I don't say oh you're those people no I always bring it down home amen I like that kind of thing it's because you've taken on a different nature you've taken on the uh on a nature that we won our rights we're going to do what we know is right to do and we become arrogant we become hostile we become indifferent we let temper come in we let selfishness come in why because it's all about me amen so so when brother bands talk about this he's not saying these people and uh these people are not converted right they're saying that they've allowed the wolf nature of their flesh to rise up a cardinality to rise up that the spirit of God takes its flight now we know the Bible says don't grieve the Holy Ghost we're by your seal to the day of your Redemption so we can grieve them but doesn't mean we lose our ceiling right it doesn't mean we have to go back and be you know doesn't mean we become a sinner again we've got to get baptized and start all over again no we just have Grieves them so the holy spirit is like a dove he goes up in the rafters waiting for our heart to come right again waiting for us to repent and then that sweetness and gentleness and love of God comes back in amen because we all know when we're carnal if you're mainly carnal most of the time you need an altar right because it shouldn't just be a constant do good Do Bad No it should be an overcoming your life should be trending upwards closer to God more like God you're sure you have your dips and valleys but but the overall trend of your life should be like this amen that to me that's overcoming amen so see so we become we let selfishness come in so we don't want to let selfishness ever come in amen where we begin to think we're right and everyone else is wrong we do everything out of a selfish ambition he says now would you stand out to sing his presence here and know that that he's here look the holy spirit's Witnesses see the scientific world says it's here the Bible says it's here what are we going to do about it are we going to turn our back on it and walk away say well I'm Presbyterian while I'm Lutheran I'm Pentecostal I'm as good as anybody else oh brother that's a selfish thing so you say well I was raises in the message I've been baptized right I'm as good as anyone else that's a selfish thing amen we never want to be into that kind of a state we want to say Lord change me make me more like you all of my life may not be selfish may it not be see people will pull deals that they benefit out of it mainly it may look so good for everyone else but actually they just want to pull a deal that they get the greatest benefit that's a selfish deal it can look right on the outside but really what's the what's the conclusion of the matter I see some of you thinking very deeply some of you have left the building come back today but you know we're going to be careful what's the motive that we that that we're Believers what's the motive that we have children we raise them a certain way what's the motive of how we treat our spouses and different things is it selfish or is it they their life is more important than your own because any any selfish ambition grounds the power of God see we can have the truth we can we can know all the truth we know the words open all these great Revelations and things that God has opened up in this day but if we have a selfish objective it'll ground the power of God remember the full purpose of God restoring his word is that the Holy Ghost would have free course like never before and moving great power but if there's selfishness in our hearts amen it grounds the power of God right there doesn't matter how true it is how great it is you know it doesn't matter our objective if we have selfishness in our hearts the power of God will not move and that's what we want Above All Things is the power of God to move remember it's the power of God that changes Hearts the power of God that saves us the power of God that heals the power of God that redeems is the power of God that casts out demon powers right so we'd never ever want to have a selfish objective of a look at me it's all about me I'm better than the next guy no remember who who are we comparing to are we comparing to the word is the word our mirror that we compare to or is it each other I trust your mirror is not me yeah you've got a real crazy Wharf tomorrow if you're looking at me you're going to look at the right mirror who's who's ever been in one of those mirrors where he goes real big your legs are small and all those you know that's a crazy mirror and people look at me and look what I look like no you're looking at the wrong image you got to look at a right mirror which is the image of God's word amen not to not to be selfish not to be patronizing you see there are some people in the Bible that were not selfish now we can talk about the scribes and Pharisees we never went to that but you know well necessarily but you know there's some people who are not selfish see a real believer is not selfish when Abraham and lots Hersman were having strive God let um Abraham said a lot well you take you take the best bit yeah why because he wasn't selfish see a real believer he has no selfishness in him at all amen that's how we should be like amen when Hannah went to the Tabernacle and was crying out to God for a child amen her her desire wasn't a selfish desire because she was willing to give that child back to God amen CeCe see it's a it's a noble thing to to want God to answer prayer but what's the motive behind it see her motive was Lord whatever you give me I'm going to give back to you amen and because God knew that she would do it that way she gave he gave her a greater blessing a prophet that changed dispensations from judges to the line of Kings amen goes why because I'm Samuel anointed saw the anointed king David right so so you know what is our what is our motive yeah you know we're going to be careful because sometimes God will even answer selfish prayer Balaam Balaam uh was hired by by Moab to curse Israel with money his whole purpose of being hired was selfish I want to become rich and he had the right approach to God the same approach to God that Moses did the number of sacrifices and things but if but his motive to call down the presence of God was selfish we're going to be really careful he said but God answers my prayers but what's the motive in your heart he even prophesied true his prophecies are still ringing out today you read numbers 22-25 see but his motives were selfish he said but God's answered my prayers here therefore he therefore I must be right with him not necessarily that's why you've got to say Lord I want to line up with your word whatever you want me to be Lord I want to be that I don't want to justify my Christian walk in anything see many people try and they want their experience to be their ultimate we want the word of God to be our ultimate sure he gives us experiences we could stand here for a very long time and share Supernatural experiences we know those things right but you see we don't want to say well God's blessing therefore I must be right now we're right because we want him to live according to his word in our lives amen amen Hallelujah now we're just going to finish with this because it's our time now maybe somebody would say brother saw brother Paul we want you to come over here because you've got the biggest church uh we've got the biggest congregation your offerings will be great and so forth but being pressed in the spirit he thought I've got a brother over there I'd like you to go over and save this brother get him to the Lord but yet the spirit pressed him to go somewhere else he was a prisoner see this was a man who had no selfish objectives when he was a Pharisee the Pharisees that was selfish because the prestige that came with that look at me I yo people would bow my presence oh we'll ask we'll ask brother Saul because he's an authority on the Torah all these things it was a selfish a self objective right but when he met the Lord on the road to Damascus God burn that out of him Paula they didn't care about his reputation didn't care about Prestige what people thought of him all he wanted to do was that the Lord would be glorified in his life and when Paul wrote Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ he wasn't just talking about the natural prison bars no that was not what he's talking about he's not being a prisoner to the Lord that even he wouldn't even do his own will amen yeah that is someone who has no selfishness in them it's a foreign strange thing amen and that's what we want to be oh God make us prisoners like that from our own selfish ambition and from our own judgments and our Better Way overthinking to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ I think that that was a great statement that I'm a prisoner to Jesus Christ amen I trust that your heart's desire this morning that you don't want to live in a way that you put people down and make yourself look better you're not condescending to one another that your motive of actually being a friend to someone is not that you get a benefit out of it amen and you're not a Believer so people think you're something amen you don't you don't play or preach or sing or whatever do Sunday school whatever it may be because people will think you're something greater than someone who doesn't that's selfish ambition you know you don't see we don't want to be like that we don't want to ground the power of God we want the Lord to live amen let's um let's have the musicians come this morning shall we let's be prisoners today amen Hallelujah amen amen may we never look down on someone who wants to serve God right how can we ever think of someone who wants to serve God and push them down I don't even want to see that look on anyone's face including mine you know here's a testimony just walks on the door and look what he's doing yeah yeah we don't want to be that way friends that look came from Satan selfish ambition came from Satan if you want this order in your life and every vile thing have a selfish I just want to put that scripture up and then we're going to sing um we have a song for jealousy and selfish ambition exists there will be dishonor and every vile practice Lord Jesus Keep it far from us as East is from the West lord
