write any more it means trials you know and yeah after that was the biggest trial so I said another song this song here before the lockdown sister Christine asked me have you are you writing another song and I said yes actually I do and she asked what's it called I said let God live and that's all I had was just the title so two months later I know the word has been so good so part of it is just you know I was thinking about shame girl is better being had been preaching about and how he got to recognize who he is the circumstance hasn't changed it's the same but it's something in his thinking changed and when I wrote this and basically it just came there was one line missing as it kept praying note what is this one mine and it was the greatest battle ever fought and that's where it is it's it's he also administered about the Barrow field is is where it's a no-man's land but that's where the enemy is being defeated and so face the Lord after that you see no enemy no more he's yeah you know like Moses and him they saw their enemy no more so yeah and in one line he says when the enemy surrounds me like a flood the Lord will raise up a standard I had to try and find where was the scripture and it's Isaiah 59 right at the end I was so pleased reading it and then the very next chapters as is 60 races arised you know it and shine the light has come yeah I was just having such a good time so other words there I was that was funny there are times of trouble and despair so many burdens to bear but I learned to put my trust in God and let God live let God live let him live in me let God lead having the victory I open my to the things of God and let God live in the greatest battle ever for the enemy you will come like a flood I will let the Lord raise a stand and let God let

[Music] [Music] bro [Applause] [Music] a price the Lord and I men it's good to be together it's good to worship the Lord and no better place to be tonight amen so I'm glad I'm here not without any hindrance you're a devil always tries to stop you from doing his work no matter what he did he tries to stop you he tries to stop you from pretty tries to stop you from going to church he tries to distract you from listening that's that's what it is when he have those attacks you know there's a place together you know I hope the two that I'm not looking my best in heights but that doesn't really matter it's what what's being said I have a lisp tonight and and you know the enemy would say just wait a few weeks till you have what everything's fixed up but hey redeemed the time while his time you know were like we had a brother in church he didn't want to miss any Sundays and one Sunday morning she stole his dentures he had zero teeth I only have one missing but he had none and he wasn't till you know you can find him but then he saw both the Lord has made with these or without these amen so well I'm glad we're here glad we made it so um can we just pray first Heavenly Father tonight we are gathered together just to look to you to hear from you Lord ah I look to you that he grab needs just an inspiration to say something that would encourage and strengthen and edify the body of Christ I just pray that you grant us words to speak and these two here tonight and commit this time into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated yes we all have something to give to edify the body of Christ sometimes yeah you know like tonight was placed by this song I believe that's of the Lord because if it's off the Lord it will bless the body if it's off yourself you know it's just somebody trying to sing a song but I like to start reading first Corinthians chapter 15 this is one to six Bible says here moreover brethren I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand by which also ye are saved if you keep the men in memory what I preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain for I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures and that he was seen of Cephas then of the twelve after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part remain unto this prison but some are fallen asleep is that wonderful here is Paul preaching and said I only give you what I have received you know you may be seated you know I can only give what I have received I've had people telling me what to preach you won't believe it tell me we should preach this and you should preach that and you I only preach what I have received so I can only give what I received you remember Jesus was feeding the 5000 and some air to breathe basking and some hid fish well I can't give you a fish I've got the braid here but both was to give you life you know both was ordained by the Lord but what I'm trying to point out here in these scriptures poses I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received what that how the Christ died for our sins you know we can't just stop there he died for our sins according to the scriptures that is the point it's got to be according to the word you know devil wanted him to jump off the cliff if he would have done that and if he would have broken his neck there would be no salvation because it would not have been according to the scripture so whatever we do it's got to be according to the scripture and how can you live according to Scripture and less it's given to you you cannot live according to scripture if other people tell you what to do and how to do it just imagine we have a love relationship with Jesus Christ you believe that now if you ever love a relationship you don't need two people people tell you how to love you beloved I don't need to God tell me brother Isaac you know or you should you know sister Shannon you should do this and you should you know Gmail they like to be tickled on a photo oh yeah no nonsense how would I know you have a relationship with him so the only way you can actually fulfill the scripture is if you do what he tells you to do it not what anybody tells you I mean it's greatly we have a fivefold ministry according to the Word of God there's many many good preachers and ministers but they can only edify you too more in love with him you know that's that's really what did this so I like that idea so he says how he died for our sins according to scriptures because he died according to scriptures what happened that he was buried and he rose again the third day according to the scriptures you know he knew I'm fulfilling the Word of God I'm dying here according to scripture and I will rise again a third day that's what the scripture says there was no doubt even death could not scare you away from the Word of God so when you get a hold of these things you're not easily shaken you know your anchor holds your anchor holds and you're not anchored just in some some well-meaning whatever is preached or some church denomination your anchor in Christ in His Word and then you know he will not let you down you know we sometimes get tested and we see the hand of God not always instantly the way when we want to see it in his time sometimes it's instant and sometimes it's down the track I remember a time at a young family only two children and I let myself out into I quit my job and went studying and did all these different things and ended up with not enough money so what do you do you count I had given $135 a week student allowance there ain't alone $140 a week how do we eat how do we fund the other five dollars and all these different things and then you know when you struggle like this you get well-meaning people to rub it in you know there was foolish to leave a job having a young family including a good job just to go studying how would they know what's gone through my mind how would they know what I experienced say was you how will people know what are you going through unless the little Josie I was talking to a brother tonight I sit on the phone I said you know he's often misunderstood and others and misunderstood and he misunderstands I said look people have such limited horizon they don't know what you've been through they don't know yeah you know what what jobs he had people were high up here or down low they're not that it matters but they haven't got a clue and you cannot explain say if you make a decision or do a certain thing in a few words because you will have to explain your entire life you have to explain your entire thought pattern you have to explain all the things to look minister to you you can't do it that's why we need to trust love one another as we are you see there's a lot of people I don't understand why are they doing this you know that's stupid or foolish but hey I don't know where which way this comes through as long we walk in the same direction that's important so as we are including Christ he is our absolute we know Paul had an absolute that was his experience on the way to Damascus he never looked back he always mentioned it and he knew Christ is alive because he heard from him personally once it happens in your life nobody can drag you away from it in other way the hundred horses know nothing and but people try don't think it people don't try but you see that the Bible says my sheep will hear my voice and as strange as it will not follow so we know what God speaks to us you know when God first speaks to you not when you end up in in a good church when you still in a world he calls you out he calls the lost sheep he calls you out you know something I've had people that kind of been the Lord because you weren't in a message they know you were this whole listen to nothing to do with it you're either his or not his and if he calls he his voice then you respond to it and then you hear it again and then you hear it again and then here again and it draws you into that place where you come behind the vial into Christ it leads you there so what I'm trying to encourage you this evening respond to that inner voice some twenty seven eight I just read you that it says here twenty seven eight so lovely verse it says when thou sittest seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I seek when thou sittest who the Lord when he speaks you know sometimes as a sit some of those people speak may and speak but wasn't the Lord speaking to you you can say whatever speech Suman always good word there was a good word I whatever was a good word what's a God speaking or was it man speaking and if God speaks and you heart responds because it speaks to your heart you know it so much if it is there's so much going on speaking to the intellect to the mind we can chew it up and work it out lay it out print it out yeah you know but has its spoken inside what happens when it speaks inside say what happens there will be a manifestation God is not just speaking words in vain he says my word will not return void so there is to be a manifestation of what God speaks to us so when God speaks to you as I said there's a lot of hindrances from you doing what he says I mean it can go into a very real little thing I know I'm not supposed to take my wife as an example but we've had meetings she said at home oh I felt like jumping up and say price the Lord I said why didn't you do it who told you that the Holy Spirit or the devil you know and if it's the Lord putting on your heart it's job Bob would say praise the Lord just do it we're no brother you know in the middle of preaching he used to come forward and kneel down you know fine that's the way it feels right do it do it yeah yeah you know it's so important to realize it's an individual walk if each one place is part then we function tonight I mean these paths sometimes change tonight um maybe say if we talk about the clock I'm the clock face tonight a saint in the front you look at me you know yeah quarter past 9:00 you know what I mean but inside there's many little gears ticking and going and if one misses out you haven't got the right time but if you want to know what the right time is we'll play our part I think it's wonderful so I never despise the least of anything because there's no such thing in the household of God even the least the Bible says in the kingdom of God is greater in John the Baptist even the least well that's a good one isn't it so we just read some twenty seven eight he speaks we here in the heart man speaks we're here about it with Rosie yes barber says in I think in regulations 322 somewhere he that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches he that has near not that one this one in here you know it many people read that and and read the book of Revelation hasn't got a clue what it is doesn't speak to them that ever naturally and then you get all these different interpretations and ideas but we have an inner ear and we have the ability to hear him so when you hear him respond with you heart if he uh I don't know if we should say that there was a brother lovely brother his where he came from South Africa he was talking about the meetings they had and Holy Ghost moving in South Africa you know and one day the Holy Ghost came down in a meeting so much he started shout hallelujah hallelujah let's March and the whole congregation walked behind him that the hallelujah March around the church inside the church outside the church down the street back to the church everybody was rejoicing there was God he came to New Zealand once when he was old and he preached and he was longing for it hallelujah much and he forced the people to join him for the hallelujah March but I'd say what it's more like a funeral march to me huzzah hallelujah March feel okay but you better you know he said you know you know when the spirit calls then is there we don't have to live on all the annoying thing the anointing is new every morning you see it's what has been anointed before it's day three anointed but there's a new anointing all the time so we don't need to worry about and try to resurrect some old experience let's have a new one I tell the new one is amen so my heart says because you know I have a ear in here so now I'd like to tell you something on that line too you know we can't hear a lot of things and a lot of good things but it's different than when it speaks to your heart if you know what God's it's something you know it'll come to pass you know I was in trouble once financially very very much and then the Lord spoke to my heart I said oh well all will come good oh there's still no money in the bank no nothing but I was hundred percent at peace you know you can imagine when you're young family he tries to make a living you might like to you know do all these things and build a house so save up for something and whatever it is and it's so difficult and then you come to a place where you start to try hard you know I mean I try to lose my mind maybe I should go and study and have another trade on top of this and the other and it just didn't work there was my efforts my doing and it cost me to get stressed I don't know if you had the experience trace anybody but you know it stress is not the portion of a son of God or a daughter of God the pressure comes don't get me wrong but we have a peace that passes all understanding that is our portion and the devil estate - Robert away from you and you know I was I was so desperate there our Lord it's not right as I'm so stressed and worked up that's not the peace that passes all understanding where is it and then a prize at Lord if I've done anything wrong show me show me I want to put it right I want to repeat but couldn't see anything I prayed a few times there's about three weeks later I was in the middle of prayer Lord what is it show me where to repent you know what he said to me in here I didn't hear an audible I heard in my heart he said not your planes my planes man that settle it I was a piece in the middle of the prayer I had such wonderful planes honestly not evil planes for the family so we were gonna do this we're gonna do that and then you know children will have this and no bear planes but there were my planes and then I repented of my planes and that piece was the instantly and I could say all's well and all turned out well you see sometimes you just have to go back to the word you stressed you worked up it's not the peace that passes all understanding hey something's gone wrong somewhere it's not our portion to do to be like the willed up and down and in and out and all about but I know it's easy to talk in retrospect you know when you've gone through you look better well I could have hit it over earlier you know I didn't need to go through all this there was a time I lived in a bush for four and a half months like a hermit to become more holy yeah well we go through these things but I tell you what that kind of holiness is not accepted up there only Christ told I seen you so I'm holy because my faith in Jesus Christ I know because I live in a bush like a hermit and deprived myself of any pleasure I nearly died out there but you see that's my own doing my own doing that look we do things we do things made me jealous young I once pulled the visitor out of bed at 3:00 in the morning as a kid out of my house I don't want an evil spirit you know I wouldn't do that today I wouldn't go and pull a visit the wrath of the beat yeah you know that's in you zealous wizened and things but when you start to realize according to the world there's a word for me to fulfill you may have a different one you may have something else the Lord lies on that you had but respond to what he ministers to your heart you know I was there himself last week and saving a few hotels or motels and I was watching some Christian preaching you know they had Christian channels on the TV so watch them mayor of interest and you know they all said good things but you know one would try to sway you over here the other one I want to sway over there but I would be drawn to Christ I don't want to be drawn to the particular church you know wonder what's lying it out was quotes and with with what he call it that scriptures here the mark of the beast he worship on a Sunday wonder what mark we have worshiping on Wednesday night you know I've been here the seal of God keeping the Sabbath of course there would have been the seventh-day Adventist outfit they sell of good things but you know then they bring scriptures in argument and it all speaks to here never speaks to the heart you know and you start to chew it up and alright what about we have meetings on that Saturday instead of Sunday neither here nor there really no when it speaks Tiahrt look one day with the Lord is like any other day in Christ we have the true Sabbath we have entered into the rest they haven't even by keeping the Sabbath you know you know we know that the seal of God we are sealed by the Holy Ghost and responding to be under the the seal of the Holy Ghost we will know come under the log of the base I mean it's quite simple but it's got to speak to you house but you know when you just chew it up in here it could sway you a bit of one side or the other then I heard another preacher another channel didn't listen too long on the other one but and he was talking about lower and grace it was really good and one thing stood out to me I like to see that he said Bible says cursed is the man who does not keep all of the law well that does away with any of our own trying to keep the law including you know whatever we might try to do though we sure that we shouldn't and keep this you know if I'm in church every Sunday 15 minutes really I'm fine with God and then one day I'm sleeping and be a bit light and then I'm condemned no only if he live by the law but anyway it's sort of there's always good things everywhere but it's good to speak to the heart but we had a brother in church he's not in church now but he's taking this being under grace to the other extreme he drinks he smokes he swears you would never guess he's a Christian well I know I'm the Lord you know predestinated you know elected and I'm the Lord's but then is that according to the scripture scripture says shall we we avoid in sin that grace may abound god forbid and if that sword comes you say God's a bit then you're according to the word God's a bit yeah you know it's it's such a trap when we intellectually try to work it out look all it comes down to a love relationship between you and the Lord Jesus Christ our love relationship and he is the one that understands you nobody else can understand what you've been through what he lady is through every thought pattern everything nobody else would know he knows that's why he is the great comforter if you need comfort though the Lord yeah you know main you see sympathy but in sympathy is no victory true comfort comes from the Holy Spirit from God himself and so often we seek comfort from other people you know it's it's nice to to comfort one another the spargle says with these words that you know that would be changed in a twinkling of an eye comes with one in other words these words was the Word of God not with oh yeah I've been through debt to you know heart just as well you you still can walk and you know even with crutches and you know that that's not very good comfort but it happens it happens so we go straight to Christ I had an email her several emails from a main from Kenya Muslim main and he said please Lee help me to be saved or whatever he said something like that in English but anyway first I ignored it and then dinner so you never know it might be genuine or maybe not so I wrote to him I said look don't look to men look to Christ he's your mediator you can go directly to him and then he wrote back out you know he was surprised he sort of had must be saved through you that's what he wrote you see so cut a long story short he was kept on writing asking questions and I wrote I wrote back to him and then I told him about you know the first step is to repentance you know I traced the Lord directly with your own words and then I sort of basically wrote the sinner's prayer down in some formal way got another email he said the other night my family and I we we used your prayer and then a presence came in the room and now he got 10 people from the mosque come and fellowship with him too and then he asked me about different things that wrote him about baptism a whole big page and he wrote back he understands baptism now he said he's taking all the tin from the mosque and the river to baptize you know do they hear from the heart or from the mind but what what I thought it's so easy people who are open the Lord leads them thus far he wants to lead him on the same way you know I said to him how did he find me oh he was looking on the online Bible and my name came up I don't know how my name came up but that you see to me it's so easy somebody gets ahold of a person like that and weighs him over here with intellectual understandings and things well-meaning people here again be yourself be yourself don't take somebody else's place be yourself it's so lovely when you see a person being themselves and it's so obvious when a person tries to be somebody else or copy somebody you know it's as I said people like you to conform to this so say it this way I be it that way but that's not the way it is but we want the Holy Ghost in our own lives in everything we do and say so hearing was the spiritual ear same hearing the message with a spiritual ear there's many people they hear the message with an intellectually and then you get all sorts of things but if it's spiritual ear well you know it's there is one bright room and there is a big pride collectively but there's a relationship individually never forget there but he might minister to you may not minister not fun but when he receives something from him to edify the church then it will be a blessing otherwise it's not from him or it's maybe something personal to you I've hid something personal to me and so I don't want to share it tonight it was personally to me and but I don't want to share things like that but you know Bible says we talk about according to the wood it says old men dream dreams you know I'm getting that way so I'm getting dreams but you see the dreams got to be according to the word and not just an old man rattling on for hours telling all that but he dreamed last night and nobody knows what he's talking about that happens that happens you see but that's not according to the world but I was troubled I say that again years ago because I was confronted with what'd he call that mental understanding of the message especially the token what is the token you know the token is the word I thought the token was the Holy Ghost you know and I was sort of thinking and battling and another one I wished her brother brain won't be here and I could just ask him do you know what happened I had a dream in the dream there was a bar and was sitting on the barstool and next to me said brother Brennan he had such an expression in his eyes and and such a sweetness you can't describe it it was wonderful like looking at the Lord's in the Saints anyway I started to cry in a dream and I said look I'm crying because because of the grace God chose me I said you've already gone on and now he asked me to talk to you now here we come back to speaking to the heart not a single word was spoken everything was conveyed he looked at me and I said you know I want to know about the token and then that sweet understanding smile can I know what you mean you know I know exactly a house feel and then he took a lump of ice there was a lump of ice he held it over a bottle it slowly melted and dripped into the bottle now I knew straight away I had my answer well if I want to say it philosophically you know the lump of ice is the word in the hands of a prophet you start to understand it it becomes a different form the same word it wholly goes water dripping into the vessel and that's the way it is and look I was so happy when I woke up I never left me that dream because it is so true here is the lump of ice that's the lump of ice it's the Word of God but how'd you get it in here I knew of a woman she actually literally ate spoken books I don't know if she got any ink poisoning or not but that's misunderstanding it that has been written by the Holy Spirit so it's only the Holy Spirit important in here and you know when you see these things it's so wonderful I just want to say one more thing about the relationship you know love relationship okay just give you one more dream no too short once if it doesn't edify you let me know send me an email - no that's a load of rubbish and then I share them anymore but another one was just recently I was in the situation and I sue myself kind of harsh - it's my wife or or like legalistic in a sense it wasn't me but I was there as a representation of husband wife bride and bridegroom but it wasn't me and then you have to do this you have to do that you have to submit but whatever came or you know you can't wear this kind of clothes or whatever it was your sleeves are too short you know whatever it was then she my wife she was addressed in the dream right there and she loves me you see so she comes over to me was the sweetest smile you could imagine gave me a kiss on the cheek say that wasn't hard that wasn't hard it's not hard if you love somebody whatever the Lord leads you through and tells you it's hard if you're in a love relationship you know that in the scripture you reap all well you look at his life he'd been stoned he's been beaten he's been left for dead and and he was in poverty and hunger and everything and then he had this thorn in the flesh the Bible says one can be physical can be host to the false praetor and he dealt with but you know he sought God thrice it says he didn't just get an answer straightaway and he you can't use this mind until look here I'm serving God with everything not even food properly I'll get beaten up I get stoned to death like a kicked and persecuted and everything else I don't even get that you know the ants this thorn in the flesh and top of it all you know when the law came and said my grace is sufficient of you know the scripture that spoke to his heart directly from the mouth of God and that man started to rejoice in persecutions in misery in beatings he started to rejoice because of that love relationship knowing the Lord wants me to do that and you know no matter what it is if you know the presence of God so I don't know how to say it but when their presence comes no matter how have done by you are oh you know so wonderful so wonderful that's why we need to have that close relationship with him you know I just wanna finish with one or two more little examples but as years ago it just fits in I was cheated by a car dealer who sold me a dud with you know I order catalogs to story short I was meeting the manager on the Monday but at work everybody told me taken to cool do all these things you know I was a bit distressed because it didn't have money and anyway I was there with the manager the manager said look mr. rook you know they call you mister when they want money over here there is it we're in business here you've got to pay this otherwise you can't have the car and you know he went on like that I was you can say the underdog in a miserable state but then suddenly their presence of God came on me whoa okay what it didn't matter I said you know I started to for I don't know did a glow I don't know but he started to change colors but I said fine your business that's it so am I the way I do business is this here you give my car you can keep it you've had my trading and already sold can keep the money and I look from now on that's how I do business I'll tell you what he gave me the keys never don't have to pay anything just go but you see the presence of God came on the scene and you never alone whether you feel him away to Europe feeling he looks after his own he is looking after his own and then when especially in the storms of life will you have storms get you know young people have storms we think this is a joke you know they have problems and worries we think they're stupid but to some people it's real real worry isn't but you know whatever storm I was tossed to and fro on on the batch in a dream here are another dream last one I was tossed to approach you wife's now we're holding on throne over there and holding only this rile the other Rio and those who have been on the boat in a big storm you know what feels like usually have ropes along you can hold on and all that and then there was a man I was a lord and he says just lean on me I was leaning on him we were writing the wife it was actually beautiful device didn't go away but we were writing the voice and you know you write the wife you know that story brother Brent talks I'm writing and I'm writing and yonder log you know how do you get that low down there I'm writing it and I'm leaning on to Jesus we scored through together wonderful so and then you can see that wasn't hard that wasn't hurt no it's it's so beautiful when we when he can be together with a lure like this and have a love relationship where you can just commit all these things them to Lord you know what I'm going through you understand look I wanna read you one last scripture before we close Hebrews in Hebrews find then Hebrews 11 I think it is healing yeah verse 6 it says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he there cometh to God must believe that he is that's the first thing so if no matter what happened you come to him because you believe he is and what else that he say and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him so expect the reward not have you've ideas what the reward would be you know Babu says if you receive the righteous men in their volodya receive a righteous man reward if you receive a prophet in the name of a property to receive a Prophet's reward yeah doesn't be prophets reward I received the Prophet so I'm probably not very large and double portion yeah some people get that way but you know what brother and said what is to receive a prophet what the reward is you gotta be friends with the Prophet friends and what do friends do they show you a few things what did the Lord - what this Bible says are saying in Genesis he reveals the secrets to his children that's what friends do what did Jesus do it just in closing when he shared the parable of the sower you know someone good ground and someone stony ground and all these things he explained it but nobody understood nobody understood by the mint and then I took his disciples aside and said no I'll tell you what it means he revealed it to his own and he reveals to us and is there anything your wife couldn't ask you we need to gather in your room and have fellowship and talk about the Lord and different things she said look I feel this way sometimes I feel I'm not even the Christian or sometimes I feel this you know you can share everything you can see everything with the Lord and he reveals to you why sometimes not instant but it'll come and may he help us as we even leaves that place if you have any questions bring it straight to the Lord Lord have I not been according to the world or wasn't there pleasing to you have I stepped out of my calling have a sit down from my calling you know I only found out kind of kind of what my calling is about two years ago three to encourage the Brethren that's that's against its is to encourage the Brethren hey I may not be here to teach you deep lessons I may not be here to to have everybody die not dying you know flocking to the altar yeah you know some people have that and yeah
