========================================

[snorts] Sometimes [music and singing] I wonder is he faithful? Does he see me in [music] my trouble? Does [singing] he understand? Sometimes [music] I question if he's able. Can he rescue? [music] Can he save me? Again and again. [music] [singing] But when I look back, did he move [music] every mountain? [singing] Did he part every sea? Yes, he did. So yes, he can. Did he defeat [music and singing] the darkness? Did he deliver me? Yes, he did. So yes, he can. Oh yes, he did. So [music] yes, he can. Sometimes those voices try to [music] tell me I'm forgotten and I'm falling [music] too far from his [singing] hand. But I know what kind of God he is and I'm trusting in his promises. I'm believing and I'm singing. Yes, he can. Did he [music] move every mountain? Did he part every sea? [singing] Yes, he [music] did. So, yes, he can. Did he defeat [music] the darkness? Did he [singing] deliver me? Yes, he [music] did. So, yes, [singing] he can. Oh, yes, he did. So yes, he can. [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; Cuz I've seen so much now I can't deny. &gt;&gt; He's [music and singing] come through every single time. From the beginning until [music] the end. [singing] &gt;&gt; He did any way we [music] can. &gt;&gt; He can. Did [singing] he move every mountain? Did he part every seed? Yes, he did. So yes, he can. Did he defeat [music] the darkness? Did he deliver me? Yes, he did. So yes, he can. Did he [music] move every mountain? Did he part every sea? Yes, [singing] he [music] did. So yes, he can. Did he defeat the darkness? [music and singing] Did he deliver me? Yes, he [music] did. So yes, he can. Oh yes, [music] he did. So yes, he can. Oh yes, he [singing] did. So yes, [music] he can. [music] &gt;&gt; [applause] [music] &gt;&gt; Stay there.
