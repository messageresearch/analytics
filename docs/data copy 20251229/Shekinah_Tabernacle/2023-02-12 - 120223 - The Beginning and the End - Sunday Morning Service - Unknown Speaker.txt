thank you musicians you can all have your seats um this morning praise the Lord how are you all doing you're doing good yeah okay you can actually stand back up I've got the scripture I'm going to read I didn't know it was here but it was here I'm um okay I'll just uh this is my thought this morning I'll read the scripture then I'll tell you a bit about it then we'll start the scriptures um Second Corinthians 5 verses one to three before we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly Desiring to be closed upon with our house which is from Heaven if so be that being clothed we should not be found naked surprised all my gold places where you can take your seats this morning I enjoyed the song selection brother Jimmy and I enjoyed the special brother onias the the um I've got a thought called the beginning and the end and I think the first song We sang was win the redeem the Gathering in you know that's that's the end and then there was another song oh yes we're looking for that City we will never die talking about the city at the end and then brother Ania sang in the toils of the way we'll see nothing when I get to the end of the road so I'm I'm I really enjoyed those and um this is a a I often come up here and tell you oh I'm not going to tell you something that you haven't heard before you hear me say that and you people don't believe me when I say that but that's the truth and you and I come to say it and you're like yeah we knew all that you just sometimes when you put something everyone knows in a way that it just puts it all together then they it's like oh well I never saw that but you knew it all already um that's not going to be quite like that with this one this one's a a wee bit more complicated um any and for me it's been a bit complicated and it's been a thought that's been on my mind for about four months constantly I've been thinking about this thing and it's but before that it's been something I've been thinking about for about 20 years and I've put pieces together over 20 years of this particular saw and this is the furthest that I've got with it over the the time so it's a challenging thought for me to deliver now I'm just speaking to you as a as a man their brother this morning um just in my frailties and weaknesses and things like that that we are as a human that that's how I'm speaking to you now just in just to kind of catch your spirit and get to know people a bit and get settled in but when I start speaking I'm not going to speak like that I'm going to speak as though it's from the Lord and I'm going to sound convincing because I believe what I'm talking about but it's because I've looked right into a lot of stuff and I I happen to believe this so I'm going to speak it as though I believe it but now speaking to you as a brother I want you to know it's in Fellowship that that I'm talking now because it's Brethren that I know I can't get up here and speak from the word of God and not believe what I'm talking about so I've got to deliver it in a way that I know what I'm talking about but that doesn't mean you have to say it all the way that I see it when I might sound like I'm convincing and that you have to you think well I must believe him because he really sounds like he knows what he's talking about okay you understand that little concept okay I just want to lay that because I'm going to go pretty fast through this as well you're right with it because it's a long thought and and I have to deliver it in one segment because you need to capture I want to capture the whole thought of this whole thing so I've gotta I can't really break it up into two because you will miss the the Journey of it we've got to go from the beginning to the end okay and I mean brother Ben said you can carry on some other foam and you know you can unfold it but I don't want to do that I just want to deliver it so this is four months trying to compress it into about an hour and 15 minutes okay so so um when we go we're gonna go and I'm gonna I'm gonna talk for like uh that's from the Lord not not okay now there's some things that have been hard for me to perceive in this and get my head around but I believe that the purpose of this is to bless you and to help you to understand who you are and now brother Brandon says when we know who we are then the Rapture will go um now in order to find out who we are I've also got to find out who was everyone else how does this whole thing work because because when you see that everything else has to have its place as well so Humanity everything has to have its place and that and I've endeavored to look into it all and figure out where does everything fit in this whole thing yeah and it's often talking about spiritual things that we can't see that we wouldn't perceive if we just walked around although we can see the effects of it but I'm talking about spiritual things this morning okay I'm gonna start now okay so I read the scripture here and quite often when I do I read I've got another um I've got a Bible app that shows a whole bunch of different versions then it shows the the Greek or the Hebrew as well so I like to look into to get the essence of sometimes what it's talking about to see if there's English translations that I've missed now the different ones were similar on the last line in particular that I was interested in I said because when we are closed we will not be found naked they all go down we will not be found naked but the another translation put it we will not be found Spirits without bodies and that intrigues me I thought it's possible to have a spirit without a body that's intriguing that was an intriguing thought so that's where this thought started to come from who who would there be that would have a spirit without a body now you're going to see this picture here a lot or this idea a lot of three because God always works in threes when you want to find out the truth of something you've got to find find three things find how it's one two three and you'll be getting something if you end up with two or four or five you've kind of gone off the track somewhere most of the principles of God have got to work in three three is his Perfection okay and I'm going to be talking in these different Realms one one realm we've got no time I'm going to call that no time one realm that we are in as time as we know and one realm is eternity Now by no time I mean slow down so time has stopped like anyone you're having a bad day and you think man it's like a dragged on forever I believe there's a realm where that bad day is almost it's in time but it's like it's stopped the time just things don't improve I believe that's hell in that realm right this realm it goes 24 hours in a day it ticks over like it does there's an eternal realm that is not like this so we've got to get our mind off of just this natural thing when we describe these thoughts this is um Albert Einstein smart people always seem to be able to say complicated things in a simple way and he's talking about relativity I want to just get our minds just thinking a little bit different for a moment here you see relativity is when you're quoting a nice girl an hour seems like a second Ben would say Amen and when you sit on a red hot Cinder or a red hot braai a second seems like an hour you know that's relativity depends what it's relative to what your situation is relative to right so now the theory of relativity is that things are relative to other things so in this picture here you've got a if a if a person is there and they fire an arrow and their Arrow travels 200 kilometers an hour then relative to them the area is 200 kilometers an hour but if someone is on a train that's traveling at 100 kilometers an hour and they shoot the arrow the arrow is in relation to him now is traveling 100 kilometers an hour because he's traveling at 100 kilometers so it's it's even though it's 200 to him it's 100 and if there was an object coming the other way to the arrow or the train at 200 kilometers an hour then relative to each other it's 400 kilometers an hour this is what relativity means right everything is relative relative to everything else and that's how we can work out a whole lot of things relative right until you get to this concept called light and it does its own thing that's right it light itself light just stays the same it doesn't matter what anything else is doing light always stays the same whether you're traveling towards it at the same speed as it it's going at the set speed if it's traveling away from you and you're traveling the opposite direction it's going the same speed it doesn't matter what happens light always travels the same speed doesn't matter what's relative around it right and it travels really fast the speed of light is about 300 uh 299 792 458 meters a second or three at this but just put it this way 300 000 kilometers a second about how fast it travels so if you were standing on the equator and uh the light had to travel from you and come back around to you and you said on your marks get sick go before you said the word g it would have gone around about three times when you finish your word go it's gone around about seven or eight times when you finish go so so that's how fast uh light travels right so because of this concept that that it never uh everything else changes around it Einstein thought well if that's the case then other things have to bend to make this travel like that so he understood that if the faster you travel your time as you know it slows down it just has to be that way because it time has to bend in line with this constant yes right so if you go faster your world is going to change time uh light's going to stay the same right so and these guys tried it when they they got three atomic clocks one and one playing one another plane and one on the earth they flew one plane one way around the earth one the other way one plane went with the with the turn of the earth and one went away with it and when they landed the planes back down with the clock relative to the on the earth the time on the these atomic clocks were different that tells them okay something's going on here time is changing that time a different amount of time passed when it was traveling faster than this one on on the Earth right so that's when they understood that that this is God declaring himself if you travel at the speed of light time will stop right that's that's a that's a fact like when they work out that okay that's what happens um if you travel at the speed of light you need all the energy to do it if you travel at the speed of light your mess will fill everything you'll become everything so I don't brother brand upstairs I don't care where the person is it might be across the sea across the ocean no matter where it is God covers all space fills all the time he's omnipot he's omnipotent he's omnipresent he's infinite right because he's he's in a different realm he's in that that realm where he's everything right I want to tie it back to just how he is and in first John 1 5 it says this then is the message which we have heard of him and to clear unto you that God is light and then him has no Darkness at all because he fills all the time and space he just fills everything and the speed of light which is a constant and is the same speed regardless of your perspective doesn't the word of God say I'm God no change or not or him as the nurse will pass away but my words shall not pass away and God is his word because it's an expression of him everything else see time and space Bend relative to to like if you travel faster even space is going to warp itself to make you keep going to make light keep traveling the same speed okay so so now I think outside a little bit about that this is just all happens normally nothing happens normally around here and job says where is the way to the dwelling of light and darkness where is its place these places have a place where they dwell if there's a place we like dwells how fast is that and where I'm going what's happening up there there's something else going on Daniel said he reveals the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in the darkness and the light dwelleth with him the light rests stops that realm must be going pretty fast all right so that's why I go back to this one there's there's Realms where things are just different than what this one is I believe this realm has just been slowed down that light and darkness can exist in this realm too that we can perceive it right but when you get to this other realm what we would know here is Darkness because there is kind of a Darkness there but I don't believe it's not a Darkness like this Darkness because there is light and day in the new Heavens new Earth for some people but hello bro how are you good to see you first John 1 5 says this is then the message which we have heard of Amanda clear unto you that God is light and then there's no Darkness at all and then I found it interesting that John 1 5 the other John 1 5. so first John 1 5 says that and then John 1 5 says and the light shineth in the darkness and the Darkness comprehendeth it not this realm here that's going so slow it's like it's like radio waves we our minds can't we can't actually pick up that it's going on I believe there's a place of Darkness where light when it it can't even that's so slow it doesn't even register that there was light there it shot in there and that's why it's just pitch black this Darkness because light doesn't even reach in that realm all right this is just Isaac's idea on it okay the Lord will show us all the answers when we get to sit down and talk about it okay but that was just to paint a picture of this idea now I want to then in this with this idea talk about God this this in the beginning was God God filled all time and space and he dwelt in this place where it was just him alone with his thoughts and he was he was everything okay now then he from this from this thing came out what we call the logos or or at one point we then called it the Son of God but it was this image that came out from this eternal all filling being right yeah God who on Sunday at times and diverse men have spoken time past unto the fathers by the prophet Seth and these last days spoken us done to us by a son whom he hath appointed ear of All Things by whom also he made the world who being the brightness of his glory and the express Express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high it says by whom he also made the world so this being that came out made the world right okay and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which hath been which from the beginning of the world has been hit in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ right so this being that came out and was the express image of God had a name and it was Jesus that was who this who this person was and that's who made the world back in before he came as a as a son and a body we knew him as a father oh this is Father father but his name was still Jesus because because he was he was the Everlasting father he called himself right he was there and then when he came down and took on flesh not from this bit of dirt here but he made a new he made a new body and that's very important as we get it to a later on it wasn't from here it was a new body but when he displayed himself in this body then we called that the son or his son and he came as the son of man but it was that same being that made the world and then when he when he left and sent his Spirit back it was that same spirit that encompassed the whole thing that comes back into us which still has a name as Jesus right so that's why we baptized the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's the same being okay now when this image came out of God it had a shape it wasn't just a blob that came out now we might call it the pillar of fire but it actually had a shape and it looked like this because when he when he went down and talked to Moses he said and the Lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon the rock and I shall come to pass when my glory passeth thee I'll put you in the in the Cliff of The Rock and I'll cover thee with my hand while I pass by and I will take away my hand and thou shalt see my back Parts but my face Thou shalt not see so he said he's got a hand he's got a back and he's got a face he looks like us right and then he said I'll McMahon in my own image now I've tried to get as many scriptures as I can through this and and quotes from Brother Brenner who I believe and he's gotten his uh his Doctrine from all of the prophets and everyone throughout the ages so I'm not just going to throw information at you without get showing you this is why I think it's shaped like a man okay so just because if you're not sure about it you know that I'm not just speaking this okay now we've got this scripture here Job 38 which starts to make things interesting because the Lord said to Joe where was there when I laid the foundations of the Earth it's hard not to preach I've got to go fast to get through this declare if thou Hast understanding who has laid the meters here off if they're noticed who has stretched the line upon it whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened or who laid the Cornerstone thereof when the morning Stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy so we read this and we think okay there was a time where there were sons of God somewhere shouting for Joy when the Earth was being made now there are other translations that always change that to mean Angels but I've looked into it that doesn't say angel they only say it says Angel because they can't comprehend we weren't there but this clearly says God says where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth and when the sons of God all shouted so it's given us a bit of a a difference now there was we were there somewhere what's going on here I want to ask you who is who is this job 27 38 when he said where was you when I laid the foundations of the Earth when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy who were those sons of God that were shouting for Joy Jesus told them that I had Joy with you before the foundation of the world we're not creatures of time we're creatures of Eternity so we came from we came from there okay we're not we're not from here notice he is in me and I and him notice in every Christian that's a real genuine Christian amen was with him when the morning started staying together and the sons of God shouted for Joy before there was a foundation of the world we were identified in the immortal Realms of God 10 million years before the world was ever formed I was I was back there with him if I've got eternal life I was there with him I was identified with them when the sons of God when the morning started saying together and the sons of God shouted for Joy okay you were all there I want to show you let's have a look at where we were now creation I want to talk about about creation to start to unfold this we there aren't any scriptures on this as such but brother Branham has said that the first thing God created after he became this logos were the angels to then become a God because you can't be a god unless people worship you or there has to be a relationship somehow to uh it might be uh if you're if you want to be a boss you can't have a boss with that people to work for your vice versa there's all these he he had no relationships when he was by himself so he had to start forming these things so in my opinion the first thing they made was angels and then they worshiped him and that made him God and he started from there as in previous messages I've tried to explain break it down and now when the Angels begin to worship him that was before there was even a molecule on the earth okay so we get this image okay there was God then there were these angels that he created all right okay so God created man later on it says then God create a man in his own image male and female created he then okay after this we'll get to the Earth soon but after this brother Brown says then when he said let us make man after our own image what kind of man did he make a spirit man so that man that he made there and in that instance was it was the same after his own image that that logos that came out that expressed like that walked Pastor put his hand on the rock he made a man like that yeah and his own image because that was his image so so that when he made this one that's what he made right now we're going to go to Genesis I'm gonna look at this from a different perspective for a while so we look in the in the in the account of the creation of of the world day one it says he made the the um the Earth was without form then day two he made the firmament this is a little bit hard to read here but then day three it says he made the the grass and the trees and all those sorts of things they formulate the Sun and the Moon before the plants I couldn't photo synthesize okay day five day five you made all the animals you made the fish in the sea day six he made all the the the beasts of the field those things and then after that he made Manning right at the very end he made man a spirit man and then then on the seventh day he rested right when you carry on reading it's like there's another account of creation because in it straight after that it goes now to Genesis 2 with 49 we've just gone Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 down to verse 8 uh verse three then we go to four to nine and it says these are the generations of the Earth of the heavens and the earth when they were created and the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the Earth and there was not a man to till the ground but they went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground now if I go to these other versions here because we say this is these are the generations that the way it would be described as um this is the account of the heavens and the Earth or this is the history of the heavens and the Earth being made right so we're talking and he's clearly talking about the search because there was these things and and he's essentially saying there was dirt there was dirt there I didn't there was a Mist that came and there was dirt there were no trees nothing like that yet then then verse seven straight after that it says and the Lord God for man of the Dust of the earth so he said it took some of that dust and made man okay now there were still no trees and no birds no no animals right he Foreman of the Dust of the earth and breathed into his nostrils the Breath of Life a Man became a living soul and the Lord God planted a garden and Eastward and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the Lord God to gravy tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food so it says once he made man and then he made the trees come out of the ground and the tree also tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil then after that once the trees were there he said it's not good for man to be alone he said I will make him and help me for a minute says out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and if you fellow of the air so make sure those out of the ground okay and brought them on to Adam to see what he would call them whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof okay and then it says and Adam gave names to all the cattle and the fowl of the end to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not fearing any help meat for him so we hadn't seen these animals before they arrived at him okay and then he gave them names so now it seems like it may be quite like it contradicts because in the first account it says on day three there were trees and on day six there were animals then man came right at the very end and then got arrested then on the second account it says there were no trees then he made man and then after he made man then he made the trees to grow then he made all the animals from the dirt and showed them right there seems to be a contradiction but I don't think there is you see when the sons of God shouted for Joy when they were made this is what I believe this first account of creation Genesis 1 to about enter 2 to about verse 3 was actually god making the new heavens and the new Earth which is where we're going to dwell right you read it the only thing different are the Seas but they're still going to be C in the new Heaven and there's just not 70 water like what we have now but that was because the firm room broke water went all over the Earth it's the only thing that differs but when you think about it he if I come here and we go way back to the Book of Revelation we can see that there's a new Heaven and a new Earth because the first ones passed away yeah okay now this one was made after that one and there has to be an account of that one being made now that could be a dual prophecy you know we could we'd say out of each I'll call my son right they they you could now that that was meaning Egypt coming out uh that children of Israel coming out but it also meant Jesus coming up right so even though we could say oh that's Genesis one that's how God made this Earth it's like no no no that's how he made that Earth and that's where I was made when he made man I was made there he made the youth later on that's why I could say well he's making something there and I shout it for Joy right because of this think about a replica idea brother Ram says every time I see a tree I think that tree is a negative there is a positive somewhere that tree was made off of something and intelligence made it and all this Earth does is reflect the Heavenly the Bible said so and if there is a tree here that disappears there's got to be one that won't appear so saying before there was a tree mate here there had to be a tree made somewhere to patent it off right before there was a a horse there had to be a horse somewhere to patent it off before there was anything here so the first account it may seem like a differs but I believe it's making the making the yeah the real world the new Heavens newathon that we go to was made first and then he made us there as Spirit beings there we were there right then this world was made second as a replica off of that because they had to have a plan this is just this is now there's two differences when he made the two right the the first one when he made Manny said to man be fruitful and multiply that's what he said when he made the spirit man be fruitful and multiply when he made man here he said don't multiply don't touch it the tree that's in the midst of the garden metaphorical mids he said man and woman shouldn't be together the day you do that day you'll die so he said you do not multiply but this one you multiply now I'm not saying that the spirit men and women multiplied in that sense but he blessed them to multiply what happened there was all of his children he began to make his family his family that that we're going to be with him forever were made there they begin to multiply everyone every every bride of Christ that's ever going to be at the end was made there yeah was made there that's why that's why the Bible says we have a body weight in because it's death it was made before it was here this whole thing was made there first now if I can just look back over there for a bit at the beginning I could say um now what was there if we look at that new then you have the new Earth but it was the first one it was but it was the best one there was just the new Heaven and new earth and then there was you and me now there was God but not in a perceptive way that we would understand it I'm not saying I knew what I did when I was there I'm just telling you I was there all right now when we get to the end uh what wasn't there the New Jerusalem wasn't there okay Jesus Christ as king wasn't there uh me knowing him as king like I mean as a king the tour can buy me knowing him as a king that thought wasn't there okay save Nations weren't there because they weren't the kings of the earth weren't there there are things in the and this one that weren't at that one right and we're going to go through and find out where they come from how'd they turn up okay with me so far okay good so that was the new one built this one was built after that one that's why it differs in creation but we can still apply that creation to this one now when this happened in time I don't know because we sometimes can't relate at all the time but there was a war in heaven at some point now the reason reason why we know this is because Isaiah it says how out there falling from Heaven are Lucifer son of the morning how about they are cut down to the ground which says weaken the Nations for thou I set a known heart all Ascend unto Heaven I'll exalt my throne above the stars of God also also upon the Mount of the congregation and the sides of the north it was a conflict between who was going to be in power up there and this fight ensued and the Bible says and there appeared another Wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his head and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them down to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her children as soon as it was born the reason why I put that one into you is because Satan had to have some sort of kingdom and we've always thought well he's got a third of the Angels it comes from the scripture here that we would imply that that means he's the third of the angels went with him deciding that he was going to be their King rather than Jesus Christ so that's how we get this concept if you ever wonder where the third came from it's there and that's what I wanted to bring out these things like I can't just say a third I can't show you what why the third means right and then this one says and there was war in heaven and Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and saved him which deceive of the whole earth he was cast onto the Earth and his angels will cast that with him about a third we'll cast that with them okay yeah so this this battle happened at this point in time the Earth was made then okay so because it was this Earth here was in existence and I believe the other one was because that was their first then this one was here so this thing happened at some point around there now I want to just read you some unusual quotes and then I want to try and explain what they mean because to me they were unusual I think what do these quotes mean this is unusual now the souls that were in prison that repented not were not Angelic beings that had had been brought down into in the form of angels but it was the spirits of those Angelic beings that fell before the foundation of the world back there when the war went on in heaven and Satan and the dragon fought them or Michael and and the dragon Fort and Lucifer and Lucifer was cast out with all of his children all of his angels that he had deceived and those angels came to the earth and the subject then to become human and when they did that's when the sons of God saw the doors of men that they were fair and took unto them wives okay that's an unusual concept he's saying they went down became humans that's unusual and there was a part of me Alma Neville and the rest of you all hear that's in Christ Jesus before the foundation of the world and here's to my analysis of that I think that people today that are possessed with this Spirit uh or thus Spirit you talk about the Holy Spirit are a part of those Angelic beings which rotated off of God like that creation that never fell in the beginning and resisted their Devil's lie in heaven amen okay so saying yeah so he's saying now there's this group here that that we made a choice somewhere and so do these other guys because if we were there we had to make a choice too okay we didn't know I'm not saying we knew and all this but that's the way it was and one day when I was weary about myself I said you boy you better go ahead if you're 50 years old if you're ever going to do anything for the Lord you better hurry up and do it you're getting old see and there that morning the quickening power came and he let me look over the curtain and I've seen all of you there yeah hi when I went there today I saw you there I thought I was here well you've got an eternal being somewhere and that was seen think of the realm just all stretches to make this all work somehow or another we're not that smart but we just believe what the word of God says all that we have loved and all that love you they give to you see I've seen all of them over there like that what was that quickening power amen okay now now there you are that's the way we are here we come from a higher being in the beginning we were in the image of God um the veil and the Darkness keeps us from knowing it now because we're born into this realm okay but Jesus told his disciples he was with them before the foundation of the world see we were you can't know it now but you was in the beginning and if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting Hallelujah and then we move into this theophany once we have lived so we can eat and shake hands and that Souls under the altar cry how long when you turn up you don't know that you were there okay now now in this war In Heaven There Were Three there were three groups that emerged that took sides and things that happened in this war the first group were the children of God that resisted the LIE they said no we don't want to go with you right with his children that he made there he said no we're not we don't want this Jesus is our King right amen that's what you said think about this from that perspective there were angels that resisted about two-thirds of the Angels said no we're not keen on this okay and there were one third of the angels that said actually we'll go with us so there was a division happened and then that started a chain reaction of what we have now and the way that the Earth would unfold right now this might be an unusual concept but the fact of the matter is that all of these groups have the capacity to become a human the children of God that resisted the LIE the angels that resisted and the angels that went with the LIE have the capacity to become human in different forms but they do right I'll show you where I get that idea from so this is the first one the children that resisted delay Jesus says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God that's the word the logos that came out then it said the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us okay now I can say okay if I'm theoretically of that same nature because I'm Made In His Image if I'm made like that as a son then I'm the same being as him and it says because he says I've met him as image then I have the capacity to then become a human me if Jesus can because he wasn't didn't have flesh there it wasn't flesh like this it was that being so so I say if he could do that then I have the capacity to come and become a human here okay that's how I say that's the first comparison capacity second one were the angels that resisted had the capacity to become human but not in the way that we think but still here's one in Genesis it says this is talking about um Sodom and it says There came two angels that evening and lot set in the gate of Sodom and lots seeing them rose up to meet them and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground and he said behold now my Lord's turn and I pray you into your servant's house and Terry all night and wash your feet and you shall rise up early and go your ways and they said they but we will abide in the street all night and he pressed them greatly convince them angels had a conversation and they turned on to him an incident to his house and he made them a feast and did bake unleavened bread and they did eat Angels came and talked to him and ate food sounds to me like they're a human being but they had special powers okay after the the men wanted to come in and know them I want to talk about one of the songs that we're saying right at the end too remind me that when I get to a spot okay I pledge allegiance to the lamb remind me of that right they came to the door the men came to the door to want to know them sexually because they were all homosexuals and it says the men the Angels then smote the men that were at the door the house with blindness these guys had power they were humans with a supernatural power they smoked them with blindness both small and great so that they worried themselves to find the door and the men said unto them Lo hast thou hear any besides like son-in-law and thy sons and their daughters and whosoever thou Hast in the city bring them out of this place for we will destroy this place because the Cry of them is waxing great before the face of the Lord and the Lord sent us to destroy it these guys that looked like humans were coming to destroy the place okay this is why God says Satan can't create and become a human like that because what could he do just he would just destroy the place but these Angels were trustworthy because they resisted the license they could be trusted to become human and have this power to to blind people to destroy the place and then go back they were just going to do the job they were called doing here back they weren't gonna go Rogue and kill everybody because they could that's Supernatural Powers right now that's why that's why Paul says let Brotherly Love continue be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares some of the people you've spoken to in life could May well have been an angel because God can create he can just create a body and this Angelic being has the capacity to come into that body and function like a human eat talk be reasoned with sure come in no no I'm not going to no please no no please don't just come in okay isn't it how we do it as humans we feel the pressure the emotion he really wants me to come in but I don't want to but I just can't resist it right now the angels that went with the LIE this is how I can I'm going to do a bit of coloring in in some places like if I see a tree that's not colored in I'm going to say well I assume that tree's green if I see some water I'm going to say well I assume that water is blue do you understand now it may not be blue it may be green maybe you're dirty like maybe Brown okay but I'm gonna where I think the needs color I color it in okay now firstly how many how many Angels were there Hebrews 12 22 says but yeah come to the Mount Zion until the city of the Living God and to the Heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels so it says God's got an innumerable company so if I said he's got a third of an innumerable company how many angels does he have right a lot now you could say well maybe he made more when they left I think he still had an innumerable number and a third of that left okay so this is how many beings are there somewhere all right now this is why when I come back to this one this quote here the one who I've underlined and Lucifer was cast out with all of his angels children all of the Angels here deceived and those Angels Came To Earth and was subject then to become human to become Satan's Children on this Earth okay now when God when God formed man it says he took the dust of the earth and he formed man and he made him from the dust but remember there was already a man the first one I believe there was a man already made he was making Adam after something that was already made right I can say this of Adam because he was the handiwork of God I can say this with assurance as much as I can say about me I had a representation but Adam had representation So Adam was made as a as a being first like Jesus was as a being there when he was made in the dust of this Earth if God formed him after that because this just reflected that right that's why that one's waiting when he goes and gets his body it's going to look like Adam people who knew Adam are going to say that's Adam they're not going to look around oh by the way I'm Adam and he's a he looks totally different he's going to be Adam okay now it says after that Genesis 2 when the Lord God calls the Deep Sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh thereof instead thereof and the robots of the Lord God had taken from the man made he a woman and he brought her unto the man so from the man now this is this will happen in this time because it was to show something but remember in the beginning he made male and a female separate when they were made here he made them like he called their name Adam because he had to show something but when he made them there they were separate okay this here this here is just to play yeah yeah brother bandham says it starts here and it ends here and all the stuff in here doesn't matter we were there we were there at the beginning we're going to be there at the end all the stuff doesn't matter okay just think about it that way it's it's just to play out of purpose but I believe that because Eve was created from the hand of God through Adam as a type but still created from this Earth that she had representation okay now within this Garden we had another being there called The Serpent now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yes God said you should not eat of every tree of the garden now this being had a conversation with Eve and she said she said yes we can but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden metaphorically your genitalia and that means you're not don't touch it unless you die God I said you should not touch unless you die okay now this this being here was almost like a human it said it was the most cunning of all the world the animals the Lord God had made the Beast of the earth it was most cunning we see innate reason to be cunning but there was one in between that and Mankind that was more cunning it said it walked upright and it said it could talk it wasn't a snake pissing around the ground it walked upright and it could talk it could have a conversation because God just made things went up and up and up and up and up and that was the one when he made that he's like it's not it's not quite what I am yet one more step up and it'll be man now this this being was if this didn't happen it would have still been there maybe it was the help it helped out move things was big and strong it did whatever right and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant for the eyes and the tree to be desired to make one while she took of the fruit the Roman did eat and gave also unto her husband and he did eat and the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed themselves quick leaves together and made themselves aprons okay so they committed a sexual act she committed one with the serpent and one with Adam okay that's why you had the first thing you had was they knew they were naked before that they didn't know because and they didn't know to even do that but Satan knew that's what could happen so he got into the serpent now that wasn't Satan that was still a being okay yeah yeah now there was the result of that what did God say there's going to be war between the serpent seed and your seed amen right now the woman doesn't have a seed he was referencing to Christ the seed of Christ that will come in but there's going to be a war between these seeds essentially the sons of God and and the Sons of Satan is going to be a war and he said to Eve you're going to have being pain bearing children this is clear as day when you see it and you curse the serpent down to the ground we see pictures of him a snake wasn't a snake it was up walking around that guy cursed to the ground and they knew they were naked you had an issue happen here something strange happened upon the Earth as a result of this you had two beings born you had that and you had what we would call a hybrid because species that are alike but not quite alike but almost a light can be together and create something now sometimes they're fertile sometimes they're not but hybrids do happen okay the these are some hybrids here and biology a hybrid is The Offspring resulting from a combination from combining the qualities of two organisms or different breeds varieties species or something together through sexual reproduction It generally means that each cell has genetic material from two different organisms whereas an individual where some cells are derived from a different organism is called a chimera hybrids are not always intermediate intermediates between the appearance such as Blended inheritance but can show hybrid Vigor sometimes growing larger or taller than either parent yeah okay think about a hybrid because what we had here I want you to see this real clear this is very important this was one of the hardest things for me to kind of get my head around we had a hybrid being now okay but I want to just get our mind into this hybrid the first idea blint they had this idea of blending inheritance that was um Charles Darwin he got a lot of things wrong and this was one of them that's what says his theory was that when you hybrid things together the seeds blend together and eventually they just become a mix of those seeds and so that in theory if you had a white flower and a red flower eventually those particles would cease to bend there would only be the the pink would only be in existence forever so he said the seeds actually mixed together um but people come out and say no that's wrong other more smarter men than him told him he was wrong we're still doing the same today but these other men came out and they said no it's not it's not um blending inheritance it's particulate inheritance which is a pattern of inheritance discovered by these guys showing that phonetic traits can be passed from generation to generation through discrete particles known as genes which can keep their ability to be expressed while not always appearing in a descending generation okay they can just stay there and never be expressed they just they can be 100 years and then it comes out yeah and they never mix all right now the blending model versus a particular model is The Offspring which is the wrong one The Offspring are a blend of both parents are actually Blended together to create a new seed and the characteristics of the Blended offspring are passed to the Next Generation so that Blended mix goes on which is not correct that separate ones pass through right and variation is washed out over time which is not true variation always stays the real one is The Offspring are a combination of both parents the characteristics of both parents are passed on to the next Generation separate entities to be used either way and variation is maintained over time these things never mix okay okay now I need to ask a hard question here then when this being emerged and next to the human being was a serpent the Bible said he was smart the most subtle of all the beasts of the field smarter he almost had a soul he had a place for his soul but what did he do he sold out to Satan to deceive God try to how many gets that so far Satan the serpent almost had a soul God note they'd look for those bones and there's not a bone and a snake that looks like a man he was that's the curse of him he stood on his feet just like a man okay right now but the surfer never sold no it was an animal that could mix with man okay now I wanna these are hard questions but if I said if I looked at the first being here that actually now I'm not going to call him directly a Son of God because he was a son of Abel was the son of Adam and Eve we can't confirm whether he had representation we don't know that think about that I'll show you but was he technically a Son of God because he was because he I'm not trying to trick you and you say yes and I say no it wasn't because this is not that I'm just going through it uh first one did he have a soul I would say yes because Adam here about an eve had one and so they would they passed on that now I don't know where a soul is and how it gets passed down as your genetic makeup but he had something he had what we would call a soul okay is he a Son of God in that respect I'm going to say he was made from that now I'd say is he savable yes right does he have representation that I'm not sure I'm not sure that he did we have to be honest I don't know because he was a product of something they weren't supposed to do he may not have had representation but he's still savable and we'll get to that in a bit as he fertile a meaning can he reproduce uh physically yes and spiritually yes because two Souls came together okay so that I'm gonna call it like that right now also if I just I just need to labor on this for a second if I would go to the other one did he have a soul it's a hard question but I'm going to have to answer it and say no not a soul in terms of what these other guys had assault because it was a hybrid right is he a Son of God no is he savable no no right does he have representation no is he fertile well hybrids can be fertile in a natural sense like a hybrid can actually hybrids can breed and become fertile his body yes his Spirit what was that that did that could that Soul live on and be saved and go on no so now what you had to have here you this being had to have an origin somewhere now this is why we have to I said if we want to see us we rejoice when we say that was me there we have to paint a picture and say there's got to be this side on that side it's got to be light there's got to be Darkness there has to be something where there was one here and one there so that's why when we when we say this what origin where did that what was what was then came to then Express where was that that's why I believe that was one of those he he was one of those beings that came every time one of those seeds are born that being from there from Hell comes in a bit that's him becomes one of them that's the that's why Cain killed his brother he hated God he could just fight against God because he was that line and he just and he had an end point once he was finished now we'll get to how this could work in the end but if you notice the parable of the wheat and the tears God says what well me and sleep this enemy came in and sowed tears among the wheat and went their way and he said this is about creation he said the field is the word the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tears are the children of the wicked one now a tear is going to stay a tear from when it's born to when it dies tear does not get converted to become a wheat a wheat is going to be a week when it's born to when it dies okay they can't change a rainbow Trout's going to be a rainbow trout yeah uh an eel is going to be an eel they cannot change this is why Jesus said of these men I don't have the power or the capacity to say who's who but he said ear of your father the devil they now don't forget these men killed him in the end where did that come from who was a murderer and alive from the beginning he's not just metaphorical Europe your father the devil okay and the lust of your father you will do and he was a murderer from the beginning and about not on the truth because there was no truth in him when he speaketh the light he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it now I'm going to twist this around slightly this is I do a lot of reading all the time like I joke to people that and when I relax myself I read some sort of Hardcore conspiracy or something just to kind of I find it relaxing wow it's relaxing you know some people maybe want to laugh to relax like it puts me to sleep I just get so intrigued by it then I fall asleep right so this is my relaxing I read this sort of stuff now I came across this bit of material and I researched just a bit more but this will Intrigue you okay uh now this is another man that's talking about his account of Genesis not not a not a Believer doesn't know brother Brown not that we understand right listen close but this is what he's understood it it's going to take me about two minutes to read this but it will it will Intrigue you right ask yourself was it really a fruit Adam and Eve ate that Dan Eden or is it the story referencing something much deeper in the human psyche I'm just repeating something else right there we don't believe we don't have to believe this but this is now further is the version of Eden taught to you the actual story or is it a red herring this guy's a Christian the luciferians have their version of Eden and I've never heard it put exactly like I do because I have not heard or read a person yet who has connected the dots like I have hasn't heard us so maybe my thoughts about this stuff will act as a serum serum disenchanting agent for our planetary plate I'll say this hearing the luciferian version of a version of Eden for me was in fact an experience of Satori it clarified the Eliza connected the dots and most importantly it helped to explain the extreme extremely anti-human motivations and behaviors throughout history and even today this is a guy that looks into the Demonic parts of the world that the evil stuff that happens these guys look into that and think he's trying to understand why is there so much evil like child rape in these things and these guys are just evil and they don't have any right luciferians luciferians have run the world since organized human history began they have been steering and shaping the planetary cultural Vector since long before the United States Rome or even the Egyptians the cult goes way back to and is known as the old religion they have maintained direct contact with a fourth dimensional being known as Lucifer for thousands of years Lucifer is parasitical genderless whatever that word is whatever that word it has been anthromorphized into human recognizable forms and names throughout the time like just saying he's coming as different beings right all over the world it and the Legion of other fourth dimensional beings like it have pilferred the human race since the beginning luciferians communicate directly with Lucifer through the ritual practice of child sacrifice that goes on today this practice to invoke and convene with Leviathan originated in the cult of Baal which we Rave read about in the Bible bail is just another name for Leviathan or Lucifer or molar these will reference the same energy The Cult of Baal which is the oldest cult ever established on this planet is the ancient precursor to luciferianism luciferian I personally considered to be a simply a formalized and highly organized Cult of bayonet I forget there were people in the Old Testament they would say these people sacrifice their children they were evil people who sacrifices children right the the mirror govern Line This is a line upon the Earth here is the most secret of all the luciferian families they world the most power as they carry the pure Satan satanic genetic I'll refer back to that throughout the slideshow and he's named a few names and I've blocked them out because I'm not about to name anybody in this because I can't say who's who right so I've blocked the names out that's not my it's not my job to do that to say who's who names are changed and luciferianism to hide Detroit identities of the individuals or virtually every U.S Congress everyone namely newest Congress will be on those 14 families these guys have said these families that run the world and it will be obvious that Coop has been pilfering the United States since a succession Inception more information on the families can be found in the 1995 PDF Bloodlines of the Illuminati which I then went and read luciferians Trace their bloodlines back all the way past the amalekites who practice these same cannibalistic human sacrificing rituals Bloodlines are desperately important to these people because blood carries luciferous energy they must keep the genetic pure from us normies who are not from the blue bloodline of Satan understand these child murdering cultures believe they are direct descendants of the bloodline of Cain as in the Book of Genesis Cain enabled the two there's one twin sons of Eep as we know Cain murdered Abel right luciferians believe Lucifer was literally the father of Cain and Adam the father of Abel according to them Eve at intercourse twice that day once was the demagogue and once with a human she became pregnant with twin boys the key obfuscation and the biblical story is that Eve's boys had different male fathers Lucifer was the first event of course with even then Adam luciferians believed the line of Cain carries the original genetics of Leviathan not a leviath or neviathlon they believe physical sex is essential blah blah blah so they're saying next one sound like Abe Abel came to not in here at Living DNA from his father he narrowed a DNA from a demon now that's wrong it was from the serpent yes right but I researched this and this is common knowledge um this is common amongst this luciferian thing is that's where we come from they say Eve they believe this but they say there of that yes right okay so now this explains why when you understand that the origin of some people on this Earth from hell okay I'm gonna get to the other people soon but this is why you you haven't funny stories in the Bible where Pharaoh the Moses came to pharaoh and had a stick and he threw it down and became a snake and then Pharaoh's magicians got a staff threw it down and became a snake now I don't believe they had it behind their back and a snake in the bag and did a slight of hand and threw a snake down it turned into a snake right Satan doesn't have power to turn a stick into a snake that's why if you follow brother Brown and what he says about it he says Satan cannot create so you've got to get that thought out of your mind but this will still make sense Satan can almost create in this sense when he when because human beings are made like God and we have the capacity to create and to speak and to believe that's a that's a trait of humanity we are made like God so we have the capacity to create slightly so if Satan all he's got to do is try and convince his people if they can believe it enough they can buy that same power of human inspired by Satan make the staff turn into a snake now they're humans like us they can't they don't they just have to learn it all the same as we do yeah right but and here they clearly had the power to do the same thing because but it didn't come from God they were resisting god with the power of humanity inspired by Satan that well you that's why you can't get caught up well there's a miracle I believe that that's right hey he said by the fruits you shall know them the fruits where they were fighting against the word of God that was coming from Satan they did a miracle most people would believe it while they threw a staff down I believe them too maybe I don't believe Moses right that there's a lot of those now if I didn't want to put any pictures here or names or anything but in this modern realm we think that all that evil stuff has gone away it hasn't there's evil that happens on this Earth satanic evil some of it gets uncovered but it generally Satan runs the world he knows who was children are and he gives them positions they just you hear stories well that guy got this he got there he got up to that position Satan gives us people positions this is how it works right that's right and there are there are there's evil stuff there's you don't want to watch the stuff you know the things that happen the the children being taken uncertain and it's always around the time where they have these festivals these satanic ones and children's go missing these children are killed but who does that they murdered like and and wealthy people that you think are wealthy and are normal people are involved in this pedophilia and stuff that you think and recently some were caught and the people that expose it end up dying even the people who exposed some recent stuff laptops in that about eight of those guys that did they did you're only 12 of them nine of them are dead why they did why is someone that was going to expose he had a book of names who was what to try and maybe had a change of heart he's dead why is he dead because there's evil okay this and this evil comes directly from hell it just these these things don't now I don't not going to name anybody but I just need to name principles right because we wouldn't do that in ourselves right let me just talk to this real quick go through this Nephilim right we the in the King James that calls them the Giants but their the name it's always preferred to whether the Nephilim and these were these were when when um and and Genesis 6 it talks about the Nephilim or the Giants were on the earth in those days and when the sons of God had sexual relations with the daughters of man it gave birth to their children they were The Mighty Heroes of old the famous men Young's translation down here uh he Tran they they're quite good because they just translate word for word but they use it a bit different they say the Fallen ones were on the earth in those days now Nephilim doesn't really mean you could you could take that Nephilim means Fallen ones because it's a word put together but these there was a giant race on the earth these Nephilim people also appeared After the flood this was before the flood and after the flood these Giants appeared we're talking big people yeah bigger than the ceiling big people what happens when you hybrid you get big people now and they're different people back then knew there was a difference the sons of God went with the daughters of men they knew there was a difference in these races these two things going on here you're different than us right and this is the one after the flood but brother Brandon CC I was speaking here a few nights ago somewhere upon the subject of naranas in his days take Genesis 6 when the sons of God saw the doors of men and once I was studying history I was listening to what the historian was giving this when I beat your pardon it was a commentary on what he thought the sons of God was he said it was fallen angels that press themselves into human flesh and seen woman and how appealing this woman was and these sons of God became flesh if you take it that way I thought my precious brother you're more smarter than I but if you want to do that you make the devil a Creator so the devil cannot create now the reason why these guys want to figure out what's going on is because they know something's going on they know there's something different here Something's Happened we just don't know what to create two races to create these people that they're calling the Fallen ones the these people and these people so yeah this is how big they are there's you and me there's Arman yeah these are bones they've found these guys are big you think you're Big Ed you're a [Laughter] I'm not saying all big people are from Satan but that's Bible the Christian Old Testament a group of mysterious beings or or people of unusually large size and strength you live be both Before and After the flood and if the Nephilim are reference in Genesis and numbers and are possibly referred to an Ezekiel the Hebrew word Nephilim is sometimes directly translated as Giants or taken to mean that Fallen ones from the Hebrew nephil to fall but the identity of the Nephilim is debated by Scholars so it could go either way we had a situation on Earth where you had this happening now from the genes from the hybrid thing happening you had this yes okay now I'm not going to say that every one of those were Son Of Satan because I believe the the being that comes together inside the DNA I'm going to say it now you had cane you had able right Cain was part of his mother that DNA and part of that DNA right now in order for him to carry on and and reproduce he had to because Humanity's seed was quite pure he had to go with his sister and his anyway her sister was a daughter of um Adam and Eve right so then the The Offspring of that had the DNA of Adam in it and the DNA of even it in the DNA of the serpent all three so the next one after that could fall either way it just stays there all the way through stays there never mixes it just stays it could fall either way okay you understand yeah so it's not like oh oh that's your father like these guys that do the Bloodlines it's like well it's not quite that simple if you can trace your blood back then now if you're happy to be in that line some people carried that through but it didn't come onto the my line when I was born I was we'll get to that but we had a situation we had a situation after 2000 years that these beings were there was quite a pure strand of being on the Earth and as a result after two thousand years what did I say the world became an evil place the Bible said the thoughts of man's heart were evil continually Satan had so much power on the earth because he concentrated it says Cain left then he went to this place and he was just concentrated with with their satanic ideas not all of them were like that but there was like a definite separation between the sons of God and these these this line they this line here as per usual became they built the cities they were wires they built their brass the things in brass they built houses they shepherded they did all these things all the intelligent things they did because that's what Satan uses is intelligence and that they built all that they had so much dominance I reckon they had TV and all sorts back then now the Earth was made with a firmament they this these guys were smart they weren't dumb we see the we see the pyramids that are still there we can't figure out how they made them that stuff is granite you know that was granite you asked brother Jimmy we cut granite slabs at work to make these table tops we cut Granite 30 mils he's got to get a grinder that spins that I don't know how many thousand RPM and cut one small line he's out there dust over his face going and that's the best tool we've got to cut that Granite that thick yes yes you can't tell me that guys made things that size with a hammer and chisel if we have to do that with any sort of hand tool we ain't doing it it's like that's impossible these things have been cut straight okay the man lies and Satan lies and says we've gotten we were dumb and we've got smarter and smarter and smarter that's nonsense they were very smart there smarter even so much they probably blew up the firmament with some sort of nuclear thing there was a water above the Earth clearly there was water there it came down on the earth that's why the Earth is 70 water and then The Fountains of the deep broke open I believe in God made the Earth and had an attention to making a man a land-dwelling being he didn't make it 70 water he's gonna make it 80 Earth 20 water it's now 70 because the water from the firmament came down and The Fountains of the deep broke open it probably got blown up by some nuclear thing their devised right that's right but you had this you had the situation where evil had become so predominant that at a point God said I'm done with it all I'm going to wipe the whole thing off and start again and that's what he did wiped out the whole thing now but the line's still carried on but it didn't have as much power after that because it it was it just wasn't as concentrated they sort of went out but it's still carrying on from there to where we are at today but I don't I believe that the capacity was a strong because it was sort of mixed through the flood and then it it just Satan then had to work his way back all his technology everything was gone flattened you had to start from the start again build it all up again okay so now by talking about this this is now if I just take don't take the little pink one there for now just take the other two these two made a choice before they got here that's why when they got here their Destiny was already determined right that's the only way that I can say that I can't be lost and that's the only way that I can say they can't be saved is that they had to have made some sort of decision because I can't just say well you can't just send someone I know God can do what he wants but my mind is like there has to be in this decision made somewhere okay it was made somewhere now and so was that one because that was from there right now you have this other being which is different because adamant you have another being that is born from the Earth okay let me just tell you a little bit about DNA who likes this is the this is an interesting subject I need to tell you this then I'm going to go back in DNA is like the code of the human body right it's this amazing code that says who you are what color your Skin's going to be how long your fingers are going to be how long your eyelashes are going to be how tall are you going to grow it's all coated in there and then when you get made it just follows the code that's made and you can't change it God said can you make one more here on your head you can't whatever's encoded in that tiny microscopic Gene is what you're going to be right here's a Data Center and um this is like the fifth largest in the world but I got it because they told me how much data it stores this is a 140 000 square meters our house's house is about 140 squares so it's the size of a thousand houses this Big Data Center and um it's about the fifth biggest there's another four bigger and it serves as a hub for Surfer farms and and uh various and data collect and installed by various government agencies including the NSAIDs with all the spying all your information gets put there and studies us study away it stores 12 extra bytes of data the only person interested in this will be um brother Matt he's not here so so okay if we talk about data I just want to show you how much data is stored in DNA it's estimated that one gram of DNA can hold 215 terabytes which is one million gigabytes of data 215 so it's like to give you we're like that means nothing okay this might mean something here all of the data that's stored in there you can fit on 12 teaspoons of DNA information wise right that's how this is how God's data storage system is very good we can it's the amount of information is encoded into this thing called DNA or in the human being we have about 1.15 grams of DNA or we can store about 6 million films our data houses that much information at just a piece of data in US we're very complex beings right now when Adam was made he had an eternal image so the DNA that was made to create him that was made from the Earth the color and skin colors everything was made like what he was right okay this one here which we're going to call Strangers you had another you've got another line that comes from man being with woman and a child being born that is neither there it's not from there but he neither does he have representation or she have representation you've got this other this other being right you understand that just let's call this Abel right now God knew that in order to make me I'm going to be a mix of all sorts of things later on down the line I've got to get the DNA pattern has to be made over to four thousand seven thousand years to make me right yeah but it's got to be made somehow I want to talk about strangers for a little bit Thou shalt this is in the children of this race says Thou shalt neither Vex a stranger nor a person for You Were Strangers in the land of Egypt so God's saying you're you're part of me you're part of you're my children but if a stranger comes in and wants to be a part of it don't fix them let him come in right because I want to show you these people are strangers that can actually come and inherit the kingdom of God but they're not it's not their Kingdom but they have a right to inherit it that's why the Bible says whosoever we'll let him come because God had to somehow make Humanity to make us he's got salvation is for us but these people but these beings will get it if they want it they don't want it they don't have to have it but we'll go to strangers first and if a stranger is doing with thee in your land you shall not Vex him but the stranger that dwelleth with you you with you shall be unto you as one born among you and thou shalt love them as thyself For You Were Strangers in the land of Egypt now I want you to get this concept right because in the past there's been this thing about denominational Christians these sorts of things it's actually not right you the Bible say when you perceive see I don't want to preach too much because I want to keep going through it but if you've got representation from the other world you're going to receive the Holy Ghost you're going to understand the things from there if you don't have representation you're never going to understand it you're never going to get the Holy Ghost but you can accept salvation that's as far as you go because you're not from there you don't it's not in you yeah but because you're going to be born through Humanity these then you get the opportunity and you can choose either way right do you understand okay and whosoever but they come on the same Principle as as if they come in and whosoever there shall be of the House of Israel or of the strangers that's adjune among you that eateth any manner of blood I'll even set my face against that soul that Edith plate and will cut them off from his people so yes you can come in but you've got to follow the same rules so you don't follow the rules you're at you they don't just come and do what they want so that's but that's the way that it works right now Jesus is walking along the shores of Galilean it's walking around no he isn't I just put the picture of the um fish there for the children and John answered them saying master Jesus has has got his ministry and he said Master we saw one casting out there was in thy name and he followeth not us and we forbade him yeah because he followeth not us but Jesus said forbid him not for there is no man which can do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me for he that is not against us is on our part for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because you belong to Christ verily I sound to you who do not lose this reward now there's this this part of humanity as a purely uh they have pure free moral agency in terms that they get to decide the Eternal destination okay now their their being is made I've got it here soon here okay there being I'm gonna in order for me to get around my head to say well then where'd they come from what being was this they were made their being has made like what an angel would like an angel was created and could choose which path they took right then then one path stayed with God one went down and they became that but this other being didn't have a because Adam and Eve weren't supposed to be together so these were you could call them mistakes if you wanna but it's not a mistake but you created this being but but they didn't have any representation but so then God made it that they had a choice so they were I'm going to reference the being like what came in them to talk and be a person a name that sort of being not like their Angels but you understand what I mean there's a being that can be right so they could they then have pure choice and their outcome their outcome determines exactly on what they choose that's why if someone doesn't believe this don't just leave it you don't want to leave it just and say praise the Lord go on love the Lord if they do that they'll be in see this gospel the Salvation was for his children he came to us redeemed but because he knew there's going to be other people here not that but that you can be saved too if you want to come and come in and we'll show you where they end up at the end that's why these things like what Billy Graham didn't that's absolutely of the Lord even though at that time there was another message going forth to call out a bride but this is absolutely of the Lord to call to come come let them come not preaching the same thing because they're not going to receive the same thing right these ones even today there's that it's happening it's absolutely of the Lord but you've got to know what you're laboring in right we don't labor to say we labor for the people with representation that can receive the Holy Ghost because we understand you just accept that it's hard to describe but you just it's different okay now that's why I say salvation salvation Jesus came not at this world to redeem his children those for that representation that was what he came for but he said if anyone else wants to come in if you're strange you want to come in you can come in and this needs to decide which one they choose but don't forget Redemption was for you it was for the people with a representation that was purely why he came amen but then he said well this is why I used to feel funny about singing other people's songs you know that I think you're not really that's good you know but now I'm like actually no it wasn't for me wouldn't have that song you come in and you write it now if you go out I keep the song that song we sung I pledge allegiance to the lamb that man became homosexual now he's a practicing homosexual saying it's all good to be homosexual in the Church of God and he's promoting that okay we still sing it and we get anointed by you probably won't anymore because you'll think about that when you sing it a lot of churches won't sing it because I know we don't want to sing that it's he he was a homosexual I'm like yeah I like the song If he walks out I keep the song yeah because because you're only you only got it because you you tried to be a part you're a stranger in my land and I learned a few things off you if you leave that belongs to me that's why I think all the songs you're in spite of God but they actually all belong for me if I wasn't here you wouldn't have them you understand uh represent the Son of God with representation now here's just one thing that confused me a little bit because brother Branham said that Jesus blood the on the world and all the babies are saved okay if you die as a baby you're saved now that that was a little hard to get my head around because I'm thinking what about if you're born like that okay yeah okay now I came up with two things but I think that that I want to say the first one was when Kane went out he said oh if people find out what I've done they'll kill me and God put a mark on Cain and said no one's going to kill you so then I had this first my first idea was maybe maybe when they're born there's a mark and even say this this one if he's from that line he can't die till he's of the age to reject it right that that's plausible because Kane had that Mark that got a bit complex in my mind the word I got was show no mercy now I thought that and I thought there's a scripture for that and God went when he said to the children of Israel to go and land he said when you get there just kill everybody the the man the woman the children everybody and he said on the last line show no mercy right brother Mario comes up a couple days later and reads that scripture and then it's the same thing he says show no mercy now I don't like to show no mercy because that's not what I'm made of but I have to ask the question is God going to save all the animals that die no what are we dealing with I'm not saying an animal but I'm saying a hybrid he's like hey I made the wicked for the day of Destruction okay it's a hard thought that's why I couldn't get my head around I'm like this is very hard for me but Salvation for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believes now that's what I believe that's why I've mentioned no names it's whosoever believes come in you believe it come in it's all for you you believe it come in no matter what you are come in it's for you okay that's what I believe I have to see this because I have to understand this but this is what I believe it's whomsoever will in the last day the great day of the feast Jesus stood in quiet If any man thirsted him coming to me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture saith has said out of as badly shall fly rivers of Living Water but this is spake of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive the Holy Ghost which they should receive for the Holy Ghost is not yet given because that Jesus will not yet glorified now if you if you're not part of the representation you can still receive that and you'll just think oh that spirit is just when the spirit comes but then for the Believers that so that's when the Holy Spirit comes in but if someone wants to receive it they can receive it you understand so being very very nice to everyone that wants to call upon the name of the Lord very nice the way you react to them could determine your outcome don't forget this is a hard saying to say but they're they're dispensable they have no representation you can never be lost some people can never be saved these ones are dispensable that's a hard hard word to say do you understand if you try and RAM something down their throat and they reject it you know it says and they say and they get so in the humanity rejected the Bible says the only unforgivable sin here and in the world to come is calling a genuine work of art and God an unclean thing it says you won't be forgiven here or the world to come you're out there are people that ended that are dispensable it's like well you're out that's it you hate your choice you chose that gone it's that simple so be very careful just encourage people if you find they're not interested encourage them in the Lord praise the Lord man get keep going believe the Lord believe this I'll see you there keep going bro be as nice as you can I mean that okay there's strangers in the land and God sees you shall love them as you love yourself love them as you love yourself they're not going to accept this but love them because they they'll make it if they believe they'll make it because it's for whomsoever will yes okay now I need to go now to the Book of Life and then I'm right on time The Book of Life now we've got three clearly three things in the Book of Life one group that's never on the book one group that their actions determine whether they're on or off and one group that always on never come off okay now let's look at always on the book first of all we know most assuredly that the purpose of God stands in election it was purpose in himself it was God's purpose to bring forth to people like unto himself that would be a word bride she was chosen in him before the foundation of the world in him she was foreknown and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the Earth before we got here where representation he was Redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation she can never be in the Judgment because she because sin cannot be imputed unto Romans 4 8 says blessed is the man to whom the Lord does not impute sin okay but indeed she shall be with them in his throne of judgment judging the world even and even angels her name each of whom members All of You was written in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and can never be taken off okay but you made a choice already you've made your choice that's why when you cut here you're just manifesting your choice you can never be taken off now the next one the less got another step further but before we do let's review our case that's far first of all we know most assuredly that the purpose of God secondly there is another class their names were also on the book of life and they will come up in the second Resurrection such as other foolish virgins and the righteous as it spoken of Matthew 25 and this class also are those who do not worship the Beast or become involved in the Antichrist system but die for their faith even though they are not in the bride not having been born again but they will come up when the second resurrection and go into eternal life okay because they are a byproduct of what Humanity wasn't supposed to do but they did and these people came forth to bring forth me there's got to be opportunity right but it's not the bride because there are different we've got to end up in threes right now Judas or the third one thirdly there are the borderline Christians such as we saw in Israel coming out of Egypt these had their names I'm still in the middle one by the way these had their names on the book of life and the works written in the books these having failed to obey God and being void of the spirit even though the signs and wonders were amongst them will never have their names will have their names removed from the book amongst this group will be the ones like Judas who though entirely void of the spirit but are religious will have manifestations in their lives and though on the books were not elected in him such as as Balaam such also as Balaam will be in that group okay so now I want to talk about Judas for a minute Judas was from that line he wasn't from Satan he was this right now the disciples got together after Judas had betrayed Jesus they got together and they said in the 70 returned even with joy I know this is before that they said uh Lord even the devils are subject unto us and he said unto them I beheld Satan is lightning falling from Heaven behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject to you but Rejoice because your name is written in heaven okay now now we know that Judas was among them he said Your name's written in heaven so at that point Judas had his name written in heaven and he was on his way to Glory yeah okay clearly now after it all happened and unfolded the way that it did because Judas made a choice now I don't want to I want to go this way right and in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and said um the number of the names together were about 120 men and Brethren the scripture must needs have been fulfilled with the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake concerning Judas which was guide to them that took Jesus for he was numbered with us and obtained part of the ministry now this man purchased a field with the reward of his iniquity and falling head long he bursted Thunder in the midst and all his bowels gusts out committed suicide and it was known amongst all the Dwellers at Jerusalem until the Dwellers at Jerusalem and so much that the field is called in the proper tongue which is to say the field of budford is written in the Book of Psalms let us habitation be desolate and let no man dwell Theron and his Bishop Rock let another man take so they're looking back in the Old Testament saying this is where it talks about Judas let his land be desolate and let someone else take his position don't think that God's not in the Small Things these men are up in a small room saying uh David wrote about us 120 guys in a room saying David wrote about us now let's go back to that one Psalms 109 verse 8 says let his days be few and then another taker's office they're saying that meant Judas and then they're saying this one let the habitation be desolate and let none dwell in their tents for they persecute him whom now has smitten and they talked to the grief of Those whom thou has wounded and inequity and to add inequity unto their inequity and let not them come and unto the righteous let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be written with the righteous so saying let his name be blotted out okay so he was on there then he was off by his choice right okay now now that you have this other group fourth and finally which come from this origin that made a choice fourth and finally are the ones whose names have never been or ever will be written on the books such as the found in Revelation 38 and Revelation 17 8 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world not there the basic their saurus was and it's not and shall I seen out of the bottomless pit and go into petition and they that dwell on the Earth shall Wonder those whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world when they behold the Beast that was and is and yet as Jesus said that a certain group would have seek one who comes in their own name that is that one is the Antichrist and that is exactly what it says of them in Revelation 38 and 17 8. these were ordained of God but not unto election and what's what this group was such as Pharaoh it says if I'm even for the same purpose have I raise the up vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction Romans 9 17 and 22 says None of these would be placed on the records of life I'm not saying there is no record of them no doubt there is some kind of record of them but not on the records of Life their purpose of existence has to be dealt with slightly in the rest of this book but we can add two more scriptures Proverbs 16 4 that says the Lord hath made the wicked for the day of evil and the wicked is reserved to the day of Destruction they shall be brought forth in the day of Wrath okay yeah okay this has been hard for my head but it makes things make sense now I want to tell you this this was our journey I'm about to close okay this was our journey we started off here with the glory when we were made in His image I had a glorified body and I had a I had some sort of mind but I don't know what minor hex I can't remember right I'm not going to say I don't know neither do you now it's always got to end up in three I came to the Earth there was a physical body made for me that that's part of me here whatever it was I don't know what it was but some some part of me stated some part of me came here because that part of me is waiting when this earthy tabernacle's dissolved I've got one waiting I'm gonna go back there and it looks like me so I got made on this Earth DNA matched me exactly and I turn up here and I and then I I become a soul a body and a spirit because I there's a human Spirit upon this Earth that we get as a human and I've got my soul which was from there and then over time I received the Holy Ghost because that's my that's the earnest of my inheritance that I've got a representation there it's the only people that receive the Holy Ghost the ones that have representation there people can receive salvation not the Holy Ghost because that's that's essentially part of me coming in because that's from that's from that world coming in right so I have these I end up being a full human being right before it's an unusual number but when I pass on my body dies this is the surf this body just goes back to the Earth my Earthly Spirit just ceases to be because it was just came with this empty Spirit what things go on my soul which is which is me there but knowing all this now and the whole the holy ghost that the promise of me goes on and it joins up with my glorified body that's there and I become a Triune being the way I should be I've got a body I've got a human soul to know this and I've got God in me I've got this right so I become who I should be but I've gone on this long journey it's our view okay let your journey we're gone the wedding garment is the Holy Ghost yes okay so this that's why this Parable here says someone tried to come in without the wedding garment only those that are going to the marriage supper of the Lamb only those with the Holy Ghost to go in there but we've got to have we get a I need this is the big thing I want you to get out of this we get a winning garment because we've got a body to put it on right you can't put a wedding garment on on a spirit without a body right so it's only those that have a body because when I go I it's like I carry it the Holy Ghost then when I get there I put it on my my body the only people with the body put it on right so if you don't have a body there you don't get the Holy Ghost now you get one eventually I want to show you where they fit in but the marriage supper of lamb I haven't actually talks about I haven't gone into this very much so I can't really say much all I can say is first there's a wedding supper as this is the Tribulation is happening on the earth and then we're going to rain with them for a thousand years on this Earth as it is now but Satan's going to be bound a thousand years and now people say uh are they going to be babies born I don't believe there will be because the time will actually slow down I don't think time is going to transpire that people will actually like babies cannot be growing you know that time will just it's like you'll be there for a thousand years because it's like an old man shall be as as this and a young man you would just stay so some way or another time we'll just stop saying how can you things aren't going to grow like and produce on the linear space of time that's just what I think because it wouldn't make sense for babies to be born in this 2000 years but it's like maybe it's a day of risk maybe maybe that's the seventh day because it's the seventh day maybe God just rests time we're gonna rest for a thousand years because that's what it is the Earth has been six thousand years seventh day we're gonna rest stop time relax when it starts again in this then there's the the final Earth is destroyed after that after the thousand years is up the day of rest the Earth is destroyed we all turn up I'm about to close we all turn up to this place called the Great White Throne judgment now the Bible says know you're not that the Saints will judge the Earth Okay so we've turned up there and we've got a body right now we judge the Earth okay now before us before us there are humans are put and and angels are going to put before us and they come from two places firstly it says death and hella gave up the dead that were in them okay there are people that are going to judgment just to confirm you're going back there yeah that's why they're there right there are people already there yeah now they say well hang on why can you go to a judgment to be judged and you're already you've been convicted of the crime I believe the people that are there are that and also the ones that blaspheme the Holy Ghost because that says there's no forgiveness here or the world to come so they they cut themselves off there everyone else I believe if they're not part of that line they then they and then the next in the same scripture it says the sea gave up they did there's another group that had put forth right which is not from death and hell but they're not judging now these these beings end up to be Spirits without bodies okay when this being dies his body dies his Spirit human Spirit dies it's just a soul what it looks like I'm not sure but it's it's a soul without a body because it doesn't have a body weighting yeah right so it's turning up to the Judgment without a body a spirit without a body it's naked right now this is why we can say there is potential forgiveness there because this scripture says and whosoever speaketh the word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world nor in the world to come right so now you could color that in and say okay that tells me that that in the world to come there is forgiveness available right because if you say there's no forgiveness here because he could say uh you won't be forgiven here but in the world to come you be forgiven now that's possible right it's possible for The Unforgiven to go there and be forgiven there there's forgiveness there absolutely and that's that's why it's a judgment come forth what did you do and it's a fear judgment some people never heard the gospel never heard the gospel never heard nothing better Sophia judgment what did you do with your life then like I say this one for he that is not against us as for us is on our part whosoever should give you a cup of water to drink in my name because you belong to Christ really sound to you he shall not lose his reward see one of these people could just say man I like you want a v give David a v now on the day of judgment that's going to come up oh yeah he was nice he gave him a v never heard the gospel never did nothing that could be it what does it say blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy there may be people that didn't know nothing but in their heart they were merciful never heard the gospel and they just did acts of Mercy help people did that they're going to be judged accordingly because don't forget that the judge is there Christ blood has been shed for everyone okay the the there is going to be there uh blessed are the peacemakers there are good people in the world that are just doing good things I believe on the day of judgment that will be remembered so don't just write everything off except just to let God be God to worry about you let God be God and if people bless you I encourage you to say Thank you Lord I thank you for that person blessing me I've done it many times if a family member that I know not interested in God does something nice for me I say Lord I remember that if they never do nothing in this on a bad judgment I'm going to say I remember that yeah if people do if people some people wave out to me some people lift a box of fruit and I went and got a piece out of there and I said and something in me said I said Lord whoever gave me this fruit thank you they they put a box of fruit on the side of the road said free and I was running past and I was hungry well it's a bit of fruit free I'll eat it and I enjoyed it I said Lord have a gate put that fruit there on the day of judgment I'm going to remember them when they come up show me who it was I enjoyed this this is the power of forgiveness right because God's got a lot of people on the new heavens and new earth right amen but you have one last issue to sort of deal with right we are there we've got a soul we've got our body that was made these people are there let's say they come there and then they believe in the Lord yes he clearly believes the Lord with all of his heart he believes the Lord there's that those people that believe there's other people that did things there's a whole group of people that are going to be saved I've heard people that you wouldn't think will be Christians dying and saying they came back they said man I was walking along this field not even a Christian I was going somewhere there's something in all this right it's bigger than what we think don't just Heaven is going to be a big place with a lot of people more people than what I hear now billions this Earth has only got 30 percent Earth and we managed to fit here comfortably and half the planet is inhabitable there's going to be a whole planet with no sea there's going to be billions and billions of people mark my words it's going to be a massive world it's this place here it can be a lot of people not just us four and no more people there's a lot of people there right last obstacle then is a spirit without a body so this person comes up if they get forgiveness they need a body this is now according to Isaac they need to first they need a body to put the robe on because God's got the robe and I just think how he does this see I think he just goes back to the Earth before and because it's been all baptized with fire and it gets there oh you mate where was you where are you gets them now don't forget Adam will live forever when he was there from that dirt he would live forever and ever this is just my idea of it right so he says right get his body we get her body fetch it back and there's a whether this is right or wrong I don't know but they but their body is not God just can't I'll quickly have another son and I'll merge you with the son or daughter you understand so that's this is the way I've made it they he just gets that body he gets their body back oh it's me again because remember they were just made from the Earth but it's been the the Earth has been baptized has been baptized Bloodshed and baptism of fire so it's all clean get his body make it so then he gets the body then the Holy Ghost is actually just the Holy Ghost given to him they get a robe to put on now they're walking around there but they're with you but they're not like you their body is not the same body as yours but they're there they've got the robot they're walking around happy but they're different and that's the way this new heavens and a new Earth right and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth will pass away and there was no more sea okay I bet there was water and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband I've got about three more to go now this there's this new heaven in the new Earth remember at the start I said what is not there is the is the holy city so on this one he said and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials of the seven plagues and talks to me saying come hither and I'll show you the bride the Lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to Great high mountain and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending from God out of heaven that wasn't there at the beginning it says holy city the New Jerusalem where the bride the the the ones with the bodies that's where they're going to live the New Jerusalem the holy city now it says about this place neither shall there there shall be no night there and they need no candle neither light of the Sun for the Lord God giveth them light and shall reign forever and ever amen okay so God is there in this city and his light just lights all up the whole time and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine on it for the glory of God's Enlighten it and the lamb is the light thereof amen okay now this is the bride now the bride are the ones that have that were there in the beginning before the world was made and throughout all of the ages they'd be manifested they've heard his word they've come and through all the ages yes they live here this is a big place the city's a big city but it doesn't cover the whole Earth but this earth looks like this Earth just a whole lot better yes right but it's the same as this now you get another group and it says and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it so let's talk about this there's going to be Nations around that that it's almost like a reward system if you actually followed the Lord on the earth and you accepted it you're going to get to live close to the city and live in the light of it right it's a big place there are these people there are nations we're talking Nations millions billions and then it says and then the kings of the Earth all around the rest of the world there are Kings of the earth not nations of the safe just people maybe they've just did well on the earth and they've been in because of that whatever they're in for the kings of the earth do bring their glory and unto it and the gates of it shall not be shut At All by day and there shall be no night there and they shall bring the glory and honor of the Nations unto it okay there's going to be a lot of people there and it's going to be these groups one group near and these ones are going to be out there yeah there's going to be day and night out there because it says there's planets in that but it's not going to be night like Darkness because night is quite a wonderful thing when you can stop and relax and you go back to your homes and you relax that's what God intended hey just you go back don't just be all go go go go go home relax settle then in the morning when the Sun rises come back up the sun's going to rise if there was no no we might go for a walk out I want to go out and see what it's like to see the sunrise we've got to walk a long way to get out of the light of the city and we can see the sunrise right right but those in the city there's never any light now if you're on a globe you could be here that light lights that City it says there's no night there but there's planets and things happening there's light and darkness and that but the the people in existence are all the saved of the Lord the whole earth and there's going to be many many there's about eight billion people here I reckon is going to be probably 130 billion hundred I don't know there's gonna be a lot of people there there's kingdoms and Nations that come in and bring their Glory unto the city right but there's going to be different people some are in there some are there some are out there it's God's great plan of how he made it but amongst it all he says I am Alpha and Amiga I'm the beginning I'm the end I'm the first and the last this is who's going to be there lighting up the city and that's who we're going to dwell with the bride is going to dwell with other kings and that we'll get to enjoy and say hey and meet the king just like the Queen of Sheba did come in and out and bring things and then we want to go and see the king but the bride dwells with the King and and the new Heaven and the new Earth thank you very much for your time and for listening I I I wanted to get that thought off my mind so thank you for if you don't believe all of it praise the Lord just but if you want to ask me questions come and ask me I've got a whole bunch of stuff I left out okay and I've got reasons why I've said everything but hopefully what I want you to get out of it is be a good belief be and be nice to everybody yeah be nice to everyone as much as you can and just know that you're not from here it starts here it ends here all the stuff here doesn't matter don't get caught up in little finicky nonsense don't worry about it just keep your eyes on the Lord rejoice in the Lord don't worry about anything just praise the lord it's all falling apart praise the lord it's all going well praise the Lord you're not from here don't worry about it the Lord You're just here to you're here to go through things to be molded to be made to that's what I didn't really touch on but the purpose of you being here you think why does this whole thing in my last final Point why this whole thing why the trouble why the trouble that's what I thought when I started seeing it all like my first question not to the Lord but my first thought was why all this trouble it seems like a lot of why I'll tell you why so that you can experience God as my savior he's my healer He's My Redeemer back there he wasn't that because he didn't have a way of expressing it we come here into this realm that we can experience actually be lost now I'm saved I'm saved I'm redeemed we get sick we can be healed he's a Healer we get broke we ask the Lord help me he's a provider he becomes all these things to us that's the purpose of this whole thing just experience that if you're in a valley praise God no walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil for thou art with me they'll write that stuff that comfort me experience that that's what you're here for you just to understand the power and the goodness of God to know I'm a savior and King that's the most important part of the whole sermon actually right there I'm glad I remembered it praise the Lord have have you all got you can stand up Shake around a bit have you do you have 10 more minutes for me to sing this song okay you can I know I went a bit longer and I cut out 20 slides I think
