God can do anything amen amen nothing's too hard for him this morning amen so let's just read here from acts 15 and verse one and certain men which came down from Judea taught the Brethren and said except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be saved when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them in other words they had a big long Fellowship but you know and they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain other of them should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question and being brought on their way by the church they passed through uh fence if that's how you say that in Samaria declaring the um conversion of the Gentiles and they caused Great Joy unto all the Brethren and when they were come to Jerusalem they were received of the church and of the Apostles and elders and they declared all things that God had done with them but there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed now what kind of Faith do they have saying that this was needful that it was needful soorry to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses and the apostles and Elders came together for to consider of this matter amen Let's uh let's bow our heads in word of prayer if you have a need you just want to raise your hands to the Lord this morning say Lord Remember Me In This Moment amen let's pray gracious Heavenly Father Lord we are Lord we know who we are because you have shown us who we are Lord through this message of the hour Lord God you revealed that we are Sons and Daughters of yours Lord we are the children of the most High we know where we stand Lord covered in your blood father sinless perfect in your sight so we thank you dear God and Lord as we have opened your word we've opened the sword of the Lord I pray father that you would your word would have full uh impact in every life Lord anything that any spirit that would try and influence or or or dilute your influence or or or deflect your influence Lord from any any life Lord I pray it to be bound in the name of Jesus Christ father that you'd have preeminence in our lives may you come and take control we thank you for this day we thank you all of you're doing father we want to just remember as well father those who are sick and body Lord we want to remember brother Phil father thank you he's back at home but we're asking dear God for a complete restoration of his health father especially his hip Lord different parts of his body Lord I pray you would fully restore him that he can he

father's pancreatic cancer dear God we know nothing is too hard for you Lord Jesus Lord when you died on Calvary Lord you didn't just completely save our souls you completely healed our bodies so Lord we thank you for the blood of your atonement dear God and we just want to commit him into your hands father asking you touch his body Lord and give him a new pancreas Lord in the name of Jesus Christ have your perfect will in the situation be with the church there too dear God help them Father through these difficult times Lord may they just draw closer to you Lord above all things Grant it dear God we love you we thank you for this day have your way Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen am amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning so I want to um I want to talk about this morning about the you know there are three kinds of Believers we all know that now every every sincere Christian believes they're the True Believer right I don't believe I'm a make believer I don't believe I'm a unbeliever I believe I'm a Believer right and so now but the thing is there's always a battle now first and foremost I want to say and we'll go into it later but you know a a True Believer doesn't start a True Believer they started as an unbeliever then they'll be a make believer but then they'll eventually become a real believer right so all of us through some stage of our Christian Life or even just our life upon the Earth we were unbelievers even if we were raised in church it didn't mean nothing to us we were there because Mom and Dad took us or family or whatever but there came a time when God began to deal with our lives then we became make Believers and then we became real Believers when we really met the Lord you see because the difference between the three is an unbeliever um uh they all love Miracles they all love the supernatural right they all love it right we know when uh brother bran preached three kinds of Believers he took his text from John chapter 6 I won't read that now but you know it speak when Jesus would stand there and said unless people you know unless you drink my flesh I mean drink my blood and eat my flesh you have no life in you you have no part in me and we know in that group the 70 were there the disciples were there there was a multitude there the 70 experienced a Supernatural Ministry Jesus sent them out they cast out Devils they healed the sicks they knew what the anointing was like of course the apostles knew the same and then by the end of that sermon there was only the the disciples were left but the but Peter was a True Believer though he was actually a m believer at that stage because he hadn't gone to Pentecost yet and so he would he would say you know because Jesus asked him are you going to leave too and and Peter said those incredible words but to where shall we go for we know you have you only have the words of eternal life but then Jesus would stand and say don't you know I've chosen you but one of you is a devil so the so the m so the unbelievers left the 70 were actually unbelievers they left soon as God began to reveal himself and speak the word they said no there's nothing to this and they left the make Believers especially Judas but you know the others they hung around but you see it's all about the motive and attitude of the person which really dictates where you are so as I said we think we're all um True Believers and God wants to make us all True Believers I'm not putting anyone in a box but you know it's kind of like the immune system of the body this may seem like a strange segue but you know the reason why people get so sick is because initially the immune system does not identify what's causing you to be sick yeah that's the reason why cancer is such a such a terrible disease is because it takes a long time for the body to realize what's really happening and then once it starts recognizing it starts fighting it but sadly many times it can be too late so so what happens is is is is the body has these cells so the immune system is a very complex thing but part of it is there cells in the body that have to identify a a virus or bacteria or something that's in your body once those things identify those things then they have other cells which come and kill the enemy yeah so it's kind of like the word of God the enemy can be working in a life he can be causing trouble he can be causing all kinds of Mind battles and struggles and sin and all kinds of things but unless the word comes and attach itself to that sin then the Holy Ghost then you can actually realize hey this is not part of me it's not meant to be in my system then God can come and kill that thing and you can be free right so this is why there's like an immune system deal going on here this morning so so there's always those three kinds of Believers now the True Believer when they get to that position they want the word of God to have preeminence in their lives that's all they're interested in that's what a True Believer wants a make believer does not want the word of God to have pre a make believer wants his own human Spirit to rise up and he said and whenever whenever the word is contrary to them they say that's just an opinion they'll even take quotes and things say that's just an opinion because it doesn't match where they are and unbeliever doesn't care about the word they're off somewhere else right and we're all here today so there we go we'll get rid of that category real quick amen so you see now so a make believer see this is this is to me this is one of the most astounding things in the book of Acts there's many different things things go on but brother Braham would tell us that we are at another Ephesians again now the now I've been reading through that church age book chapter of the Ephesian age and it's it's just it's just so powerful I just really enjoy it I encourage you go read that go read that portion of the church age book again and brother BR would always speak about you know because there was a complaint against that age where where they had left their first love now there's a reason they had left that first love you know we know ultimately sure they are anointed to you know uh because uh Ephesus means to aim at and relax so they aimed at the high calling in Christ but because the church had to eventually go to down into a Dark Age they would not obtain that but they relax and begin to drift but there's always a challenge in every age are the people really going to fulfill the whole word of God that's allotted to them or are they just going to aim at it and get caught up in something else and drift see brother Bram said we've come to that Ephesians again but there's a people in the earth that God is going to use to break that cycle because we're not going through church ages again there's not another seven church ches we have come to the end and God has determined he will have a people that that are made in His image amen they're exactly like him upon the earth I mean they're on fire for him they're full of zeal they love the Lord with all their hearts and they will not allow the enemy to come in and try and Crush their experience they'll not allow see the enemy will try he'll try he doesn't want the fire of God to fall he doesn't want God to fulfill his word he just wants us to be cold formal lukewarm powerless that's what the enemy wants us to be but God doesn't want us to be that way amen so but the thing is we've got to agree with one or two Powers amen either God or Satan which one do you want I want God by the way you in case you're wondering so now here were these here were these people now you can see they say the Pharisees there verse 5 which believed what kind of Believers were they they were not true believers because if they are true believers they would never say they are still a sect of the Pharisees the Apostle Paul never said he was still a Pharisee he said he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees he was but he wasn't after God met him on the road to Damascus he was not that Pharisee anymore and he said I count that all but dung that I might win Christ so all of his previous religious training all that he was he says that's dung on the field I I count about that I don't even hold it in any regard of any goodness as total filth disgusting waste of time I'm so glad I'm not in that anymore but these guys they still are still Pharisees but yet they are believers but how can you be a Bel a True Believer and still hold on to a previous light of a previous age how can you hold on to the traditions of man and yet claim to be a believer you cannot amen because God burns out all the old we become a new creation in Christ we are not a reformed group we're not a patched up job we're not a people working through things no we become a new creation amen the old person's died and there's a new person here amen amen so you may live in the same house but you're not the old person praise God I'm so thankful for that aren't you amen amen so so so these ones were were now there was so there was a battle begin to start here in the early church where which which would have the preeminence amen would it be the fire of Pentecost would it be God living in the people would it be God dwelling in his church again would it be the power would it be the word put on flesh would it be that kind of a church would continue on or would these ones coming with the with the p with a dead formal religion would they have preeminence among the people well sure they their Church order might be right you the you know the services might be all be very good but the fire of God is left am mean so which one's going to have preeminence you see this is where the challenge is where the spirit of the makeb believer always tries to usurp the spirit of the believer amen like Cain and Cain and Abel they were both believers they both believed God was God Cain wasn't an atheist right but Abel was a true Believer by Revelation amen he offered the lamb amen but but Cain Cain was a make believer he did not have that Revelation so he brought the fruit of his hands you know the you know the ground and all these things everything he did and because he was a make believer when God came to correct them because God said to him just do like your brother did you don't even really need to understand what's going on just you saw what happened in your brother's life you saw my fire fall on his sacrifice you saw me say this is my boy amen I want you came to be in the same group do like he did but you see cuz he had the spirit cuz he was a make believer he was not willing to surrender his human will am mean that the word of God would have preeminence it was his opinion that ruled because his opinion says no My Sacrifice is good enough but God said it's completely wrong it was an excellent sacrifice it was sincere it was right you know it was good in that regard but it wasn't according to the word you see so the make believer of Cain came and killed because it a make believing Spirit never makes peace with a True Believer it cannot it cannot make peace there cannot be Harmony there's always a clash and me when the both come together don't don't pull back on me okay because you know I believe we're all True Believers but you got to be able to discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit me because he wants to come in and make us formal lukewarm cold and Powerless he wants us to have a formal of godliness but deny the power thereof where we just say well no God can't really change me in an instant it's just too easy no God can I mean the Apostle Paul was changing a moment it wasn't a long time of season of working through issues no he met the God who can solve the issues amen he met the god that could change him amen and he became a new man on the road to Damascus amen Peter here we'll go into him soon but you know he was a make believer he needed a Pentecost he needed a Pentecost he didn't need a p party he needed a Pentecost amen and he got that Pentecost cuz he was a True Believer on the inside see the difference between Judas and Peter was Judas didn't go to p Pentecost he didn't go I believe if he went he would have got so the blood of Jesus Christ can forgive all things really you think about it what can he not forgive I've done too much bad I've done too much evil try God try God I thinking the other day God you forgave a murderer Moses you forgave an attempted murderer Peter is there anything too hard for you is anyone in a too hard basket that God can't reach and change Hallelujah but you know a song says come to the table come to his table you got to come to his table like MTH was was invited to come to David's table but he had to go under the T to sit there at the table amen be like everyone else amen so it comes that now meetings always create three classes of people the meetings produce this so Jesus himself produced make Believers unbelievers and True Believers nothing wrong with the word nothing wrong with our lord Jesus but his preaching produced these three kinds now before the word ever came their way they probably would have been all the same you would never said the Pharisees were make Believers You' never said the 70 were unbelievers and Judas and you know that would have been all kind of but the word came and be to draw people to where they were ordained to be yeah right now I'm going to bring this very much into choice because God puts it on your lap because unbelief says well if I'm ordained I'm ordained if I'm not I'm not that's unbelief speaking faith says God you're here for me God you you can change me you can fix me you can transform me God and I'm here for my blessing I'm here to be changed I'm here to be renewed you can do the job God because you can do anything amen that's what faith says amen so Faith does not say well if I'm in I'm in if I'm out I'm out that's unbelief speaking so never let an unbelieving Spirit tell you that you can't get there because Jesus said all that come to me I'll no wise cast out amen so if you just come to him he's not going to say sorry he's going to say welcome come home I mean for you come home amen so so there's nothing wrong with jesus' Ministry but this is what it produced the disciples Ministry produced the same thing brother br's Ministry produced the same thing you see but there's always a phase now when there's always a phase where people are as I said they are unbelievers then they become make Believers then they become real Believers I say you know if you find yourself in a category that's not a real believer why have the substitute I don't even I you can't even I don't even know how you can even call it that but you know why have the fake or the not even the real when you can have the genuine God when you can have the Living God like you know brother Isa said sorry I just get emotional cuz he's he can safe hallelujah amen you know why why why accept anything less than a genuine walk with God Amen why I say take the real hallelujah amen now you see now the Spirit of this world hates the spirit of God I'm going to put this in but many times we think the spirit of the World As in out there The Atheist the agnostic the whatever sure that that is the spirit of the world too but remember the spirit of the world is religious it comes in among the Devil comes to church he comes to church he tries to cause trouble he tries to get your mind off everything else I mean on everything else but what's going on right now you know but God comes to church too amen hallelujah our great king comes to church as well but you see the spirit of this world hates the spirit of God I say the spirit of the make believer hates the spirit of the True Believer amen because it can't overcome the spirit of the Lord it tries to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit of the of Truth dwells see this is why so see the thing is people out there who are atheists that doesn't affect you someone comes along and says well 25 billion billion years ago God made a slug come out of the sea and all this happening and you know I've study science so I can talk to them and say well how did it start in the beginning give me the chemical level at the beginning show me how it happened and the laws of chemistry forbid it happening oh but they say no we're talking about this no you got to start somewhere I've got to start in the beginning God said let there be hallelujah how it happened well I'm here that's fine you know he he'll show us the full details of it you know but the thing is that doesn't bother me that doesn't affect me it's when it's when religious people come along and they use the word of God in quotes to try and destroy you say well you're still living will they try and kill your influence amen because brother R said there's what there's more than one way to kill someone you can physically shoot them or you can murder their influence both is murder both is premeditated murder amen right so what will happen is spirits will come along and give give snide remarks and off comments and put put burdens and stresses and pressures on people to try and destroy the vessel in whom the spirit of Truth dwells in right say shake that off shake that nonsense off amen you should actually rejoice when those things happen cuz you realize I've got something the devil can't have Hallelujah I belong to God and God's in me and this is why why all this happens against me Hallelujah you say well the battle's too strong now God can fight any battle amen he can overcome anything he's already overcome hell death in the grave the Lord amen so there's always this battle between truth and error or these two Spirits they're always within the framework of the word doesn't change the word though the word's all good now as I said Peter was a make believer at first okay we're going to go talk about make I'm not worried about the unbeliever I think we've already talked about him let's move on okay so now Peter Peter is a make believer because the make believer as I said will not allow the word of God to have preeminence so when it comes to prophecy being fulfilled they will hinder it they'll try and stop it now this this section of scripture here is just after Jesus asked his disciples who do me say that I am yeah and you know we know the answer you know they you know the disciples say well some say you're Elias or Jeremiah or one of the prophets but then Jesus asked that great question but who do you say I am and Peter says Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and then so Peter begins you know Jesus says you bless out thou you know Peter you know Simon um son of Jonas for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father in heaven and Upon This Rock the revelation of who Jesus Christ is I'll build my church and then he says the gates of your the gates of the Kingdom will be given to you right so here's Peter he's got a revelation that Jesus is the Christ see there's one thing to know the message is Messiah revealed there's one thing to know that it's another thing to know that and that same word come and change you because the devil believes this message was Jesus Christ revealed that's not a that's not something that would chock him and think man I've never thought about that before no he knew what it was like to stand there meeting after the meeting and the angel of the Lord come down and those Devils be cast out and exposed and demon powers scattering for their lives service after service he knows what it does Amen am mean he knows what it does when he sees people become filled with the Holy Ghost and the Damage they begin to cause his kingdom he knows what that's like am mean if he told the truth he'd say yes William brandham was Malachi 4 if he really could tell the truth say yes this message is Jesus Christ revealed he fought it and fought it and fought it right and he will will still fight it now but you see a make believer who's in the message will actually try and stop prophecy being fulfilled cuz this is what the spirit of a make believer does because here is here is Peter he we we know ultimately he's a real believer okay just like I say everyone I believe God wants to make us all real Believers amen amen I believe it that's why I'm preaching these things God wants to make us real Believers amen so now here here is Peter and then Jesus after he speaks to his disciples about this then he begins to tell them about what he here to for will he's going to go to Jerusalem he's going to suffer many things of the elders Chief priest scribes he's going to be killed but raised up again the third day so he's telling them the prophecy he's ordained to fulfill that he is here to be the uh sacrificial lamb amen he's here to be the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world but you see Peter is not rejoicing in this Peter doesn't start rejoicing saying Thank You Lord my fathers were looking for you my Forbe were looking for you we were told in the synagogue that you've been prophesied to come from the days of uh the Garden of Eden and now you're here no he says Peter took him and began to rebuke him in other words he's saying God because he said doubt the Christ Messiah you're wrong what you're saying is not right it's not according to the word he rose his opinion above what the word was declaring to be I don't think that quotes right I don't think that matches that scripture that doesn't apply to me none of us special cases there's no sub Clause with your name in it that omits you from any part of the scripture I'm sorry but that's just how it is everyone thinks they're a special case none of us are a special case God is without respector of persons and to have respect of persons is sin that's why many times things happen in the message ranks is because the name of the person doing it carries weight and it's sinful to respect that if it's contrary to the word of God amen so we must never judge something by based on who says it we're got to take everything back to the word of God subject it back to the message amen take it back to the Bible that's what we've got to do doesn't matter how long they've been you know I was thinking about this just jumping back here see and they came down from Judea well that's one of the original places where the whole gospel went these ones must carry Authority they're there one of the original places see they're using their what they claim as originality as a as a as a um of authority well I've been a Believer so long I've done this I've been here I was raised here I'm from here no you got to take it all back to the word of God yes sir amen irrespective of who's saying it and and and I put myself in that boat too cuz there's no sub Clause that exempts me from anything all right thank you brother Colin amen so you know I'm not I'm not putting this this is not there this is all of us right amen amen so now Peter Peter says no this shall not be so in other words he's telling he's telling the Lord Lord you're not going to die on Calvary you're not going to cleanse us of our sins you're not going to you're not going to conquer hell death in the grave and you see Jesus identified the anointing on Peter he didn't say Peter was Satan he said the the inspiration upon Him is Satan amen he says Thou Are an offense unto me for th Savor us not the things that be of God but those that be of men you see and then now but then this didn't stop Peter trying to hinder the word see as an unbeliever people always try and hinder prophecy because when Peter was in The Garden of Gethsemane well-meaning sincere man but him cutting the servant uh high priest servants ear off he was trying to stop the Lord go to Calvary he was trying to stop prophecy in his day be fulfilled that's what he was trying to do he wasn't doing it to I mean what other reason would he do it for well we're all going down let's go down and you know in style no he was trying to stop the word fulfill what it was there to do that's what he was trying to do so it was he was a good intending make believer a good intending Christian right some some of you got that some of you get it tomorrow right a good and tending Christian but he's trying to stop prophecy be fulfilled as we heard on Wednesday we're here for missing puzzle pieces that really Rec calibrated be our brother man thank you very much I appreciate that we're here to find the last one the last one might be here amen maybe maybe it's overseas and God leads us maybe it's in Papa New Guinea where we help with Mission work or the Solomons or somewhere I don't know but the last one's somewhere right the Rapture will happen but it's when all of the names in the Lamb's Book of Life are dipped in the blood amen they're redeemed then the Rapture is going to go so so what what is the devil going to do he's going to try and Inspire us to stop the Rapture happening cuz God works through man all right I just want you to think about this deep why are we here well I've got family I've got family I got to raise them absolutely I've got a job all all those things but why are we here what's the purpose of our being you see I've got a lot of plans in life that's fine but where's God in those plans Where's God in the plans amen so we can't allow the enemy to to control us that actually the Rapture is hindered yeah amen I trust you're thinking deep about these things you say well what have I got to do just surrender to the word of the Lord let him live through your life live an everyday Christian Life be salti on you come across that's you fulfilling the Great Commission I thought I was going to Ecuador and preaching the gospel and all these things it can be but it's living an everyday Christian Life where people can see you may be having a bad day but there's something different about you why cuz Christ is on the inside amen amen so so here was this make believer trying to stop trying to stop the trying to stop the prophecy be fulfilled this is why we've got to let God live more and more because brother brah says that National Force put Israel into Israel put Israel back right and it's putting the world churches into the World Council of churches but the power of God will put the bride in Christ amen the power of God Amen so we've got to let the power of God move more than ever before we need him to move more than ever before am mean the enemy's coming like a flood say Lord You've risen a standard amen you're here but Lord I need you I need you to anoint my life to wash all the enemy out and things the devil tries to put in us through the week and be Washed by the Water of the word you know Lord I I need a touch of your spirit Lord I'm hungry for more of you oh God Amen but the hindrance of that as well we got everything just fine it's all calmed down now we're mature you know you know it's it's amazing maturity David was anointed king I don't know how old he was but maybe he's he's probably older than me I don't know but the Ark of God was coming into his City he was an adopted son of God anointed by God and he began to dance he probably danced like that maybe he never danced like that in his whole life I don't know maybe he didn't dance on that as a young person anointed by the prophet amen but he came to a place in his life where he saw the word restored in his life that which had been lost was now being restored amen and he began to dance he began to Rejoice amen it meant more to him probably then that it did in the beginning Hallelujah but he he said oh but you're a king you're too see Saul Saul's daughter looked out the window and saw him and said you are acting the wrong way you should be more mature you should be setting a good example and he was he was showing a good example amen amen because he created an atmosphere cuz it just came out of his heart how great God was and God's mercy was so rich in his life that God would allow his ark to come into His City amen that God brought it in there he began to dance he began to Rejoice hallelujah amen he set the right example amen you say well we shouldn't be like that Miriam was over 80 years old yes Miriam was over 80 years old I wish I had a tambourine but you know she was over 80 years old amen and when she saw her enemy drown am mean in the in the Red Sea she took out the tambourine she began to dance she began to rejoice and she was leading all the other sisters of Israel amen rejoicing dancing on the River Bank Hallelujah she was a real believer hallelujah amen so she did not let oh I'm too old I got this pain who cares about that God's God we should let nothing hinder us amen from worshiping Our God if we feel the desire by the Holy Spirit to dance let's dance if we feel just sit and cry cry don't hold it in let it out whatever what however it comes out let it out amen if it's God it's a it's an order hallelujah oh but things can get a bit wild and things can that's too a bit Pentecostal I used to be in a Pentecostal Church they did not even believe in raising their hands so I don't know what Pentecostal people are trying to say but I know the genuine Pentecostal of Acts chapter 2 I mean where Liberty comes into your life because God has sealed you into the kingdom with his holy ghost he's cleansed You by his blood amen he set you at Liberty amen he said you're my child amen you're here to fulfill the word you belong to me and I'm not letting you go I know that kind of a liberty Hallelujah so I think we should just rejoice in that more Hallelujah John would see the book open in the book of you know he was lifted up before the throne room he saw the lamb come forth and take the book Hallelujah everything heard him shout and praise God Amen John represents you right well my shouts not very loud what however if you're lad just praise God hey I don't know why I got off on that but you know we got to see the devil wants to take the Cry Of Joy from our lives he wants us to just to have a memory of what could be but he never thinks we can go back to that he never thinks that we can have a victory dance again he never thinks see I mean he always wants us to think that way right see so yes it was there but it's just too far away and you just can't no he's the same God he's the same one the same one that called you will keep you the same one that keeps you is leading you amen so we can Rejoice the same God oh I wish I had that Joy again you can you can have that cry of Joy again amen it's not gone forever it's not even really that far away amen amen amen but you see the make believer doesn't want that to be fulfilled he wants everything just to be controlled see Judas we know see the difference between Judas as I said and Peter well one Peter went to Peter went to Pentecost but then also Peter could be corrected by the word all right now there came a came a time when Mary was inspired by God she was a she was led to take this ointment of Spike now the very costly um perfume and anoint the feet of Jesus one place is Anointed her she anointed his head right and she anointed him for burial see the Lord allowed her to do it because the Lord knew that he was he was my bride anointing me to fulfill the next part of my word that's right amen that's why it's so important we praise God and anoint him with our praise we anoint him with our love amen we wash his feet with our tears of Thanksgiving and a genuine heartfelt love of what he's done for us why because you anoint the word for what he's going to do next amen so so um you know they were they were there and see maybe we'll go to Matthew first sorry cuz I actually got these around the wrong way see but when his disciples saw it they had indignation saying to what purpose is this waste so all them were offended Mary what are you doing what are you doing in church Mary why are you anointing the word like this why are you why are you this so much effort so much giving of your life and all this all this you know why are you doing this Mary it's such a waste they fill with ignation but you see the Lord didn't say that and they saying you know we could we could sell this give it to the poor and we can do all these kind of things but then when Jesus understood it you see he sat there and then a revelation struck him about what she was actually doing and and he said unto them why trouble ye the woman she hath wrought a good work upon me for ye have the poor always with you but me ye have not always for and that she hath poured the this ointment on my body she did it for my burial right amen and then now they're all filled with indignation but then 11 of the disciples received that correction and then John you say well where did this ignation come from it came from somewhere it came from an influence came from the influence of a make believer trying to control everything because we know the Gospel of John was under that eagle anointing prophetic anointing where where Matthew it just says they all were like this but then John is inspired to write the source of this indignation it came from Judas it spr spread on the others see make believing spirit always wants to be popular always wants to have preeminence it doesn't it's not willing just to be part of the furniture or the you know like David said I'd rather just be the doormat or or the dant of the house of God he was a real believer he says I'm happy wherever God wants me to be praise God as long as I'm part of God's economy right but it make believer isn't that way it wants to it wants to dominate it wants to take control It Wants to Rule right this is what Judas was doing and he and and he would he would tell his um he this indignation I believe came from him and then John when he was inspired to write of the same scene he said it was Judas that said why was not this ointment sold for 300 p and given to the poor but then John was also the only one who said but he was a thief so a make believer will use the vehicle of the church to get something they'll try and gain something they will always it's always for their own personal gain oh I need some fellowship we all need Fellowship oh I need some encouragement we all need encouragement right but they'll come they'll get what they want and they'll disappear for a while where have they gone you know and then a make believer will always come to a point of conviction because we all did right where there's a choice we either surrender Our Lives completely to the Lord and let him take over or we go back into the Wilderness again and you see a make believer will always I call them also a borderline believer they come up to the borderline they'll come up to Jordan they'll come up to that death to South but yet they'll never cross unless God does something they won't cross the Jordan they won't take their opportunity they won't take their time like Joshua when he when they were Crossing Jordan you know he said look uh put the ark into the river it will part the part the waters then we can cross over dry land there was an opportunity for everyone in that moment to Cross Jordan you had to walk across you know Mom and Dad could say look kids we're Crossing Jordan we're going to our inheritance the kids had to walk too Grandma had to come you you all had to say if we were let's just go back there for a second we all would have to say I'm crossing the Jordan there where God has ordained it I have a choice I'm either going to stay in the wilderness or I'm going to go here I've been in the wilderness for 40 years so I know what I'm used to this see people make Believers get used to going around the mountain again they get comfortable in this thing they're not willing to fully surrender and I believe God will give an opportunity so we don't we don't ride anyone off right but you see there is there are seasons where God deals there are seasons of repentance there's Seasons when God puts his finger on someone's life and says now's your time it's not when we chooses when he chooses there's certain seasons in life and a make believer will actually say I'm not ready no one wants to die but a Believer will say Lord I just can't stop walking forward I can't stop walking with you Lord hallelujah in spite of everything Lord I'm coming you you called me to come Lord you called me to die you called me to surrender my life Lord I'm here I'm here Lord hallelujah so a real believer will will will will cross in the season of course God gives other Seasons but take advantage of your season whatever you do amen don't don't don't B the B God away don't say now is not the time now is the day of salvation now is the time I know how many people we would know that that that if they could go back in time that' change their decision they'd say Lord yes I'm coming Lord I'm willing to lose everything to gain you lord it's not worth it to hold on to anything amen but it's worth it all to take him and say Lord take me by the heart take me by the hand Lord and Lead Me Cross Jordan into all of your blessings Lord Jesus Hallelujah there are seasons brother brah tells a story of a Deacon's daughter brother Braham was inspired to call her out she doesn't come forward doesn't give her life God's dealing with her and then brother Ram goes out the church and she says you embarrass me don't ever do that again not long after that brother Bram saw her on the street drinking doing all kinds of stuff and she said you know when you called me that was my last chance amen and he said she said my my heart is so hard and now I could see my the soul of my mother burn in hell and I'd laugh she crossed she didn't take her season she didn't take her season if she took her season but Pride see this is the problem of of religious Pride it thinks it's be you it gets offended when God says come see if God's see we should be sensitive enough to the holy ghost that no matter who God is dealing with dealing through we can say yes Lord yes Lord just like our's said God was working through a 2-year-old he took it that was his answer to prayer he was a real he's a real believer right he was a make believer for a long time sorry brother Kus but you know he became a real believer he wasn't offended by how God was working so we must never ever get offended by how God calls we got to take advantage of our season you say well I'm young I wish I met God a lot younger amen God started calling me when I was 11 I wish somehow God I got caught up in Sp I got caught up in everything I wanted to be Danny Morrison I know I've Shar these things before most of you don't know that era of cricket I wanted to be him fast baller New Zealand let's take the umpire's head off when he's B bowling forward all these things I wanted to be you know I wanted to be johy rhods as a as a as a Fielder all that Martin Crow all those ones I I got so caught up in these things that that voice got got got hushed but Glory you may run You Can't Hide You may run from the call of God you may run all of your life but don't wait for a deathbed confession when you could spend every life every moment of your life being a testimony shaking the kingdom of Hell causing a lot of damage to his minions and causing a lot of damage to what he's done and and letting God use you to bring healing and salvation and deliverance to people don't wait for a deathbed confession of a being a m believer all your life and say well I know I thought this and I was right here but you come to a point say Lord I'm wrong don't wait for them why not today why not now why say God I mean business today God God you're meaning business with me I I want to me business with you Hallelujah the Lord hallelujah but you see now Judas got offended it was after that moment where where the bride Anointed The word for the next part of what's going to fulfill that he went to betray the Lord he got offended make believer got offended and he left he knew where Jesus was going to be in the garden he knew all where the disciples all those things he was a make believer he didn't go to Pentecost see it's a terrible thing to think of unbelief I was going to drop this in here your Eternal destination rests upon your faith and your action speak so loud that your words can't be heard your attitude towards the things of God see Peter's attitude part of it was right part of it was wrong we know thou the Christ they tried to hinder what God was doing you see but then he came to a point where he you know God God dealt with him until he came to a Pentecost he became a real believer now the make believer can can can seem so right cor and daythan would stand up one day against Moses I just threw a picture in there and they would say you take too much upon yourself we're all holy they were actually rising up against God's given office of Moses and then so now Moses would say well we'll see who's on whose side you get your 250 princes men every now you get your senses all these things and if God do a new you if you just die a natural death or if your life doesn't change in any way God's not on my side but if he do a new thing and the Earth opens up and swallows you you'll know who side is who's on and what happened the Earth opened up swallowed them up by the Earth and how many people let's I I know this is rough but the world opens up and swallows people make Believers rise up I've I've come across people that they've got a a spirit that wants to dominate you actually sense it the spirit of them wants to take control I've I've been in the presence of seems like sincere Believers but they want to take there's a spirit that wants to dominate and something in me says you're not going to win here boy amen that Spirit not welcome here amen but you see they they rose up and the Earth swallowed them but the thing is the people were so come under the influence of cor and Dayan that they actually said to Aaron and against Moses ye have killed the people of the Lord that's how that's how controlling and how real a make-believing spirit can be they didn't say thank you Lord you spared us that we're not SW up by the Earth thank you Lord that you brought us out from under the influence of those men who are trying to stop the program of God cuz if they had their way Joshua would not have been in Church Joshua would not have taken them over the over the Jordan I mean they wouldn't have been placing their inheritance where they would been stuck in the wilderness you see and that's what a make believing Spirit wants to keep people in the wilderness Cross Jordan meet God hallelujah walk with him but you see it was so murky in their minds they they said you have killed the people of the Lord they weren't God's people God proved whose side was who was on I don't mean that as a joke I just want you to think about it now the devil I'm just going to keep going through these things so I really want those immune cells of the Holy Ghost to attach thing and kill things we can walk in Liberty amen and we can shake off the burden of the enemy and be children of God like we're ordained to be amen you see because the devil's the ultimate make believer he's the ultimate make believer see his own selfish will caused him to become what he became he was not content with what God made him to be and then but he believes he's not an atheist like when he came to Eve he he didn't say God isn't real he said yeah ha God said and he quoted scripture against her right so but trying to get dominance now but you see a make believer does not come to God unconditionally see a real believer says you can have your way Jesus amen that's where Peter came to a point in his life because he went through all the hardships and and the humiliations and all those things that God would deal with him take the make believer out of him to that that his heart just became you can have it your way Jesus I'm not here to hinder you anymore Lord I'm sorry for getting in the way Lord amen see because that's the heart of a real believer you see but you see the Devil is a ultimate make believer and a make believer comes to God upon condition always condition so he would come to Jesus in the wilderness if thou be the Son of God turn these stones into bread what's he doing God I want you to prove yourself this way I want you to answer my prayer how I want it that's what he's saying that's what he's saying he's not saying Lord You're King you can do what you want in this moment Lord You're the creator of heavens and earth you can do what you want he says no if you're really God you got to prove it how I want you to prove it Thomas was a make believer too he did the same thing he said unless I put my hand in his side and and you know feel the nail prints and think things I won't believe it Thomas was a m believer he didn't say that way right he became a real believer but you see the devil doesn't want to become a real believer because if he became a real believer he would have to acknowledge he is wrong he ain't going to do that a make believer who's only going to be a make believer will never acknowledge they are wrong so he wanted to so he says if thou be do this you know people say well you know I'll only serve God if he does this for me imine job standing here it's say friends he's God he made you he gave you life in your body he's got a heaven to give you am mean he's died on Calvary for you he's redeemed you by his blood he made all things the only reason you have life in your body in a sound mind is because he's allowed it that's what he would say he would say you know because when when job came down to his crunch point he said though he slay me yet I'll trust him that's it that's a real believer though he slay me though my life becomes a complete train wreck I'll trust him I'm going to walk with him anyway am me that was see that's a real believer amen he say well I've got to put a fleece out because you know I need to put fleeces out you know Gideon got the Revelation that he was going to deliver Israel before he put fleeces out many people do it vice versa and this may sound a bit strong but that's kind of Witchcraft it's a bit no it's wrong see Gideon got the Revelation you're a mighty man of Valor you're going to deliver Israel the angel of the Lord came to him before this right and he says well then he but then so but then he put flees out for God to confirm what the Revelation already was not he didn't put fleeces out and then the angel came to him so we don't want to put fleeces out without there first being a revelation in your heart right we don't want to do that because this is a make believer no forget okay just imagine Gideon's putting the fleece out without the god visiting him beforehand he's he's he's making God answer his prayer based on how he wants it answered but you see Gideon had a visitation of the Angel so it's different do are we all together class amen we'll understand this right so it's nothing wrong with putting out a fleece but make sure it's a revelation in here first make sure that you know the voice of God and you know his leadership in your life amen amen hallelujah now we're running out of time so let's just let's just let's just go for a real some real Believers Hallelujah let's just go for some I love these guys hallelujah hallelujah you know hallelujah we're going to we're going to dance with them around the throne the Lord you know they would say but we were just serving God they say but your testimony Hallelujah your testimony gave me courage your testimony gave me strength amen because if you could stand in a foreign land without the baptism of the Holy Ghost without the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ without a church to go to without a preacher to preach to without an end time Messenger to preach to without the book coming open if you could stand in that condition hallelujah amen that I said I can stand amen I can stand hallelujah amen and I stood because you stood Hallelujah you stood Hallelujah so I could stand Hallelujah Hallelujah to the lamb hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you see a make believer says well God can do it but if he doesn't I'm not quitting I'm not bowing I'm not compromising amen I'm not I'm not saying God you better do this otherwise I'm going to quit no when they walked out of Jerusalem as young people amen they said them and Daniel said we're going to serve God Amen how are we going to do it I don't know but we're going to do it how are we going to overcome lady OA I don't know well actually by the blood of the Lamb Word of Our Testimony but we're going to overcome I me what about the situation I don't know but God's going to come on the scene hallelujah hallelujah amen so they made up their minds as young people amen we're going to serve God wherever we go we're going to make a stand and come what me that's it sorry we're doing it that's a real believer Hallelujah there's no record of them feeling the anointing of God there's no record of them being filled with the Holy GH ghost like David you know the spirit of God was with him from that time on when he was anointed there's no record of that but to me a Believer shows his colors in spite of what they feel what they don't feel what they're going on the believer comes out and says I believe God and God is greater than this idol God is greater than you King Nebuchadnezzar great God is greater than this world system I find myself in and I'm not bowing to this I'm walking on Hallelujah and but they didn't even know that the fourth man was going to show up they didn't know that they said well we're not we're not bowing whatever you do Nebuchadnezzar we ain't bowing amen they were not going to bow to the image of a prophet I mean they were going to bow to a false image of the word and say no we're going to serve the true and living God we're not going to about because Nebuchadnezzar was a make believer he was a Believer but he was a make believer God dealt with him he was God's servant but he was a make believer well he put up an image that was wrong this is how the message is meant to be a dead Idol we don't serve a dead Idol amen we serve a true and living God Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen hallelujah Lord amen they got thrown in that furnace they had testimony with the one that they stood with Hallelujah God began to tell them the things that they would they would accomplish and walk with in the future amen but they were real believers they didn't say God if you save us then we're going to serve you see there their them following God was not based on what God would do for them in the future it was got nothing to do with well God if you restore this if you do this then I'm going to be a Christian no they came unconditionally they were serving God unconditionally I mean God whatever happens I'm here I'm a Believer I want to be identified as a believer I'm to be identified with your word I'm standing for your word and here I am amen hallelujah I like that amen we're going to have a jubilee with him hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen praise God we're going to Blind bmus was a Believer there's something about a belie see see the devil's guns are against us because he doesn't want God to live he doesn't want he doesn't mind us quoting the message he doesn't mind us quoting the Bible what he Minds is when that message and the Bible be becomes flesh that's what the devil hates amen when God puts on flesh that's when he tries to destroy the vessel that God has tabernacled in amen but you've got to realize the one who's called you church should call you I say even the prophet didn't call you no the voice behind the voice God himself called you to himself amen the Lord himself called you and commissioned you to walk this walk hallelujah amen amen so the so the world always tries to to keep the real believer still this what the make believer does tries to keep keep the real believer still but that didn't stop B there's something in the believer I'm just going to close with this thought because we feel like I just feel like we've running out of time and my May Sig Wang to something else we'll continue maybe another time the world will try and stop you a religious spirit will try and stop you don't praise God don't sing don't raise your hands don't testify don't Rejoice don't be happy keep it all to yourself that's what the world tries to do amen but it won't stop you amen it won't stop you it may try and stop you but it can't stop you amen so all all of the crowd that was around Jesus amen and they were making some of them were mocking him some were praising him some were doing all kinds of things and Jesus was on his heart was he's going to Calvary and then blind bmus heard heard the commotion outside Jericho's Gates amen and he began to ask a question what is this noise I've never heard this noise before and that's why when you come among Believers there's a different kind of a sound am mean there's a different kind of a sound it's not a mournful maybe one day you can God it's a thank you Lord I'm saved thank you Lord I'm redeemed thank you Lord you've opened your word to me thank you Lord you've called me from the open book amen there's a different kind of a sound from believer's lips am mean and and and he heard that kind of a sound he says what is this what is going on and someone said bmus Jesus of Nazareth is passing by and he had heard of this Lord Jesus and what happened is all he knew his child teachings that there was still a Jehovah God somewhere that God was still a deliverer and he realized that that same God that he heard about his mom tell him about was passing by his way and he took his moment amen he took his moment and his faith touched the master and the word says that Jesus Stood Still yeah now our lord Jesus I'm going to wrap up with this thought our lord Jesus has been walking through seven Church ages right the son of man has been walking through seven Church ages right but we we have the opportunity today to make him stand still and that that he can meet our need in our life we have an opportun see church is opportunities church is moments right so because bamas was a real believer the world telling him to be quiet because he cried out Jesus Son of you know son of David have mercy and people trying to stop his worship trying to stop his prayer trying to stop him calling on God but that didn't stop him he said well if that if they're going to try and stop me I'm just going to get a little bit louder and it was actually his faith that touched the Lord am me but his faith was manifested in his works as cry so in closing I'll just summarize this okay a real believer okay we start with the unbeliever the unbeliever say all three love the supernatural they love the blessings of God but the unbeliever when the word comes open they're gone they're not even wanting to sit around and see what is this all about does it actually marry up with the Bible or not is it actually scripture fulfilled they're not interested they're gone the make believer will hang around longer than that but they want themselves to have dominance over the word of God and they're actually waiting for a loophole something that they find is an error and they want to use that error to control that's what Judas Judas basically said I'm going to stop this whole thing I'm going to control this this guy who says he's the Messiah he's out of control he's out of hand that's why he went to betray him I'm going to stop this whole thing see he wanted to have dominance and he wasn't corrected by the word so he went and did it so the make believer will always have their own opinion above the word of God and they will dictate to God how they want God to work in their life that's how we go to Baum all kinds of ones through the Bible but the real believer comes unconditionally to God yes my Lord they are not interested I mean they're they're not there to say God if you do this then I'll serve you they have no pre-existing conditions they say God here I am here I stand Lord do what you want to do in my life change me Lord your word is right and I am wrong amen your word is true and I'm false amen your word is eternal and my opinion doesn't matter and they're willing to surrender their whole lives say Lord may your word take control of my life amen so that's the three I just asked you the question where are you in this remember God wants to make us all real Believers we start as unbelievers we then we continue as make Believers I was I was making Homebrew reading the Bible getting drunk partying listening to rock and roll and in town and clubs and all the stuff listening to the message I was I W wasn't a real believer I was a m believer because my own will was I want to keep my friend friends but I want the Lord at the same time I want to keep my circle of people so my own human world was actually take was greater than God in my life but there came a time where God said hey you got to come now you can't keep this up amen you know you're miserable you know you're not enjoying this you know you're just actually being torn in two come to me and I'll give you rest I'll change you Lord I'll change you now became a real believer Hallelujah 17 years ago in September you see praise God so which one of you today maybe let's have the musicians come please let's just finish there i' I'd be like God make me a real believer that my human Spirit does not stop you being God in my life see God is God but you got to let him be God like brother and Paul said we must let God be God Amen in our lives when we let him be God let him be king not just savior not just someone to to you know do you know be a be an Aron boy but be the Lord and savior of our life amen amen let's stand shall we amen let's stand let's just bow our heads and let's pray let's pray this is a serious moment amen let's just bow our heads and if anyone wants to be remembered in prayer hallu amen raise your hand to the

Believers Lord father we lord we may be like Peter before Pentecost Lord we we may be like that kind of a make believer but Lord bring us to a place Lord if if there's anyone here who has not had a
