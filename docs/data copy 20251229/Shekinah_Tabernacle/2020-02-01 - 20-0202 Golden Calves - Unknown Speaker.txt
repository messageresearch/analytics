bless you everyone thank you for the ED thank you musicians amen have your way in me amen hallelujah Aven god bless you all it's great to have you on here this morning let's just go to the scriptures I've got a well a bit of a slideshow but it's not gonna I don't see burning no earlier here so anyway um you just throw that up let's go to first Kings chapter 11 and I want to I've been kind of off and on speaking about you know identifying the Antichrist spirit and um it's you know if we can discern and withstand that into our spirit then the the bride will be an invincible army so I just want to kind of keep in that kind of vein of thought yeah let's go we are we honor we offer we where are we first first Kings chapter 11 and we're going to read from verse 26 I don't have the entire thing up but I just want to show a couple of diagrams more than anything but let's go to first Kings 11 in 26 and and Jeroboam the son of Nebat and if if a night of Rida Solomon's servant whose mother's name was as Errol would a woman when he lifted up his hand against the king and this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the King Solomon built me low and repaired the breaches of the City of David his father and the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of Valor and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph and it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem that the prophet Elijah the Sheila night found him in the way and equal anyway he had cleared himself with a new government and they too were alone in the field in a higher court the new garment that was on who had rented in 12 pieces and said to Joe balm take the 10 pieces for thus said the Lord the God of Israel behold I'll rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and will give 10 tribes to thee but he shall have one tribe for my servant David sake and for Jerusalem's sake the city which I've chosen out of all the tribes of Israel because that they have forsaken me and have worship Astaroth the goddess of the sidonians she washed the god of the moabites and milcom the god of the children of Ammon and have not walked in my ways to do that which is right in my eyes to keep my statutes and my judgments as did David his father how bid I'll not take the whole kingdom out of his hand but I will make him a prince all the days of his life for David my servants sake whom I chose because he kept my Commandments in my statutes and I will take the kingdom out of his son's hands and will give it unto thee even ten tribes now this just dropped down to the next chapter chapter 12 we're gonna read from verse 25 and we're just going to read down to verse 33 here it says then Jeroboam so now he's been made kingly the the you know that he's now king over the ten tribes the Israel is divided into two kingdoms now then Jeremiah built Shechem and Mount Ephraim and dwelt therein and went out from thence and built pineal and Jeroboam said in his heart now notice is reasoning now she held the kingdom returned to the house of David if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord of Jerusalem then shall the heart of this people turn again unto the Lord even as a real bomb the king of Judah and Asia kill me and go again to Rio Bom king of Judah whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold and said unto Him it is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem behold thy God's o Israel what's brought thee up out of the land of Egypt and he sent he set the one in Bethel and the other he put and an and this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before one even unto Dan and he made an house of high places and made priests of the last of the people which were not the sons of Levi and Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month like under the feast that is in Judah and he offered upon the altar so he did and Bethel sacrificing unto the calves that he had made and placed and Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made so he offered unto thee I mean upon the altar which he made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the 8th month even in the month which he had devised of his own heart and ordained to feast and unto the children of Israel and he offered upon the altar and burnt incense I mean made the Lord bless his word you may have your seats this morning I want to speak about three places we have in the scripture notice Jeroboam he he built a golden he built two golden calves I'm going to take this a bit slow than maybe we'll see if we change gear but he he made two golden calves he put one and Bethel he put the other and Dan but the third place is Jerusalem now this man Jeroboam it's amazing he was yo all day in profit went to him said you could have you're gonna be king over ten tribes but who knows in his mind he began to form a plan how can I keep control of the people now this is the greatest curse that can come upon a group of people as we in the ministry in their own mind try and hold on to them and they try and join the people to the ministry as opposed to the Word of God and this is what Jeroboam was doing he was thinking in his mind how can I bind the people that they will not go worship with God has ordained them to worship because he was worried that the people he said as we just read that that the people would go worship and Jerusalem and the influence of rear bomb would come upon them and in the would kill him and and and the kingdom would go back to Rio Bom but the thing is that remember God ordained a place of worship and we're going to go into that soon but you know God would say in Deuteronomy you will worship and the gate right put my name now we know that Jesus is the gate he is the door so the true place to worship is in Jesus Christ and we'll come to that but I just want to show you that this is what people have done is that is that men have have risen up and this is many more you know I'm speaking about our age that we live and men have risen up under their own devices to actually use the word of God to bind people to themselves as opposed to uniting them with Christ you know as the Apostle Paul he he his burden was you know that I travailed until Christ be formed in you he says I've espoused you to one husband which is Christ the Lord you know he had no interest of binding people to himself he even warned that men would rise up binding people to to their own selves and this is the greatest curse that can come as where since their people can begin to worship God but then an antichrist spirit comes in to take the worship from the people that that should be to God and actually put it upon a man remember we are not married to William Branham I mean we are not married to this church this the name of this church is irrelevant we are united to Jesus Christ the word brother Brown would say at the end of his ministry says we are following the church across the nation because you're the dressing you know churches through the telephone hookup he says we are following Jesus Christ the word right and it's the same thing today we are still following Jesus Christ the Living Word so Jeroboam II he decides he's gonna put these two calves and it's amazing wait maybe I don't want to do that let's just now I don't know if you can see this very well but this is a map of this is the map of Israel where the twelve tribes settled and I've put the scripture here that we read he see he set one and Bethel and he put the other one in there now this is very significant as as I'll show you but I want to keep in your mind that that here is here is Jerusalem and Benjamin and I kind of like that on a side note anyway I like that anyway anyway so he put what and then and the other and Bethel so if you do your research you'll find out well Dan of course here's the tribe of Dan but Bethel is actually in Ephraim and it's actually on the border between Benjamin and and Ephraim and originally actually Joshua gave gave where Bethel was to the tribe of Benjamin but then Ephraim invaded and and they took the place but it's amazing when you look into it where Bethel was only about 15 miles north of Jerusalem so close so close to where God put his name but it's too far to go and you may have journeyed from Asher all the way up here you've done in it and then instead of going here you come here so people get so close but you know what happens is we're going to understand a golden calf as man's ideas fashioned into a God and people take the Word of God because remember an antichrist spirit can only pervert what God has already put forth so an antichrist spirit comes a man takes quotes and scriptures and quotes and scriptures quotes and scriptures and and the conclusion of what their what their argument is not what the prophets said it's not what the Word of God said and they're fashioned in Idol and they say here is the God that the prophet followed but you find out the life that was then the Prophet is not in the people well and that is a proof that what they're worshiping is not actually the word it's actually men's ideas that have been formed into a formed into a golden calf so now this is member if you can discern withstand the Antichrist spirit because remember it's the ones that are most close to the truth that use the quotes dress right maybe even act right but no life and it's a golden calf worship now I will read this now this isn't Deuteronomy 16 I just want to read this here maybe just read it from the screen so our technology in me we found out we're not good friends no season Deuteronomy 16 so this is where brother Branham would preach God's chosen place of worship he says observe the month of Abbot which is April and keep the Passover under the Lord thy God and the month of a bird the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night thou shalt therefore sacrifice the Passover and the LORD thy God of the flock in the hood and the place which the Lord shall choose two places named this they had specific instructions don't just worship anywhere where I've put my name there's where your worship thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it seven days shalt thou not eat a leavened bread there worth even the bread of affliction for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt and hast that thou mayst remember the day when thou comest for that land of Egypt all the days of thy life and there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coasts seven days neither that shall there be anything of the flesh which they'll sacrifice us the first day and even remain all night until the morning thou mayst not sacrifice the Passover within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee but but at the place where the LORD thy God shall choose two places namin there thou shalt sacrifice the Passover even at the going down of the Sun at the season without Commerce forth out of Egypt this is very specific instruction don't worship any gate doesn't matter how pretty the Gators how great the churches how wonderful the music is how great the people are worship God where he put his name and he put his name in his son Jesus Christ which is the word I mean so that's why that's why I wanted to put that in there because now we know Jerusalem even Jesus would say to the woman at the well they'll come a day where people won't worship here no more but the father seeketh into worship God in spirit and truth so now when I'm talking about Jerusalem I'm not talking about a geographical location I talk about where God has put his name in his word right in the revelation of the hour now this is this is what Jesus just he did John John for if you need a reference now this is the this is how the children of Israel they were this is their formation when they traveled after Mount Sinai you know they built the tabernacle in the wilderness and this is how the twelve tribes would march and they were in a formation which which was representing a pattern which is in heaven now we know that the that the ark here I mean so the Ark of the testimony here was was you know the Ark of the Covenant and the tabernacle and then the tribes were camped around in a certain order and there was around each of these so in these each groups there's one tribe over the other two so here a frame was in charge of the west side and then Dan was in charge of the north and and due to the east and then Reuben the South and what this shows is now there's always been the way to the Tree of Life has always been guarded the way to it if you read in Genesis you know it says that God placed a cherubim with the flaming sword it says to protect the way not to protect the tree of life but to protect the way to the Tree of Life so the access has always been guarded right and and we know that you know the scripture you know even you know when brother Bram here would he would speak about Matthew 28:19 baptized in the name of the Father Son and the Holy Ghost he says that's a gospel God because many people trip over they miss out that one word name the Prophet you see well what's the name father's not a name sons not a name Holy Ghost is not a name and you can read through church history and it's been documented very well that the Catholic Church or pre Catholic Church they change the baptism from the name of Lord Jesus Christ to the titles of God father son Holy Ghost it's very well documented right so so now he says that's a gospel guard stopping people actually stopping people walk into the way to go into the Tree of Life and so now we have and then you go to the Book of Ezekiel I'm not going to go through it but there's the cherubim said Ezekiel sees they have a face of a lion lion ox man and an eagle and then you come down through down to the book of Revelation and John sees the same cherubims but in the Book of Ezekiel they only have they have wheels showing that the that the Gospels and transition but then when when john sees it they don't have wheels no more because now it's it's actually fixed in its place the the axis the arc is finished moving because now it's the word of god manifested but that's a whole nother thing but when i throw that in there but what we have now is well i always get things mixed up so just you don't mind me just go and slow now so Dan so this as I see it as the there's actually the four cherubims guarding the way to the Tree of Life so now what we have is we have Ruben is that into fighters a man we know that the for their faith bills are at the face of a man and then Judah of course is the lion 'iframe as the ox now I'm speaking about these things as these things were going to bring out why did Jeroboam put the golden calf and Dan and Annie frame and we showed that the devil uses the same thing against believers today and then now always missed the fourth one we have in den was the Eagle which is the pattern of the cherubims and so this was built in such a way now I just want to highlight this so when he put in Bethel he put 1:1 cherubim I mean sorry he put one golden calf Jeroboam did he put one and den which is the Eagle Eagle anointing he put a golden calf he set it up I'm gonna go through these but I'm just gonna give you an overview then we're gonna break it down he put one and the prophetic word of the hour he put a golden calf and the open word he put a golden calf and said of the people going to Jerusalem I wonder you think about this and then he put the other one in II frame and he frame symbol as an ox so he put a golden calf ox as a beast of burden so the people's works he put a golden calf there that people will worship their own works above going actually to Jerusalem but the RAM no I don't know if I have this I don't have it on the slide but but he says this he says this in the paradox and this is paradox in 1965 17th of January he says you have to you do have something into it that's your surrender of your own world your own ideas to the will and idea of Almighty God and that's finished that's all there is just take his promise don't think of nothing else walk by it and God does the rest of it then they wanted a law and God always gives you the desire of your heart he promised to but we find out when they turned one step from the side of what God really promised them then that was a thorn and the flesh until the law was taken away until Jesus Christ came and was crew crucified to take away the law it was a thorn in the flesh and anything you try and do within yourself it'll always work to your dishonor it'll work to your disadvantage just simply believe God that settles that what God promised on the law by God who heals all my by diseases see if there is any among you sick let them call the elders of the church he promised the works that he did would be done in his church why do we have to accept organizations and so forth that will write them off of the off of the book see it becomes a thorn and the flesh and here at the end time we meet the same thing again face to face that's up to the Methodists Baptists Presbyterians what more see you can't go on you've got to come back to the entire Full Gospel right it was made for the full man by a complete God who was made flesh and dwelt among us and we know that those things are true now if you notice then their journey in the wilderness is where they've got their greatest mistake that has ever made until Calvary was when in Exodus 19 they accepted lore instead of grace they had grace they had a prophet they had a sacrificial lamb they had Redemption they had brought through the Red Sea they had been healed of their diseases they had water from the smitten Rock they had manner out of heaven everything that need of had been supplied but they still wanted something else and he says as a thorn Creed's and dogmas as a thorn in the flesh now we can go to this just now I want to know this now the son of Jeroboam was a curse to Israel and it caused them to leave the land and we'll get let's just go to 2nd Kings and we're gonna read that 2nd Kings chapter 17 and to me it's one of the saddest things you say well thou just under the blood of bulls and goats but yet God had provided them a word and if they even just in their own humanity kept that word they would have been victorious now he's given us more than just the blood of bulls and goats now he's given us a power that can change our nature I mean it's not just an outward keeping of a law but God can come in and change our nature that now we are living his word out because it's in us already right I'll write their laws my laws in their hearts and they shall do them right it's not us doing it it's him doing it in us now second King 17 and we're just going to go down to verse verse 19 and you know it's such a tragedy you say well we're under the blood of Jesus Christ these same tragedies can still happen and they have happened and I pray they stop happening seeking King 17 we're gonna read from verse I believe I said nineteen also Judah you can read the whole this yo yo this whole chapter but and also Judah kept not the commandments of the Lord their God but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made and the Lord rejected all the seed of Israel and afflicted them and delivered them into the hand of the spoilers until he cast them out of his sight for inna Israel from the house of David and they made your Obama the son of Nebat King and Jeroboam drivers Ralph from following the Lord and made them sinner great sin for the children of Israel walked in all the ways of Jeroboam which he did they departed not from them until the Lord removed Israel out of his sight as he had said by all of his servants the prophets so was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria and to this day so because of the sin these golden calves it's too much for you to go to Jerusalem just worship here worship this man's made idea it was a sin and it caused them to leave the land so they left the Word of God completely they were driven from it there out of the promise completely because they worship these golden calves instead of worshiping God and spurred on and truth in the place where God put his name now we see if you know as as Jeroboam placer placed a golden calf any frame as I said he frames symbol as an ox the beast of burden it's a man's works you know we know even the four Gospels are written according to the four for your anointings and you take the book of Mark and it just goes straight into Christ's works it's under that ox anointing and people won't actually make a golden calf out of there own ability to keep the Word of God they will they will judge their their their their Christian walk by maybe how long their dresses are how maybe loose fitting their clothes are nothing wrong with those things you know they'll judge by how long they read how long they pray how much they'd listen how much they witness how much they come to church and they will gauge their and then how much their families in line and your conformity to the word and they will judge their Christian walk by those standards but both of em says at the end of his ministry he says we're not saved by measuring stick but saved by grace a divine influence upon the heart and it's reflection in the life and so people will make a golden calf out of their own works and that's the problem when people begin to look at look at what I've achieved look what I have done and even they may say well it's God's grace but in their hearts they say no it's me and my determination and I'm gonna do it and I'm going to serve the Lord it's good to have a determination but you got to give it over to God but he's going to take that design let her manifest themselves through it it's not you doing it remember we will never take a rapture by our own ability even by our own desire and enthusiasm our own ambition it will never get us there it's God revealing us worth sovereignty to your soul and him quickening your mortal body I mean by the spirit already in you that's the only way it can happen right but they but he he did not want them to go to Jerusalem to worship member where Jerusalem and Jerusalem was the ark and Jerusalem was the presence of God where people could really worship but but Jeroboam didn't want to want them to go there now that's just that's we say that's very Elementary it is Elementary but then when we come in to Dan as the more subtle things and we can and now when brother Brown said when the when the seals came open the eagle began to fly so the so the man agent 19 came to an end and then the eagle anointing came upon the church so there's a dispensational change when the book came open amen now under the under the yo when the word came open now that so so the church is to be under this prophetic anointing where the word that was released through the prophet of God would come into the people and they would have the same insight as the Prophet did so remember it's no good just teaching someone something if it's just up here but if the spirit that's upon the teacher comes upon the pupil right they will see what the teacher is is speaking about amen so now under the so when that when the wood came open brother Ben said the Eagle began to fly so now we are living in an eagle age how lujah we're living in an eagle age but this is the most can be the most dangerous age because the thing is as I see it I think last Sunday is that as even as Moses would would would tell the people of Israel Deuteronomy 29 you know they've been 40 years in the wilderness they've seen great things we see as you haven't been given a heart to perceive or eyes to see until this day yet you saw all the miracles and it as the message unfolded to the Prophet it unfolds to us right we don't know everything you know God going all the way down through the scripture has always use what we call progressive revelation and that shouldn't be a scary thing he progressively revealed himself to Abraham right when God first revealed himself to Abraham he said just leave this land go to another land he told him nothing about this is this is where your seeds gonna sojourn you're gonna have a son you know he told him nothing about those things when he first called him but as and then as God revealed himself to Abraham he revealed himself as Melchizedek as al-shehri I you know as as yo as the Lord God Almighty he revealed himself in different ways was the same God revealing more room self to Abraham so Abraham's revelation grew has understanding became more perfect but at the beginning it wasn't so as the same thing with the bride even you take the prophets ministry his revelation is understand God greater as he walked with God as the season changed in the book came open brother Graham said the Bible became a new book it didn't take him out of the scripture it just put up more in the scripture and it's the same things with us isn't it you know you first meet the Lord everything's wonderful but even you you don't know what you're really cool to be you just glad you're saved and then and then God opens more promises he you know he stabilizes your walk shows you your pre dis there it shows you your inheritance you know and the word shows you your part of the word you don't know those things in the beginning but you as you walk with God he reveals himself and he reveals who you are in him I met I believe he's still doing that too for us so now we have but then what happens is the golden calf if you look at the original golden calf as when the people were too impatient when Moses was at Mount Sinai here was their prophet receiving the revelation of the word on the mountain they were waiting at the bottom of the mountain waiting for that revelations that come and they became impatient and they just turned them Aaron said Aaron just build us a God the image of that God was going to come down off the mountain in the form of the law right but then they were too impatient they said Aaron build us a build us a God and so instead of waiting for the revelation to come they built an image of what they thought that God looked like they took them out of Egypt and it's the same thing with people and this has been through since since the message has been here as people begin to catch revelation but instead of waiting for it to mature and coming to its fullness they begin to run with a partial revelation and they begin to build camps we've seen it they you know they they they built specialty doctrines and you've got to listen to this preacher and this preacher in this breach and if you don't listen to those preachers you know turn and you're not going to make it because you don't listen to them right and then what happens is and then people misunderstand what brother Brahim says like I'll ride this trail again and people think he's going to return this in these whole movements of return ministry and when he says I'm gonna raid this trial again it's God speaking first person through a man that the same Holy Ghost and the Prophet they say ministry would continue but now through a multi member bride he say well how do you find that in the scripture well David was there and and he was anointed and he cried out and what Psalm 23 or wherever does my god my god wise elfis akin me and here he was king and no doubt maybe the people around and we'll look him he's speaking this forth and they're thinking you're not forsaken David you know forsaken what you're forsaken but he was looking he was right on the cross at Calvary right he was speaking first person God was speaking first person through a man just like when Moses went down spoke to Pharaoh said let my people go they were God's people God was speaking through Moses right so when so when you're saying you know I'm gonna ride this ride this trolley right whoa boy ride this trail again you know brother brand see sometimes take what I mean and not what I say I'll ride this trail again that was the Holy Ghost saying the same ministries going to continue on and people saying oh he's gonna race from the deed he's gonna preach some more things he's going to tie up the loose ends it certainly be tied up here but sure he's gonna race but it's coming with the dead in Christ yeah then we're gonna be gone right by people but what happens is people take quotes mate and they make a carnal misunderstanding and then people are waiting for something and it's happening right now you know just like the 10th version you know when when brother Brown was trying to you know the first two parts of that vision was was him trying to put a lay through a child shoe and then also with the fishing and then he talks about the teens and people think it's gonna be a literal tinters literally going to happen the first three parts of the vision were in literal that's symbolic just like the third one it's symbolic remember the mystery you know his tabernacle you know that mystery is now when the wood comes open and it changes your life a member it cannot be imitated it cannot be you know manufactured it's a God's doing it you know the other people came into that wooden place in the tent and there was a reporter or someone waiting on the other side because they win and came out well and and and they're trying to ask them what happened to you they said I don't know but now I'm not a no more right it's the same thing when the word strikes your heart where once virtually crippled maybe on a cot whatever were God brought us into his presence right and then we went out of that after that union with Christ we walk can't people say what happened to you you say I don't know I can try and describe it you know it was incredible I met God he's alive as woods real he's not in the grave no more this message is real it's part of the scripture it's a revelation of God about can't describe to you really what happened because you have to experience it yourself right so it's not a but the thing is people take those things what do they do they build a calf and that's why you see specialty ministries have risen up and they've fallen apart you've seen it why because all man-made schemes have to come to an end remember this message brother but even even you know eight messengers I'm sure just you know it's like you could have a convention of them all they think they're the eighth one and they take it quote from the seventh seal brother and say well maybe I'm just building a platform for that main one to come and people take that and say Here I am and they and they and they form a following but actually the the platform we built for that main one to come was Christ themselves who did who did put it alight I mean who did John the Baptist introduce Jesus Christ the word amen and of a prophet coming the spirit of Elijah to introduce them for the scene coming who will he introduced us to Jesus Christ the word has he not hallelujah I think people take that quite say Here I am this is me and they've got to change to change the message to make it a special revelation you say well the scripture I mean you know even as the Bible says that the scripture is not a private interpretation and bet then you read the next verse why because God moved on the prophets so it's not man's idea devising what it means no God just speaks for through a prophecies this is my word hallelujah so what have they done people have built golden cow well in order to hold on to people to engineer a following you know I don't care if I'm not even a footnote in history I would rather I wouldn't stand here myself I'll be real honest I don't care we want to meet him that's the important thing doesn't matter about the ministry or who we have a great big whatever who cares about that not interested in that and said us and God have a true personal relationship brother then comes the end of the church age book he says if this one thing that one thing I've decide is that man and God would need to have a true spiritual relationship that was the summation of the whole church age but this is what his desire was he says I want you to follow me or whatever that's the thing I want I mean and that's the one thing we want I mean that God and man would have a true spiritual relationship that if this place is no more you still a believer hallelujah I mean cuz remember this this church won't get you in a rapture you're not gonna get all but I went to church on Sunday here that's got nothing to do with it it's cuz you know him if you know him you'll get there a means a people of built calves they've taken the word they've taken Scripture they've taken the message and they've meshed it together to fit their own ends and the built in a golden calf and they say this is where God is today God is in his word God is in his word we're following the word amen now but then now so and this is what people have done this is this is basically the sages history right now this is what's happened but I want you to if we can I have it here the most glorious thing happens though when Jeroboam builds these altars I really pray I have it here as it causes some people to leave and return to Jerusalem it's got a second chronicles 11 and then we'll talk about Jerusalem seeing Chronicles 11 in 13 I don't have it on the on the slides scene chronicles living in 13 Sam in when you were there remember this is just what's happened this man's built these golden calves he's he's put in his own pre sees you know stopping the people worship God as was ordained in that hour but whenever the enemy raises something up it can't hold the true seed of God it can't hold them they have to get out of it and they will if they haven't already second chronicles 11 and 13 and the priests and the Levites that were all in all Israel this is after he's built the golden calves and the priests and the Levites that were all were in all Jerusalem resorted to him out of all the coasts that's the rear bomb this is in Jerusalem for the Levites left their suburbs and their possession and came to Judah and Jerusalem for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off from executing the priests office under the Lord and he ordained him priests for the high places and for the Devils and for the calves in which he had made and after them and after them out of all the tribes of Judah such as set their hearts to seek the Lord their God of Israel came to Jerusalem to sacrifice under the Lord God of their fathers so here it is now is that that that Jeroboam kicks them out and then and it's in their heart they want to seek the Lord God of their fathers and whether they return to Jerusalem I mean to where true spiritual worship is taking place so now there's a gathering member we are kings and priests of God we're a spiritual priesthood right so we're talking about the Levites here is talking about the bride now people have risen up these golden cows within the message it causes the true believer to leave it and they actually return now to where God really is in his undefiled word I mean so here they are they have left left the rest of Israel and they've gathered now to Jerusalem because that's where the worship that's what God put his name at that time hallelujah to set their hearts to seek the Lord their God some seek the Lord God of Israel come to Jerusalem to sacrifice under the Lord God of their fathers now as we read in Deuteronomy God said I'm only gonna I'm gonna place I'm gonna you're gonna sacrifice the Passover in a place where the Lord shall choose to place his name now we understand that this gate he says you won't worship anywhere but there's this one place that you must worship and as as brother Brown brings it out and the message guys provide a place of worship he would say that you know we know Jesus is the door and and then you know Jesus said I come in my father's name and you received me not so what was the father's name there's actually Jesus Christ right so he came in his father's name and so now the name so so what God put his name is in his son now I trust this means something to you because you know if God is seeking people to worship Him spirit and in truth he's gonna take them to where he wants worship to be done and he's not just going to place the meat to dwell for a season but they're going to be sealed in there they're gonna be in the gate hallelujah so now so these these Levites because of the Golden Calf because of Jeroboam son they left and they begin to wander they begin to walk back to Jerusalem where worship really was and that's what happens with the true believers something funny comes in and if they're not under the influence that spirit straight away they'll say something's not right here and they'll begin to seek God and His Word to see if it's true or not hallelujah but remember even if those are under that delusion they can come out of it amen he says not the so so he sees here so not the Methodists word the Baptist word remember if is if there was any left over and the sacrifice had to be burned before morning this is the sacrifice given cause to tomorrow's another age that's right Exodus it's true a symbol type of the sacrifice at the door he says I will make one place don't you worship me in in every door that I'll give you but there's one door and then that door I put my name and where the Lord put his name that's the place that God will receive your sacrifice we've made all kinds of doors but God made a door God made a door and that door was Saint John the tenth chapter Jesus is I am that dawn God put his name in Jesus do you believe it here was the Son of God every Sun comes in his father's name he said I come in my father's name you received me not I come in my father's name he you come in your father's name Jesus came in his father's name so his father's name is Jesus that's exactly because he came in his father's name and you received me not another will come and him will you receive you'll take your denominations and go on with them the Methodists say it's an our church the Baptist's say I'm seers and the Pentecostals and nurse and the Presbyterians and this but he said I'll meet you I'll meet them in one place the place I put my name that's in Jesus Christ that's where God put his name that's the only place he'll meet you and that's in Christ as the word see the same yesterday it's growed from the feet the thighs and now it's in the head fixing to go manifesting the full measure of the bride as same as the groom that's the modern events made clear by prophecy he says and and God's chosen place of worship Romans 8:1 is now therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit that's the gospel we can different upon creeds we can different upon man-made theories you can go to a Methodist Church you have to be a Methodist a Baptist a Baptist the Catholic a Catholic but when once you're baptized into Christ and become a member of his body there's no difference as the middle walls of partition is torn down and you're free because you're in Christ Jesus and you worship God in spirit and in truth when you're in Christ Jesus that's God's plan for you to worship Him in Christ Jesus now no church denomination has claims this no one can claim that how dare you make such claims to do such a thing would be an antichrist spirit be taking away from Christ to take from him you cannot do that Christ is the only place that God meets the worshipers they say today I I'll have people tell me a man me not long ago and Belmont Texas his brother Brett he said mr. Branum if your name is not on our church book you cannot go to him and what do people say today if you don't see it the way I'm seeing it you're lost you've got to have my understanding of the open would otherwise you're not gonna make it remember it's who you know it's not what you know if you remember when the Spirit of Truth will come here loogey Legion guide you into all truth so when the spirit truth comes to you personally he will lead you and guide you into all truth that's God now guiding you through his word that you'll have an understanding but it's him guiding you throat say Amen you say well I don't you don't see it my way that's fine you know it's like you know wheat DC wheat never matures exactly the same speed together he's ever seen wheat grower or corn or whatever it is it's never just now one day everything's just the same know that some of the fields are celibate green so it matures a bit quicker than the other but they all come to harvest condition they all come as long as there's life in that wheat plant right it will come to harvest condition right surface and then so well what should revelation do for us revelation should give us the character of Christ man but Moses received the Lord Sinai as a revelation and it made him the meekest man in all the earth remember he was raised in Pharaoh's Palace do you think he would have been a meek man in Pharaoh's Palace they considered themselves gods he would have walked on I'm Moses son of whoever you know he would have walked around like you know his servants were just mere mortals this he wouldn't have had that kind of personality being the meekest man in all the earth but that being meek was an attribute of Christ's character and when he received the laura's revelation it made a meek the scribes and Pharisees they were reading the same law but because it was a learned thing not a revelation they were proud arrogant people and you see the same thing even within the message see it's the character that's formed that matters the only thing you're gonna take with you is his character you're not going to take nothing else so how do you know you're receiving halation you should be be more like Christ everyday right because as as a bit as the word becomes a revelation to you it manifests as character in your life amen so Moses because of Revelation became the meekest man in all the earth now hallelujah he says what'd you ever think of that don't you believe such a thing as that you think you have to belong to that certain church you cannot go to heaven that's wrong to believe that is Antichrist I'll say this if you believe such a spirit you're lost that's a good sign you're lost because it's taking away from what God did God never put his name in any church he puts it in his son Christ Jesus and when he and his son become one that's a genuine place of worship so when you and Christ become one that's a genuine place of worship no other foundations is laid no other Rock on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking Sam what is the crisis hard rock the Word of God honors word I stand all other all other the sinking sand man's ideas man's opinion I don't care about opinion I don't care about my own opinion I only care about what God has vindicated in the South that's what matters because if God has backed it up boy I'll get on that side Lou yeah member of corn days and had any kind of spiritual sense they would have recognized God is with Moses I'm going to follow him and it's the same thing with Joshua you know people had any spiritual sense that say well God is what this man is he was with Moses is with Joshua I'm following this man and why why should I follow this man it's because he is here to fulfill the Word of God the places in our inheritance rights not just to follow up ministry for the sacred knows that you would be placed in your spiritual inheritance and this is why this message is so vital because it's an adoption message I mean it places you and the body of Christ where you're a day to be and it's not man's ideas us formulating this person should do this this person should do this now that's man's government and if it's man's government it will fail right but if it's God's work placing the people that's how it should be amen see no other place that a man can find to worship God that God will speak back to them No but in Christ Jesus that's the only place the only place that God chose to put his name and the only place that he meets men to worship you're lost to believe anything else he says notice he says notice all seven Jewish feasts are kept in the same place they never kept one feast here for the Methodists over here for the Baptist's over here for the Presbyterian over here for the Catholic and one for the Protestant all seven feasts will be kept in the same place it's a very beautiful type here we just went through the seven churches is going to show that God kept all seven Church ages and the word for each church age produced a part of the word and whenever they produced it they saw the light just like people who first discovered the baptized in Jesus name what did they do they made a denomination out of it and it died right there then God moves right out into somebody else he will not stay in one of those creeds and dogmas he has nothing to do that there's nothing perverted about God God's Word is holy and adulterated Christ as God send a point of worship He is God all seven feasts must be kept in this one place you couldn't keep the feasts in any other place but them seven places the seven I mean I mean I mean the seven feasts the year must be kept in one place therefore the seventh church ages had to come from one single place that was Christ speaking all seven Church ages that's exactly right I mean type of the seven church age as they but they made denominations out of it now let's know what let's just stop it how does the nomination form man tries to hold on to truth and they make a man-made government and rules to legislate the church that's how the denomination has formed now brother Graham says this message will never denominator but I'll tell you people have tried people have tried they've tried to make people apostles in the end and instead of being a god-given apostle which is one sent a missionary as an apostle they place an apostle above the rest of the fivefold ministry and they say well this person as is prophet now after the you know yeah you know after brother Bramley if they do all these kind of things lifting up man out of their god-given position but member the Prophet said that the bride will under her messenger will be the final voice of the final age so we now under this word will be the final voice of the final age so now God will come and live in his bride and she will be the mouthpiece of God once again as she was of the day of Pentecost amen so it's not man-made government that we're gonna have some kind of system you know no it's not man's system it's God ordained pattern in his word that we follow amen you say well you know and church order as their pattern so we need these things but when it comes to man ruling the bride that's when you see ministries fall is because God will not have his bride manhandled by anyone he's jealous god I mean he cares about us he you know if someone raised up thinking they have it all and they're the one that's going to run the signal they're gone because God will get his people out now let's look at another type now I'm not speaking about any particularly any one place anywhere I'm just showing you in this you know in the word what's happened now let's look at another type while we're along here that's the type of the Passover for foreshadow Jesus you notice here the sacrifice of blood by death the sacrifice of blood was the place that foreshadow Christ can a denomination bleed could you think of a church bleeding a denomination bleeding certainly not had taken blood to bleed from a life and the life here Jesus comes in view by the lamb the lamb was a type of Christ and foreshadow Christ because he was the Lamb of God that John introduced that takes away the sin of the world we find Jesus coming into view here in Exodus the twelfth chapter notice it was the only place death could not strike when death was about to strike the land there had to be a certain place all from under this died only one place now doesn't mean it was one house but there was one place that's where the lamb was killed where the lambs blood was the death angel could not strike because it was the one place God had put his name and the lamb was named back there in the beginning of lamb notice it was the one place he could not strike and now the same as today and the only place that spiritual death cannot strike that's the word death cannot strike the word because it's a living Word of God amen if you're under the word amen death can't strike you my brother had said about the token you ought to get under the message get out of the token maybe don't just talk about it don't just debate it get under it amen but when you put a Creed into it the word its moves out of itself out to itself it'll separate like oil from water you cannot mix it together therefore you see when the Creed comes comes into a denomination they all go after the Creed and the word dies out and goes on with somebody else and increases it more picks up a momentum it goes from justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and it goes out into the grain do you see the path God has trod bringing his name all the time right down the same way because he is the word notice it can't die the word of life can't die notice how perfect now that the death angel was not forbidden to strike egypt's great intellectual I mean intellectual people it wasn't forbidden to strike it scared lands its great buildings that's Pharaoh's or the priests of the land the angel was not forbidden to strike it could strike any building any place anybody but it could not strike where the lamb was death cannot strike with us provided place of God is and that is in the lamb notice not even see he was see he see he was not even forbidden to strike Israel or its Hebrew priests or any of their denominations but those under the blood he could not strike now as I see it in the beginning the golden curves are man taking part of the word and making a god now I don't have time to do it but but we've gone through it maybe a few years I think we're downstairs that Egypt they took the children living with God and you can read about it in Hebrews and it took the attributes of God and made them God's said as a God of life is the god of fertility god of nature all the different gods of Egypt actually attributes of God that have been taken from him and made as a separate God you go and and you can see that through all of you know all the ancient religions they take a part of God and they make an idol out of that part of him right and that's what people have done that's what Jeroboam essentially did is he took a part of the word and made a golden calf took a part of the word that's what happened people have risen up with whether partial River and they've made a golden calf out of it and they say this is the message of the hour the whole message is the word I mean and we don't add or take away it's it's the whole word remember when Joshua was commanded when he was commissioned in Joshua 1 he was told to meditate upon the whole Word of God and you'll be successful God and say no meditate more on the feasts or meditate more on me you know dietary laws he said just take the whole word take the whole Word of God and you'll be successful don't add to it don't emphasize or even diminish how the points just take the whole thing and you'll be successful even let's go to Judah honor me I believe this you Terada me chapter 4 and we're here in verse 1 and I don't have that up there is now therefore hearken or Israel under the statutes and under the judgments which I teach you for to do them that you may live and go in and possess the land was the Lord God of your father's giveth you you shall not add unto the word which I command neither shall ye diminish aught from it that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I commanded you now this word diminish it actually means to scrape off by implication to shave remove to listen or to withhold to keep back to restrain to make small to withdraw see if it is a small diminution it's just like scraping off like you know you take a piece of toast you've burnt it you scrape off the burnt but you've actually diminished that toast because you've scraped off a bit of it you've taken a piece of that away we don't want to diminish any of this word it's all important it's all important from from how the family should be to the revelation of the seventh seal to the third pull everything and if you meet the author of the word it's all connected so the doctrine is not all separate things it's actually a person being formed right it's actually a person being formed in you when you actually meet the author of the book you'll see if it's water baptism is how we should treat each other how we should be in our jobs how we should you know be fathers mothers whatever it is you know how we should dress the seven church age is the seven trumpets the seven vials the seven seals church or whatever maybe you'll see it's actually a person it's not just an idea or a doctrine so we don't want to diminish anything Jeroboam perverted part of the word and said you don't need to go to Jerusalem to worship but we're in Jerusalem was the temple and in the end the temple was the Ark and over the ark was the presence of God so in that temple was the word the Ark represents the word and God's presence was above that word and people could go to that temple they could worship God they knew Jehovah God was there so it wasn't vain worship wasn't just man's enthusiasm was actually God was there to worship hallelujah and it's the same thing now remember God is in his word we don't need to go to Jerusalem to worship we don't need need to go to Jeffersonville or anywhere else I mean God is in his word hallelujah but remember if people put a golden calf in front of you they say you don't need to worship like that you don't need to know God for yourself you just need to quote this and say this and be like this you can say that's a golden calf thing you just got to conform to this just be like us know you've got to meet him amen any of it and that is God if you're really in Christ you're in God's provide a place of worship and the death angel can't strike we're lifers I mean with the Lammers can't strike it that's why these priests and these Levites they were thrust out of their places Jeroboam said get out of here you're not part of this why won't you be like us get out of here and they said we're gonna return we're gonna return to Jerusalem we were once scattered out among the people as we are ordained to be but now there's a call back come back hallelujah and then the bride has been called back to the true Word of God sure people may have built Cavs and had all kinds of isms and schisms and the message but there's a people that have come back to the true Word of God I mean more than just a few quotes to suit people's ideas but have come back to the Living God who manifests himself in reality I mean come back to a true Pentecost I mean come back to the true book of Acts with true God hallelujah that the same God the Prophet knew a min the bride knows how lujah Amen you say well we should be the most happiest people in all the world I'm not talking when I'm saying that go make a Drusilla talking about these four walls I said it's not coming to a church it's knowing him knowing him and his word amen you can yo I was so simple when I know when when gob was dear with me I thought well if he's alive I could meet him that was my you know simple maybe I'm too simple but you know and I still I still believe he's still alive you can still meet him I mean that that the same God the Apostles knew you could know Amen that you can worship Him in spirit and in truth member the father of seeking such to worship Him in that fashion so he's actually seeking you so I want you to come worship me in spirit and truth hallelujah I'm gonna leave it there never ever ever ever let anything change this word to you if it's me if it's anyone never ever let it happen stick with it stick with the scripture stick with this message follow up prayerfully amen whatever you do don't just change it well times have changed God don't change I mean the same God that gave the promises the same one that will fulfill the promise you just say Lord Here I am NOT on my own ability I don't want to make some golden calf put it in with my works I don't want to make it will out of my works and what I do if you I just do those things cuz I love you I mean it's not because I can merit anything or gain anything of my own self you know we should never have this opinion or god you owe me he don't owe us nothing he's God he's the one who made heavens and earth the reason we have life in our bodies and we're still alive is because of him it's not because of us and I keep when I died and I work and all this things that's irrelevant the very reason we're alive is because he's allowed us to still be alive I mean the very reason that we're believers is not because of you it's because of him I mean year before the foundation that world he knew you'd be here and he sought you out doesn't matter if you came out of the world like myself you're raising the message they had to come a day where he met you when you hear from just a church for every say now I know it's alive now I know you're real holier and God found you me but God's grace is a divine influence upon the heart and its reflection in the life that is the Strong's definition of New Testament grace hallelujah so it's not you know I'm a believer because I I decided no the reason you decide is because God put on your heart to decide he gave you ability to choose him hallelujah you you take that thought of the cherubims all the way down through the scripture and the conclusion I come and say thank you God you allowed me to walk past them I mean because that influence that anointing that kept them away from the Tree of Life is now present to drive us to the Tree of Life hallelujah sure they thank God because some people are not ordained for eternal life the bride isn't everyone we treat Yvonne like they are right some people God actually says no you weren't am I thinking before the foundation of the world I'm not talking about anyone that's just the fact of the scripture it's not something to rejoice in I don't rejoice in that Lord why don't you just take everything everyone let them all come heavens big place where I have overcrowding I don't mean that as a joke I believe you bring you know but some people just not ordained to it we say well do you look down your nose at anyone no sir no way never ever I want them to come I'll then to rejoice I'll need to be free that's what I want but we should be saying thank you lord their flaming sword doesn't say no you cannon said we've been waiting for you you're on the book come and partake of the Tree of Life hallelujah God allowed you to come it wasn't ultimate it was him not you you just responded to the call so how can we ever make her how can we ever make a golden calf out of our own ability it's not it's not him that will earth or runneth it's God that shall Smurfs II so it's not him that willed I'm gonna be a Christian I'm gonna take this message to the four corners of the world no it's not him that willeth or even him that runneth it's got you know enthusiasm and goes for a while it's God that shows mercy his mercy hallelujah and how can we even make a golden calf out of the open word or part of it how can we do it how can we do it we say because Basie what's the Golden Calf this is your God full-stop this is it this is him there's no more add to it there's no more of him to unfold I'll say that's it how can we say oh now I know everything . Here I am I've arrived God will continue to give us revelation until these bodies change he will always unfold it we say well I've heard it all I've seen it all no you haven't why are you still here right if you are done you'd be gone why big will you say well why are we still here we need more character remember God the reason I still you know the reason we're still here is God is still forming ass into his image God knows how much character we need and he's you know cuz he's got a you know it's like anyone like a great artist they have in their mind like Hoffman who painted this with the rich young ruler he had in his mind a painting and then finally it became material it's like us Godhead before the foundation of wealth he thought of you at your best redeemed hallelujah overcome rejoicing this is now I'm gonna make that material and then we bought your grandparents are married all these things we come down come down that would give a certain thing a certain sound finally we're upon the earth as a baby that's not the image yet but it's going to become it it's gonna become material and then God's what he call it ordained time he meets you I mean your birth into the kingdom but spiritually you're a baby you still being made into the image because you're growing his life and he just adds revelation upon revelation build your character into him through suffering trials different things then finally he sees what I had in my mind like what half man had in his mind of the painting finally it's done there's an unveiling hallelujah done same thing with us so he
