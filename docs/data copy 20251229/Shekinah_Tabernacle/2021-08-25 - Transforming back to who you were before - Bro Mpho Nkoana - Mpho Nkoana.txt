of you there brother matt milam uh omar robin brother chris all of you i believe you can see the screen while i'm greeting you at this moment in the name of our lord jesus christ amen without much ado i've just put as a slide there a title for tonight and it is that the title is transforming back to who you are who you were before i mean sorry transforming that to who amen so tonight i'm not going to talk about uh our usual uh part part three we are not going to talk about part three of our sermon we just take a little detour and there's about this little title that the lord put on my heart to share with you and i trust that you'll you'll be blessed and then you'll take something home uh tonight or into your heart for a subject we just talk about god's power to transform amen let's just read a scripture then we can sit down and let me do this um please let me know if there's a problem if you can't see the screen the ad is on standby to help us amen [Music] now can we see the second the second title amen let's just read that scripture and then we can sit we're going to read quite some lengthy scriptures and then but the rest of the scriptures will read them while we are sitting down philippians 2 philippians chapter 2 does anyone have their their bible amen you know sometimes it's important to have it because you can correct the minister reading something wrong there and then you can say hey brother you jump you jumped a vest [Laughter] amen let's just read there and the bible says if therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and messes feel he my joy that he be like-minded having the same love being in one accord of one mind are we listening carefully that verse two is where the is the is exactly where the gist or the cracks of our someone will be tonight although we'll take some slight uh other other other routes but that's where the real thought is just to fulfill you my joy that he be like-minded like whose mind who who who should we be like like-minded to who amen like the lord jesus christ amen having the same love that jesus christ have can you see having the same love being in one accord amen and then of one mind which is the mind of christ amen can we say praise the lord verse 3 let nothing be done through strife and vainglory but in loneliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves amen look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others and we continue in verse 5 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus let this mind which mind is that one we have just read the previous verse that let not every man on his uh let not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others surely in the mind of the world i cannot count my things to be yours or your things to be mine but in the mind of god that we are reading here in verse 5 the bible says let this mind be in you that my things are your things your things are my things amen that is the mind of christ amen are we together listen to verse five who being in the form of god thought it not be thought it not a robbery to be equal with god you see that is how the mind of god works the mind of god he being god he comes down to come and share with you he thought he was not robbing himself that is how the mind of god works surely if maybe it would have been any of us being in that position would have said ah human beings backslid let them sort themselves out down there with the devil on earth he said no ways because they are mind he thought in a different mind let's continue with that verse verse 7 but made himself of no reputation and took up him upon him the form of a servant it was made in the likeness of moon and and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore god also had exalted him and given him a name which is about every name amen let us pray together praise the lord jesus father any man can open the scripture any man can be eloquent any man father god can read and page the bible we can even read them nowadays on our gadgets this bible other god but it takes your spirit it takes you the interpreter of your own weight father to come and inspire your weight father to come and do the talking father god tonight may you anoint and inspire your word father may you bless it father as we have read it for you said in your word where two or three i get that in my name surely i will be in your midst and tonight father we are more than two we are more than three father god and i pray that you come and take glory unto yourself come and bless your people let them not look at brethren for tonight for i have nothing to offer unto them but lord let them look and expect from you for lord if you use a stone or a piece of wood or if you can use a donkey to express your weight my father how much more about the human by the whom we have put your spirit in i pray that you help us father may you father god transform our attitude may you transform our thinking lord like yours i pray for these people bless them in their respective families may you protect them lord god as we come fellowshipping around your weight we just want to commit ourselves lord jesus christ and i say father that if there's anywhere where we have displeased you my father my god where we have disappointed you father where we have let you down with our thoughts may you forgive us father ask you for your forgiveness we say father may you wash us clean with the blood father god that atonement jesus christ wash us clean so that we can be ready so that we can be suitable to stand and sit in the altar and eat from your table i ask these things father not because we deserve it lord not because we are worthy but because you took the form of men and lord you came unto us i pray father god asking these things in the name of our lord jesus christ in thanksgiving i pray and the church say amen amen amen i believe you can enjoy the comfort of your couches oh yeah and then uh i was expecting to see a full house because we are at home we don't have to drive we don't have to paw patrol we only all we need to do is to open the computer and just click a button there we are on the screen so but nonetheless the bible says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord isn't it so we are not here by mistake we are here uh for a purpose amen so we have read about the mind of jesus christ and we want to speak about the title that says transforming back to who you were before amen so what i'm telling you is that now which means now we are actually uh not in our real form which means we are not in our real form if we are transforming back to where hallelujah so now we we want to read let's read the book of uh romans chapter 2 and just enjoy reading the scripture there no one is in a rush are we we are in agreement tonight who is in a rush no one is in a right so we can talk speak until it's time for us to go to bed though we just moved from what's up i mean we just moved from zoom straight into our beds amen so let's read roman chapter two i'll go quickly i'll go fast so that uh i shouldn't bore you amen but the word of god is never blossom amen isn't it so from this one i see you therefore brethren by the message of god that you present yours your body is a living sacrifice sorry we are reading romans 2. sorry my mistake romans 12 my mistakes sorry thank you one bible reader has corrected me this side sorry i omitted a one let me give you a chance to go to romans 12. romans 12 1. sorry my mistake apologies i believe you therefore brethren by the message of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service so paul is asking a favor not a favor he's asking us to perform a reasonable service to present our bodies living sacrifice wholly acceptable to god amen a reasonable service there's two and a b not conformed to this world but be he transformed right be he transformed by the renewing of your mind that he he may prove that what is sorry that he may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god so this verse is asking us not to be conformed not to be complacent not to be in alignment with the world why why is asking us that because jesus christ came to the world but he was not like the world so he was already transformed right so he was transformed and he was coming to the earth to transform who us because brothers and sisters the true fact of the matter is that we along the big chain of events the devil came in and deformed us you will see as we get along now he came to transform us now that is why he's asking us not to conform to this world but to be transformed by the renewing of our mind how do you know our mind because my mind is the impact my mind is that is other than my soul my mind is the center of my thinking and my intelligence and my thoughts how can i renew it which means it takes another mind to renew my mind hallelujah another mind to renew my mind so i my mind i can't really knew myself jesus christ the one that we spoke about we read about in the previous in philippians that we must be like his mind so our mind must be transformed and renewed which means it takes god's mind to do that hallelujah amen let's go forward for i say through the grace given unto me that every man that is among you not to think of himself now paul is repeating this he was telling philip and now he's telling the romans but hey do not look yourself in your own eyes yeah look yourself in the eyes of others look at yourself as yourself as a part of the bigger body because you are not alone amen so so the head will look at to the to the hand and look it doesn't look as itself as the whole body not just as the head in a little island it looks at that body so that is the that is what paul is trying to tell uh that the romans and he also told philly so i want us to go faster for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think that's a very challenging statement because the days that we are living in are the days of looking putting myself higher on a pedestal and putting everybody below these are the days and that's the spirit so now he says no no let not none of you esteem themselves higher than others more than how you are supposed to but overly you know when you think so badly we say when someone is drunk we say they are not sober now on the canal mind it is drunk you can't think so badly you can't think straight now if if you are sober you think straight you think you don't you don't you don't mix things things are not slow and you just see this computer moving that you say i know this person must be drunk because you're not sober so the bible says you must think so badly according as god has dealt to every man the measure of faith for for us we have many members in one body you see that's what i was talking about and all members have not the same office we have not the same office to take it further we can say we have not the same function each and every part of the body is important in its own right therefore it is important that a truth must look at the tongue and have respect for the tongue and so the tongue must do the same right and also the feet the hands everything must look at the body not just itself individually because we've got we don't have the same office we don't have the same function let's continue them so we being many are one body in christ and every member one of another which means we are joined up together right each and everyone is a part so you cannot look at me and say ah but this hand why is he doing this but this i no no i'm part of the body now i don't want to deviate now heaven there then gives differing according to the grace which means you've got different gifts different so all those things we know we have so but the point is this that according to the grace that is given unto us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith or ministry let us wait on our ministering or he that teaches on teaching or he that exalted or our own exhortation he give it let him do with it with simplicity right not wanting to be seen not wanting to be placed just in simple in a simple way you know he that you left with diligence he that showed mercy with cheerfulness let love be without the simulation you see the way the simulation i was reading and i intrigued how i was soaked i was so and what's the word curious to to understand the way the simulation you see it means the simulation it means disguise you say let our love not be disguised well when i come with the simulation you what you see is not actually the reality that it is inside me but outside i i show something else let our love not be like them let our love be real love we are talking about spawning our minds we are talking about being transformed because originally like this are we together above that a point you know when you say something is is appalling i'm not saying about means apolly but when you say that that just reminded me of the word appalling above that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly affecting one to another with brotherly love in honor preferring one another no not slothfulness in business fervent in spirit saving the lord so the lord the bible is covering everything but hey when we say we work we work there's no one who's going to see there and not want to do work and only others are what kind of a body that will be we must not be slothful in business that you must also not be slaughterful in the spirit you know there is a critical slothfulness and there is a spiritual slaughterfulness that's what we are not supposed you're not supposed to be that way but that's not the subject for today now uh i'm not gonna read this one i'm gonna jump quickly to a first quote now brother in this quote says he says for the lord truly that's why we come on these hot days speak to us through daily the prophet is praying here right but the lord truly that's why we come on this hot day speak to us through thy living and let the living word dwell in us and abide in us that we might be shaped and formed not to the world but be transformed by the renewing of our spirit into the form of the son of god remember i told you that the son of god came here him he was not a sinner but he came to the sinners the purpose was to transform the cinnamon back to be the way he used to be are we together amen my friend now all our hearts tremble when we think and the joy of flats and the joy flies our soul to know that we can be called sons and daughters of god hallelujah amen he stands on the very brim of his second coming and all nations and kingdoms quivering under the feet all things of the world is vanishing but knowing that someday he will come and shake and take us to a kingdom where there shall never be an end or it will never be moved you see he's coming to transform us so that he can take us back to the kingdom while we must be transformed now i'll show you now that why i'll come back to code number two but i just want to say i'll i'll come back to this one let's let's just go through some of my comments here when we look in the book of genesis we find out that um from the beginning the bible teaches us that the word was without form you see the word was without form and that there was darkness was upon the face of the deep and the bible says but the spirit of god was upon it isn't it how many of you remember this hallelujah so now but god the spirit of god started the process of transforming right god started to transform it and the prophet says he transformed it with his faith with his word he he started to transform me by faith through revelation he transformed it because he had thoughts in his mind and he said oh i want to do something and then thoughts went in his mind and because god's thoughts are real you see god's thoughts are are not like uh our carnal thoughts when i my thought can be maybe a theory or it may not be real or it can just be an imagination but god's thought when he thinks that thought is as good is real is more real than this bottle right yeah a thought of god is very real that the moment he thinks that thought is eternal amen how many believe that so to transform the world the earth the cosmos you know this physical thing and then and then and then he he started to transform it and then he put the seeds he said let there be light and there was light and everything then the bible says he he put the seeds all the things that he put there those things were good and some of them were evil and those things were there because before the enemy called the devil he like slid he used to be called lucifer so that is where this all these evils came to be and now when gods are there to put everything together then all sins were put there and then god said let every seed bring his own kind right are we together so that it was from that point that now no no now every seed had to bring his own kind and then bring the fruits of his own kind hallelujah so now now god in the garden of eden maybe what i've just said now explain to you about the putting of the seeds and creation if you can just put what i'm about to say first now god and in the garden of eden god uh said to adam and and and and he put adam and eve in the garden let me read for you what the prophet says here now let's read this one first quote number two now this word transformed i looked up in the dictionary yesterday this is the prophet when i almost lost track of that i was to be up here when i was looking for a text and i found this word or this text rather scripture and in the dictionary it says that is something that's changed it it is to be changed transformed made different than what it was it's been is a character and everything has been changed in it to transform is to change you see now uh now now what i wanted to tell you was that now every every every part of our body every part of our our existence amen has to be transformed our body our spirit our mind our soul everything our flesh subject to what is inside this remember we said we spoke about the seed that god put inside so our our flesh is supposed to be subject to the inside seat and manifest or show the real seat who i was before are we together i understand that this flesh is not a believer this flesh is a sinner but it becomes subject to what is inside to the seat the real me inside are we together yeah now every part of our body has to be transformed that is why we don't do everything we are not like the world we are not conforming we don't eat what they eat we don't drink what they drink we don't talk the way they talk we don't walk the way they walk now because we are transformed and that shows in our spirit that shows in our flesh the moment we do the things that the world does which are not of god we are conforming to the world we are disappointing our savior but we cannot be conformed to the world amen and every seed after his kind god placed all the seeds through his weight right and all what is happening is every seed is bringing his kind let's just pause there i want to open here and say quote number three now god in six thousand years he planted all these wonderful seeds and his way it shall be this way this tree shall be this shall be everything was perfect it was good and he commanded each one of those seeds that they will be they will transform themselves into the plant we of which kind of life that the word of god is spoken in them now because god's power is able to transform god's word because that is a god planted and then there is a seed where that god put the life the seed gene of life he put in each and every seed of all those seeds that he planted now it those seeds are each and every seed was able to transform itself to show what was in the mind of god because the real seed of god is the real seed for god is his word are we together because the prophet taught us that the spoken word is the original seed so now the real seed is the word of god but now because the word of god is inside that seed that the physical seed or any seed whether of a tree whatever human being anything the weather the seed gene of god is inside there and god said it must come up so it transformed itself itself then it starts to grow then we start to see oh that's brought on person ah that's that's that's that's a grape tree it is called grape grapefruits oh that is salt and salt because now of the seed gene that was put inside right so now he commanded each one of those seeds that they will be transformed themselves into the plant which of which whatever kind amen now if it was not an oak tree if it was an oak tree it was to bring forth an oak if it was a pound it was to bring forth a pound the seed of god will transform itself according to what god saw it say and the word says the word seed was there before the word seed was there before the real seed was was was was was ever formed what i said was the word spoken where is the original seed so the real seed is the word of god so it was there and the word formed the seed see he made the world out of things that does not appear see he he made the world by his own word his own seed weight and then god spoke everything into existence now let's hear what let's hear let's hear what the prophet will say further here and and now that means that each and every seed must come to its own manifestation it is effective of what kind of acidities but the prophet says all of the seeds at the beginning were wonderful seeds everything was okay everything was good and perfect and the lord had it in his mind that is going to come the way that he saw it right and then put them under all he care he put them now under the care of somebody he created adam and then he put also under uh uh the care adam and his wife he put them in the garden of eden to look after these seas amen and then he created a place called eden how many have heard of eden before then he made a garden called eden he said okay you guys are going to look at this you see here he he put them also under a cab of the same thing that that that he put his animals and so forth his way they must not never by no means break that weight amen so everything was supposed to work according to god's way according to plan and it was bound to to function like this because god's way does not fail amen so he said don't ever take anything from it there must be a sorry where am i i'm here they must say stay there don't never take anything from it or eat anything from it you must live by his word now those are all the seas that that's how we were supposed to come about and i have put tasks in my son now now god talking i've put trust in my son and his wife that they will they will make head of it and that they will watch over it all and see that it will all is all right that everything will bring forth of his kind that was adam and eve right god had never changed that's the same today as he was then god is determined to do something he'll do it nothing is going to stop him right as he said right now the problem after all these things that has been made after all this creation after all the good things that were coming to bring the good seas and to show the lions will bring lions the palm tree will bring a palm tree the humans are supposed to bring human according to their kind now everything was set up it was beautiful the prophet in one area he says the headquarters of that whole creation was hidden and he put his son and his and his daughter there and his wife there to look after it now problem started when another guy called lucifer came on board that's where the problem started now that man he's not a transformer like god he's called a deformer he's a perverter you see so yeah i i put here the deformer using his power to deform specializes in twisting the weight or the seed of god a little bit huh it does not look like he's a little bit to me but the prophet says he twisted a little bit this comes to me it comes very close to us as christians as believers because if the devil twists the word of god so obvious and so clear man you will be able to see that the devil is lying so a little bit the bible says i mean the prophet says until it is fully perverted so he twisted a little bit uh and then you don't realize it then he tasted a little bit to be further further further further until it is miles and miles away from the original production of it what it was supposed to manifest can you see he does not taste it like twisted no he knows that it won't work in any case he will never be able to twist the seat of god completely and change the nature of god all he will see that he's doing he's hybridizing even on the canal side he's hybridizing and doing all sorts of things but he'll never be able to completely change an orange from becoming an orange to be something else as long as that orange is an original seed he can only mix it and hybrid it and do all sorts of things so the same thing goes to a believer a son and a daughter of god he will never be able to deform you completely because you are a seed of god because the word of god he can only try to deform you a little bit the prophet says and then you don't realize it he deformed a little bit just like he did to eve he came and said no no no no no no no no god does not mean it that way god just means that you cannot be wise really surely die let me show you um i know this thing i i i worked with god i i was very close and he told him just a little bit not too much then if agreed then he went further a little bit by the time he realizes that she is lost he was not where the devil started he was way far he was very far she was already pregnant with cain at that time by the time she realizes it but god said no don't even touch it but the devil twisted the weight a little bit a little bit a little bit and there was a deformed deformation now watch here okay let me go back check a little bit until it's fully perverted he comes in ways that you may not think is the devil he comes in very subtle way now watch him in in his message twist that word just a little bit saying if said for god said that if we do this uh that that day would we die if says no devil god says if we do this we will die he said oh surely you will not die you will not die see he he was a man you see and and you do this now now god gives his weight and god finds it exactly the way he put it i'm busy checking my time also so now all your cultures the prophet says all the cultures all the powers all the signs everything on this earth is part of the deformed earth of the devil but when he started he said he will surely die but now we die we kill one another now we get sick now we are away from god why why why did we go so far when he said no you're not that much not that wise you'll be clever you'll know better how far now all these cultures hello my culture every culture is of the devil because it came through knowledge it came through science orthodox science traditional science now we there's a culture that we are going back to that we are being transformed into we are currently almost done right now we are almost there amen he's getting transformed do not be left behind now that the former i know it seems it seems to be rather strange to speak uh or to speak it in this way to to deform but that's what he was he deformed he perverted pervert means to change to be changed over listen to this the prophet said formation i mean to transform is to change over now to pervert he says here is to be changed over is in other words you are looking this way then he makes it look that way change over same thing pervert and transform the results are the same but just that one is on to the bedside another one is on to the good side pervasion or to pervert or to deform is the opposite of transformed so god put his nature he puts everything there then the devil changes it he prevent it because he can create amen and before the same thing that's been brought over and deformed and made in another way just to be made in another way yet still the same seed is being deformed the point i'm trying to show is that he's not bringing a new seed he's not bringing any new theme of himself he's just taking the same human being the same son or daughter of god and perverse them and deform them are we together i'll show you something now i'll show you some pictures now and we we we we are all still in the image of god yeah the fact that some of our friends of people that we know or unbelievers are uh it does not mean that they are not in the image of god you see they are still in the image of god but some are so deformed a sons of god that contrary to his word and to the way that that he he helped us and provided for us to all you see there are still god's people he created them but they have been perverted they've been deformed and you'll see now that the reason they are some don't get transformed it is primarily because the seed that is in there has been temporary it's not the seed of god it is the devil has as i don't want to say a better way but he has already he has dynasty it's not the seat of god the true seat of god can be transformed back to the original where it was amen that is why you are where you are today are sitting where you are listening to a man talking about telling you about who you were before and you being in a process of metamorphosis you know metaphors being transformed is where you used to be with you now you are in a process of being transformed to who you were before but it's not safe that is going to be transformed some spirit will be transformed not into what god wants or into the the image of god some seeds will only transport to be transformed to like the evil the evil seed because there's a separation from the beginning isn't it right now i want to move on quickly with speed here and and show you this um here let me read this first searching something the world twists us out of the way pulls us close to it and away from that straight narrow strip that he planted us in to be sons and daughters of god sin has done this evil thing to the sons and the daughters of god he has done it the devil came and wanted to to deform the whole world if you look at this tomato you'll see that another another one is deformed and another one is transformed it is in its original state can you see but you can see that the one that is deformed you can see that that's a tomato you cannot see that's a tomato you can't say tomato but it is deformed but we need to be taken to the one on our right are we together amen in the original state now it does not take me it does not take you it does not take no one it takes the lord jesus himself because the first adam he failed but the second the second adam he's not going to fail cannot fail the ministry of the second eve is the second one cannot say he cannot fall for the lie of the devil this earth cannot fail this bread cannot fail that's what the adam did not fail so he's here to transform us to bring us back because the first adam failed amen look at this one can you see little ones even even our canal eyes when you when if i can ask you which one can you choose definitely you choose the one on the right if i can ask malakai then i say my friend which one would you like jonah then he will choose a beautiful corn there on our right he'll even take two because it is in its original state it is likable it is how it is supposed to be go back a little bit to the slide that i wanted to read for you uh of course number two was it code number two now oh no i've already read this one for you which one was it it's okay and now i'm copying my pasta now he said he also moves around a lot so now uh now after after all this this this deformation that the devil has done you know god created the garden of eden putin's son and his son failed because of the devil and now every seat now was deformed well i mean was affected by some form of a deformation and then now and he has caused a mess and he has taken he has taken six thousand years the prophet said to deform the whole world today he's got what we call his own eden what we are here now we are in satan's eating this is how the devil has deformed it so now now each and every one of those god took six thousand years or six thousand six six years six days the devil also took six days all of them six six so now god because his word can never fail he's got inside his way there's a power of transformation now he's a journey a journey of transformation because why it is impossible for god to fail it is it is impossible every seat must bring its own kind he said at the beginning that's what he said now he realized that the enemy the deformer has come and deformed this thing now there must be a plan there must be a way to bring that wisdom according to what god has said and then you come to what you call god's plan of redemption you see now god now start a journey to transform the seas that were there then he started he brings a plan of redemption as i said he comes down here to earth because it is impossible for his weight not to happen the way he said it is impossible for god's thoughts not to come to pass first transform will transform the earth into another eden now brother andy likes to say now we are now even so we are already in an idiotic condition we are already there in any condition we can almost almost see garden of eden opening we can almost see we can smell the fragrance of the flowers in the garden of eden because that's where we originally were transformed when when something is being transformed i don't know if you have ever seen a chicken hatching those who have experienced it you'll see the more that little peak is is hitting on the shell the more it's about to come out you know what the excitement gets higher and stronger you know so i guess it's push and kick the closer it gets to the to the breaking of the shell if we get to the rapture the harder we must kick that we are in now so now we must be like that little chicken that is almost transformed hitting me too late in the egg it's almost breaking the sun of righteousness is almost on the rise we can see the more it gets darker the more darkness into the world comes the more clearer and clearer we see because we are in a different realm we are in the different the darker the world gets it brings us happiness and excitement because hey we know we are almost there we are home now he is going to transform time into timeless i was preparing something on the table and my family jesus saw me laughing and and they were wondering what is happening with me because something said to me the time allocated to time is over time is allocated time is getting to end to an end but no more time brothers and sisters so we need to be ready to realize that we cannot depend on time for we don't can even time itself has got no more time hallelujah and full of sin will be transformed into transformed into a sinless world ah we are going to a new world where there's no more sin amen that ever since we were born our forefathers have to adam whom we have never seen without physical eyes everything is coming to an end to change to take us back where we used to be transformed into sinless minds that's where we are going in fact as we are there already because we are living already in the bright age we are living in this earth but we are not of this world we are living in this world but we are walking like kings and queens on this world amen like-minded believer who is continually in the spirit you see is a believer who is transforming the mind whose mind is getting transformed he is always christ like-minded he's always talking working thinking like christ you will never if it happens that's not for him he'll quickly fix it if there's anything wrong if there's anything that the devil can pass through you know you know when you you've got a tv and you want to put the channel some somehow sometimes another channel just come through and that's not the channel you want you say ah you just press the remote quickly and pass that channel because that's not what you want sometimes we go through dangerous areas we walk through the value of the shadow of them and the bible says we shall not fear amen for his lord and his staff hallelujah so sometimes even if a believer do a mistake or the wrong thing you must not look to that believer through that the eyes of that mistake because you shall behind you will be looking at somebody who makes a mistake and you are long left behind that brother is in the process of transformation he has passed already that sister do not be looking at you ah he did this and that no no no no you that is for god and for him to sort out the prophet says look to him in the eyes of jesus because jesus when he left heaven we were filthy and sinners come to those kinds of people because he did not look to us in the eyes of sin he saw us in our original form oh my they're not aware let me make them aware that they can be transformed that they can get back to where they are they are in a in a situation you know in english there's a word called so so some non-believe is it the right way you know when when when you are you are lost in nature huh when when when amnesia and amnesia is amnesia's another way you know you are in there in an amnesia state he came to reverse that because amnesia is part and parcel of the deformer tactics so if there's an amnesia he is coming to do the opposite of amnesia you see for me and for you to see and to know that ah and now we know even so all you're waiting for is to take your flight over the pilot is ready all of us our seat belts are tightened the fuel is full the flag is ready and serviced ready so you better get on board my brother my sister get on board it's not time it's time to put on your bed it's time to get transformed it's normal for a christ-like minded believer to allow things of the world to be in your mind about your brother and your sister to attaining an english talk i heard the pastor last week saying people assassinate each other's character minded believer that's not a mind christ-minded like christian not in the flesh not with another brother talking not in my mind alone not not alone in my mind or my heart not with another brother or sister those things cannot be heard you must take that level and take this place why would you do that because you are transformed you are transformed you you run and stay away from the evil world even the very appearance amen i'm almost finished and then the bible says i mean i'm sorry not the bible this is me i'm saying if you see someone who who who really fights and rejects this weight it's possible that that person is not deceit because every seed show is on bringing its own kind so everything must bring his kind now there's nothing wrong what you think about yourself what you think about yourself who do you think you are that's there's a statement in the world you know some people ask it but i'm asking in a friendly way who do you think you are who who do you think you are because the brother brother ben was asking one sunday the lord asked peter and them who do the people say i am and the disciples answered him and they answered him and eventually peter hit the court and he said you are christ the son of the living god and he said blessed are thou peter right we know that so now i want to ask you a question the lord asked a question well question tonight is who do you think you you are that's yourself who do you think you are not the weightless way of saying what do you think you can do or who do you think that one you know that the root one not that one the one i'm asking you is how do you perceive yourself who do you think you are who do you think these people around you who do you think they are who are they the answer is in your heart and the answer must be according to revelation it must be revealed answer it must be the one that jesus christ will say ah edward and blood have noticed without my son of the lord the response to your answer you see brother mario it must be the lord said oh marion johannes bless and blood have not revealed that unto you amen amen so you are the son and a daughter of the living god hey in the process of being transformed therefore a sea that is getting transformed does not get mixed up in the loose things of this world is shooting up to the sky it's going home time it does not time for those things amen the way you see yourself is very important it's very critical it is very important because and it depends on how you look at yourself or you're right obviously obviously you're either wrong or right you know someone one day they ask them oh do you know the gender of the baby the sisters expecting you know the gender and that person said oh no no no no yes yes yes we know this is either a boy or a kid now it's obviously is other boy or again i'm repeating the same thing i'm saying the way you look at yourself you're either wrong or you're right just depends on how you're looking at yourself why because the natural eyes are going to tell you and the mind that you are a sinner you are not the son of god that's why you make so many mistakes that's why you think like that yeah you cannot allow that the same gene inside you cannot allow that cannot answer them somewhere from deep within you something is going to say but i'm a son of god now that is no more the natural art you see you look to yourself not through your own eyes this is why you can say i am almond the son of the living god you see because you are not looking yourself through your own eyes through your mind no you are looking through the rock that the lord jesus said unto peter flesh and black you see it's not flesh and blood that will make you to say i am armand or i am paul the son of the living god you say no i am matthew the son of the living god the devil because he will be realizing that it's not flesh and blood saying that it is coming through the mouth but it's not flesh and blood it's through revelation from somewhere inside the transformation has taken place you see seeing yourself as the lord see you you see that's how we we must see ourselves we must see ourselves the way the lord saw us when he left heaven to come to us he saw the end product and he came he overlooked these things in between he says i will delete that you know a delete button on the computer he deleted it and he even removed it from the recycle bin he removed it when you talk about yourself you must you must catch the mind of god you must be talking about what is in the mind of god about you cannot say it from your own mind because you'll be wrong that's the mind of god the mind of god the revelation of god and his own faith then you know exactly who you are i call so much about brothers i didn't call the sisters names you see so revelation love and faith of god will be doing that through you sister and christian isn't it amen now think about moses this is a simple example in in in closing think about moses and pharaoh they were looking through to the same people but sing differently right then look at you you look at yourself jesus christ looks at you but you see different things they see different things pharaoh looked at the israelites moses looked to them both of them same people but they are they are seeing if one one sees slaves one sees the children the sons and daughters of the most high god christ looks at us he sees a bride of him the devil looks at us he sees someone that he must abuse that's what the devil does you see so in closing i won't read this scripture here but now this scripture is the one that i wanted to draw your attention to this uh i wanted to draw you just to repeat what brother ben said there about when the lord was asking peter who do the people say i am and we've already spoken about it now you can't say that through your lips revelation of god will speak through you that you are the son or a daughter of the living god are we together now let's just uh read this and then we pray then we are finished amen now it's hard to say this this is the prophet now you see because everything that is happening through this journey of transformation it comes through that plan of god a book that was stolen that is getting to be restored that has been restored in the rightful owners this it is along those lines that the prophet is saying this he says now it's hard to say this it is very hard because speaking to people who feel the same way i do and the way i have been for many years but since the old painting of those sea seven seals of them angels just behind the mountain yonder this has become a new boob if the things that has been hit is being revealed as god promised revelation in revelation 10. you are the seven seals you see you are the son because you you you did not know who you are before only through the preaching of this world you became to know that oh i'm part of the seventh season christ is the seventh everything revolves around that book and is now getting restored in the hands of the rightful owner it sounds like to me that the prophet says oh everything i've been preaching and everything but from the day the seven sales were revealed man it became a new book the prophet says that's what he says he will do it and we are the we are the privileged people that god has chosen and of the earth that we might see and understand these things which is not some mythical fleshly mind of a person trying to make it up is the word of god make manifest is the word of god made manifest revealing itself who it is manifest meaning meaning coming to reality showing of the actual theme of what it is that's what manifestation means the word of god made manifest proven that it's right proven not by science but by god that's that's right god as i have said before in the message in a message god doesn't need anyone to interpret his way he is his own interpreter amen you know he no one can interpret the word of god the word of god interpret itself when it happens that is the interpretation amen of god happens that is his own word being interpreted so everything you come into manifestation coming to reality the existence of the seed gene that you are becoming being transformed you are the word of god being manifested ah you are the devil can argue he's got no leg to stand on so on that note brothers and sisters it is a bit awkward to preach on zoom because i'm not used to it but on that note i pray that the lord will take this word that has been everywhere and just build something in your hearts and bless you and show you through the rock of revelation that you are the true seed gene of god and the transformation and one of these days it will take a flight history will be history amen may the lord bless you may you have a wonderful night and thank you very much for being an attentive audience i would have loved to hear you but the lord bless you i would like us to pray and then we can hand over to brother edward maybe you have a need in your heart somewhere if you search deep in your heart the holy spirit tells you that there is a desire for something and the lord wants to give it to you and now uh it is an opportunity for you to lift up your hand inside your heart don't just lift it physically only lift up your genuine hand in your heart because you are a true seed gene of god you are a true seed of god being transformed today and what you are asking for you must get especially the word of god as prophesied lift up your hand by faith defy the force of gravity let's be reverend as we are going to pray god is here to give you a need remember he left heaven and to come here to give you your desire let's pray together our most gracious and eternal god father we don't have the ways to say more lord jesus what we want to tell you tonight father is that you know it all master you can even see our needs even before we ask them lord jesus you knew them my father my god and somewhere in the bible you said even before we ask lord we will find that you have already answered and we come on the basis of that word my father my god we come on the basis of that confessed word that lord we have received that which we are desiring because it's not our mind and our flesh that is putting in our in our needs but lord is the holy spirit guiding us we are asking according to your will my father we say let the needs of your children be given more soul my father my god spiritual needs more soul the needs that are linking us with our original transformed way with our original transformed form not so my father god yes the needs of this earth while we are wrapping up here on this earth we do need them lord may you also grant them your children in their families lord oh the enemy thinking that he has locked us up but my father my god you can never be locked up in the spirit my father we are together not even through zoom we are together in the spirit of god and i pray dear lord that tonight you'll bless your children may the angel of the living god go in the neighborhood of nelson may the angel of the lord neighborhood the neighborhood in the neighborhood of fox valley in the neighborhood of upper heart may the angel of the lord go to the academy away may the angel of the lord tonight go everywhere to where your children are listening and are watching tonight and deliver their needs my father my god one day there was a woman who was healed the prophet lord jesus christ said to that to the people that the angel of the lord was walking in the neighborhood and deliver the healing of those two women and i pray tonight lord jesus christ that you can provide for your people make yourself known unto them by the fulfillment and the provision of their desires i pray my father my god that as we close the service we are not closing it we are just adjourning it and handing it to you lord that at the point of time you can bring us together to bring us more to the full transformation of who we are really we really are and i pray dear lord as we thank you for this opportunity for this privilege we say father thank you for all the wonderful things that we have done for us lord we cannot mention them all thank you for the healing thank you for the protection thank you for the food that you lay on the table thank you for the clothes that we wear thank you for protecting our spirits and our souls against the evil forces that are roaming in the night thank you my father for protecting our children thank you for healing jonah thank you for healing abby thank you for healing each and every one of your children you can see their hearts my father and you can hear them i pray
