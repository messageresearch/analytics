for that this evening we thank you for your abundant Mercy to us Lord for your Grace and we just want to pray you'll continue to be with us um this evening Lord as we we just want to speak about you and and your word Lord and may we be enriched by your spirit and by Your Word this evening we just pray we just commit each one to your hands bless those that are streaming tonight too we pray in Jesus name amen amen praise the Lord God bless you all this evening man it feels like I'm I'm I'm really living in the sun tonight this this is metaphorical this is where you want to be people living in the Sun Lord of God Amen um uh okay can you turn with me to um Ecclesiastes thank you musicians 12 verse1 Ecclesiastes 12:1 says remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth well the evil days come not nor the years draw nigh with when thou shalt say I have no pleasure in them amen you can um take your seats this evening how are you all this evening good how your week going well Victorious conquerors that's right brother regardless of without may appear we're always winning amen that's the God we serve you know I I love serving the lord we you know no matter what would happen each day and how it may appear I I have confidence that you know when we commit our life to the Lord and we the great Shepherd is leading us that he's never going to lead us astray and that he's always got our best interest in mind you know no it doesn't matter we we can begin to rest and as we go on life's journey and we go through things and we always come out the other side okay we start to have more faith we realize well if I came out that out of that one okay I'll come out of this one okay you know we we begin to trust more and and maybe we don't get so worried when things aren't going the way that it might appear that they should be we just think oh it's all right Lord I remember when I um when we we moved here we were in a house for maybe three or four months and then we had to move out and we had five kids and five children and a small I don't like saying kid sometimes because it's like a baby goat so like don't take anything off that that's just in my brain five children in um a small zoo I think we had some goats then we had chickens and dogs and cats and fish and any all these creepy crawly things rabbits I think the rabbits probably got killed by the dogs but um and for the life of me we could not find a single place to live anywhere because nobody wanted a a like a tribe in a zoo and it was so funny trying to get a place you know we were we were looking I remember brother and you been with me I think I've shared with some of you but every place I looked at said no no no everywhere I looked man and and I said to we look for replace and then I'd say I'd say to Brother Andy you watch this bro this will be a no you watch this it'll be a no and then the next day come back and no no no no and um I remember the day we still had nowhere um we'd be going to the prayer meetings and they'd be praying oh Lord give brother ISAC a house you know sister Shannon but I'm sure on the back of their mind they're thinking man what's this brother done you know not the Lord's not providing he must have done something wrong confess you know some of you were thinking that now and the day came where we had to move out we had nowhere I thought man we got nowhere to go so we had to pack all our stuff up and throw it on a storage unit said to Brother Andy were moving into your place bro we got nowhere to go nowhere I think brother alre was helping us move cuz he was down for the weekend but fortunately for me it was a time where I did have faith I didn't waver we were moving our stuff and stores you know it's all right the Lord's got somewhere perfectly lined up for us it's all right everything's going to be all right I can't say mo like that in case I don't think oh this brother just goes through trials and things like it's nothing you know but that time I did and um I said it's all right well the Lord's got some sort of plan in mind I've got no idea what it is because this doesn't make any sense to me we're going to have to put all this stuff in storage and then go and live at brother Andy's then about two weeks later the guy we would that we dealt with to get that house he he gave me a ring and he said I found a neat place for you um but it's an unusual setup but come and have a look at it so we went out to the aatar was there and it was this amazing place and 180 acres of land and just really good and it was fully furnished with stuff house load of stuff and he said look the funny setup is this these guys just finished fully renovating this place and it was all go and um but then things happened they had to all move up to Oakland um and they're renting out there and living living with their parents and things like that but they said um the only catches they want someone to live here for about two or 3 months with all of their stuff um well they found a place up there and then when all this when you could um when they found a place up there then they would move all of their stuff up there and on the walls were all these Christian scriptures and things so it turns out this was a Christian family and they that they had gotten a situation where they they you understand the picture like they they had to go up there and then they said Lord we need someone to move into our house and use all of our furniture for about 3 months well we find somewhere and we said to the guy well that works out well for us cuz I just finished putting all my stuff in storage so we're ready to move man we moving tomorrow our whole belong our whole life is in the back of the car and we were there for 10 years you know it was such an an amazing um time but you know even you know you just the Lord's always got some sort of plan I'm glad at the time I didn't think oh no Lord you know I've done all this for you and then you put me in that situation I going know where to live and you know he had a plan all the way through amen um okay so the um the scripture that I the thought that I have want to speak on tonight is a a subject called the excitement of Life the excitement of Life who's excited about life if you're honest sometimes you're not you're very dis excited about life if that's a word you know but I just want to talk about this and maybe maybe talk first about the this natural path of excitement that we go through as now this is just now I'm going to talk first as just a human being because we we go on this natural path of excitement as as our life unfolds um some of you are still on that at the early stages of the paast and some people are going to be near the end of it which is a very different stage than than it is at the start but but there is a path of we're talking natural excitement now and we get into the spiritual side but it's we're going to talk natural excitement which is you know you're excited you're happy about something you're enthusiastic it gives you energy it's you know excitement you know when you're excited about something you're kind of like like I remember oh Jesus is not here tonight but we were going to go hunting early one morning and I said I'll wake you up at like 5:30 or something you know we'll go early and this little guy was so excited about it he was about 8 I think or seven and I went to his room and woke him up and he hopped straight out of bed boots on pansan jacket everything he was ready to go man he stepped on his whole clothes so he could just get up and gone that's how excited he was to go so on our natural path of life we got like say 0 to 10 you know it's quite a it's a it's an exciting little time when you live you know you just everything's new to you but you actually don't know that you're young and you don't know you even exist really to you get a bit older you're like well that was my childhood just then but you know you just sort of it just comes upon you without you really knowing that it's there you know cuz you you understand you realize later on that my childhood well you know you're alive but you don't really perceive it as much I was having a a fun time looking at I was going to get pictures of little children but I was having a fun time looking at pictures of excited little animals you know cuz you know you see a little lamb jumping out in the field you know it's little things little children are so excited you know they're just excited about everything everything things excite them really easily like you go boo and they get excited they're like w this is or you you know hide behind there and sneak out they're just so excited that you snuck out to them you know or if it's almost dinner time they're so excited all dinner you know it's like everything is exciting they're just they're just so excited about life and it's such an amazing thing with that's what I love about children they're just everything excites them some adults you know they just like nothing excites them anymore you know but little children are just they're just so excited you know everything's just new and fresh and it's just it's nice to be around like here's your little beer Cubs you know they're just excited F fighting you know playing and the mom's like I had so much fun looking at these you know who's this you can sort of see who's more excited than the other or this I think a lot of dads could relate to this is keep playing dad's like I'm done man the excitement wore off 20 years ago no this next one is very funny you wait till you see this one boom [Laughter] I think that's the dad he's just done man this might be the mom I think but one of them is more more excited than the other and this is a natural way that life would unfold you know the when you're young you're excited when you get older you're not as excited about the things that they're excited about you know then you get to this funny age like 10 to 12 it's kind of like a you sort of transition from like being a kind of like a little kid but you're not really like a teenager you're sort of in this it's quite a neat stage you know it's quite a quite a I I put here just because it is a fact if you're a boy you're kind of like this you're you're not really a kid but you're not really independent you're not really and you are old enough to be Mischief but young enough to be naive you know that's just that it's quite a neat little age 11 10 11 12 like a lot of movies or books are about if they want to capture something about that age they they they hone in on this age here cuz it's like they can still make the boy or girl a bit goofy but then they can still be serious they just sort of just stuck in the middle you know because when you get to a teenage Hood it's a bit more serious you're a bit more the realities of Life are there bit more and you know but when you were a kid you they they wouldn't understand these older things so it's quite a funny little um age and then 13 to 17 you're still like you're still excited about things at this age you're the ex hasn't gone yet though right we're always kind of excited even in your teenage years you're still excited about things you just go a little bit weird for a while you know like you're not really you should be really excited but you like try not to shot but in your heart you know you are you're so excited but your friends you look at your friend and if your friend is an excited man you're not going to move a muscle that's the truth you know all the kids are going nah [Laughter] man but when you kind of get over that you get over those your little insecurities and you know you're like H you know who cares if my friend doesn't it's not excited I am you know I'm excited girls showout a bit more than guys till I notice they sort of show a bit more excitement but you get to this age where you're let's let's say 18 to about 28 you're actually you are old enough to if I put it here you are old enough and independent enough to to try things but you never have you know so you now have this you you now have this excitement in your life because suddenly you can go and do a lot of things but and they're all new you know all the things that you that you could go and do are new for you because you can go and do them yourself it's a very very exciting time it's like it's just everything is exciting you know like uh understand what I mean by and you've all been there you know it's just you but I'll just talk real quick about this this emotion called excitement have you got your thinking caps on your natural thinking caps so the this is the way scientists and psychologist would determine this the understanding of this emotion called excitement because it is an emotion it's still like a state of emotional and it could last longer or shorter but one dimension they call it Valance and that that's that's whether the emotion is positive or negative or Pleasant or unpleasant so you've got this is it going to be positive or negative and then the next one is called um arousal that means is it activating does it bring you up or pull you down so so these are the two sort of things that that affect excitement so with that in mind you'd say you'd say ex excitement has a positive uh Valance like it's a positive thing and then it's got high arousal like you feel good and it's like yeah you know so that's that that creates this this emotion to make you excited so and if you look at it like calmness is it's a positive thing but you've got very low arousal you're you're calm you know so it's on the positive side but it doesn't really you're not like yippee you're actually like wow this is so nice I'm just sitting down and looking out at the view and relaxing you know it's it's a but it's still positive uh so then anger would be a very negative uh like a feeling but bearing in mind those two the what it does in your body with excitement or anger or that it's actually almost the same thing it's cortisol that comes into you it's actually the same it's a strange thing like your heart beats a bit faster your things happen to you but the same thing happens to you it's just the way your mind perceives it if your mind perceives it's exciting you'll get excited if it perceives you're angry it'll do it that way so you actually have this it's not like oh your angry I'll give you a different shot of stuff you know you get the same shot which there's a lesson in that too because people could take the same thing a different way uh boredom or depression is negative Valance and low arousal so it's so it's all around bad at least anger you kind of like you fight up about something but but depression or boredom you're just you're down and you're just and everything's negative and it's just low Rouser you're just like you got basically zero excitement in life zero and because depression brings you zero excitement you're not when you when you get really depressed you're not excited about anything at all nothing excites you um this is one last bit of study here then we're going to move go back to where we were um I talked about this but arouser what's called the hypothalamus controls this response through the um autonomic nervous system which is responsible for regulating Baseline body functions like breathing blood pressure and heart rate feeling excited or feeling anxious is actually the same sensation both send a rush of cortisol to your brain so it's the same thing it just it just sends it up when it thinks that it should and then Valance is in the meantime another part of the brain the prefrontal cortex is involved in processing the context of the situation to determine Valance if it's a positive or negative thing or like you say like take like change if in your mind you're scared of change then when change comes it's going to shoot up this quarter all and things in you but you're going to take it as a negative thing because in your mind you think it's negative so you're you're going to be anxious oh no there's change right but if you like change then you're going to be excited about the change see that's the two that's is how this thing works so the way you perceive it in your mind is actually it affects how you take it okay so let's just cut back to this now life now becomes full of new experiences when you're you know you're 18 19 20 you know you you travel to a new place because remember every place is almost new you haven't been there before you I've always wanted to drive there but I've never had a car now I've got a car and I can visit there woohoo this is going to be fun wow there's the beach this is so amazing like I was getting photo after photo of raging you know chill chill chill here's the beach here's the beach I was like aring raging I bought I was bought up about an hour away from them it's just rling you know but to these guys like an AB sent me a photo of him he's on the and then I should have shown it he's doing a backflip on the so he's midair upside down and then there's the beach the waves behind him and he sends me a photo with a single caption beautiful I don't know if he's talking about him or the view beautiful but it's new it's a new place new thing going to camp this is awesome this is new uh you start a new job you know wow I got a new job today my first job you know or or the job you wanted ah I got a new job there you're working there you know but it's new it's exciting it's a new job it's a you always wanted to go on work there or maybe your first order maybe just a progression there you've got a full-time job somewhere and it's to you it's exciting everything is exciting still you know it's like or you can get some money and you can buy things who loves starting to buy things when you finally had money like I could buy things I've always wanted that thing my parents never got it for me now I can go and buy it I'm so excited even when you get married you know washing machine is so exciting we got a washing machine how many Ms after 10 years are excited about a washing machine they're like no you're not man still excited about it it's like washing machine because then you think man I'll go do is wash clothes isn't it all the time it just keep on coming man over and over and over and over again I remember when we got our first microwave it was such a big deal when I was you know maybe this was the mid 90s I think microw were a big deal then and we got one you know and it was like oh there's a microwave and dad was like now none of you kids are touching this microwave it was like only mom was allowed to put food in there and push start we like w watch it go round you know it was so exciting now it's like oh you know $50 microwave jacket in there boom you know uh here's one you you you can enter into new relationships like your guy or a girl looks so exciting you he may be the one one you know it's very exciting hey who's looking at the parents look at their [Music] little their son or daughter but it's exciting you got to admit it it's exciting man W it's like oh this and they talk to me we made oure contact and then you can't talk and you're so nervous you're like uh hey um and then and then you think should I have said hey was that the wrong thing to say I should have said hello they're going to think I'm silly CU I said hey oh no now it's bad I haven't seen anything for about 20 seconds and that's awkward you know it's like but you know if it do all slowly eventuate you get so it's so exciting you know and it's and there's a because you have more of life ahead of you than be than behind you and you have you have opportunity and things that options that you don't that slowly fade as your life goes on you get less and less options and people want to give you less and less options as well and so that's a and you'll find that universities and sports teams mainly universities they they major on this idea that oh look life is a hide is exciting come with us and you can be this and you can be that they major on that like all these Billboards like oh I am Fearless come with us and be fearless and and take on life you know they they they kind of in a sense they leverage off this idea that you're at the age where it's all exciting now you know they're not marketing towards a 60y old that has decided to go back to University you know they're not marketing they're marketing to a 20-year-old that's like got their life ahead of them they wants to you know that's who they're marketing towards like learn boldly live to inspire you know make your make your life mean something now this is good you know this is kind of I'm not down playing this cuz it it's what they should do you know they shouldn't be saying oh you know life is going to be real boring and just come here and work and then die and it's all over you know they they don't want to Market it like that it should be you know it should be a bit exciting or it's a new world learn to lead it you know it's it's always the thrust uh the power to change your world now these and these things are correct because you go into you you have hopes and you have dreams you have things you want to go for so you should be like this you know I think it's the beauty of Youth I'm not I'm I'm for it um in a natural sense like the because this is naturally how we progress you know in life and and all of these you know if you want to join the the Army they're saying be all you can be and they're trying to bring you in by giving you hope that it's going to be a bright future for you you know there going to be it's going to be exciting you know find your greatness you know find your greatness boys I know it's in you um and in a sense life is it's like at that point it's like this Buffet spread you know you can oh do I want that do I want that do I want that you you have options you can and it's all exciting you're so excited oh look it's on the buffet you know now I think that's a good thing that's a natural part of life but you know you can get older people that can sort of pour cold water on it all and say oh yeah yeah been there done that it's your first job you'll get sick of it soon enough oh yeah now you just studying year probably be a boring job or you know but but we shouldn't do that to young people you know it's their turn it's their turn to be excited and have fun in life and even if you know probably you know you're going to get sick of that after while say awesome man go yeah it's exciting because to them it is you know it's exciting this is a this is their turn to be excited we were excited when we were that age we enjoyed it hey it does Wayne but don't worry about it you don't need to tell them that let them let them go and enjoy it you know and and even Solomon perceived this process of excitement that's why he said Rejoice oh young man and thy youth or young woman and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy Youth and walk in the ways of thine heart and in the sight of Thine Eyes whatever you want to go and do just go and do it it's exciting for you you know but no there that for all these things God will bring the into judgment just do the right thing don't go off and sin but go off and have fun life is exciting go and do things go and experience things go go and travel go do this go do that sorry next month all the youth will be gone shouldn't say now don't travel no no but but it's a this is a natural way that we that lives are going to unfold and then you have maybe at about 2830 you get this thing happens called the downward spiral okay it's called this this little downward spiral that goes that suddenly things stop going up and things start going down in terms of your excitement about life the downward spiral who's who's who's who's who's slid done the downward spiral now and then no one wants to admit but you know you all are [Laughter] and that's the end of the sermon I'm [Laughter] done because the scripture we read at the start said remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth well the evil days come not nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say I have no pleasure in them I get zero excitement out of this anymore because I've done that for about 100 I've done that 100 times it's called the evil day this is now naturally our excitement how it would naturally go okay I'm not saying we go like that I'm just saying this is the natural progression of how it's going to go if it's l to take its natural course it's just like you shouldn't see a little forn being born that just sits there does nothing that thing's going to bounce around but probably not when it's older it's not going to bounce around you know it's a natural progression and this is a natural progression and there's a simple reason for it is that less things are new and more things are old you got a lot more old things in front of you then you have new things in front of you so you're less excited about life like that job they've been there 10 years and it's you that washing machine was now I got to buy another one it's broken you know the things that would excite you because they're all new you've been to that place 10 times you know it doesn't excite you as much anymore that's the there's the excitement in life goes because there's not as much before you there's more behind you that there is before you even opportunities go you know things like that this is uh you know you have you have the same job you had the same job for a while it's not as exciting as what it was you it's the same people everywhere it's uh the same things every week the same challenges like oh this this one again same thing different day I'm not being all depressed but I'm just telling you that's how that's when when so um when they referring when I think Solomon referring to the evil days he's talking about this what happens in the human mind that how it unfolds and so you can if you don't watch it you can start to get dis dis excited about life if that's the right word disenchanted yeah now we're making up new words here that's why I never liked English because they don't let you make up new words you know like it's a subject you know if someone says a wrong word they're like no that's not a word it's like why not if I say it and someone else understands it we can it can be a word you know this ain't math 1 plus one is two this is this is where communic if we want to do that to communicate then we do that you know we communicate how we want disenchanted you become disenchanted with life I've always if you can liken it to the simple here a simple analogy I may have said this one before but I heard a brother talking about him and his wife would you know when they had a car like this we had an old car like this growing up too with the old bench seats along the front so you can sort of fit three or four on there Mom Dad and about four kids on the bench seat um but you know they're driving along one day and the he's driving and she's sitting over by the window and she says they American honey she says to him honey do you remember when uh remember we used to sit so close together honey you remember that oh and he's sitting there driving and he says I haven't moved but somewhere along the line the excitement of was sitting there slowly waned and she just slowly moved away and then now it's by the that side I haven't moved but excitement changed it caused it to go that way okay and you as you go through life you start to understand you you you look at it and you think this is sort of just doing the same thing week after week month after month year after year until it's all over it's just sort of going like this just going around like H this thing's just going round and round and around it's it's we're not really going anywhere it's just we're just living and then we die you know that and that's why um Solomon said the thing that has been is that which shall be he's like it's the same thing just a different time uh and that which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing under the sun because we get excited by new things you realize Not A lot's new you know you start to perceive this uh is there anything wherefore that may be said see this is new it has been already of old time which was before us this is not depressing this is just reality of how your brain starts to perceive as you and as you go the now we're talking the natural course of life now right we're not talking as a Christian this is why you get old depressed people because they most people naturally go this way now they fight with psychology to try and be happy and be excited about life and they're trying every trick in the book to remain excited about life but you know deep down they hate it you know you see that you see some people are just really hanging on to try and still be ex but they're not really but unfortunately you can get some Christians without the I don't know if they've got really got an unfilling with the Holy Ghost and the life of God and then because okay maybe I shouldn't say this but some people are a little bit like this you know they're kind of a depressed old a Christian life's just so hard and I'm just looking forward to it all being over so I can wait it out till the Rapture or death you know you know you've heard that they're not excited about nothing you know it's like what I'm going out the blaze of glory man don't know what you're doing usually this way of thinking is because I think if you don't have the Holy Ghost and that real life in you you've you've naturally taken the course of the natural way you're just mentally trying to think up some good things about it you know and you end up with this sort of attitude of uh you know I can't wait for the SW to be over because it's just you know it's you're actually you're just sort of patched up but even I I think this is correct to a degree even brother brandom did suffer from the slightly when he began to lose his love for the people because he realized this is just the same thing over and over again I try to help that person they just they don't listen that one goes this one and then yeah they're here that week and gone and they you know it it it became a bit I think I think when he first started it would have been like so much hope and long suffering not that he ever went really bad but you know it was just the when you continually see it maybe go the other way with it he he did begin to get a bit more like here we go again you know and he actually himself admitted I've kind of lost my love for the people or not lost I'm losing it so you had to re jig how he thought to make sure I don't want to go down that path you know I want to be excited when someone says they want to receive the Lord I want to move forward even if it's the H hundredth time they've done it and it's the same person I want to be excited Yep this could be the time the1st time could be the time praise God you know why not you know I'm I'm still excited about this you know we don't want to lose that that way but just to cap off this thought then we'll swing back around another way Winston Churchill you know Winston Churchill was the Prime Minister of England and he he he would he had an exciting life you could say very exciting and and he he led the Allies through um World War II Britain and that and it was a you know there were you think of his day at any given day amongst these especially these three or four five years of World War II was he was a busy man a lot of stuff going on every single day and even the buildup to it and his his everything and he lived what you would term a very exciting life I don't think there was one day to the next there was the same you know very exciting and he he wrote that um speech it said we shall not flag or fail we shall go on to the end we shall fight in France we shall fight on the Seas and oceans we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air we shall defend our Island whatever the cost may be we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the Hills we shall Never Surrender this guy was an exciting guy you know you hang around this guy it's probably an exciting life but you know what his last words were before he died these were his last words I'm bored with it all famous last words in a sense he's right he sort of he' done all the international politics and everything it's like even at that level it's all the same this one's upset with that one he's upset it's just like being in a schoolyard little tussles except this country she was tussling with that one and they want this and I'll give me that toy back and know he came and took this you know it's just like oh man I'm bored with it all honestly you know now but for a Christian for a Christian now is it an ex is it uh do we as we progress in life do we go to an evil day or do we go to an exciting day I choose an exciting day I choose to be excited by the things of the Lord I ch choose that actually I'm not going that same way I I choose that I choose that that when I receive Christ I receive a life in me that grows this thing's growing so even if my natural life and everything seems to be going the other way there's something else some me that's just growing every year it's growing it's changing it's Mak it's new it's there new things happening it's exciting I'm excited by life because there's there's a there's a life of me that's growing and in 5 years time even if I look like I'm a whole lot older a whole lot more worn out I'm going to be more excited because there's something growing more and more in me every single day week month there's a life in me and and and that's why Jesus said I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly more abundantly as the days go on it's more abundant every day so so the older you get the more abundant your life becomes because you have it more abundantly the the the bigger this life when you becomes as you grow this life becomes bigger and bigger so it's like man this is so exciting what's it going to be next year you know it's so exciting it's that's why I say the other person that's all down about life trying to be a Christian it's like maybe you haven't got that life in you that actually makes you new and and and the scripture that says it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not they are new Every Morning his mercies are new every morning every morning I wake up there's something new from the lord it's exciting Lord what is it today what what new Mercy have you got for me today what what new compassion what new word what what new thing have you got for me today it's exciting it's not we're not bored we're excited we're we're we're happy to be alive it says but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength the old we get we seem to get weaker and weaker but it's like my strengths is renewed as I wait upon the Lord I get renewed day by day they shall run and not be R they shall walk and not faint we we have we have this life in us and we have these promises and we have this eternal God that never gets bored and never gets UND disenchanted never gets disenchanted he's he's always there's always energy and excitement and power and things flowing out from him we happened that it's just always coming our way it's always making us excited even when we're old we're excited about life we're excited to be alive we're happy to be alive we wake up happy and joyful because the life of God is in us I was wondering one time I thought why do I like fly fishing so much what is it about fly fishing that I enjoy you know it's kind of catching the fish I guess but when I thought deeper into it I thought you know the exciting thing for me about fly fishing especially on a river I don't do Lake because it's very boring because you can see where you're going but on a river the rivers take twists and turns and if it's especially if it's a New River even if it's an old River it doesn't it's still the same but newer ones are slightly better than old ones but you just never know what's around the corner you're like if there's nothing in this pool it's all right just around there there might be a better pool and a better fish in there and you're like oh I'll go there and before you know you've burnt like 2third of the day walking up and you're like oh man I got to walk all the way back down and it's going to be but you you forget about it because you're so excited okay there's something around the next corner you get there you f it oh this I just want to go up where I can see up there there's something there it's the excitement of actually weaving up but you know we as Christians you know when you labor for the kingdom of God there should be the same excitement about about finding a lost sheep to to searching it out you think maybe just maybe maybe this week I'll find them maybe maybe something's going to happen here it's it should be exciting it excites us is what's going to happen on on this journey of Life what will I come across as I Journey who who will I meet who will I talk to How Will I unfold you know it's exciting uh and you realize the Angels get excited when one of those lost sheep gets found they get really excited these these these angels it says likewise I say there is joy in heaven and the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth they get excited man they they're they're watching this thing unfold and they think oh will this person repent they did they they're so excited there's a story of the um the this is this is the armor and Company it's actually called the armor and Company it was a big um it was actually a big meat Works company and then they would buy ranches and then all the meat would go from the ranches back to there be Pro processed this was the company that brother B talked about in Chicago very big company and they were having the you know they they were having that bit of a shindig down in some Ranch in Texas or wherever it was these guys were from Chicago and the boss of sun was going to be there and and all the girls there were trying to get this this um the boss's son you know to maybe go and have a b life but brother brandham tells the story and he he tells the story of the washwoman you know and that and eventually the the boss of son went and saw the washwoman and said you know it's I've been looking at all the girls and you know you you I've seen all their type cuz I see them in Chicago and everywhere but I I see a character in you that I just really like and I admire you know and and I you're the sort of girl I'm looking for you know and he said I'd like you to come back with me and I'll take you out of this little place where you're in these washing these dishes and I'll take you back to Chicago I got Mansions up there well take I'll take you back there so he would say I'll come back in a year's time and I'll I'll come and get you you be ready cuz I'm going to come and get you when we're we're out of here you can't tell me that for the next 364 days she wasn't excited every day she was excited and as the time went on she's more excited every day as it went on 1 2 3 4 5 and as the days counted down she's more excited you know and and and it should be the same with us we're actually invited to the same thing to this marriage supper to this the consumation of all things to this place to be with the lord it's like okay if it didn't happen today that means technically it's one day closer like it's exciting I'm excited we're excited I've got I've got something to look forward to I'm not just going to the grave and it's all done all over and boring I've got something exciting to look forward to like her suddenly the dishes weren't so hard the next day just everything became easier all of her jobs became easier she was a model employee after that like even more than what she was before cuz she was excited that someone had given her a promise to come back and get her and take her out of there it was exciting suddenly her life was exciting and and uh what else excites us is say the revelation of the word excites us when we get Revelation and this is Brother adan's word the stimulation of Revelation s you know it it the the word comes in and it it strikes the seed in us like and we get excited that it's Revelation excites us you know so so we can we can live in a total mundane looking sort of life and be so excited in our hearts because the the the the revealed word is continuing to excite us it comes in and we're excited we're like this is so exciting what are you excited about everything you can be in a meatworks cutting meat all every day and be excited in your heart you know we we it doesn't matter then circumstances don't matter anymore because there's an excitement that we get that's deeper than all that you know the eagle when the eagle was in the chicken Coupe and it heard the Eagles cry you can't tell me it didn't get excited what's that what am I hearing ctis all shot up and it was a good feeling I thought I like that and then ctis all shot up I thought this is exciting what is that this is something new I recognize this you know that the word excites the gene seed of God that's in US it pure word of God it just excites us when we hear it and when we go to fellowship and we're in the spirit of God and we get a and then the Lord just reveals something else to us it excites us that we leave church excited we're so excited we leave listening to a tape excited uh and and when things happen when the Lord does things in our life we get excited it's like the woman at the well she after she had she had that experience with the Lord she got so excited ran down to the Village come look who I found you know they're like What's gotten over here the Lord did the the the spirit of God got over her and it excited her about things suddenly they like man haven't seen her like that before she's excited seeing God fulfill his word excites us that's why we have testimonies you know someone we we're hearing a testimony and we're waiting to see what's going to happen what's going to happen we know what's going to happen we know it's going to turn out all right but we're just we're so excited what's going to happen what are they going to say are they going to get healed are they and they do yes I knew they would praise the Lord we're excited you know we we see the Lord move and work we get excited it excites us there's there's um and even anticipation excites us when we going through something we think now it's all going to be all right don't worry the Lord's going to do something and I'm excited to see what it is if you don't think like that you should I'm excited to see what he's going to do oh you're at Rock Bottom there's only one place from here then that's up it should be it's exciting it's not like if you don't believe it's like oh well down at the bottom I'll probably just go even and lie you know someone will dig a hole and fall in that you know but Faith excites us because it it we we have faith in this word of God and we think this is exciting like Caleb you know he said hey I'm I'm twice the age of what I was back then but I'm still excited we can still take the land that still excites me um I've got as much Faith as I had did back then because it's the same faith and then it's just it's still going his body looked a whole lot older but he was still excited he was excited to go and he was excited when he was 40 and he was excited when he was 80 uh laboring in the body of Christ excites us we we see growth it's exciting we we see people grow on the law we see Souls come in things happen and different things and excites us it's an exciting and it excites us because in our mind we know it's for an eternal purpose so it's not just this going around this wheel like I like I film a lot of basketball and things like that know year after year after year we film these basketball tournaments and things and then you realize after about the fifth year you're like this tournament is just a new crop coming in go on it and chucked out and they win this Trophy and then the six we and they grab it and then that stays and they and they grab the trophy you know and you think this is all standing still like what's this all for they get it they then they put it back there another person tries to get it it's just a it's like this is a complete waste of time this is pointless just what are we doing here for Te what are we here for but the the the value that you get out of achieving it doesn't last you know but but but when you understand Eternal things and eternal value then then as a Christian you're excited when you see Eternal things happening you see a soul life change and grow you think this is I can rejoice in this you get a shot of cortisol in your head you're excited like cuz this is good this is eternal that that that person was lost now they found this person had that they were struggling with that now they're free from it and they're I can see they're happy you know there's things happening in their life that's why you know when you see growth in the body of Christ it excites you it's exciting or and and then seeing God work in your own life excites you it's exciting you're like because you're you're your favorite subject put your hand up if you're not brother man you need to talk to your wife about speaking the truth now Jing If we're honest we are our favorite subject you know and we should be no one else is really going to look out for us ultimately like I love a little I love that maybe I shouldn't say this I love that about little kids you know they're all me me me and I'm and like oh just settle down a little Johnny but like now hang on if Little Johnny doesn't say me who's going to Little Johnny's got to say me Little Johnny thinks he's important if he doesn't say me he gets no Lolly so let little Johnny say me you know yeah sure you learn to go online and all that sort of stuff but that's good because what if God didn't make us like that you know we'd go and you know get no food and die in the corner you know it's good I like that uh and even about your job you know you I don't know why I put this one in there but you can start to see the Lord work and you maybe in your career and you you just see them work there you think Lord I'm happy about this job and they just I don't know maybe a same job is at two different things to a Christian it's something amazing to someone else your work man it's like this job but it could be two different things for a Christian because you think the Lord's put me here for a purpose I I really feel I'm in the right place I'm liking doing this uh you know you you you have family and you can see the Lord work in your family and there maybe ups and downs but you know you you just it's exciting to just watch it all unfold and hold it stand on to the promises of God and um this one here is very exciting when you work in your calling when you start to realize this is what my calling is this is my these are my talents and you start to use them it's exciting you get excited you're like I'm so happy I can I'm so happy I I know what I'm supposed to be doing for the Lord I know how many talents I've got and I can be doing them for the Lord I'm so excited this is good fun I can wake up every morning and I'm excited because I get to I get to live for the Lord I get to to live out my purpose I'm not just here on this wheel going you know trophy next one trophy next one I get to I'm excited because I'm I'm laboring for the Lord I'm I'm doing my calling and if you don't know what your calling is or what your talents are you should really diligently try and figure what out what that is because that's a very important part of being a Christian once you get saved you need to know why am I here and what are my talents and then you need to start doing them because if you don't you'll probably just go I didn't go this one you'll probably just go this direction you'll just fill up your life with other stuff and it'll be a very boring life be very unfulfilling but when you you know I've just got a few more than I'm done here this is this is Paul and this is a timeline of Paul's life now Paul actually started his ministry at about the time when the evil day begins roughly he he got he was converted they say about 30 he was converted so so theoretically as a natural man life for him should have been sort of slowly going downhill from there but that's when his ministry started and he just started going up from there and and and when you think when you put yourself in Paul's shoes you realize so Paul he he was for about three years he was um he sort of just went and sought the Lord and then he then he went to Jerusalem then I think his first missionary journey was was it 60 55 I think and so this this guy was pushing 50 that's not not a young man and he's going out being Shipwrecked stoned beaten starving this a 50-year old man and then throw him in prison and and then this man is almost pushing 60 when he when he was going over to from ceria to Rome to be in prison and when he got Shipwrecked and then they he went onto the aisle of um uh the Greek people it's out in the middle of the Mediterranean uh no it's a Malta Malta yeah but I think they name is something else yeah I could be wrong but I think it I it's molter I think because it's in the middle in the shipping Lane so this man's this man's pushing 60 and he's he's out traveling the world roughing it on a ship and all that you'd think he should be tired and exhausted but he's going for it at 60 he's going for it and we complain you know we get to 30 we're like I'm getting too old for this too old for that to for the other thing this man wasn't getting too old for nothing he was going for it because he had a strengthen them that was renewed day by day and he was and then and then he's thrown in jail at 60 and and and he said to this is and then that's when he wrote second Timothy which is one of the last books he wrote he wrote second Timothy and he wrote to Timothy he said for I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I've kept the faith I've lived an exciting life I'm excited and I'm excited where it's going to go from here on you know so then I say to you then that waking up in the morning excites you tomorrow morning and wake up so excited I'm so excited to be alive man look at look at what lays before me today so much opportunity this may sound a little bit morbid but I had a when I was studying doing film I had the my film teacher um he was really good but he was a bit sort of he was kind of a morbid sort of guy like we would study his films he made because it was he couldn't really get rights to other films so for the film course we would study his ones and they were always like these weird horror ones and stuff like that you know he was a bit weird and always had this demonic symbolism in them and stuff was and um later on four three or four years after I finished the course he got I guess it was a bad cancer and that and um and he started essentially Facebooking blogging his he was a Aid Facebook user anyway but he started sort of blogging his journey of I suppose you'd say death you know well it was but he would always talk about what he was up to anyway so this was not nothing new for him he was just explaining what was happening so so one of them was um so then he began to say as he got older uh weaker and weaker he could hardly walk anymore and that he he would put out a a a Facebook post in the morning and say I woke up again I woke up this morning and I was alive again Pamela thinks it's rather lovely the way I open my eyes and say I'm alive don't know how long this can keep up for it seems to be working for now but I found that so interesting when I read it this man wakes up he says whoa I'm alive I'm alive and when was last you did that you know I'm alive like he was surprised to be alive another day then so he posted that one day then the next day I thought wonder if this man's still alive so I checked his Facebook post the next day I'm still here here I am I'm alive next post you know Phil Davison passed away this time he's gone but I like that I kind of thought you know I want to be like that man I'm alive wow I've got another opportunity to live because there's a scripture that says whatsoever the hand find this to do do it with thy might for there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave whether thou goest once your time's up your time's up it's done there's nothing else it's over so why not make the most of it here do all that you can do be excited about the things of the Lord don't don't be scared be excited this I just going to finish with one of these this one story here this lady Helen Keller don't know if you've read much about her but um when she was I think 19 months she got some got an illness that made her blind and deaf so so this woman couldn't see or couldn't hear she could communicate slightly because she did learn to talk in those first few in the first few years slightly but um there was a lady her parents wanted to try and teach this girl somehow to communicate with the world because before that she would just kind of she could hear footsteps and she could maybe do about 60 hand signals to say maybe come or go or whatever it might be just quite rudimentary one so she couldn't communicate with the world or connect in any way and they there was a lady an Sullivan that her parents brought in to try and help this girl to help her in some way to connect with the world to communicate because they knew she was very intelligent she wasn't dumb she just couldn't communicate and it was funny because Helen K said that the day that Anne Sullivan arrived she calls that the birthday of her soul because of the impact that this woman had on her now what this woman tried to do to get through to Helen was she tried writing on her hand um words so letters which form a words so so Helen had a doll so she would write she would try and point to the doll and write d o o l d o l l on her hand um and but Helen didn't know why she was doing it and she would actually learn to copy the words and write it back on her hand just by feel because she would feel what she did so she'd do it back but she didn't know that it was to do with the doll like she would touch the doll and do that and she tried to do it with a a mug you know and write m u and have hold the mug but Helen got so frustrated she just took the mug and threw it away cuz she's like what on Earth is are you trying to do cuz she couldn't connect you're trying to tell me what words are cuz she didn't know what words were imagine that she didn't understand this concept what are these things like I don't know what a word is I don't know what a letter is now this this lady is a Christian lady Helen I don't know maybe it was after that she got converted but she so uh so she couldn't she didn't know why this person an was trying to do this with her and all she got was frustrated was maybe weeks she just got frustrated until one day they were walking outside and there was a little there was this Fountain here and I think an had an idea and so she put her hand under the fountain with the water flowing on her hand and she wrote in the other hand water w a t e r so she had the sensation on her hand and she wrote water and Helen said something went off in her mind and she thought maybe that is connected to that what is that what is this write it again and she would spell it back and something clicked and she thought that's a way to communicate she's trying to reach me and she just latched on to it like wouldn't believe and I think it she was learning 30 new words a day just word word word word word she just this lady ended up writing like 16 books and all sorts of stuff just like not from she went from not even knowing what words were to like just words were everything to her because she couldn't see she couldn't hear but I think it was just the mercy of the Lord that she could then do this but she's got a quite a neat quote and it says security is mostly a Superstition it does not exist in nature nor do the children of men as a whole experience it avoiding danger is no longer is no safer in the long run than outright exposure life is either a daring Adventure or nothing so take that from a blind deaf woman life is either a daring Adventure or nothing be excited about it don't be don't let this cortisol thing make you anxious make it be excited don't let an enemy think I know he's going to get me think I'm excited because the Lord's going to defeat that enemy I want to finish with one pem and I I just always like this pem because it sort of encapsulates how we should be towards life and that you know the excitement that we should have and this was brother R quoted this poem a lot from this old man Henry Longfellow and it says Tell Me Not in mournful numbers life is but an empty dream for the soul is dead that Slumbers and things are not what they seem life is real life is earnest and the grave is not our goal thus Thou Art to dust return us was not spoken of the Soul not enjoyment and not sorrow is our destined end or way but to act that each tomorrow finds us further than today art is long and time is fleeting and our heart so Stout and brave still like muffled drums are beating funeral marches to the grave in this world's field of battle in the bwack of Life be not like dumb driven cattle be a hero in The Strife trust no future however pleasant Let the dead Let the dead pass bury the dead act act and the living present heart within and God overhead lives of Great Men all remind us we can make our lives Sublime and departing leave behind us footprints in the sands of time footprints that perhaps another sailing over life solemn man a fallong and

can call you my K hallelujah hallelujah amen glory to God hallelujah and you thankful for that amen praise the Lord you want to take your seats uh Hannah's got a testimony from Camp you like this year amen praise the Lord thank you hello everyone I'm not used to seeing you all here in front of me so it's good to see you guys after a week um my testimony is a a bit of a longer one so I hope I don't take too long sharing it but it started back at the Aly Camp I felt like it was a very very slow camp for me compared to what happened the year before so I thought what am I doing here you know I've already got my salvation who doesn't Tamer so I start praying for tamer in the services I start praying I said Lord I've got my salvation but I've got a friend a friend in a dorm and she's not SA Lord so I pray and I pray and for me personally I don't think it's very I'm not really outgoing when it comes to things like telling people to come places or saying come to church with me I'm not I don't really do that I sort of just let people be influenced by my life and decide if they want to do it themselves but for some reason when Tam was there and we were sitting there we were talking about how fun it was that we were at camp together and she was you know we're in the dining hall having a little snack and she was like it's so much fun here Hannah and I said yeah you know there's a Youth Camp She said said I said you should come she said are you paying I said I can she said I'll just come then why not so T came to Youth Camp She which is a miracle in itself but I thought wow that's that's quite strange you know why why did she come to Camp so in the weeks leading up to Camp I was praying a lot and that's unfortunately a bit unusual for me to pray so much about something until I get an answer but then on the Sunday before I think it was the the Sunday that we left to go camping brother Ben was standing up here talking about how he was wanted to go to Pap and new getting a minister but he didn't know the language and God told him just go and I'll do the rest so I took that for myself and I said look I'm not going to say anything I'm not going to push anything I'm just going to go I'm just going to bring her with me and see what happens so I went I went to Camp with t and t doesn't really like doing things if she doesn't really want to do them so she didn't go to any of the service but she was there for the small things like the testimonies she was there for the the prayers before the meals because she likes the meals and then there was one point when I'd been I've been going through so much during this Camp I would say it's the most awful Camp I've ever been through not because of the people not because of the place but just because in my mind everything was going hay I just all my insecurities all my flaws everything that I could think about about myself was just being thrown at me and I was like why am I here what am I I doing here and then I think it was after just days and days of this just being attacked I got to the last service and it was halfway through and I'm staring up at this preacher I'm like I don't like you and I don't know why this whole thing's a share I'm like what am I doing here and then I think you know if I can't be here present for myself I might as well be here for Tam so I'm sitting there and I'm watching the preacher I'm staring at him I'm saying if you're going to preach brother you better to preach cuz I'm here to listen to you and you better to preach something for me right now and he doesn't but it's all right cuz I was present then and I was thinking you know if I can't be here for me I've got to be here for Tam so there was a prayer line and I was waiting and I thought no I'm just going to sing for a little bit I'm not going to go up and I'm waiting and waiting and all of a sudden a song comes on and I know this song and I stand up I say this is the time so I got and I joined the prayer line and it was a really long prayer line and it's lots of time for the anointing to wear off and you're standing there you're like oh dear can I turn around now I don't want to go through this prayer line Lord I don't like people praying for me I don't like this at all and I get up there and I'm one person away from the preacher and the preach is standing there he's praying for the person in front of me and everything just getting so much worse and he's got one trump card and it's it's this card that says you do not like being prayed for remember what's happened before you could the same thing could happen to you if this preacher puts his hands on you and I was standing there I was like nope you know what I just I do anything for Tam anything even if it meant that I could go through the same thing that I went through i' do it again for Tam so I was stand there and I said Lord if there's anything in my life that would stop me now from being somebody who could pray for Tam whole hearted if there's anything that would come out of my own in this prayer I just I ask you'd take it away from me Lord and then and then it's my turn you know the person in front's moved on and I'm standing there and I'm just thinking let's just get this over done with you know let's just move through this he doesn't know anything about me what's he going to pray some kind of generic prayer like this guy doesn't have a clue so this preacher standing he's not he's not you know bringing me forward so I'm waiting there and I you know sneak a little peek I'm like what's he up to and he's just standing there singing okay what's what's the brother up to so he pulls me and he leans down he says sister are you here for yourself or for someone else I opened my eyes I stand up straight I said what he said are you I Saidi here for someone else he said God told me to ask you that and this man who doesn't know me he doesn't know T he doesn't know anything about the situation leading up to Camp he prays with me for T of salvation and then as I leave the line I just I feel there's a revelation in my heart I think okay she's safe it's okay you know my sincerity touched God I was willing to go through anything for her and I'd sacrific everything for her God saw that and now we're on the same page fighting the same battle but it's funny because this preacher when he was praying for me he started praying about these these men who you know when their friend had policy I think it was and Jesus was preaching in a house they climbed to the top of the house and they cut a hole in the roof and they let their friend down and he was praying for me and he's like thank you Lord for the sister who's who's come all this way to let her friend into the house or something like that you know he referred to it very heavily and then I come back and and this doesn't happen to me but I get an urge I think wouldn't it be great just while I'm you know cleaning my room I put on last week's sermon like the good little Christian I am and I turn it on and one of the scriptures that Ben used was the one from Luke where his friends let the guy with py down into the house Hallelujah so it's just a lot of things happened that camp and I think that we're going to see the fruits of it because it's just small things but as we were leaving I was pretty tired and you know I was waiting for for my friends to be picked up from the factory and Tam's over there and she's being really annoying you know she's like in my ear but she's in my ear singing I'm so blessed Hallelujah I'm blessed I'm so blessed Hallelujah I'm blessed and she doesn't know that song but she learned at a camp because I prayed I prayed that t would come to Camp so I just want to say that if you see T coming to church it's because I prayed for it okay amen thank you amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen we believe in a miracle working God don't we we believe protocols coming home don't we Hallelujah thanks for that Hannah I appreciate that praise the Lord amen our God is real Hallelujah well God bless you friends you're dismissed in Jesus Christ's name take the name of Jesus with you amen go excited God's going to do incredible things there's a lot of space here lot of space here it's going to get filled up I believe it that's just me maybe just emotional but hey let's expect it let's be excited to see prodal come home glory to God God bless you all [Music] for [Music] h I [Music] h [Music]
