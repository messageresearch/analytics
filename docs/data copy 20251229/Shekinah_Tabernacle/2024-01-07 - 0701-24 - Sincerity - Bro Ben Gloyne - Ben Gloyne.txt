it's interesting we were driving to church this morning and U Christine basically preached my whole sermon to the girls so they've already heard it we don't talk I I don't talk to her about what I preach on so amen anyway so they've already heard this but but they can still listen Okay amen amen so 1 Corinthians 5 and we'll read verses 6 to8 and then we're going to go to Hebrews 11:6 so uh this is the Apostle Paul this is the Lord speaking to the Corinthians your glorifying is not good know you not that A little leaven leth the whole lump Purge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even Christ Our Passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leav of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth amen and then we go to Hebrews 11 verse 6 you don't need to turn if you don't want to I can just read it here but but without faith it's impossible to please him he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen Let's uh let's pray this morning shall we you want to be be remember in pray you want to raise your hand before the Lord amen gracious father we so thankful Lord we truly do long to worship you and we are so thankful it's uh it's not even a human Desire by itself Lord It's you put that in US Lord that we long to be in your presence Lord we long to walk with you and know you more and so Lord may you pour your spirit out more and more this service Lord May touch each life dear God may as we have read your great word Lord we need you the great author to come now Lord and speak from it dear God may you just take over this service anoint speaker and hearer Lord anoint those who may be watching by the way of the internet too dear God and may you take control Lord may you wash us in your blood Lord cover us under The Shadow of Your Great Wings this morning we thank you for this privilege to gather together Lord we love you and we thank you have your way Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats this morning so I want to talk about sincerity this morning I know I've you know you know in the past year we talking talking about selfishness and different things but I want to go into sincerity because we need to be I believe this is the hour where we need to be more sincere than ever you walking with the Lord in this in this world of indifference and lukewarmness I'm so thankful we can we can have a real Godly sincerity am me so so the Apostle Paul was was instructing the Corinthians that you know you got to purge out the old leaven you got to you can't continue walking as you have been walking but there's got to be a purging go on now we know Liv we we we talk about it is yeast it's the same thing but you know yeast or leaven has a has the ability of changing a dough into a completely different structure it will spread from one part of the dough it'll go all the way through the dough and then by the time the leaven has gone through the dough and raised it it's actually a different composition chemical composition to when it began that's right and that's the way with living in our life we can start off with a little thought maybe a little deed maybe a little action and it will eventually spread all the way Liv is sin right that's what I'm talking about sin can spread all the way through our life to change our all of our thinking our Outlook our nature everything can be changed because of sin but we're called to purge out the old Liv we're called to purge out amen sin and we know sin ultimately is unbelief and I'm so thankful we have the power of the blood this morning that we can be purged that this is not just a human Reformation or turning a new Leaf of a new year but God can change us because we know we serve a transforming God God is the one who does the changing he says you know Pur out the old leav so so this old leaven is your old ways your old nature it's got to be purged out even your old religious ideas are got to be purged out anything contrary to the word has got to be burned in the fire you know we can't we can't hold on to our old ways we got to get rid of it just like the you know the children of Israel when they left Egypt under the under the anointing of God led by the pillar of fire you know they still had a slave mentality and they said we cannot take the lands that slave mentality of unbelief stopped them entering into the promises of God entering into their promise so you know they they needed a purging of that nature and God that's why God delivered them with a mighty hand to show them you don't have to live with that slave mentality you don't have to live under that unbelief no more I I have brought you out with a mighty hand you did not deliver yourself I have delivered you to walk with me Amen to enter into the promised land and that's what God has done with us today we need to realize that God has done a mighty work and he's not finished working he's not finished changing lives amen he is still the same yesterday today and forever and if we just settle back and just have church and go through the motions I say we have completely missed the Mark I mean but if we push the prize of the High Calling we really push and we say Lord I want more of you in my life you've done many things but I want more I want to see you live again I want to see you come and do the supernatural Change My Heart Lord I want my heart to be soft towards you that your word can affect me and change me amen I trust that's everyone's desire this morning we want God's word to change us amen we don't want to just fill our heads with ideas but we want our hearts to be changed amen yes sir so he says to purge out the old leav the old thinking the old way of life and and also the leav of malice and wickedness now malice we know ultimately is having an evil intent it's not having a genuine motive amen we want to get rid of malice we don't want any you know preconceived ideas or alterior motives when we deal with one another or we speak to people or you know we want to be pure in our motives right we want to be sincere we don't want to have anything that you know Shady deals or anything like that we we must not have those things now sincerity here just go to the definition here it says you means of clearness that's by implication of Purity and the root word of that which is the next one down I won't try and pronounce it in the Greek it's it's judged by sunlight that is tested as genuine and we know the real sunlight that will test a sincerity is the sunlight of the light of God the S so n light amen that really you know it's amazing we can even deceive ourselves when we come into His presence that's all gone I mean if we're really genuine in our hearts we can have all these ideas and motives but you step into his presence realize that was wrong that was selfish that was that was evil that was perverted that was wrong thinking that was unbelief what's that it's been tested by sunlight I mean but I want to be in his presence where there's nothing I've got to put right cuz it was already put right I mean it was just rejoicing and Thanksgiving and praising God and amen that you I trust that's how everyone feels this morning so it's all but it's also the absence of pretense deceit or hypocrisy that is sincerity so you don't have any pretense nothing you know no no no preconceived ideaself selfish motives is not deceitful so you cannot be sincere and be deceitful you cannot be amen you cannot be sincere and be a hypocrite amen so to pretend to be one thing and be the other amen we you know that's not sincerity now right so we must not we must not approach this Feast of the word of God in any of these things we must be genuinely sincere amen and this is the hour where where we need to be very sincere now I'm just you know as always my notes are never in chronological order I don't know wife and but you know brother Bram would would would would have a vision in the message Paradox I'm just going to read portion of it it's very important because what he saw in vision is is is very much roaming the land today and it takes sincerity to bind it you know we we don't live we don't talk about a God and just talk about a God you know we this is not a lecture hall this is not a theory Center this is not a hypothetical Idea Place no our God is God Jesus Christ is alive amen he is the resurrected God he is not a theory he's a person he's a being he's the almighty God Amen so so this is this is not Theory we're talking about but this power is being placed in your lips I mean to bind or loose the devil it's up to you what you can loose them in your life by unbelief you can loose them in your life by selfishness you can loose the devil if you want to you can put up with him and you'll just have your pretty party and you'll go nowhere but you can bind him say Satan I'm not serving you I'm not putting up with your nonsense no more but you belong under my feet you have power to do it amen amen so he says here in this Vision he says it was about 3:00 in the morning I suppose I'd gotten up I looked where in front of me and I was coming down to the Jordan looked like I was I'm coming on the map of standing on the map of Palestine and I was coming down to the Jordan it seemed like I could hear the song I'm going down to the Jordan someone was singing it and as I drew near the river I looked back it seemed which way I had come and I was 2third of the way there to the Jordan and I looked across the Jordan I said oh praise God just on the other side is where all the promises lay every promise lays in the promised land now we know that our promised land is the Holy Ghost right it's not a physical piece of real estate somewhere it is all in Christ is our Promised Land every promise lays in him amen amen then as I sat there a little bit aside of this chair then all of a sudden there uh there it come back again then I knew it was a vision and then when IID come into the vision again it seemed like I was lifted up standing on a highway a narrow Highway with some brother I never knew who the brother was I looked around I said now I am sure I know this is Vision the Lord God is here and seemed like everybody was afraid this is a age of fearfulness what's Russia going to do what's China going to do what's North Korea going to do what's the economy going to do what's happening in our schools our homes all these things it's a fearful time right I said what's everybody afraid of and a voice came and said there is such danger in these days there is a great hideous thing that's death when it strikes you and I heard the weed mashing down and I looked and there was a huge monster snake crawling through the weeds I thought now knowing this is Vision then I shall see what this animal all this Beast is and he crawled up on the highway and as soon as I got sight of him I knew it was a Mamba now a Mamba is an African snake which is the most deadly bite of all the um thing there is there's nothing as poisonous as a mumber and the snake of course represents sin death sea and there is that we have in this country the the the rattlesnake and the copperhead and and and the cottonmouth moccasin many of those snakes that is if you're in bad Health the one would bite you it would perhaps kill you but if but if you didn't get um Aid of some sort right away and here he was on the highway and I thought well this is it so I looked at him and he looked angry at me and he licked his tongue and here he come but when but when he got right close to me he would run up fast and then he would get slower and slower and just quiver and stop now we know a mum in the natural will get up on its hand and actually run you know it's actually faster than a human I'm glad we don't have those things here in New Zealand and they will strike multiple people and they'll all be poisoned and get killed a very aggressive thing and that's like sin death is very aggressive but you see as this as this as this snake here would come come towards the prophet you know it it got slow and slower as it Advanced and then it couldn't get any closer to him amen and then see and then something and then something would hold him off he couldn't bite me now that's how important the baptism of the Holy Ghost is in this day I mean the devil will try and come come towards you he'll Advance he'll get angry at you but he's nothing but a bluff if you have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost amen he won't be able something will keep holding him off and now that's exactly what God does because he's our protector amen he's our Shield he's our he's our Mighty Fortress he's all of these things so when the enemy tries to strike you with spiritual death amen he can't bite you he may try and bite you he may he may chase after you he may breathe out his threatenings and his cursings and his he'll say I'm going to get you I'm going to destroy you but there's something that keeps holding him off and it's not religion it's not being a good person it's not just coming to church it's God on the inside of the inside it's when the Holy Ghost comes in amen the devil can't bite you with his poison fangs of unbelief that you totally deny the word see something he couldn't bite me and he would turn around on the other side try to approach from this side so he tries to approach from a different trial and a different problem a different situation but he just can't bite amen and he would get back and and start and swish right towards me and get slower and slower and then and then to a stop and then he would then it would shake like that and move back he couldn't strike me now this may just be a vision but this is very important that we can grasp these things that the Lord would put this in our hearts that sure there's death riding now notice brother Bram was lifted up on a highway right there's a way of Holiness amen so this was the path of Christians walking up into canaan's Fair land up and you know up into the promises of God and death is there spiritual death is there trying to stop people get to where they need to go amen amen so so this thing will try and bite each and every one of us we're not immune from it we're not immune from problems we're not immune from the spirit of unbelief and lukewarmness trying to grip our lives and just trying to make us cold formal church members see we are not immune from those things but if we have the Lord on the inside it doesn't matter how much he threatens his F doesn't matter the size of his fangs the swish of his tail he can't bite you none amen but see notice and then he turned and looked at my friend and away he went after my friend and I seen my friend just DRP jumping way in the air and over him and over him and over him trying and everything was striking out him I thought oh if it ever hits him it'll be instant death no wonder everybody's so scared see there's people in this room even this morning that that are in this position they're running scared because they don't have what they need to keep the mum away I mean you can be blessed by being associated with Believers sure there's blessings with that but when but you need God on the inside you can't just have god with you he's got to be in you yes amen so we don't ever want to be see we don't want to be in this see I threw up my hands oh God have mercy on my brother I said if that serpent ever strikes him it'll kill him and just then the serpent turned I mean then the serpent turned to me um when I said that looked at me again and the voice came from above me said you have been given power to bind him the worst or any amen so so we have power remember when Jesus even when he just commissioned his disciples in the 70 to go out and cast out Devils this is before Pentecost and then they came back rejoicing saying even the even these you know demons are subject to us because they went and cast out the Devils they healed the sick they raised the dead they did Mighty Miracles and Jesus said I I beheld Satan fall as lightning and brother Braham said that was the church rising in power so as the church Rising power the Devil Falls from his from his squatter Place amen from his place where cuz he thinks he has dominion over this Earth and he has dominion over you and I and he has dominion over human beings but if we're under the blood of Jesus Christ if we are filled with the Holy Ghost amen what we Ascend into Heavenly places in Christ Jesus our position in Christ and the devil is cast down so even before even before Calvary even before the blood was shed even before Pentecost Jesus said I saw Satan fall yeah how much more of people that are Blood Washed Blood Bought filled with the Holy Ghost the devil is well below amen but he'll try and make you think anything but that but we see the prophet was given power to bind him the worst or any now any promise given to him is given to the believer because the same God that was in him he he was a sinner saved by grace just like you and I right he had to repent he had to be baptized he had to give his life to the Lord he had to surrender he had to be filled with the Holy Ghost just like you and I and the same God in him is the same God in you and I that's right amen so so if he was given power to bind him sin death or the worst or any then we have that same authority over the enemy I said well God what must I do he said there is one thing you must do you must be more sincere see you must be more sincere I said well God forgive me for my insincerity and let me have sincerity see this is what we must be when we see the enemy try and come into our families come into our own lives we say Lord make me more sincere this enemy is trying to come among me trying to destroy my family destroy my life so see when the enemy comes in now then is not the time to pull back it is not the time to compromise it's not the time to quit it's not the time to have a pity party you know I remember reading of um um um Charles Spurgeon there was a prominent Christian in his fellowship and he stopped coming to church and so what he did is he is is he went and saw this guy didn't talk anything about God or anything and and and and there was coals on the fire and he took the iron prod thing iron you know just pulled one Co out onto the half didn't take very long it was it was glowing right glowing white hot to begin with and then it went darker red darker and then just went black the next service that guy was in church again amen cuz he cuz he got the sermon he got the sermon he he realized he was that coal yeah but I'm on fire I'm fine here but then you pull away withdraw what happens the fire goes out you're still cold you're still a Believer you still got potential to be on fire for God but withdrawing because the Bible says forsake not the assembling of ourselves together and so much more we see that day approaching amen and we're in 24 the day right here yes amen so so we should never withdraw because because the MERS trying to destroy us no we say Lord make me more sincere make me more genuine amen take take all living out of my life Lord any thought that I think I'm the great one I'm important anything that thinks that I'm special or different or whatever more anything that I think that I can just rest and what will be will be take that living out Lord and help me to to to to call on your name more than ever before help me be more genuine more honest more sincere and when I raised my hands to him again there was a great something came over me just lifted me up seemed like my whole body was charged with something and I looked at the serpent and then he stared towards me and he couldn't do it yet I said Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I bind you and the serpent a blue smoke flew out of him he curled up made like a sign like an s a capital S backwards and an sign means buy this one or anything below him cuz he was the worst blue smoke flew out of him and his tail choked his own self to death around his head uh when he made this backwards s that an sign like a conjunction you see choked it to death and the brother was free and I went over and mashed on it am that's right he mashed on the devil that's a good how do you mash on the devil you praise God how do you mash on the devil you love the Lord more that's really because people say I'm so angry at the Devil I hate him so much well how do you express that anger love God Amen be more surrender to the Lord love him more praise him more that's the thing that gives the de black eye see it's Thunder that shakes the devil amen is a consecrated sincere life and I went over and mashed on I said now I've got to find out about this because it's a vision and I hit on the thing and it turned like this it looked like a handle like a glass handle on a picture just made of solid Crystal I said think of that how quick that blue smoke was life and everything and how um and and everything and it just left at all the elements that turned to glass that's how quickly the devil can be destroyed in your life how quick one prayer one rebuke when the Lord anoints you say Satan come out in the name of Jesus Christ you've got to leave amen it's not a big wrestling match you know there's some books out there there's big hourlong battles with the devil and big fighting that's a bunch of unbelief trying to exalt the power of the devil brother Bram didn't have big long fights in the prayer line Jesus said just come out of them and he did because there's Authority in their voices amen and that same Authority is in the Bride of Jesus Christ it's not a big wrestling match some big Hollywood nonsense no just come out of her or come out of him in the name of Jesus Christ when you feel inspired to say it amen now and the voice came again said you can unbind him too also so I said then Satan that I might know I unbind you and when it did he he started coming to life again wriggling I said I bind you back in the name of Jesus Christ and when it did the smoke flew out of him again and he choked himself right back and turned to Crystal am me we see the same thing with Moses when he came down the first sign that God gave Moses was turning a staff into a serpent picking up by the tail and became a staff again and that's the first sign that was done before Pharaoh when Moses went down to Egypt and God was God was actually telling Pharaoh actually telling Satan and Pharaoh I can bind you and I can loose you because the Cobra is the emblem of the Pharaoh there in Egypt and so he says I can bind you and I can loose you as much as I want and if that was a man under the blood of bulls and goats commissioned by God to bring a Deliverance now how much more people under the blood of Jesus Christ commissioned by God to bring and deliverance amen the same pillar of father that me Moses has met you and I amen he's commissioned us to cast out Devils wherever we find him amen he's commissioned us to set the captives free amen he has commissioned us so you say well I'm waiting for God to do something God wants you to put your faith into action amen God wants you to step on the battlefield and take him at his word he wants you to do it amen but we must be sincere we must be more sincere if you think if the prophet had to be more sincere and he is a very sincere man how much more you and I how much more gen genuine do we need to be cuz you see Proverbs it says in Proverbs 18:21 life and death is in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof amen so if you want life you want death what are you talking about what are you confessing if you're angry at God you're confessing death if you got a pity party upset cuz you're not happy with how he's running his business you're confessing death but if you just line up your confession amen with god with his word life will come amen and this what we should do amen see so we should never have we must be sincere you see many people will come to God but they're not sincere they want to try and trip him up as the Pharisees would come to the Lord Jesus and the only reason they asked him questions is to try and Tangle him in his words and his talk they weren't interested and he was the Fountain of eternal life this was this was the same God that met Moses was now in flesh but they weren't interested in in and actually this is Elohim this is Al Shai this is the Mighty God this is Jehovah God made flesh this Jesus Christ but they weren't interested in actually saying what must we do how can we serve you how can we know you better how can we walk with you like Moses did or the prophets or the Kings how can we worship you like David worshiped you how can we do these things no they because they weren't sincere they tried to entangle him in his words but yet they had their ceremonies their forms they weren't they didn't on the outwardly um appear indifferent they were very outwardly they looked very religious things but inside they weren't sincere but you see the woman at the well was a very different kind of person she was genuinely sincere I mean when when when Jesus told his disciples I need to go by the way of Samaria you know because he had a predestinated appointment with one of his children and that was a woman of ill Fame a woman we call the woman at the well she came to the well at the time when when The Other Woman didn't go because she wasn't welcome to go with them and they begin to talk about God and different things and you know she would say well our fathers worship here and worship there and different things but then but then Jesus said go get your husband and she says I have none and he said you've you've said right because you've had six and the one you you've had five and and the one you're with is not you know you're not even married and she said we know when Messiah cometh he'll tell us all these things see she wasn't trying to entangle him in in his words she was sincere yet on the outwards you think there's no hope for her she's lost she's not welcome in a church anywhere but she was generally sincere we know when Messiah cometh he'll tell us these things and Jesus said he that speaks to you am he she dropped her water pot she purged out the old Le and she dropped her old life she ran into the city said come see a man who's told me all I've ever did is this not the Messiah so she wasn't trying to entangle entangle him in his talk just like the Pharisees why cuz she was sincere you know there's there's say there's a power and sincerity which if I can find it here see brother says now it's even becoming Pentecost in the churches it's becoming into the Pentecostal Realms that they always promising something that they never get to it it's always that every fellow has a different sensation to make it whether it's scriptural or not and they're promising something that they never do get to until it seems like it's got to a place to where there doesn't seem to be any sincerity the people don't get down to that real kernel of sincerity now the kernel is where the life is in the seed so the very life of sincerity they don't seems that they don't get to that the very English word of sincerity has lost its value to the people or by the way or by the people's way of living it's lost its sincerity to them now they don't seem to understand even to our confessions now I want you people that are coming or here here to hold or on the tape I want you to listen real close now a moment to this quotation brother B says unless you're deeply sincere you cannot be sincere until your POS until you your positive understanding until you're positively understood if you're presuming or guessing or hoping so then there cannot be a depth of sincerity that God requires see if it's revealed to you it will produce a sincerity and that's what we need to pray for Lord make it a Revelation to me make every promise in your word a revelation don't just have it in my head that it sounds like a good idea make it a revelation because if it's actually if the word is actually a revelation then it will produce the sincerity then it will change the life amen see see um faith faith is not a hope so or it could be right it's got to be absolutely amen or I'll put in some kiwi lingo it's not a she'll be right that's not not Faith that's just hope that's just human hope not even Bible Hope bible hope is actually an expectation but but human hope is just a stab in the dark like people trying to win the lotto kind of thing not advocating any of that stuff but you see it's just but you see it's not a she'll be right it's got to be an absolute see um it's got to be absolutely amen it's your ultimate it's your absolute it's the thing that you're tied to see you have to come to your ultimate that is it is the truth and there is there's nothing but the truth it must be us and when you realize that in your mind then you've got to approach it with your whole life soul body that's all that's in you just completely sell out to everything to it as Jesus so graciously taught us the man buying pearls and he found the one of great price and he sold all the others to get to it all the truths and everything that he had though they were good pearls this one meant all to him am mean so it's like the saraph phenician woman who had a daughter that was grievously vexed with a devil it was was revealed to her that Jesus could cast that devil out that that this was more than a prophet it was more than just a religious man this was the god of the prophets amen so what did it do it made it it made her deeply sincere amen it made her approach deeply sincere when she approach the Lord you see even she had a lot of hindrances but her faith her Revelation didn't have any hindrance am mean because she came calling out master and Son of David have mercy on me and then even the disciples said well she's calling after us send her away and then Jesus said I haven't been sent to you I've just been sent to the lost sheep of Israel she's a gentile now someone who's insincere would get offended and say this very man who claims to heal the sick raise the dead and be here to help everyone he won't even help me and you know forget about that kind of I'm not following this kind of a God but you see she was sincere and because it was revealed to her that he had what she needed I mean even her even him trying to turn her away didn't stop her that's right I mean cuz she knew she could get what she needed am out of him it wasn't I hope this is going to work let's see what happens no it was revealed so if it's revealed it's got to happen amen but youo she said I mean you know he said to her youo it's not even fit to feed the children's bread to dogs and you know basically just calling her a dog that didn't hinder her that didn't hinder her faith rather she said true Lord but even the even the dogs eat the crumbs under the master's table the children's table and and he said great is your faith go have watch you you know you what you have need of and and she went home and found her daughter was free why what happened she had a deep sincerity I mean she saw that M was trying to destroy her daughter and she wouldn't take it just for granted saying this is just how life this is just the grab bag of life kind of thing she did not settle for that amen but she settled no there's there's a God in the land am mean Jehovah is alive this this one that Jews just told me about as alive and I'm not going to settle to I get a hold of him and he speaks the word am my my family is free and that's how we should be the same it should be revealed to us it should give us a deep sense of sincerity that that same God is alive Among Us has he not done all things well has he not cast out the devil has he not healed our sick has he not filled with the Holy Ghost has he not done many tremendous Miracles he's brought prodical home amen he's done incredible things and that should give such a sincerity because we realize if he's done it for that person he'll do it for me if he's done it for her he'll do it for me amen because why he is God and he respects faith and he's given us Faith to claim his promises and take him at his word hallelujah so this is why it's so important she approached it with her whole body soul and mind and everything she sold out completely to that thought I've got to get a hold of him I trust we're sold out today amen see the pearl of great price many times we think there's no there's no battle in obtaining the Pearl but there is there's a battle over unbelief a battle over self amen that can we lay aside our value of what we think lay it aside and take that pearl of great price which is Christ and say this is my everything not what people think about me is my everything not my not my pay scale not my job not my whatevers that's not my everything here is my everything amen amen and that's if we can just come like that I believe that God will do incredible things see we've we can't just sit back and say Lord If It Be Your Will sure now there's one part of that cuz God is in control of all things but you can sit there saying well Lord yes or no that's fine and it's actually just unbelief hindering you you say well everything's predestinated well yes or no I say if I'm predestinated I'm going to fulfill every promise that's allotted to me in the word amen if I if I'm really this word made flesh I'm going to be it amen I I'm probably going to talk about the youth service but there's a meme I just put it up there's a guy sitting there behind a computer screen you know just some person and he says you know I'm saving myself for a like a real nice virgin Trad wife traditional wife and there's the other screen where it's this girl there holy looking she's praying Lord I got to find some kind of loser who has no job no ambition no nothing I'm looking for that kind of person boy that's not what anyone I'm sure all of you sisters here are not married you don't want some man who's got no ambition drive and motive behind you you want someone who's got Vision who's got who's got the future in mind who's trying to build a life and build home and build a career okay there's some good if you want someone who's going nowhere well there's plenty of them out there but you know we don't want to but you see you can't just say what will be will be no what are you ordained to be am mean don't just sit back and say well God's got to push me through a pipe no no God don't push you through a pipe and make you overcome make you walk with him no it's got to be your own will say yes I'm coming Lord doesn't matter what obstacle what trouble I'm going to go through it Lord because you're going to take me through it amen amen so yeah anyway I'm going to I want to talk about that because it's so true man A picture speaks a th you paints a thousand words or whatever he says now now no God's provided way is the best way they got no better way for the baby to get what he wants than to cry for it you know you can put a video monitor right by your baby you can see it it doesn't sit up and push the button and say mama I'm ready for milk now no or daddy no they start crying cuz that's God's provided way there's a need and it's expressed right and it don't settle until it gets the need met that's a child you say man they're perseverant and and and Jesus said if we just need the faith of a little child I mean they are perseverant because they know the reason they CED to you is they know that you can provide that need amen they they are not guessing I wonder if I'm going to get milk today I wonder if I'm going to get fed no they know it because you've done it before and you've done it before and you've done it every day of their life until that moment and it's should be the same thing with us and God we should look into this word and see how many promises he's fulfilled amen how many miracles he's done every time the promise he has given he's fulfilled it then we should cry to God say God you did it for them now do it for me that's right there may have to be a lot of changing going on in here until the promise is fulfilled that's fine I trust you're willing to be changed see we many need to see there's nothing wrong with God we' got to get in condition for God to meet with us right just like the you know in the upper room took them 10 days to get all their carnality out of the way all their Humanity they fussing their troubles they thing until the on the day when the day of Pentecost was fully come there were one heart one mind one Accord why cuz it wasn't Clicks in the church anymore was and I think this and you think this and we think this no they got rid of all that stuff they purged out the old leaven amen that God came down and filled them yes praise the Lord now yes see as Dr BOS used to say the baby that cries the loudest gets the best service oh amen that's about the way it is that goes up for God's children I could parallel that for you if a if a man go up and say well chew is chewing gum real well says well father I'm here tonight if you want to give me the Holy Ghost you're right I'm here but if you want to you know but if you want to heal me I'm sitting here but if you don't why that's all right it's your will Lord he's done wrote the will out of here in the Bible this is your will all right this is his will right here and if you want me to have it I'll have it but nevertheless if you don't why that's all right you'll never get nowhere that's right you'll never get nowhere it may sound all very good but you'll never get nowhere that's right the violent take the kingdom by force am mean the promises of God are not taken by the jellyfish right no the promises taken by real Faith real Godly conviction and sincerity yes amen see because you see now if you don't have genuine sincerity it's a sign of lukewarmness a Blas attitude is a sign of lukewarmness we serve God we don't serve just some Spirit somewhere we serve the god that made your body made this made the materials that made your body made this made this place where you're sitting in the chairs you sit in are made out of what he spoke right the reason you're alive is he's given you breath I think we should be sincere about that thank you Lord I have another day amen praise the Lord thank you Lord that I can I can know you I can walk with you in this hour yeah amen glory so sincerity is very important it's absolutely important if you want to be able to bind the mum cuz the power is in the bride to do it the power of that spoken word to be lifted up and have dominion over that spirit it's in you but you've got to be sincere see this is see it's the colonel brother B speaks about if I can find it here and I trust I'm not boring you but you see he's got he says about even he speaks about your humility now I know these things all merge into one another but I just wanted to put this in because I was looking at the brother speak about the real Colonel and he says about you I won't read this but he say about you know you know he finished up reading all the church histories and he's read about St Martin in uh France and you know the Catholic Church refused to canonize him but he is a real Saint he was a church age messenger for that day you know he raised the dead healed the sick cast out Devils did many mighty acts of the spirit spoken unknown tongues seen visions and all those things but the secret of his power was humility yeah many people want to know about the power but it's the secret for the power but see because the thing is we don't operate the Holy Ghost right the Holy Ghost operates you amen see it's not us saying Lord I've got to get a hold of you it's Lord get a hold of me get a hold of me and change me you see when we worship God and we're singing I trust you can raise your hands and surrender so you can do everything you want but if you can't raise your hands hand something's wrong with you I mean because that's what worship worship to bring us to a place that's why I love that song Elohim says there was such a worship at the end of the song service where it's our attention's on God he's the big one in the place he's the main one we're just we're not even in the picture he is the picture right and it generates a worship and that's what real real singing and praise should generate it's not about it's not about how well you can sing about how you dance or don't dance no it's your focus is on him your heart is Lord I want more of you am me what is that that's real genuine humility see I was going to see well I'm going to read the second part but yet in the very secret of his power was humility before God and we find today that the church yet teaching its power and teaching the signs to follow the believer yet we find them puffed out big me little you and that if it isn't it isn't like the early church you see they were humble and and kind to one another and sweet in understanding and it was so and it's so much different today wow see we can't compare churches we can't think our Camp's better than that camp our church is better than this church our singing is better than this one our music or our preaching or whatever you can't compare cuz that is a leav that comes into your life that will change your sweet humble Christian attitude and it will change the fiber of all that you are and use a stuffed shirt proud arrogant dead is a post with God we can't allow that kind of thinking we must never compare ourselves with ourselves amen we must compare ourselves with the word of God see they were humble to one another sweet understanding and it's so much different today and I wonder if a if a lot of this hasn't sidetracked us from the real kernel of the message the real life of the message amen the whole purpose of the message is that Christ would come and dwell in you you would be his love prisoner and he would have preeminence his word would have preeminence in our lives right there would be walking talking Bibles amen amen that that is the purpose of the message that's why Malachi 4 came that's why the seals came open that's why the mighty angel came down with an open book book amen that the life of God would inhabit people once again amen that that that when people see you and I they would see the word made flesh you see so we don't want to be sidetracked from the real kernel or the real life of the message I mean you see we want to be to Humble ourselves I mean the more humbl you can be the better God will use you and mean when you realize that without him you can do nothing like Jesus said without me you can do nothing that should make us real sincere shouldn't it that should make us real humble Lord I'm not nothing without you but but with you I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me amen amen amen that's how we want to be amen I trust we're just going to continue down this vein I hope we're all okay amen but you see sincerity is absolutely important amen even even we're just going to go back here so even in Exodus here in Exodus chapter 12 they were they were commanded to to take all the 11 out of their homes now this we know this is all in type right so we're not just living with unleavened bread physically right this Feast that we approach and sincerity and Truth is the word that we're feeding on so he says for seven days you shall eat unleavened bread that's speaking of seven Church ages am mean when the first day you shall put away leaven from out of your houses for whosoever eateth leaven bread from the first day till the seventh day that Soul shall be cut off from Israel so we we can't we can't approach the Lord and feed on his word with any malice Strife unbelief in our hearts they all that all must be gone amen all man's ideas have got to be purged out of us I mean we cannot have this Feast with any of those things it's got to be taken away I mean any any any thought that makes you doubt the word of God and make you doubt God's ability in your life that's leav amen that's leav if there's any thought in your mind thinking God can't do it and if he would have done it he would have done it long ago and he just and my problem's too big that's leav that's right you got to Pur it out of your you're thinking God is more than able is anything too hard for the Lord amen all things are possible to them that believe amen so you see so so this leav it's got to be purged out so we must keep this Feast with with since of sincerity and Truth now we know Le is is um as Jesus would say the disciples thought in Matthew 16 that he was just talking about natural bread and and you know those things but he said no that you should beware the living be the leav of the Pharisees and the Sadducees then understood how that they B him uh um not Beware of the leaven of the bread but of the doctr of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees see this is what we must be we must beware of are you all following me this morning amen that anything that makes us insincere is leaven it's got to be purged out am mean we can't live with any pretense any kind of you know saying saying one thing and doing another we can't have any of that that's got to be purged out of our Lives we must be deadly sincere amen because death is riding in the land today we know the fourth seal is open amen death is about to take its last ride I mean all the Machinery is here you know the P horse rid is riding and that way but you know all those things are happening but there's only one place where you can be safe from it there's only one place there's not two places there's only one place and I'm sure we all want to be spiritually alive we don't want to be we don't want death to strike amen and the only way is to get under the blood of Jesus Christ that's the only way under the blood if you're under the blood you're safe amen amen it's and and it's so important in 2024 that we are under the blood that we don't play Church you know the devil doesn't play he's not playing a game I've got you I win again your turn no he he's not playing he ain't playing games just like Putin's not playing games all these military is fighting Hamas isn't playing games Israel's not playing games Ukraine's not playing games they're fighting the Battle of their lives the Ukraine country they're fighting a battle for existence that's right and they know if NATO stops helping them in the and America they're done right the devil isn't playing games with you he's not trying to isolate you and fill you with unbelief and make you doubt everything and and and forget who you are just to play a game oh now I'm going to let you out now now would you let's play this again sometime no the devil wants to destroy D us I know this is very serious but hey the devil wants to destroy you and I so if he's not playing why do we play why do we play games with him I'll tag you're it or I win now now let's play again no we should drive him out amen and keep him out amen he's not welcome amen amen instead of a sign don't mean this is a joke people have got the sign on their property beware of dog keeps people away we shall Beware of the Holy Ghost the strong man in the house amen if he's in the house amen then then it should keep the devil away it's the only way to keep him away amen I don't mean that as a joke but you we got to if the devil's not playing games we shouldn't be playing games either I mean you see but sincerity see Peter had to come to a place where his pretense of being the Macho Man was taken away I'm going to finish with this thought won't be too long this morning see Peter you know Jesus said everyone's going to you know everyone's going to forsake me and and Peter said no I'm going to die with you I'm going to stand with you he had a pretense that that that he could do it he was the Macho Man but you see and and in his in his uh human ability all he did was cut one man's ear off miserably fail trying to kill the guy protecting the Lord Jesus you know and then he was there outside um Pilot's judgment Hall trying to warm himself by the fire just trying to keep through the night and it wasn't even any of the chief priests or scribes or no one in Authority came and questioned him it was a servant girl it was another servant one said weren't you there I saw you in the garden you know one of the men then a girl said aren't you a gilean aren't you one of them because you're speech and all these things and and his pretense was actually blown away because he didn't actually have what he thought he had and it's actually a very good thing when we get to a place where we realize what we what we thought we have we don't have cuz when we realize we don't have what we thought we have then we can get what we need amen it's actually a blessing so so Peter had to miserably fail until his sincerity came right that's right and then Jesus when he arose CU he knew all this would happen but he said go tell my disciples and Peter amen they have risen right but then Peter because his pretense was taken away but in his heart of hearts he was actually very sincere because when they were fishing that you know that Resurrection day whenever it was or afterwards you know they saw Jesus on the on the Shore Bank Peter didn't know if Jesus had forgiven him he didn't know if he' be accepted by the master but he jumped in the water went swimming to him anyway see that's a real to me a real genuine sincere heart when all the pretense is taken away amen right they come to the Lord and you know because they don't know where else to go hallelujah amen then Jesus said Do You Love Me Peter he says of course I love you feed my sheep and feed my lambs and all these things but you see Peter became the right his sincerity came right and then he became the spokesman on the day of Pentecost and then when he went before the Sanhedrin that that Mum that was in that you know that religious spirit trying to destroy them it couldn't strike them it couldn't bite him because he because they didn't bow to that pressure amen amen and it's the same thing today friends I pray with all my heart this morning that that Mum will be bound in every life amen that will be real we'll be more sincere this year than we've ever been in our entire Christian walk amen we'll be more dedicated more sold out we'll love the Lord more more than any any other time of our life am because that the spirit of death is riding the land but if we're truly under the blood of Jesus Christ it can't get you just like that m in the vision couldn't get the prophet amen let's finish there this morning I didn't want to keep you long but let's um let's have the musicians please this morning amen say what must I do just cry out like the prophet did make me more sincere Lord make me more sincere amen that we can we can approach this Feast of un living bread of sincerity and Truth yeah amen we got to keep this Feast amen praise the Lord let's stand shall we this morning amen let's sing um do we know the song I lift my hands to the
