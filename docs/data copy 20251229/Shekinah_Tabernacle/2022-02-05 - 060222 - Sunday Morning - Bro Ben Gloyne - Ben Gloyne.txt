a song that was really important to me a couple of years ago there's there's a little miracle out there called uh sympathetic resonance it's where if someone plays a note any objects around that are tuned to that note or somewhere in that notes family will resonate too even though nobody touched them i think i need a child to be a witness to this miracle actually no well you want to come come check this out so if i play this note here i need you to bear witness i am not touching this string i'm only touching that string but this string here it's actually moving and i'm not touching [Music] actually that's not a miracle it's pretty cool but it's not a miracle thanks noelle if you're a star um i might have said that too but then i found out what the resonant frequency of my soul was i didn't touch it i just played a note and then my soul started resonating it was particularly cool because i didn't even think i had one at the time but then i found out what note it needs to resonate and this is the song that i was singing at the time the words have resonances as well and i always enjoyed praising the lord in terra maori even when i didn't enjoy it in english so this is called ateyariki [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music] me [Music] foreign oh [Music] [Music] hey [Applause] wow amen i don't know many maori songs in fact i know only one i'm gonna teach a

hallelujah i mean the lord's rising her up in power hallelujah amen amen god bless you musicians thank you very much melania's thank you for the songs amen praise the lord amen so uh yeah if you've got your bibles handy we're going to go to we're going to turn to mark chapter 10 i'm going to read from verse 46 down to verse 52 before we before we do that we're just i'm going to go to prayer we have a couple of prayer requests we want to remember omar robin in prayer amen i'm so glad that no sickness can stand before our god amen and then also we had a um we've got a prayer request from um sister ilana so my sister-in-law about pedro her husband so he had an accident on thursday with a water sprinkle he works in a he manages a farm park and he's moving a water sprinkler and it was running and and uh and it's very powerful water sprinkler when he was moving it tipped on its side and it sprayed into his eyes and he couldn't see for a few minutes and and the doctor sent him to after hours they sent him to an eye specialist and they said it was the first time they seen anything like this because apparently there's bruising behind his eye and it's quite swollen and today he realized he actually couldn't see at all from his right eye it's just a big blur which means it's getting worse he has to wear sunglasses inside or his eyes hurt so we believe in a in a god who heals he's still he's still the jehovah of miracles he's the same yesterday today and forever so amen we want to remember them in prayer also brother jose if anyone remembers him maybe no one here does but he gives us greetings amen he was a he was a brother here many years ago but anyway he just gave his greeting so brother jose says hello and god bless you but let's go to prayer before i read the word if you ever need you want to raise your hands to the lord amen where are you glad we can approach him his blood puts us on speaking terms with him so let's pray together gracious father we come before you lord we know we don't deserve anything from you but lord we're so thankful you just bid us to come so we come lord because of your precious blood we can come boldly before your throne of grace and lord in a time of need father we just want to lift omar into your presence by prayer father just want to ask you take the life out of out of the virus in the name of jesus christ if god the shingles would leave her body father may you touch you want to thank you that by your stripes she is healed lord we just claim your lord your blood stains for her father just asking you to raise her up thank you lord jesus it's already finished work that day on calvary so father we just lift it before your throne asking you to touch your body and may all symptoms and signs leave her lord for your glory and that god just want to live brother left brother pedro into your presence by prayer father who's had this accident with his water sprinkler lord i i want to thank you before he ever had this accident lord you already made a way for his healing lord you made every cell in his body so father i pray that the bruising would go down lord any every sign would leave him in the name of jesus christ that father's his his sight would be restored father 20 20 lord may you grant it for your glory lord may they not worry but may they just believe oh god may put such a faith in their hearts lord jesus that you've got it all in control and may touch them supernaturally for your glory and father we just ask dear god that you meet every need and divine presence lord those who are watching over the way of the internet as well father may you touch them lord may change our lives lord may just take over our lives father in jesus christ's name may we not hold may we hold nothing back may we give all to you father have your way lord you're still a lord you're still a god of miracles and you're the same yesterday today and forever so we thank you dear god as we read your word now may you bless it to our souls father may live in our lives in jesus christ's name amen amen so let's read or before we uh yeah let's read to mark um chapter 10 uh and and verse 46. here we spoke a bit on this on wednesday but i just want to go into it a bit more so mark 46 sorry mark 10 and 46 says here and they came to jericho and as he went out of jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind bartimaeus the son of timeous sat by the highway side begging and when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth he began to cry out and say jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and many charge him that he should hold his peace not just one or too many many told him to be quiet but he cried out the more a great deal i like it yeah when the devil tells you do one thing just do the opposite amen thou son of david have mercy on me and jesus stood still and commanded him to be called and they and they call the blind man saying unto him be of good comfort rise he calleth thee and he casting away his garment rose and came to jesus and jesus answered and said unto him what will thou that i should do unto thee the blind man said unto him lord that i might receive my sight and jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith has made thee whole and immediately he received his sight and followed jesus in the way amen may the lord bless this word you may have your seats this morning also this coming sunday we're going to use the vaccine pass i'm going to start using it every second sunday the wednesdays will stay rosted but we wanted to do this so everyone has more of a chance to get to church at the moment it's every three or four weeks but if we do it that way it'll be every second sunday at least and the sundays we don't use the past all those who are unvaccinated will have priority okay so this one habits everyone can get to church of the same regularity as everyone else so um yeah so we want to um i love blind barter mass he's not a he's not a man that really is defined by his blindness no more but we want to talk about where where you know if he can do it for them he can do it for me that's my title if he can do it for them he can do it for me amen and and this was blind bartimaeus's uh way you know he realized if god can do it for them he can do it for me and now this is the believers this is the believer's really attitude amen you know brother brown would say in in the message the supernatural he says we wanna he says the hardest thing to do is to get to the people in that atmosphere the atmosphere of worship the atmosphere of believing so we want to get into a greater atmosphere of believing that all things are possible amen we live in unprecedented times but i believe this is unprecedented at times for the bride too that god's pouring out his spirit more and more amen that signs and wonders the god of history as a god of the present amen we're where impossible things are done because god does them right so here so if god can do it for them he can do it for me that's my title now what the lord has done down through the ages he's still the same today god bless you vicky great to have you here megan god bless you we'll see you paul next time oh yep praise the lord say hello from us to them thank you thank you he's the same today he hasn't changed in any way the believer a big part of what makes a believer a believer is that he believes or they believe he's the same right he's not that you know he hasn't changed our lord jesus is not some distant god someplace he's not sitting up in heaven with us with his arms crossed just waiting to see how things play out but he's actively involved in the lives of men and women and children even today he's walking among his church today amen he is he is interested in our lives today he's not a distant god today he never was a distant god but the devil wants us to make us think that he's a distant god and he doesn't care he does care he's a very present in a time of trouble amen he's the same yesterday today and forever he hasn't changed so what he did back then he'll do for you the same today amen but he's the same the devil wants us to think he's not the same but he is the same he's the same in power he's the same in ability he's he answers prayer the same amen he does the same workings he's the same god now this shouldn't be foreign let's just let's just get into an atmosphere of believing like never before amen he's the same now a believer believes he's the same in principle he's got to be the same in power he's got to be the same in every way except his corporal body because we're going to meet that in the air aren't we believers believe in a literal rapture believers believe we're going to literally see him in the air where our bodies can be changed we're going to be with him in the air right we're going to meet him in the air that's what believers believe amen brother brown would say in seed of discrepancy he says now for if a gospel preacher or someone says the days of miracles is past that's a seed of discrepancy when a man stands and says that he's a minister a pastor of a church or somewhere and does not believe that jesus christ is the same in every detail except the physical body the same yesterday today and forever that's the seed of discrepancy so we believe he's the same he hasn't changed one bit should i say i'm about to close stay with me right because we're going to travel some way but see if we can just realize we get in contact with almighty god we can as individuals get in contact with almighty god and god can move on our behalf and change situations things we cannot do he does amen so he's the same now that's the that's the attitude of the believer you know i find even even people they are you know they just wander off off the street or people who just start to walk in the way deep down inside they believe the bible's true that's an attribute of a believer they just believe the words true they may never heard it before but they just believe it's true because there's something in them saying he is his word and his word is true amen and he has not changed now we many times we think if i just had the faith of you know of blind bartimaeus if i just had the faith of the woman at the well if i just had the faith of the serophenician woman then i would get you know what they have need of i have need of and i'll get it you know we have that same faith we have that same kind of faith this morning we don't have a lesser faith we have the same faith i mean we're actually built of the same stuff as they were we're not built of a lesser quality faith we have the same kind of faith you know as a as brother brown would say about about the widow woman that fed elijah he said she was made of the same caliber as the prophet that's why the lord sent him there that she would sustain him during the famine he says that she was she must have been the same caliber as elijah so you take the caliber elijah you know elijah wasn't some peashooter he wasn't some air rifle he wasn't some you know he was he was a 150 million caliber kind of a gun he was a real high caliber because he could stand there on mount carmel after seeing a vision of being fulfilled and he challenges the prophets of baal and says the god who answers by fire led a monster by fire and you know the rest of the story and he stood there one man against a whole a whole religious movement and he stood there for jehovah god amen and god came down and answered his prayer and you know burned up the sacrifice and everything she was of that same caliber no record of her doing a miracle no record of her seeing a vision having a dream but she was made of the same caliber i mean so so remember remember a prophet represents the word they are the word of god to the to the people so so she was of the caliber she could sustain and look after the word during a time of drought amen and so that same word has come to you hallelujah for you to entertain for you to give life to you to rejoice and few to praise you to make feel welcome his name is jesus amen so she was the same caliber as the prophet and i'll say the bride of jesus christ is the same caliber amen as our lord jesus christ remember because in god's economy the bride is not a second-class citizen in the kingdom where his where is queen we're the apple of his eye he loves us very much he's not angry at us he loves us he cares for us he wants the best for us is that foreign some people look at me like am i talk am i talking another language you know if you don't know he loves you you should pray lord reveal your love to me it's very very important it means she is of the same caliber and so we are the believer is the same caliber as the word so i'll say this if we are of the same caliber because we're believers now god's made us believers nothing we've done he made us believe us amen so therefore we have the same faith the believers had through the ages amen but you see the thing is many times we think we're the only one going through the trial we're in and it's unique it's never happened before in the history of man no one's ever gone through this this is new territory for a believer no one's ever experienced this kind of thing you know and unfortunately that's how that's you know no one can understand what i've gone through i can't draw from anyone else's testimony i can't talk to anyone about it no one understands this is how elijah got after mount carmel he would complain to god he would actually pray that god would take his life he was praying against the will of god for his life because the will of god for his life as he'd go to rapture how many times we get real upset and down and we pray against the will of god but god doesn't change his will for us and then he would actually complain to god god i'm the only one i alone have stood no one else has it's all me in this trial no one understands what i'm going through my brother doesn't understand my sister doesn't understand i'm the only one this is human condition but we are not the only one as god would tell them no i actually have seven thousand reserved kept you know you're actually you actually have a church of seven thousand you thought you're the church of one but there's a lot of others you just weren't aware of them amen ever so so we need to understand that there is no temptation which had which has taken you but such as is common to man right so every temptation we go through it's actually it's not unique okay it's actually common to man someone's been through it before or someone is going through it at the same time amen but god is faithful this is from first corinthians 10 13 if you're if you're wondering but god is faithful who'll not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it so in every temptation we should look for a way of escape here's the way of escape we should look for that way of escape we shouldn't just sit there and say poor me and all this you know but look for the way of escape he's the way of escape hallelujah but there's no temptation taking you but such is common to man so we if someone's gone through it before you know someone's already gone through it so if god did it for them he'll do it for you we're gonna keep that on our minds if god did it for them he can do it for me amen that we are not unique or the believers of you know in the past were not unique in the sense it was only for them and god doesn't answer the same way if we have the same faith and the right mental mental attitude towards any promise of god god will cause it to come to pass what is that right mental attitude god's word is right the promise is for me irrespective of what we say i mean what we see what we feel what we hear god's word is always right i mean sublime bartimaeus was sitting there by the by the gate he was blind he was a beggar this is the condition he was in and it's amazing even even the meaning of his name if i um i have it here it's actually uh from the chaldea origin um it actually means to be uh unclean religiously this is his name son of timmy so bartimaeus is son of timmy which is all the unclean he is the son of the unclean this is this was his name so he was living under the stigma i'm actually i i've been i'm the son of the unclean this is this is what he was living under and it means to be foul in a religious sense infamous defiled or polluted so this was his name but deep down on the inside here is a believer see we've got to look beyond our natural name even our natural cultural net our past we're gonna look beyond that here he was as a blind man i love it wig where the lord jesus he goes to cases where people no doubt every one of them thought this is my lord in life and i'm just stuck this way the woman at the well no doubt thought this is just how it's going to be i'm always going to go to the well because i can't go with every other woman because i've been ostracized from my village so i always have to go this kind of time of day and well you know i've been married six five times i'm just living with this man i've got this you know people don't you know i've got this reputation i've been shunned by society this is just how life is gonna be but jesus came her way hallelujah jesus changed everything because deep down on the inside of her and her soul wasn't meant to be the woman at the well as everyone knew but she was meant to be a believer amen and that's why jesus went her way raheb as a harlan jericho because remember um blind bartimaeus lived in jericho jericho's you look at the history of jericho there was a there was a great history of of of faith in that city hallelujah amen there was rahab she was she was a harlot this is just you know brother brown says in one place just to dramatize it says actually her her her family put her out on the street you know they caused that to happen to her and they're so there she was she was stuck in this kind of a life and no doubt she would thought well i'm never going to get married this is just how it's going to be i'm known as a harlot here i am but deep down on the inside of her she knew there was mercy in a god somewhere and when she heard of the testimonies of of the red sea and mount sinai and the plagues in egypt remember all she heard was judgment to gentiles and she's a gentile all she heard was judgment to her kind of a people salvation to the jews but but judgment to gentiles she's a gentile but somehow she knew there must be mercy in that god for me somehow all the other gentiles you know have been have been judged but there's got to be mercy for him i mean and him for me hallelujah and she asked the spies you know surely there's got to give me a token that that we won't die because you're going to take the city we know you're going to take the city you know so there's a kind of a faith in her hallelujah and and and she was instructed just get everyone into into your house under the scarlet rope and we think sometimes if we just had her kind of faith we do have that kind of a faith because that's a shadow speaking of a reality in this day of you amen where i what i love about her is her her whole her past and the complexes and the pain and the hurt the rejection and being used and abused and everything that was actually in her that became very secondary to her to now she actually had this scarlet rope and it was actually always in her possession it was her rope the spies didn't give it it was already it was already tucked down in her house somewhere amen it just had to come on display i mean a word had to be spoken to her for it to come to life as the same thing with the predestinated seed of god it's always buried there but when the light strikes the seed and it comes to life how's it what do you mean it comes to life you begin to think different you begin to walk different you begin to speak different church is not a ball the word is not a bore it's a reality it's alive the word speaks to you it didn't used to speak to you before but now it does and it means something to you and your whole life has changed what's happening that life has come on that scarlet rope that was buried is now on display and so now what she now possessed in her hand became her whole life that was her life's mission now i've got to get everyone in all my family all my relations whosoever will and i've somehow got to keep it quiet can't just put posters everywhere and say god sent a prophet and this is what's going to happen no you know she had to be wise and what she did i'm not against that kind of thing but you know what i mean she had to have wisdom but all of her complexes and pains and hurts she was still carrying them and i'm so and i'm not saying this to say you've got to live with those things god can deliver you sure but but what she had in her hand of the scarlet rope became her main thing all those things were put to one side i've got salvation for my family amen and we do we don't have a physical scarlet rope but we have the baptism of the holy ghost that's our short token amen and we can live if we you know god can live in our lives in such a way it creates an atmosphere around us of power of the holy ghost that our our family will actually become believers they'll fall right into it brother braham says amen i believe that i mean that was the kind of faith that was that was that was identified with with jericho and there's blind bartimaeus there and and when when he was young his his his mama brother bam says just to dramatize it would would pick him up on her lap and tell her bible stories of great of great heroes of faith and she would tell him about about rahab and she would tell him about about elijah and about elisha about how elijah and elisha they you know you know they walked through jericho elijah took his mantle smote the river jordan at potter they walked along the other side elijah was taken up in a rapture amen and then elisha took the same mantle smoke the same water it parted walked back across you know and maybe he had thought if only elijah or elisha were here right now then they would heal me they'd do something i miss like elisha how he received a double portion of the anointing that was on elijah and how elisha would would would would actually tell a shunammite woman because because he she looked after him and made the little side room in her house and different things from when he was traveling through that that that he would tell her you're gonna have a son and she had the son so life came through the words of a prophet and then and then when that boy actually died that same prophet brought him back to life and maybe maybe um bartimaeus would have said if only i lived back there where elisha was because i'm not dead i'm alive so it's this is not as hard as resurrection of the dead and he could lay his hands on me he could do something and then my sight would come back or maybe he'd think of the story where you know maybe maybe it was right by jericho where where neyman the general from syria came and dipped seven times was healed of his leprosy and maybe he'd think if only elisha was alive i could go to him and he could tell me what to do now what i love about it well what do i need to do just believe and come to the lord we don't need to dip seven times in some water we need to believe and come to him hallelujah amen so he would have thought no doubt if only i lived back then i could have gone and talked and many both people think if only i live when brother branham was here i could have got an interview i could have got this he would have prayed for me called me out in the service or would have been fine the same god the same jesus not a different jesus not a lesser jesus the same god is alive today because he's the same yesterday today and forever he hasn't changed in any bit just not his corporal body i mean so he's the same god he's the same power to heal the same power to deliver the same power to save amen the same power to give peace he's the same god amen the same god today so while you know while uh bartimaeus was pondering on these things a bunch of noise began to walk past and it was jesus coming jesus was walking that way he was actually on his way to calvary where jesus is there's always a lot of noise now i may be repeating myself but from wednesday but i want to emphasize this because the devil wants us to shut up sit down and just go through the motion but i'm not here to be dictated to by the devil i'm here to be dictated to by almighty god and and the lord says you have joined speaker will full of glory peace it passes understanding amen we can be drunk on the holy ghost every day of our life until we leave this world hallelujah we can be so drunk on the spirit we even forget our own name amen hallelujah you've got trouble in your life just take a drink take a drink of the spirit you'll forget all your troubles everything will come into perspective the lord is my strength the lord is my helper he's my fortress my strong tower he's my peace he's my comforter he's gonna see me through i may be trouble maybe on every side but trouble's not in me amen because the lord's in me hallelujah so you know we can we can live such a way i believe it you know but the devil doesn't want us to tap into our resource he doesn't want us to get to our source of strength amen which is almighty god you just start listening to this word you'll find a strength come up you'll find clarity come amen and his anointing the lord's anointed will come and quicken it to your life you'll find amen things very different hallelujah so there he was jesus was walking past and him being blind this was a different kind of a noise he was he was used to other noises coming past maybe he he would hear a donkey come past in the past and he would cry out you know for a penny or a shekel whatever and but but the but the voice of the man on the donkey will say out of my way i'm here i'm a i'm a priest i'm on yeah i'm on official business i don't have time for you and it's oh sorry servant of god you know forgive me you get out of the way here another noise coming past he'd cry out and you know a shekel or whatever and you know but this noise was different because here was a man walking along some of the crowd was crying out hosanna to the son of david some of them were saying get out of here beelzebub you won't have any prayer meeting you won't have any you don't have any kind of me you're not welcome down here and some would just be standing there watching what was going on a lot of hustle and bustle going on and then so he would he would begin to ask what is this commotion what is going on in this place this is unusual this is different and then someone would say well well blind bartimaeus you know bartimaeus this is this is uh jesus of nazareth coming through and then so who's that i haven't heard about this guy i've heard about pharisee jones and you know said you see sad man and you know they don't believe in a resurrection that's why they said you see and you know so so so he heard about them but this jesus of nazareth and then so someone will begin to testify because faith cometh by hearing see they say well this this jesus of nazareth is a different kind of a man for starters there were blind men that he gave sight back to he would he would take the bread and the loaves and he would feed he would take he'd take a boy's lunch see if you just give something to god god will multiply it more than you can imagine he's a boy walking along with his lunch he's meant to be on his way to school but he sees a crowd he goes to see what's going on he doesn't want to go to school somehow he finds himself and maybe in maybe in front of the apostle peter and and and the apostle peter says the lord needs your lunch so he gives him his lunch and then he sits down and he watches that same lord jesus take and he begins to pray he takes that same bread he begins to multiply that bread takes that same fish the boy was carrying it before now he sees it multiplied in before his very eyes and then he's eating this multiplied bread and fish tastes the same like mama made because the same fish and bread multiplied and then and then and then it'd say you know and then and then you know that person would testify you know there was lazarus jesus's friend he got sick maybe badminton say well did he get did jesus come and heal him he said no he went four days journey lazarus died four days in the grave and maybe bartimaeus began to think well i guess there's some cases that are just too hard but then no no no no no no no no there's no cases too hard the devil says these cases too hard but god says nothing's impossible with me you've got to think god made all matter all time and space the molecules that make up your body he made right this the you know the mass that makes this everything we breath the oxygen we breathe everything we are god made it it's his spoken word amen now the devil gets into it tries to bring chaos right into our body what is sickness it's actually disease actually causes cells it's a chaos in the body things are out of harmony right right and it's the same thing when he tries to get into your spirit all troubled all stressed you know anxiety should not be a thing we live with don't be anxious for nothing the bible says don't be stressed this is an age of stress we don't need to be stressed amen because we're in a different kind of economy don't get under the atmosphere of this world everyone else can be stressed but you know i remember so not the job i mean but the one before the show quality somehow i found myself in the data processing team i just processed data all day and friday was the stressful day because what we had to do is process all the data and then give it to scientists or senior scientists and they had to check it and they released it to the to the customer now we were a a seven day a week company but scientists and senior scientists they don't work weekends oh no no no so we had to have everything to them but the customer probably wanted their results on saturday not that they ever checked them but they had to be there on time or or sunday so we had to get everything so friday basically we had to get three days work worth of work ready on the friday and so everyone's panicking in the team being so stressed and i realized why should i be stressed about this why should i get under this atmosphere if it's friday no it's friday i'm happy praise the lord you know and and and we all worked as hard as we could right but if there's something wrong with the system something needs changing but why get stressed because all my colleagues are stressed about it it's like let's just work as hard as we can but you know i could have allowed myself to get under that no we don't have to get under the atmosphere of this world whatever climate you know whatever fear is being projected i'm not going to receive that mail i have no actually my old house we should put on the new one we should put no jug mail you know and we don't get any junk mail it's like the devil everything he sends you is junk just put no junk mail and say i'm not receiving this he may even try and make it personally to you know it's junk throw it away that's what fear and anxiety is it's just junk mail amen we don't need to we don't need to accept or even open that kind of a package um praise the lord now so they are their bar mitzvah and and he was testified to now what a believer can do is they have the ability to put what god has done in the past and what god is doing in the present and actually say it's the same god that's what the believer can do amen now it wasn't just say bartimaeus or the other ones who believe that that jesus was a prophet you know there was a man called herod and let's just let's just um do i have this here yeah let's go to luke 9 and 7. because there were other there were a lot of other people who wanted to see jesus too but their attitude was wrong and they even said that he was a prophet luke 9 and 27 i mean sorry luke 9 and 7. now here at the tetrax heard of all that was done by him and he was perplexed because it was said of some that john was risen from the dead and so and of some that elias had appeared and of others that one of the old prophets was risen again and herod said john have i beheaded but who is this of whom i hear such things and he desired to see him because all this is a prophet of old has been risen from the dead oh i want to see him but then if we go all the way now to luke 23 and verse 8 this is where herod gets his opportunity and when herod saw jesus he was exceeding exceeding glad he was real happy it wasn't just a nice he was real happy i've been waiting to see you and i keep hearing more testimony and testimony and i want to see you for he was desired to see him for a long season because he had heard many things of him and he hoped to see some miracle done by him so he just wanted to see some supernatural thing show us your power this is that this was his motive i just want to see god i want to see you do something jesus of nazareth i've heard a lot of stories but i just want to oh i just want to see you do something now his attitude was he just wanted to see god do something just like a trick but god doesn't clown for anyone well he isn't clown for anyone so herod's attitude was wrong and that's why when he if we keep reading then he questioned with him in many words but answered him nothing and the chief priest and scribe stood and verily however you say that word accused him and herod with his men of war set him at naught and mocked him and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent him again to pilate now that word to set him at naught means to make utterly nothing of to despise so they heard great things about him but because he didn't clown he didn't he didn't respond how they wanted him to respond they just said no this guy's nothing and they mocked him he was the great king of glory that if herod's approach was just right what could have happened in that kingdom what could have happened in that kingdom if he just approached them right right so there were many others who wanted to see jesus but they came with the wrong attitude now we have to come in humility and reverence right god doesn't owe us anything we owe him everything amen we aren't you know brother brahm says in one place if we come feeling we don't deserve the blessing we're actually in the right condition to receive it amen so if you feel unworthy that's a good thing then you'll receive it hallelujah amen so blind bartimaeus he hears he hears the different testimonies of what happened through the life of jesus in the ministry and then he begins to realize that that same god his mother told him about amen was now walking right past him that he wasn't a god of history no more but he stepped out of history and he was now walking in flesh more than a prophet and so he began to cry out because he began to realize that jehovah is the same yesterday today and forever remember jehovah of the old testament is jesus christ of the new he just changes his form but he's the same god hello so so he was walking past them and that's why blind by blind bartimaeus began to realize now is my opportunity now is my opportunity today is a day of salvation why wait i may not have another opportunity i gotta i've got an audience right now and you know what's amazing when blind bartimaeus didn't know where to go to see god alive god gave came to him hallelujah many times we may not think where is jesus well if you have a real desire to meet jesus the lord jesus will come to you you may not know how to get to him but he'll get to you hallelujah so he began to cry out and noticed not everyone wasn't supportive of his cry oh praise the lord blind blind bartimaeus he's got some faith he really wants to be here legally you know jesus has healed other people he can heal blind bartimaeus no they weren't supportive the other church members weren't supportive they were saying be quiet many of them said stop stop what you're doing you're you're you're you're changing the whole scene i pray we change the whole thing hallelujah amen we changed the whole scene in a service i mean where our faith projects and we touch the lord hallelujah and then so he just cried out the more that's why i said in the beginning if the devil tells you to shut up and sit down do the opposite if he says there's no way you can ever meet the lord do the opposite if he says you've you you've sent away your day of grace go to him anyway go to the lord anyway just do vice versa hallelujah amen you know we can just like blind bartimaeus he cried out all the more and then that his faith because it wasn't his his voice necessarily that made jesus stop because a lot of people were shouting at the lord it was his faith may jesus stand still hallelujah and if our faith could just be projected today we can make the lord stand still amen because we get his attention who wants the lord's attention hallelujah remember our flag ain't too small we're not too insignificant that he can't see us waving our flag of faith hallelujah he sees our hearts cry he's interested in our needs he knew blind bartimaeus was blind but he didn't want him to stay blind hallelujah so then he calls he calls for him and then someone and then so so they commanded now blind barometers you know be of good comfort he calls for thee so blind bartimaeus it says cast he said casting away his garment he rose and came to jesus now this garment no doubt kept them warm because he was begging sitting there so this was very much identified with his old life as as a beggar but he knew he wouldn't come back and beg no more because he believed the lord could heal his eyes so he didn't put it somewhere where he could you know find it some necessarily he just cast it aside hallelujah that's why it's so important just cast aside your old life just let it go in order to to go somewhere you've got to leave somewhere right so in order for me to go home i've got to leave here i can't bring this with me i don't have the technology i can't physically bring this building home i've got to leave it right as the same thing in the spiritual if something's holding us back you've got to just let it go let it go and move on your past is holding you back just let it go the law's taking care of it anyway his blood is cleansed if you've thoroughly confessed that everything you know just surrendered your whole life it's gone hallelujah amen that's why you just gotta let it go you gotta just drop it and let it go i love zoom too you know praise the lord god bless you whoever's online now but you've got to let it go you just got to cast aside your garment amen amen and rose and then he came to jesus and then jesus asked him saying what would you have me do and the blind man said lord that i might receive my sight jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith has made thee whole and immediately he received his sight and followed jesus in the way so now what i love about this is is before when he was blind he was known as blind bartimaeus so his past or his current condition defined who he was amen but after the lord received his sight he wasn't blind bartimaeus no more right he could walk in this current world and not trip and stumble and fall when he was blind he'd had to feel his way around and ask people can you help me i need to get there because i knew where he begged you know can you help me sir and ma'am and watch out and things would he'd bump into things and you know but then when his eyes came open he could just walk hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and i before the lord opens our eyes spiritually we are blind in this world we are spiritually blind in this world like the lord jesus said the blind lead the blind and they both fall into the ditch and he wasn't speaking about physical blindness he's speaking about spiritual blindness how the scribes and pharisees were spiritually blind but then so with bartimaeus now his eyes came open and maybe when he was walking around he would say hey blind bartimaeus how you doing he'd say don't call me blind do i look blind i can see you didn't realize you look like that but i can see you you know am i acting like a blind person am i stumbling around like a blind person do i need someone to lead me in the way do i get hit by stuff that i'm not aware is coming no i can see so don't don't define me by why by what i used to be it's the same thing with you and i the devil wants to define us by what we used to be i mean but we're believers now we're under the blood of jesus christ but the devil wants to drag up our dredge up our past and say you used to be this and used to be this and you say yeah i used to be i'm not now don't call me blind when i can see i'm not stumbling around i walk a man who can see a woman who can see walks different than a person who cannot right they can just walk around they can see they have depth perception they can you know and it's like a believer we walk different to the world we act different to the world i mean because we can see we can see the enemy in his tricks amen we can stay for you know yes like the prophet said you know you want to overcome he says you should be able to see that punches the devil's punches and and and sideset them before they come to you says that's overcoming you know instead of just walking into them all the time hey sometimes we do we get blindsided we're human but you know we can actually live in such a way we can see the tricks of the enemy and just just bypass and go the other way he wants to bring you down to a carnal atmosphere you can bypass it you can do the unexpected hallelujah amen because the devil wants us to react a certain way no we're going to react a different way how do how do you change the kind of an atmosphere don't answer him according to what he's trying to do you know he gets all me he you know people fuss and fight and carry on no don't respond according to that amen respond in a heavenly way like for example there's a bunch of trouble going on in the home just start singing a song start praying amen do the opposite amen so bartimaeus became bartimaeus he wasn't blind no more hallelujah and now he followed jesus in the way so he didn't stop there and get healed he began to follow jesus in the way amen now this way can be a way of persecution and trouble which it is but we have to realize that in order for there to be a resurrection there's got to be a calvary first in order for there to be a sunshine there's got to be a darkness i mean in order for there to be life there actually has to be death jesus had to go to calvary that life could come to you and i i mean he had to be mad more than any other man in order for life that we would be made whole amen so there has to be many times where you know we're going through a dark place light's coming life's coming joseph went through a dark place he was sold as a slave he was thrown into prison he is you know sold by his brother imagine the pain in agony because of just that one event the brothers that you know they just don't like you a little bit but actually one of them wants to kill you you know a lot of them i think was more than one but but but i think reuben said no no we can't do this and the very brothers he came to see how they're doing tie him up or or just throw him in the well and then and then he cries out there's no deliverance coming have you ever put yourself there you know this is not just some play some some emotionless play no he went through this and he he had to you know suffer the rejection of his brothers he's hauled out of the well he sold as a slave no doubt he'd be crying out brothers don't do this to me we're family we are the sons of abraham right we are we are circumcised believers don't don't do this to me what are you doing to me and he sold you know the transaction takes place he's taken down into egypt he had to live with that pain right and then and then you know finally you know he's part of his house then he you know part of his wife wants to commit adultery with him he says no you know i'm not going to sin against my god she she trumps up the charges he's in prison again all those things happen he's for and then and then the butler and baker are there and then he he interprets their dreams for him for them rather but then but then the butler forgets him after he's restored he has to sit there but then when it's all said and done and he's been exalted to the right hand of pharaoh and his brethren in front of him he said all this happened that life would be saved so we don't like cutting eh we don't like pain who likes pain i'm glad everyone's listening no one no human being likes pain and anguish and suffering but if you look through the scripture it takes a lot of anguish and suffering in order for a character to be molded in a certain way for then god to come upon the scene amen joseph was that way imagine imagine moses now moses through the great anguish of his life the first 80 years of his life he had to be hidden he was he was you know god allowed him to be raised up in the palace of the very one that he's going to be raised up to destroy amen pharaohs right but there's the anguish of the israelites and their slavery and all those things then he tried to deliver them but he just killed one egyptian he had to run for his life he's on the back side of the desert your backslidden prophet hiding away trying to live out his life like this you know there's a lot of pain but brother graham says that it's in those burning sands of experience where where men and women are molded into saints he says how lord how i thank you for those times that life will come jesus would be asked by in one place it's the mother of um the sons of thunder and then in other places actually the sons themselves the two disciples he says can we sit on your right and left hand when you come in glory and jesus asked them can you drink the cup that i will drink can you be baptized with a baptism that i am baptized with and they said yes we're able he says yes you shall drink of that cup what was that cup a cup of suffering i don't know why i'm going down this way but we're going down this way you know it was a cup of suffering there's actually a measure of suffering that's given to the church we didn't sign up for this but we signed up for it because we're made of the same stuff amen like joseph joseph was betraying not just christ but the believer we're the very ones that hurt and maim and scar and reject the lord can actually take that person that's been in that condition and use it their life will be saved hallelujah amen we're made of the same stuff are we not the same faith of them as in us praise the lord there's a certain suffering that is that is uh allotted to the church but it's for our good and it's for not just for ourselves remember everything we go through in our christian journey sure we get to go to heaven ourselves right we get to meet the lord ourselves but most of our testimony is actually going to say for others amen how else can we enter into other people's prayer needs how can we actually put ourselves in their shoes and actually understand where they're coming from amen it's like brother brown when he when is when winners when his baby sharon rose was dying you know her eyes were crossing in the pain nothing could be done for her and and and she died and you know he he buried her with her with his first wife he would say after that that every child that came across a platform with cross eyes they never left with crossed eyes because he could enter into the burden of that child hallelujah so what about us we say why did i have to go through that god wants to use it he wants to use our path nothing nothing that happens in our life is actually in vain god wants to use it for a specific reason hallelujah we can enter into someone's burden actually pray for them in a greater way that someone else that just sympathizes amen sure it's good to sympathize with someone in prayer but when you've really been in their shoes oh boy you can really pray amen hallelujah now amen so he followed him in the way now the apostle paul would say speaking to king agrippa i believe it was now but this i confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship by the god of my fathers believing all which is written in the law and in the prophets amen so so blind bartimaeus followed him in the way followed jesus and then the apostle paul saying in the way that's that which is called heresy this is the way i worship god so they had to walk that same kind of way but but the thing is the apostle paul realized they may call it heresy or another translation is a cultural sect but he says the reason they call it this is because i believe the whole word so worship i the god of my father's believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets i mean so people may think it's crazy to believe the whole word of god but actually you know they may call it all kinds of things but this is the way amen amen hallelujah now blind bartimaeus now i just have i think i just have one more thing i want to bring out here so blind bartimaeus realized now here comes jehovah god this is this is god the old testament i heard about he's here today he can answer what he did for them he can do for me this is this is what he believed now if we could go through all the testimonies the syrophoenician woman daughter grievously vicks vicks by devil if he can do it for her he can do it for me amen i'm sick and body if he could do it for them he can do it for me hallelujah amen amen cancers in my body if it can heal others he can heal me amen wayward family he can do it for them he can do it for me finances have gone to nothing if he could do it for them he can do it for me amen trouble in the home god brings peace if he can do it for them he can do it for me hallelujah the impossible if he could do it for them he can do it for me hallelujah brother brown would testify he'd say about a man who would who who who sponsored sponsored his meetings and and and he was doing some construction work or something and a wall fell upon him and mashed his body and and this man is lying in hospital i know where it was in america somewhere brother brahms there not even near where he was and he says now this man's helped the meetings you know he's been supportive but he's but he's on his deathbed and then he'd begin to say well if the lord jesus was here he and his great faith would go lay his hands upon him and pronounce him well but me i'm just a sinner saved by grace you know but then he began to think if the lord jesus would would would come and use use his own body to do it it's the same filthy hands but it's the same god right and then he just prayed for him because he's the same god and that man got healed and in the next morning he was in the meeting solid well hallelujah so impossible so it seemed impossible for this man to ever to live but the prophet realized jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen and the same you know if we're believers god can do the same things can he not amen if he can do it for them he can do it for us if he can fill them with the holy ghost he can fill me hallelujah if he can save the philippian jailer and his family if he did it for them he can do it for me isn't that right amen hallelujah if he can raise the dead he could he can do it today he's the same god amen because remember the same pillar of fire that was in the believers in the new testament is the same pillar of fire today the same one that led them in the old testament then dwelled in the in the book of acts church is the same god today amen so if we can do it for them he can do it for me hallelujah amen because he is the same god this morning he hasn't changed i remember we just get into an atmosphere of believing he's the same god how is he going to work it out he worked it out for them he worked it out for noah and the saving of his house if he can do it for him he can do it for me well there's not a flood coming but there's a rapture coming just like the ark transported them from one world to another amen the ark the lord jesus christ is going to transport us from this world to the next world so if he can do it for them he can do it for me who believes that this morning how's it going to work out god takes care of the details we don't need to worry about details we just need to come and ask him lord if thou will of course he will he's full of salvation he's full of healing he's full of redemption hallelujah it's his attributes he loves to display his attributes like the leper came to the lord jesus if thou will make me whole i will be thou whole hallelujah if he can do it for him he can do it for me i meant leprosy in those days i think even today i'm not sure incurable disease but if we can do it for them he can do it for us hallelujah amen let's um stand to our feet this morning i'm just going to leave it there but i just want to ask you a question i pray your faith is challenged you get to realize if he can do it for them he can do it for me my case is not unique right there's no temptation which we suffer which is common to man hallelujah but we're just common demands if we can do it for them he could do it for me hallelujah amen shingles has been healed before it can be healed again hallelujah brother pedro's eye problem god's done it before he can do it again remember he made every atom god made every atom of the body the devil wants to bring disorder and chaos but god brings order amen by the spoken word god brings order hallelujah i mean we have some musicians please this morning amen but i trust we can just say yes if he could do it for them he can do it for me hallelujah our god answers prayer amen he's the same yesterday today and forever he has not changed hallelujah amen let's um i want to sing that song just came on my heart what a beautiful name it is the name of jesus amen amen praise the lord hallelujah amen he's the same yesterday today and freedom aren't you glad he is aren't you glad when you hear the message you read the bible say i know that jesus he's the same today he hasn't changed he hasn't gone off somewhere he's the same today amen so well what do i need to do i'm like blind bartimaeus blind on the side of the road just cast aside your garment cast aside your old life cast aside whatever your trouble is and come to him that's all you need to do and then tell them what you have need of amen blind bartimaeus didn't didn't need to restore his sight then come to jesus that's not how it works we come to the lord and lord restores us amen [Music] one with the other lord most times your hidden glory in creation [Music] what a beautiful name it is what a beautiful name it is the name of jesus christ my king what a beautiful name it is nothing compares to this what a beautiful name is the name of jesus [Music] so jesus my

what a powerful name it is the name of jesus christ my king what a powerful name it is nothing can stand against what a powerful name it is the name of jesus hallelujah everything must bow to that name amen let's um let's sing that song in his presence that's where i belong amen and you're glad you belong in his presence he wants us to dwell continue in his presence i mean shall we start with
