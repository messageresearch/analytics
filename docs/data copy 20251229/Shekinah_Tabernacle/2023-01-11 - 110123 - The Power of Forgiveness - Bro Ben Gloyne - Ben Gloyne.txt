gonna go into the scripture but um yeah let's just see how this goes so I don't you maybe just cut all the sound this is probably pretty much everything you've seen has already again Gianna have a what do we got we got this for you you got that good sweet okay so is this working on okay so let's see if I can drive this so as you know we were all in me and Brother Andy I had a wonderful time with Brother Andy in South Africa I really did it was awesome so if you ever want to go and have a great time with someone take this guy you're in for a blessed time so um all right yeah that was good so it's been a great thing to Journey around this old globe with this Brother Bear I'm here fellowship with God's children everywhere and you know I come to find out where they're Swedish Norwegian German African wherever or wherever they are they're all the same when they come to Christ it makes everyone the same there's no difference in people I maybe can't speak their language but there's something about them you know you can tell that it's a brother that's the real part of it after all it's so true true man praise God we're in places couldn't speak well much English well they couldn't well I I can't speak much English anyway but you know um but yeah it was a real blessing so as you know when to went to the motherland went to South Africa praise the Lord hey my dad comes from this place so I can say at some other land I can claim it I claim a lot of things you know kiwi wherever it suits hey it's me you know I know it's naughty hey but hey um so we're up in this region of the country I just got another we'll zoom in a bit so we landed in Johannesburg we uh we stayed in emalahini here and then bushbuck Ridge where we preached the first amount of meetings is in here between uh Aiken hook and uh has evil yes it's in here so we were there and then we went up to mahola which is by Hood Sprite here then we drove through the um through the Kruger now the Kruger National Park is half the size of this North Island that's a that's a national park so this is a big place man this is a big place oh wow so yeah just to give you an idea so um and then we drove down to mumbbella is that how you said it for one night service and then we drove here down back to imalakini remote to polokwane um so we had quite a time yes um so the first part I've just got a bunch of videos we're just going to kind of Brother Andy you just chip in because man I tell you what this man's gold praise Lords here we are driving bushbuck Ridge just to give you an idea you know there's some you know there's a lot of houses a lot of open land a lot of you know but there's no industry there uh much apart from agriculture every tree is a mango tree uh you can maybe skip this a bit forward yeah just so this is the idea of this is what bushbuck Ridge is like um there's no church there at the moment by the pastor Moses muruti Moses has had a burden for for this part of the country to to establish a work so he's been going up there and we've actually last year we were supporting him to do that and um so they just hired this uh this is a Community Hall that they hired for the meetings and yeah wait we've got next one because it'll just it'll just say oh here we are yep so this is what it's like the free-range animals the cows know where they come from and they know how to get back home so there's a Shepherd there but I think they just kind of self-driving amazing technology GPS um so so here's the meeting Hall so these were Outreach meetings but the um but but a lot of Believers came not just from Brother Moses church but from many different Church so it was a great real great Unity among the people everyone just just rallied behind it and it was a real blessed time he says there's Brother Andy teaching them um I took the enemy's camp so um but they loved Brother Andy and Brother Andy love them we had a good time you know how you know our brother says that you know when you love someone they know it they can feel it so this guy was just oozing love and they loved him amen that was really awesome so yeah we had a great time so it was 30 something degrees it was thinking it was 50 degrees Maybe it felt like it anyway yeah yeah yes this is now this brother Moses there leading some songs after one of the services um yes it was very loud you could feel the music oh yeah it was like you wouldn't be able to die in one of these Services because you'd get resuscitated by the base yeah it was awesome but within this crowd there were people from the local community and yeah so it was good to hear some of the Believers so this is a good friend of brother um poor yeah brother dumasani to people and his family there that's uh brother Moses and that's his wife here and some of the boys are theirs and some of the boys are there so you know and yeah anyway but it was really powerful I don't know if I have it next but Brother Andy gave his testimony this is between one of the services they made a semicircle and he shared his testimony and it really spoke to a lot of the young people and I think there's about what how many about seven eight people were baptized I think and most of them were young people and by the end he was preaching on identity and weaved at him with his testimony very powerful and it really spoke to them real real good you know because especially in this community there's a lot of drinking there's a lot of drugs there's people have nothing to do yeah literally nothing to do they just it's just crazy how you watch them and they're just walking around and they don't have sports like the worldly people here they have sports I mean I'm not saying your worldly if you go and do sports but that's what the world does that's all they have yeah they don't even have that there's no one to organize that stuff they just wander and aimless yeah so they need the Lord it's a good opportunity yeah so we were there oh so now here we are brother Andy's about to experience mangoes I just thought I'd put this in here because we're people too you know we're not all like anyway um this is we if you haven't tried these mangoes if you've only eaten mangoes in New Zealand you haven't had mangoes yet literally it's not even the same species I'm sure one of these mangoes had like a popcorn aftertaste it was amazing oh it was so good anyway so that was good and then most of their grass actually peanut bushes because that's what they grow there too very sandy soil but it's perfect for that and here we are McDonald's trying to trying the food as well we had a great I think in Fellowship it was really good with the brothers and stuff we had a real good time you know they broke down some barriers and had some great times and then we went to after so so we've kind of jumped but we've gone from Bush back bridge we've gone down to mumbbella and then we've come down to this is in Johannesburg so brother Matt would know a few of these people because this is his family so it's his dad their brother Glenn that's his brother Mark gav Kevin all right and that's brother Donnie who's gonna be here hopefully this weekend yes so it's uh Maria's uh dead Maria Donaldson yeah and yeah there's us turn there's brother Moses so we went to uh so brother Matt's sister's place and her husband uh Rick so he was the one we prayed for a while ago had the cancer and remember it got into the cartilage and it stopped and apparently it doesn't normally happen so he was still on I think he just finished his chemo he wasn't very well he wasn't in this photo um and when we were there he couldn't eat anything solid he's just having protein shakes and things but then after we've left we've heard that he started eating solar food again is that right so praise the Lord yeah yeah so um praise God but we really praying more that the Lord would bring him bring him home to him yes you know but but he actually asked for prayer and he's very emotional way well he cried so we we we got together and prayed and then the presence of the Lord was very real and he he began crying in the room so yeah he was touched that was awesome now I think I've actually missed out I put this out of order but now we're going to go sorry now we're at the drug rehabilitation center so Brother Andy was invited to this drug rehabilitation center this in a informal settlement just south of or west of emalahini wherever it is and these are all guys who are in a Christian drug rehab and um it was very powerful there too all they had was a drum listen that's all you need a Bible and a drum Ellen you can have wish and then yeah so there's a yes there's a Christian rehab um the pastor who's not in this video couldn't see um he had a burden these guys come cold turkey off the streets they have three services a day and right out the gate there's a Tavern there's a bar blasting music so he asked can we pray against this tavern oh yeah so we pray that the tavern owner would become a Christian amen you know so hey God can destroy what like the time of uh you know you know on the back in the day people yeah God would destroy whiskey Stills into all kinds of things so God can do what he wants so but you got to ask him right so yeah we ask big because we're we've got a big God so that was powerful and then okay so now we're in I'm sorry now we've actually I I've put haven't put this in order now we're in mahola so we've gone from Bush back Ridge now we'll go North to mahola now the reason I put this photo here this is a white diker I asked one of the guides is this really said you if you Google it there's only one other photo of another one in the world this is a very rare animal we're rare animals too we're we're a rare species Hallelujah and we're not here to be rehabilitate we're here to be transformed amen praise God so um yes it's a white lion um yes this is a there's a leopard cup that I got to hold for some reason brother Brian just passed it to me not like a normal kitten that just got mad so it didn't scratch me but anyway yeah so yeah there's brother Brian Jones who knows brother Brian Jones yeah so he's pushing 79 but just he hasn't slowed down I don't think he ever will I was hard to keep up with him yeah he just on a beeline gone we just had to follow yeah so that was that was real neat this is on the Kruger there's a um yeah some elephants I just thought I'd show the kids we saw there was this big Andy but Andy was driving us in the Kruger there's a big bull elephant walking down the road towards us he ain't pulling over he's got one lane so yeah exit stage right even yeah yeah yeah we yeah we didn't do no we turned around and went the other way yeah so here we are so we're there and they get the snake out it's not well that they because being poisoned or whatever and they get it out and brother Brian's wearing it's gonna throw up its lunch and anyway they give me the head but they and he got the tail and everything came out the tail in thankfully about time but yeah snakes aren't nice to hold but yo but yeah and they said don't don't don't grip it too tightly now the snake we fight the devil we want to crush it oh yeah we're not just holding it saying look what I got we're gonna crush the thing but this thing no we don't crush it anyway yeah yeah it was moving it wasn't happy and um one of the guide said okay I'll show you how to put it back as an enclosure said no you're putting this here so it opened its mouth very wide yeah lots of tea so this is Brother Brian's wife sister Jenny now we didn't know but when we came there he asked because we went into the house Christine's been there and um they asked prayer for her because she said she had a uh operation was about a year ago or something and she's on medicines and just wasn't helping she said I really need the Lord to touch me yeah so we're in Niger with oil we prayed for her yeah and what did you hear a couple of days after that she was yeah brother Brian uh mentioned that she's well search the Lord healed her yeah so we're very thankful to the Lord yeah amen it's still the same today yeah amen so God's got everywhere that's brother Moses there so if you're ever up in that part of the world go there yeah go there whatever it's amazing yeah his testimony is amazing now we're in polokwane so there's um here's here's a couple here are very very special people yeah it's brother and Paul's parents praise the Lord they came down for one one of the days and was amazing it was I actually got emotional meeting then was very special yeah I actually said I uh we owe you a lot for letting you allow your family to come this side yeah we're in a great great um yes this is the church so they just put a church up they have church not like New Zealand so praise God see that big box there that's a subwoofer and they've got two of them and they use them really well oh yes oh yeah praise the Lord so Hallelujah and then this is after one of the services you'll see Brother Andy here dancing around cries a lot there's there's room yeah actually yeah no it's funny like behind this Pulpit there was a lot of room in the back I thought why have they got all this room here I find out why but the track there's a track around and this is brother and Paul's brother here too youngest brother I don't know what brother and Paul looked like when he was 30. that's him there he's coming soon yeah he said he's gonna come over what I love about the African people is that they're not critical oh and I was thinking man we need to we need to absorb that yeah something goes wrong praise God let's just walk off doesn't matter it doesn't matter no you know lots goes wrong we may just carry on their anointing States they don't lose the spirit they just carry on yeah no it's very yeah it's a real blessing amazing um yeah so okay so this is this is towards it so so this is Pastor Johannes here so he was um he looked after us real nice um real nice so what this is is this is an engagement this is not a wedding this is an engagement so this is the groom site this is the bridegroom side there she is back there and that's him there and their families dance one one side dances up the aisle the other side danced up the island and yes they had an engagement that's a real celebration South Africans know how to celebrate oh yes they just celebrate everything and now I understand yes anytime there's any sort of reason to celebrate it's a big party and it's people and families and yeah everything that's good yeah I think I think man we should wait we've got life to celebrate eternal life so hallelujah praise the Lord I think we should celebrate so yeah so we had um five services in Bush buck five here then a couple between so I was quite busy but it was great we just fed off each other and um I think the Lord really did a work so I don't know if I have any more oh yes and then we're at mug and Bean uh at the airport this is just before we left that cheese with a muffin and butter yeah I was very skeptical but it actually works you have to try it it was wonderful yeah I think that's the last one you go so I just kind of there was one thing I I really enjoyed was they just passed the microphone to the sisters at in the service and they just sing and the whole place is just filled with music yeah that the singing I mean it was definitely filled with music but the singing I mean it was just such another dimension and they could sing yeah oh yeah yeah and I realized where sister sippy gets it from it pays a lot that's singing voice it's amazing so praise the Lord yeah that was wonderful yeah um I think yeah but it was a real blessed trip that was real good made some real good lifelong friends yes but it's heaven right so you go there you see a bit of Heaven you want everyone to come this side but you come the side and he goes yeah it's like you go to a camp somewhere you want everyone to move where you are but it's just heaven right because you just Same Spirit so yeah it was real good praise a lot I think I think that's us praise the Lord okay God bless you so so that was our report if you want to hear any more we can fill you in on details but you know we had a lot of uh exciting times anyway yeah um okay let's stand shall we tonight we're just going to have a prayer meeting um uh but we're gonna go to Mark 11 now when that last service we were in we only had because we had to catch a plane a certain time we're in polokwane we had to drive through hours we only had a very short time to speak but the Lord really touched the people with this topic and I just can't get it off my heart so I'm gonna I'm gonna speak it to you um which brother Billy Williams spoke a few years ago but I think it's good to revisit these things um so we're going to go to Mark 11 and 22. and we're going to read it says and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God for very I send you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what's in what things over ye desire When you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if ye have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses amen let's just bow heads once again Lord Jesus the Lord there could have been many other things we could have said there Lord You've Done many things Lord we want to praise your name you kept us safe you kept our family safe and now we're back together once again and Lord as we've just read from your holy word I pray dear God that you Lord the great author would come and touch every life Lord You're the one we need in this moment dear God so may you come and take control of Our Lives For Your Glory anoint speaker and hero one more time we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats uh tonight so I want to talk about the power of forgiveness now we all want the power of the you know there's the power of the spoken word we're living in the time of the third Paul and you know we know this is more than buzzwords but it's creative Powers placed in the in the mouth of the Bride you know of the bride of Christ and we have power to speak creation the thing is perfect Faith which we just read about that perfect Faith to move mountains is bound with forgiveness so many people want the power of God but they're not willing to make the sacrifice to get the power of God and that sacrifice is actually forgiving you know it's quite amazing such a simple thing uh can you know can uh be so simple off forgiveness it seems like very Elementary Sunday school topic but it's very powerful it's very vital in every stage of our Christian walk that we cannot hold anything against anyone and if we do it actually just binds us so I I want to be Unbound today I want to be free to walk with God I don't want to be bound in my own little pity things that are relative to what he has done for me you know I want to walk with him because he wants us to walk with him you know so so perfect Faith the power of the third Paul is tied to forgiveness if you do not forgive he will not forgive you it's that simple I want to be forgiven right it doesn't matter if you think you're good or bad whatever I want to be forgiven right so if you're not willing to forgive he will not forgive you that's that is if you read it in your Bible or read Letter Bible leads the words of our Lord Jesus Christ so there will be trials along the way we understand that our faith will be tried now this is from three different Bible versions here the King James is the top under the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it betrayed with fire might be found under praise and honor and Glory the peering of Jesus Christ so our faith will be put on trial now the English Standard Version it says so that they tested genuineness of your faith so so your faith is going to be tested whether it's a genuine Faith or not so so a genuine faith will stay with the word regardless it will it will take the word of God above feelings above imagination but what someone said your past your history your present it will take the word of God above all those things a faith that is not genuine is just one while everyone else my friends are in church so I'll be in church or my family's in church therefore I'm going to be in church that is not a genuine Faith right all the food's good so I'm going to come or the music's good so I'm going to come or you know you know that guy who preaches once in a while yeah yeah he sounds okay so I'm going to come that's not genuine faith and that faith will be tried and it will collapse it'll have a critical structural failure and it will fall apart so so our faith will be tested whether it's a genuine Faith or not which is what he says here and then also the the brilliant Standard Bible says that the proven character of your faith so the character of your faith what is the character of your faith is it a selfish faith I'm just here for me we're not just here for ourselves we're here for each other right a Divine gift is for not the person who has it but it's for someone else and we all have a Divine gift of faith it may operate in different ways by singing preaching praying whatever it may be but it's still not for ourselves it's for one another Amen brother Graham had that stomach issue came up every seven years and he would yet he would touch people and they'd be healed in there thousands and hundreds but yet he had that thing why because the gift in his life wasn't for himself amen it's the same thing with Paul he had that infirmity in his flesh all those different things but yet he you know he had a he had an anointed powerful Holy Ghost filled Ministry but yet he would suffer with those things why because that Divine gift in his life was for the people so so the character of our faith is going to be proved you know you know a bad character has bad attributes and it's manifested in a bad way so a bad character of ways stealing cheating lying all those kind of things is manifested in a life the same thing with a bad character of Faith now if it's a selfish faith if it's only if well if you're good to me I'll be good to you that's a bad faith that is not the character of Jesus Christ as a faith you know because real faith is tied to me to Divine love where it doesn't matter how you treat me I'm still going to love you anyway that's how that's how our faith should be sure because Jesus said of you know if if you get smitten in One Cheek give them the other one that should be our faith right so so the character or the genuiness of our faith is going to be tried it's going to be put to the test you know and and we may think we cannot stand the test but the Lord knows what we have need of and the Lord knows what we can go through and he wants to prove to you if your faith is genuine or not praise God Amen that's what it is because actually if you think about it if your faith is not genuine and you and and something comes in your life and your son is not genuine then you can actually go to God and repent and get him to build rebuild your life that you're no longer living a lie but he can say he can come to you and say hey you need genuine you need my faith you don't need human Faith you need my faith see the Apostle Peter had had a faith that was not genuine in the beginning yet he had the Revelation now at the Christ the son of the Living God but it was human Faith but there's a part of him that wasn't dead yet so when the when the testing of his faith the character of his faith came to the test he failed there's a critical structural failure in his life he was standing by you know so so he would he would look in the eyes of the Lord Jesus and say I'll never forsake thee I'm going to stand with you I've got a sword I'm ready to die with you you know but then but then when his faith was put to the test and he'll be warming himself by a fire outside of Pilot's judgment Hall just to see what's going on and a woman would come to and say hey aren't you one of them aren't you one of them here's the same one who said I'll never forsake you because the Buckle under the questioning of just a one random woman not the Sanhedrin not a high priest just a random woman who happened to be there then another one asked the same question then another one and I said even your speech betrays you so so how you're acting how you're talking to me actually portrays to you that you're actually a Christian but because his faith wasn't genuine it was a human faith it fell apart that's why we need Divine faith we need the faith of the Son of God I'm going to move through this fairly quickly because we're going to have a time of prayer but I trust it really it really anchors down deep because we're going to beat this is a year that we should really be soul-searching because we don't want to be disappointed on that day we want to go the full Assurance I know in whom I have believed my faith is genuine because I can look back at my life with someone treated me bad I love them anyhow I didn't hold the grudge there's nothing in me that could hold a grudge I could never hold any resentment there was nothing in me that could hold it you know like a civil something it can't hold water right we're going to be like that when it comes to any malice or Strife or envy that tries to pour into our lives we're just full of holes it just goes through oh where did that go I don't know I'm not looking for it but it's gone right because the devil wants to pull us full of porous full of malice and strife and trouble and all those things but if our faith is genuine it will pull right through because it's incredible when you know what people do out of out of out of annoyance and they claim they're worshiping God you know Henry VII we know he started the Anglican Church the reason he started that church is because the Catholic Church wouldn't let him get remarried or wouldn't let him get divorced so on a tantrum he started his own movement and that's how it was birthed you know people do things for a lot less they go start their own church go split fellowships go leave churches go do other things claiming to be serving God but yet their faith is not pure their faith is not genuine because they're annoyed at someone else and how often do people worship God in the message but it's the wrath of man praising God they're annoyed at someone else the reason they're still a Believer is because they want to prove to someone else they're going to stand there'll come a time when that Faith which is not genuine will buckle right so we don't want to be worshiping God out of because I'm annoyed at someone else or that church does this or this person said this whatever more we want to be Believers because God has called us he first loved us that down Calvary and we love him in response that's why I'm a Christian right that's how we should be amen amen that's how we should be because he first loved me I love him in return amen I do not be a Christian to try and earn anything no he earned it for me that day on Calvary I'm just living as a Christian out of appreciation amen that he looked beyond my faults and saw my need and that's the thing we're really a genuine faith will look beyond the fault of a person right we may not get the answer straight away but we'll be praying saying Lord how can I help this person right and normally Jesus said the way to help someone is to get the beam out of your own eye then you can see what's in there oh that's a you know that's actually the best thing to help you say Lord help me change my vision that I could maybe help my brother Hallelujah because remember this this whole this whole walk is actually a self checking up walk that God would examine and change us and do surgery that were made in His image things will happen in families things will happen in churches you say well the issue is this no actually that's big no no the issue is this but it's not this it's actually what's the defect in our character that needs to be changed that's what that's why Trials come up it's something in us that needs to be molded and shaped praise God I'm glad I'm on his operating table I'm glad I'm on his wheel and he's molding me how does he mold me through trouble he allows things to come up and you and you know maybe something happens to you and it bothers you that's good then you can go to Lord and prayer and say Lord why do I fill this way against these people why have I emotionally shut off and disconnected myself and you know I find that's my biggest challenge with people I just I just maybe it's a coping mechanism and it bothers me like Lord I don't want to be like this I want to have a feeling I want to have a love not just an annoyance not just a well put them in a box and that's just their light in life and they're stuck that way that's wrong I'm I'm actually preaching to myself right now well we can't just put people in a box and say well or take a photo of them and say that's how they be for the rest of their life are you God but why do we why do we act like God towards people are they never going to get saved they're always going to be foolisher is going to be in and out and full of trouble who says you know no if we have a genuine Faith we'll look beyond their fault and see their need right because the Lord Jesus looked beyond your fault isn't it amazing Before Time Ever began he looked through the strands of time he knew all the sin you'd do he knew you'd be born in sin to begin with he knew you'd be born lost and everything you'd do against him did that stop him from going to Calvary for you no he saw a joy set before him which was you redeemed Made In His Image and Eternity and I think Lord give us a vision of one another that we can have a joy set before us when there's a clash or something that we can look beyond the now and see the end for that person they won't be stuck in this fight but they'll be redeemed through it I mean because we've got to believe for one another right we should have faith not just for ourselves but for one another amen but the thing is of our faith is genuine we will but if our faith is not genuine we won't because genuine Faith does not want to lift themselves up genuine Faith actually wants to be a servant of all and wants everyone else to be lifted up that's what Jesus did he says I've not come to minister but to I'm not going to be ministered to but to minister right the greatest of all should be the servant of all amen so we should never ever want to want to tear each other down see unforgiveness is like an addiction like someone who smokes or drinks or on drugs they wreck their family eventually unforgiveness does the same thing there's no smoke coming out of any lips or any e-cigarette or any bottles or any any needles on the ground but yet is just as bad because the person can play the part look the right part be as holy as holy can be on the outside but if there's unforgiveness on the inside that will that will destroy that family it will destroy a church we must never ever pass our unforgiveness onto our children we must never ever let a bad attitude that we have towards someone be passed out onto our children because in our children it will be Amplified a hundred times remember with Elisha all those kids came out said go up bald head go up the reason I said that is because their parents were talking that against the prophet so their their annoyance or bad attitude towards the man of God was magnified in the kids and all those kids died so we never want to let unforgiveness come down into our children we must be very careful what we share with them he said well they're grown up no can they I don't think they can stand a lot of things that we are a bit older but we should never pass bad attitudes towards our family you know about someone else because they'll pick up our grudges they'll oh because we're family will stand together you've got to be careful what you stand with you know if there's if there's an idol of unforgiveness in the family you want to be like get in and cut that thing down you want to be standing alone in that family they're respecting the father and mother but you don't want to be worshiping that Idol why because it will bring destruction that's very important we there's no there should be no unforgiveness in our lives it should bother us if we have a grudge it should bother us if we think about someone and have an ill feeling that should bother us because we should be able to think about our worst enemy and just think love so you should be just say if I'm your best friend you don't need to wave or anything but just say just for arguments like if I was your best friend and you think about me that way praise the Lord then think about your enemies you should be able to think about us as the same because Divine love that's how we should be and if you are not feeling that way you should go to prayer because it's not your enemy or someone who's treated you wrong that's in the wrong it's you it's it's vital we get because I want to see the power of the spoken word in this church I want to see an eye an ice and sapphires again not people dying but just sin be spoken out that the devil has no place to work in our lives that he's Bound by a chain of circumstance that he cannot work in any of us right that's what I want to see the ninth spiritual gifts operating God is moving in power that's like man every Service is like Sunday night at Camp absolutely praise the lord we we can't put a roof on our faith or what God can do he's unlimited amen but our unforgiveness will stop him moving so I want him to move who wants to see Jesus Hallelujah that's what I want so praise God Amen so the Apostle Paul would say I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me so his faith was a genuine Faith because it was the faith of the Son of God notice it doesn't say faith in the Son of God no it was the son of God's own faith in him and that's genuine Faith because it's actually God puts his faith in you Hallelujah so that so this is see he see the life I now live he used to live a different kind of life I'm going to destroy those Christians and I'm gonna give me high priest give me some letters of authority I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna put them in prison I'm gonna make them return I'm gonna torture them see he lived a different kind of life by human faith and then God made him and he lived by the faith of the son of Gods amen so he didn't have a he didn't have a human Faith after the road to Damascus amen and we must have our own road to Damascus experience where the Lord speaks to us and gets us off our high horse and knocks us to the ground and say Lord who are you I'm Jesus whom you persecute Hallelujah praise God now forgiveness sets people free of Trials who wants to be stuck in a trial I'm glad some people didn't people didn't say Amen because no one wants to be in a trial but but unforgiveness keep can keep you on a trial now this is this is from The Book of Job this is job 42 5-10 it says job responding to the Lord I've heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now my I see a thief wherefore I abhor myself repent and dust and Ashes and it was so that after the Lord had spoken these words unto job the Lord spoke unto elefaster temanite my wrath is kindled against thee and against thy two friends for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right as my servant job saith so the Lord's been saying you've been lying about me to job you have not been telling the truth to job about me this is this is why I'm angry at you this is what the Lord's saying therefore take unto you now seven Bullocks and seven Rams and go to my servant job and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering and my servant job shall pray for you for whom will I accept lest I deal with you after your Folly and that ye have not spoken made the thing which is right like my servant job so now job has to do something you think about it his best friends have been spending I don't know how long telling him he's a secret sinner being very spiritual about it and basically giving him a warped idea of who God is right they've been lying to him and so now job has to actually pray for those people who are actually trying to basically destroy him so elephants are timonite and Bill Dad the shoe light and so far the name and I went and did according as the Lord commanded them the Lord also accepted job so these ones had to go to him and say the Lord's angry against us you have to pray for us now job could have just held that unforgiveness said well you've been lying to me all this time and my greatest trial you do not help me you're telling me I'm a secret Sinner and all these things and you've been lying to me about about God now I need to pray for you but job was a man of God because he had faith in the blood of the Lamb and he and the Lord accepted job because he could forgive he had to forgive his friends before he prayed for them right are you willing to do that oh but they did this and this and this against listen the nails in Jesus hands and feet did not hold them to the cross and also the Romans didn't put him there our sins put him there it wasn't the high priest it wasn't the Sanhedrin it wasn't the Romans it was our sin that drove him to Calvary and his love for us held him there till he died it wasn't the nails sure the Bible said they pierced my hands on my feet but it wasn't it was love that held him there Hallelujah so look so so if he could forgive us of all of our sin not just past but present and future and our iniquities and our secret faults and all if he can forgive us of all those things how can we hold a grudge against someone how can we hold resentment well this person did this to me but what did you do to the Lord the great king of glory you sent him to Calvary and yet will hold a little thing that really means nothing against someone and it will be just this big thing in our life and will live looking only through that we should be Looking Through The Eyes of the blood of Jesus Christ that's how we should be looking at all things before this person and they deserve that and they deserve this and while I knew that was coming to them you hypocrite that's wrong that is not that is not forgiving how can Faith work in your life if you hold things against one another well you say I'm not willing to forgive but I'm willing to walk with God if you're not willing to forgive you cannot walk with God it's really that straightforward you'll stay captive in your unforgiveness until you're willing to say Lord forgive them I forgive them Lord and because true forgiveness actually surrenders the right to hold it against someone now trust is a different thing trust is earned but forgiveness should be freely given right so we cannot hold anything against anyone doesn't matter how they treat you doesn't matter if they never change it's actually about you because your faith must be tried is it genuine Faith oh praise God at campus genuine holy the spirit's moving God's all no what about in everyday life what about when there's problems in the family extended family father Outlaws mother Outlaws whatever you know in-laws you know what about those things people that just won't reconcile with you what do you do about do you hold it against them you know some Wars have been fought so long people forgot why they started I doubt very much of the hundred year war against the French and the English they probably forgot what they're fighting about when it was about year 98 they just well we're fighting this war this is what we've been doing for Generations forget what the past has done don't be dictated to by the previous generations this is a new season this is a new hour we should not be dredging up the past and trying to live through it it's like brother kydra said about the civil rights movement in America he says he didn't tell his kids about it because it just brings up those Spirits again that's my brother Cadre he said that although there's some wisdom in that why because we're pressing forward amen We're Not Looking Back Peter said forgetting the things which are behind press to the mark of the high quality but but I've been hurt by it sure you may have been hurt but forgiveness brings healing forgiveness brings healing praise the Lord and when the Lord heals someone it turns it from a pain to a victory who wants Victory then then forgive Let It Go but you know don't let unforgiveness be such a part of your identity you can't separate it from yourself for some people do there's grudges that still go on you know we should let it go we don't need to carry those things we don't need to be dragged down by the past just let it go let go of insecurity Let It Go Hallelujah just just let it all go and the Lord turned the Captivity of job when he prayed for his friends also the lord gave job twice as much as he had before so job's trial ended when he forgave his friends and prayed for them see how unforgiveness can keep someone captive they can be in their own high Max security facility in their mind because they're not willing to forgive who wants to be in prison that yet people make a prison for themselves it's not the devil that put them in that keeps them in the trial it's their own unforgiveness keeps them in the trial we don't want to be captive to unforgiveness what is it an eternity will you remember it will it be the big thing that's your identity over there it won't even be remembered so why not forget about it now why not put it under the blood of Jesus Christ and walk on but if you forgive not many trespassers neither will your father forgive your trespasses I want to be forgiven I want to be set free I want to walk with God that's what he wants he wants that more than you want it so I say let's just let's just you say well I need prayer no no you need to talk to the Lord yourself and let it go it's you and God you're the one who forgives we can pray for you all day long anoint with buckets of oil but you've got to be the one that forgives and lets go of it but I've been holding on for this for so long let go may this be a new year where the things that would bother us in our mind and torment us because of unforgiveness in our Spirits last year might just be gone let's let's walk with God who wants to walk with him today Hallelujah I mean let's just let's just stand to our feet I know we've got some prayer requests and so on but let's just bow heads this evening Who Wants to Be Remembered in prayer say I want to I don't want any any unforgiveness I don't want any feelings I don't want no bad when I think of anyone in my life I want it all gone let's let's pray gracious father Dear God Lord Jesus as we come to you this night oh you're the great king of glory Lord Lord we can't hide anything from you Lord we may have a lot of reasoning why we hold on to unforgiveness but Lord you look through the reasoning Lord you look through it oh God and you say no that reason doesn't mean nothing it's because you're not willing to forgive oh God I pray in the name of Jesus Christ dear God may we be willing to forgive even our bitterest enemy my Lord father maybe it's an uncle or a father or a mother or a cousin or a grandparent or a friend or a spouse or whoever it may be or gone father maybe a government or I don't know Lord Jesus who it may be

Jesus Christ so father I pray Lord Jesus as you do not hold it against us Lord but there's a joy set before you which was us redeemed dear God I pray we would look at how look at our unforgiveness
