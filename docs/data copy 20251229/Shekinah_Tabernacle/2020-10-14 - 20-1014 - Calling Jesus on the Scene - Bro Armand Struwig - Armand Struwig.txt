[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] do [Music] do [Music] um [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] do [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] do [Music] of the lord amen [Music] okay praise the lord [Music] you know just a thought today you know that we're gathered here we were eagles yeah we know who we are it doesn't matter what's happening out in the world we know that there's a destination and that eagles are predestinated to be in that destination and that's what is so good about it you know this gathering here is not just because we're gathering we're gathering because there's a destination there's a place that we're going to there's a home that's gone to be prepared for us which means we don't have to even go and build the house hey ben whether this tiny house or a big mansion it's what you desire that god says you'll meet all those desires my you know that destination is like you're going on a plane trip somewhere somewhere maybe down to south africa and you know that that's your destination and so you've got to put things into order you got to go and get your flight tickets you've got to make sure your seats your your passport and everything has to be put in order amen but you know that when you get on that plane as you sit down like you're sitting now on this flight ready to go you do a checklist have you got this have you got that are the kids tucked in the seatbelts on these are things that you have to look at because they say order and god is a god of order amen and then just as you're ready to take off the captain comes over the intercom says ladies and gentlemen there's been a delay [Music] my and that's where satan tries to buffet us that's where we feel that sometimes it's put there for a purpose and this delay that you the captain's telling you is just the environmental atmosphere and the same for us it's just the environmental atmosphere that we're standing in and then he tells you that it's going to be a delay of an hour and a half but we're about to take off anyway but now the route has been changed amen but the destination is still the same hallelujah so wherever we go in our walk in our life don't worry you're going to get there the destination has been chosen and predestinated for you amen and that's our purpose tonight our prayers are going to reach that destination our prayers are going to go around instead of going over or through they're going to go around the obstacles and as we heard about these little foxes they're just little obstacles praise a lot not you the obstacles the little foxes but our predestination has been chosen already praise the lord so just let us stand hallelujah [Music] our gracious lord hallelujah lord with everything that we have with

we'll open up in a word of prayer quickly and then what we'll do we'll ask isaac to sing a song and then you can take your seat so if you want to remain standing we can read the word of god i don't want it to be formal the only reason i need a bit of a more space is because i've got so many notes and i want to make sure i don't miss anything so praise the lord let's just close our eyes say lord jesus we've sold out lord lord we are just walking in your presence lord when we sing the songs of zion and sing these songs it means something to us lord i don't just sing it because it's a hymn oh you're worth it i sing it lord because i mean it just i give you my heart and i give you my soul lord lord we surrendered lord where else shall we go we've got the words of eternal life lord lord we ask that you would just be here with us tonight lord come in and dwell with your people lord speak to each one of us lord lord make it real yes lord break this powers of the prince of the darkness lord lord just this little bit of time on a wednesday that we put for you lord we set it aside for the king of glory because i didn't come here lord just for another service lord i came to hear from the king lord i came to draw strength from evanna's vapes lord i didn't come here for any other reason but to pray and pray without seizing lord and pray for my loved ones lord and pray for the ones

welcome in lord jesus we open the sermon in the name of our lord jesus christ and lord have your way in the name of our lord jesus christ amen we'll all have your seat we'll just have brother isaac sing a song for us and then we'll stand for the word i'm sailing over the stormy seas the waves are crashing over and the daylight hides his face from me fear in intrudes and the storm of greece but i look and i see who's in the boat with me jesus you're here there is nothing that i need to fear you're here you're here [Music] there is nothing that i need to fear there is nothing that i need to fear because jesus is here waves you won't break me storm you won't shake me jesus is here oh ye tempest you will all be still peace be still all peace be still often i sailed through life's stormy the situations are proclaiming you will not prevail but your word saves you the raging of the seas when the waves arise still then jesus you're here there is nothing that i need to fear you're here you're here there is nothing that i need to fear [Music] there is nothing that i need to fear because jesus won't break me stone you won't shake me jesus is here oh ye tempest you will all be still [Music] peace peace be still and in your darkest hour keep your eyes on jesus when there's fear all around you keep your eyes on jesus all the raging and rolling is trying to make you forget who you have with you [Music] jesus is here waves you won't break me storm you won't shake me jesus is here [Music] oh ye tempest you will all be still peace [Music] peace be still [Music] peace amen thank you brother isaac god bless you first time i heard that song it did something for me and it was in a time where a lot of things went wrong a lot of things and all at the same time and brother isaac wrote that song a while ago and i never forgot it and i'll never forget it because when the word comes your way it changes something [Music] and a testimony is your testimony because it makes such a mark on you that you cannot walk away from that place it touches you so deep that no matter how many times people reason it out it cannot remove it from what's in here so my whole thought tonight and if you all maybe understand we'll read in the word is calling jesus on the scene so we're going to go to the book of matthew and we're going to read from matthew 8 and we'll read from verse 19 and we're going to read to verse 26 thank you musicians very much thank you brother isaac before we read it i just want to say something a bit of a disclaimer yeah when we come here we create an atmosphere so god can come down and he can speak to us no man's always got two dwelling places you can either dwell in the heavenlies or you can stay on earth so there's enough of us that can keep our minds occupied tonight but let's leave that for once and let us enter into the heavenlies because that is where overcoming power comes from so on a wednesday when i sell out to a wednesday and and i used to hate long services because i came from a denominational background but see i'm resolved you know i'm sold out so i know i suffer the next day but you know what these things changes lives this is important work is important but this is more important you know and you'll be thankful brother ben said he just sees you drag your body here and you'll drag your body into church and you'll drag your body wherever you have to go to stay away from everything i wonder you're going to drag it into a rapture and we'll thank you for it so let's drag our bodies in here and let's just let god do what god does best hey change our life amen so we start that verse 19 and it says a certain scribe came and said unto the said unto him master i will follow thee wherever thou goest and jesus said unto him the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the son of man have not where to lay his head nowhere and another of his disciples said unto him lord suffer me first to go and bury my father but jesus said unto him follow me capital letter follow me the instruction he says let the dead bury the dead and when he was entered into the ship his disciples followed him and behold there arose the great tempest in the sea in so much that the ship was covered with the waves but he was asleep and his disciples came to him and awoke him saying lord save us we perish and he sayeth unto them why are you fearful oh ye of little faith then he arose and he rebuked the winds and the seas and there was a great calm but the men marveled saying what manner of man is this that even the winds and the seas obey him amen may the lord add his blessing to this word we may be seated so i want to encourage you tonight the reason i ask brother isaac to sing these songs is is because it creates that atmosphere so that we can be attentive to what is going to happen now and thank you brother um phil for for leading tonight and i appreciate everything you guys do for me i just enjoy it so much i'll talk all night so i don't want to do it i just really want to deliver a thought for me the prayer that we do on a wednesday night is so important and we'll hopefully we can hit that tonight just and then and then that might open something up for you why we're here so we look at verse 19 and i'm just going to jump quickly through this this matthew 9. verse 19 we have a scribe and i want you to parallel this journey that jesus is having here and his disciples parallel it with your life so when we speak there put your spiritual cap on and see how you entered this message see how you met christ see what it pertains to you make it personal don't don't make it matthew 9. don't make it matthew 8 don't make it romans and make it yours take it on search your life and say where did this happen in my life because there's some things here that god is showing you that that he's already giving us the victory and he's or giving us the weapons to have the victory but he just wants you to know where you are now where are you now because if you could see where you now you could see the waves coming and you could see the master but i don't want to jump ahead but you can actually see where we are so you don't need to be fearful you don't need to be fearful you just need to call him on the scene so verse 19 it says and a certain scribe came to him and said to him master i will follow thee wherever thou go so of course this guy he was sitting and there was a prayer line going you know and and jesus christ was healing the sick and he was casting out demons and miracles happen and lame threw their crutches away and everything was happening and the scribe was all there because the scribe takes down notes he makes sure he doesn't miss anything and a testimony of the testimony of the testimony of the testimony of the vindication of the vindication every time jesus spoke no man spoke like this things happen and this guy he's zealous he says man he comes to jesus and he says to him and this is a wonderful thing and i don't think they emphasize it good enough yes this and the certain scripture said to him master i will follow you wherever you go so he's now he's now decided i'm going to follow jesus okay he's happy i'm going to follow this jesus because things happen around this man you know this is more than a man okay think about the message think about your life and i was in the world and i heard something it prickled my ears and so i was more than a man or that miracle oh that prayer line something started prickly mind going oh there's more amen you know this is not a dead book there's more so i said master i will follow you i just want to be part of you i want to just be in it oh yes so now jesus gives him a warning look at verse 20 he says that jesus saith unto him the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the son of man hath nowhere to lay his head so he's saying i have no place where i call home here because this is not my home and if you're going to follow me you ain't going to have a bit of ease just can i just move this away sorry it's restricting me you know you're not gonna have a bit of ease okay it's there's gonna be some decisions coming there's gonna be stuff happening because i'm gonna come here to settle down build my little house and just say that's it it made it and i'm a christian he said no no if you walk with me we we're gonna fight some battles that's right so he gives him a warning though he says reap between the lines there's a warning coming so now we see the disciple come ahead and the disciple now comes to jesus and these are devout men that calls him their master their rabbi this is a very devout man that follows every word of jesus that believes it not like the scribe the scribe is just a reporter he's just happy but the disciple is a bit different he's been there before he's got teaching from the from from jesus no man spoke like this they went through the scriptures searching the scriptures so they they bit more into the into the word but listen to this man he goes there and he says and another of his disciples said unto him lord suffer me first to go and bury my father it's a good request say lord i just want to go take care of this business and then i'll be in the boat with you i'll jump in and what does jesus say unto him he says to me follow me capital letter follow me and let the date bury the dead so saying now here i come out of this world and i'm infused with the message and it's preaching jesus christ and i spring up in church and i go amen and everything and now it comes to a side where jesus says now leave all that behind leave it all behind now you follow me it's going to be a tough road but now you are going to walk with me now you can't worry about the dead you can't worry about all the things hollywood all this other stuff don't worry about it remember we're here for a pre-meeting children eyes on the prize because one day jesus will call you to follow him don't miss this because that call will come and you'll be kneeling at the altar and after you gave your heart to the lord there's a couple of things we need to do and when we get here what do we do then so nobody said this is a flowery bit of it but jesus said when i call you and you cannot come here there's something you're gonna have to do because you don't just jump in the boat there's a certain way to get into this gospel boat there's a certain way in a strict instruction and you children and our spirits all come the same way you have to be born again the message of this hour if you're in a message church do not save you amen period if you tell me i've been this message and i've walked in this message 25 years doesn't mean nothing i heard it i heard it too many times then you made the message to the nomination then you through jesus christ the person he introduced away this message don't save people sorry i believe this message i eat this message but it introduced a person and the message took all these doctrines and creeds and confusion and it opened it just up for you so what are we eating hey what are we eating so sorry i get passionate about these things because it means something to me because i wasn't a denominational chicken once but i was an eagle but i was scratching around there and nobody came with these answers so but don't become a denominational chicken a message denominational chicken amen because measles don't save you i know jesus christ saves you so now the next step we need to get in that boat so what do we do to get in the boat very important jesus says in matthew 7 14 he says enter ye at the straight gate for wide is the gate and that's verse 13 and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many are there be which go in there it it says because straight now see how they spell that straight brother um uh ed can you maybe put that up that verse 14 so matthew 7 verse 14 he says but straight yeah now tell me do you use do you spell straight and i'm afrikan's first language so for me spelling is it's a monumentous challenge but tell me that's straight does that mean straight but i did some homework that's straight i'm going to get to it now you see straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it amen so jesus is busy telling his disciples there's one way to get into here and you're going to have to use the straight gate so if we look at a straight and i went and i said mr google please tell me about straight he says it's a narrow passage of water it's usually connecting two seas large assets of water together so it's a place where two oceans combine it's a straight okay and then the second definition which i thought would fit in so nicely is it's used in a reference to a situation that character characterized by a specified degree of trouble and difficulty so then he says here the the economy is in dire straits so jesus basically if you read between the lines it says you're going to have to come away but it's going to be difficult because some church in the in in the the what was it what they call that age brother andy the church that came with pepper rome and all those things that that oh yeah yeah so the catholic church came and they said oh if you're baptized in the name of father son and holy ghost that doctrine okay from the catholic church if yeah okay i'll get there but what happened is he's the library we'll just display so so they came with a false baptism and jesus knew this they knew it but it still says one name he says what is the name of the father the son and the holy ghost you don't go what's the name of the father the name of the son and the name of the holy ghost now i know this is maybe a bit it's one name singular one name then it says and he says that a lot of people will be thrown off by this little waterway this little small narrow way to get into you but luckily we have the truth praise the lord because in acts 2 38 now when the book of acts continues peter stands up and he says unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you and your children and as far off as what and as many as the lord our god so cool so there's a certain way children parents people that we get into this this gospel ship okay so there's a little bit of doctrine that's our through that that's a little sunny school lesson you cannot bypass it you cannot come by the window you cannot come any other way you'll be thrown out you have to come through that way that's it so so brother caleb leave that up there please because i might refer to it again so okay here i go i say lord jesus i'm gonna follow you i'm gonna pick a side today i wanna and that's what i did and and i did this in faith i didn't know what was going to happen so i walked through the water and asked brother ben i've never seen so much fear on someone's face than mine before i got baptized we had a photo there and if you would see the look on my face and i would i wanted to have it here but i didn't know i was going to go down this way so sorry it was a kind of a bit of a segway but i was scared to get baptized for what was scared to get baptized me the real me or that spirit that was on me yeah there we go because he knew once i did that and i decided to change sides now all of a sudden now things got real because when i was partying in the world and doing all these things he was happy you just go yeah go and there's more and there's more and there's more and you love quick and you'll love don't games and all those things i did pretty much everything you can think except drugs praise the lord i never did it but i did everything and he left me alone to do all of that but the moment i picked this side [Music] things change things change glory so now we we've and this is how it happened with me we decided to get baptized it wasn't this massive woo moment but the whole experience going through it i didn't come out of the water feeling anything different but clean i didn't feel the holy spirit brush over me i didn't feel tongues and others say i didn't feel anything fancy because it was a sincere moment where i picked a side that's it god said because i picked a sign i came out of the water and had the privilege of leading my wife into the water and she went and she got baptized as well and praise the lord we both started walking and then of course the first two days we had honeymoon because it was it was nice you know and the preacher preaches the right message on the sunday for the baptism and and he's so friendly and all the brothers and sisters shakes my hand they go god bless you and you oh they're all so happy and i have honeymoon a honeymoon i'm now in the gospel show and the ship sits off and now it starts sailing all the way down we're going jesus is in the boat and we're celebrating and i'm a christian and i'm saved and i'm bubbling all the way down the street and i sang that song that brother for you saying it um what was that last one we said when uh the the short one second last one no no no the other one on top of it no no the one that it was something beautiful yeah you have something beautiful something right this is all my confusion sorry i just couldn't get i couldn't get the song he understood so i was actually working on the roads back then shoveling roads and singing bubbling and you know whistler i promise you and people whistle it past me and i was on honeymoon it was glorious and in the wednesday they broke into my house amen for praise the lord they stole all my games they stole everything they had to steal to get rid of it because i was still a bit addicted to that thing so they stole my playstation they stole the games they stole everything anything electronic without my house and guess what i didn't have insurance and i wasn't getting paid much either so i couldn't just replace it so praise the lord the way those things came into my house man like this i had a friend that was a cricket captain and he basically offloaded everything to me dvds games that i thought man this is cool these kiwi people love us you know they just give us games and everything i never saw what was happening until it was given away and i was actually a bit angry at the guys for breaking into my house i felt like violated you know like why would you break into my house and steal my stuff so now i'm off track but i just want to say something and then my wife said just pray for these people yeah because they might need that i see but they broke into my house i'm angry man and she goes yeah but just pray for them anyways yeah yeah why the answer i they don't understand it i understand it now but that time oh i just wanted to i wanted to catch somebody so now all of a sudden all of a sudden we go to verse 24 and it says here and behold there are raves a great tempest in the sea in so much that the ship was covered with waves now i'm going to stop just there now we're in the gospel we're in the of the hour and some brother says something to you and it cuts and it hurts and you think why would he say that and it says in the rose and a great tempest in the sea in so much that the ship was covered i come to the altar and i pray for healing and it's not happening and i'm devastated why not i'm praying i'm a sincere christian praying for healing what's going on is it my faith is it the lack of it is it the promise of god that's not real i'm here i'm praying i'm not getting healed i've got a son or a daughter running in the world they don't care and i pray and i pray and i pray nothing's happening and i start doubting i start doubting i feel it i was there every son of god and every daughter of god will be tested but that don't make them less a son and daughter of god just want to bring it on level playing field but see we are stuff from the lord i pray for revelation i i asked for something that god would reveal to me maybe serpent seed or baptism or anything i pray for it and god's not answering i just don't understand i'm just a little sheep lord i'm just crying out why don't you hear me but we see it and we want to get angry but see you forfeited your right to get angry [Music] you're forfeited you're right to argue back you forfeited that right you can ask and you can ask and you can knock and you can knock but you forfeited your right to kick the door down you forfeited that right because god is sovereign and he knew what's in your heart before he chose you and before he drew you you forfeit it or if you don't understand it leave it just a bit it doesn't mean if we go to the list but jesus was asleep that doesn't mean god is sleeping that means god is dealing amen that's right that means god is dealing that's right that's right yes sir he didn't save you to lose you he didn't bring you in just to tell you you don't have overcoming power amen okay same counts for everyone because when you get baptized it says and for and it says here and the promise is unto you and your children and to all that are far off as many as the lord our gods are called so as long as god is calling that's how long we shall be walking and praying so don't stop you that promise for nothing amen okay amen amen now you cried and you cried and you prayed and you prayed and you begged and you begged and you're at the point where you cannot go anymore let me tell you something let's go to luke 18. let's go to luke 18. and we're to read this from verse 1 and we're going to read there and it says at the same time at the same time came the disciples unto jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven oh wait sorry sorry i got that wrong sorry that's not it i think it's i've turned my page back luke 18 sorry this is good again sorry i didn't turn the page i would say here we go and he spake about he spoke a parable unto them to this end that men ought always do and that men ought always to and that men ought always to pray amen and not faint saying there is this there is in a city a judge which feareth not god neither regarded man and there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me of my adversary and he said not for a while but afterward he said within himself though i fear not god or a god not men yet because this woman troubleth me i will avenge at least by her continual coming she wears me and the lord said hear what the unjust just say amen and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him amen though we bear along with them i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth amen not overcoming power not perfect people faith because every promise in this word is for us everyone and he's only asked you to believe only believe what did the prophet preach only believe all things are possible now he's saying before i come back before the son of god is revealed if i come back shall i find faith so we just need to hang in no matter what happens we just need to hang on amen no matter what happens amen that's right just hang on the reason for it in romans 7 and i'll just read it it's verse 18 to 23 it says for i know ben said it on on sunday and it touched me so much he says for i know that in me that is the flesh dwelleth no good thing for i for to will is present with me but how to perform which is good i find not for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do now if i don't do that which i would not it is no more either do it but sin that dwelleth in me i find then a law so so here in romans paul's speaking about this law and he says i find a law that when i would do good evil is present with me so now remember when we preach the greatest battle ever fought now basically what happens is he says i find that when i try to do good evil is right at the door he says but now look at the let's look at the the um the types here he says verse 22 for right the light in the law of god so there's a law of god okay which wareth against or warring against the law of the mind okay and bringing me uh but i see another oh sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry he says for i delighted from the law of god which is the inward man so that's your soul man that's your soul okay that comes from god that's the holy spirit is in there but i see another law in my members so there's a second law and this is the the the man that fights the game god that this is satan and this is this is god so your flesh the fallen man fighting against the law god which is in you so this is to do fighting but look where they fight they say warring against the law of my mind and bringing him into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members so now he's saying i identify the moment i start making things wrong there's something here going on and then most of the battles is here doubt faith you know belief unbelief god's promise i don't get the promise um uh i've i've written a couple of things that i maybe want to touch it quickly because it's gonna it's gonna come to the story he says here this is what happens in our body faith versus doubt believing unbelief spirit against the flesh soul against the body we we get so worked up by which dog are you feeding which dog are we thinking remember you'd preach that how's your diet so jesus says i'm in the boat he's in the boat he's not asleep he didn't forget he's not slumbering he's just putting you in a situation where you just have to find your feet just work on that faith muscles just go boob devil back because he's already got the answer i'll show you now here comes a lady and she comes to brother branham and i'm sorry i'm taking a bit longer i really apologize for that and he says and she says to brother branham she says jesus christ was a man and brother branham goes everybody was god he said okay i'll prove it i'll prove it by the scriptures he was a man and she goes to the book of where lazarus is in the grave and jesus walks to the grave and he's crying he's crying because he loves lazarus she sees see he's a man she goes okay but when they rolled away that human he says lazarus come forth he was god amen now here's jesus in the boat sleeping tired resting he was a man but when he came on that boat and all the disciples were doubting he says fear not i don't know why you're fearing i'm here and he said be still that's it amen and everything in nature kept quiet now here's the devil raging at you your children won't come in yeah come on you don't have enough faith the rapture is not for you healing is not yours you're an unbeliever keep doubting who's calling jesus on the scene who's calling him when it gets too rough and you you want to tap out why don't you go to the boat and wake jesus up why don't you go and say lord i know you're sovereign but i'm struggling here i can't fight this battle i'm not winning but come fight it for me amen and then god comes and he says i the lord shall fight for you you shall hold your peace and god will take that battle he will fight it for you but we have to get to that point where we know that it's not your how good you are for how long you are it's god's promise in this word so why do we come tonight for a pre-meeting no i don't i i honestly come here every time we pray here i have someone i want to pray for someone i testify to somewhere i need help and guidance this is why i come here so we're here so let's pray to the living god to come on the scene to change these things yes our children our friends our family or workmates amen i did not come here to get blown over by waves amen i didn't come here to get shipwrecked i came here to call jesus on the scene amen lord jesus there is nothing nothing that god can't do amen we believe in the sovereign god that created heaven and all his glory that has sovereignity that can come into a room and dwell with his people and go out and you can feel these presents and you can see miracles and people can get eyes in the these sockets and they can throw crutches away and walk see it was all good when the prophet was preaching it the people believed because it was there the anointing was there where did it go where did it go when did miracles stop come on when i find it hard to believe yeah come on that's right huh it's not a camp to camp to camp to catch the camp we're making ready for camp we're not making ready for camp this is camp this is camp glorious so yes maybe some people feel they want to do fishing at camp it's fine get them there because one moment in god's atmosphere can change their life amen changes my life okay so whosoever come let them come while god is calling let us make hay hey amen so praise the lord
