today hope you ever weekend birthday why not well just a big day I mean the free yard just let's go to the scripture John chapter 13 got that slideshow there sorry oh here we go so I brother our man down oh here we go I'm gonna have to hit me yeah it's me okay as long as you're up this was still alive yeah let's go to st. John 13 and verse 20 it's got a few um and then we're gonna go to 2nd Peter chapter 1 so st. John 13 of verse 20 so see it's here Jesus speaking velly velly which means absolutely absolutely I say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me so you've got to receive who God sends and if you receive her God sends you receive him they meant and let's go to 1st Peter chapter 1 I mean sorry 2nd Peter chapter 1 so she can Peter 1 and verses 10 to 12 and this is sort of a context here but he says here wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall for an for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth can everyone say present truth not past truth not future truth present you've got to be established won't be able establish and present truth amen may the Lord blesses word you may have your seats this morning I want to take a a bit of a Bible study this morning and I want to show you through the scripture that in every generation God sent a word to that generation and the people had to receive that word and if the people received that word they were redeemed if they rejected it they were not redeemed and we're gonna go from Genesis all the way into today and I want to take that as a principle we read there and in John 13 if you he that receiveth whomsoever I see and receiveth me so he want to receive whoever God scenes and he that receiveth me see with him that sent me this is this is a Bible principle and we're going to read from first John if you still got your Bibles handy if you can read it on this screen here first John and we're going to read most of chapter 1 actually we're gonna read the entire thing I believe now it says here that which was from the beginning I remember John as the disciple a call of love he's going to bring out some scriptural principles here he said that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our Fellowship is with the father and with the son Jesus Christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full as he is here this then is the message which we have heard of him so this is the message I mean it's a message that this is still the message this is the message of the hour I mean this then is the message which we heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth I mean see here comes now a bit of a demarcation you've got a you can't if you're walking in darkness now I'll just throw it out there right now this world is in religious darkness and there's religion everywhere doesn't matter what what denomination doesn't matter what Buddhists or Islam or whatever it may be this world is groping in religious darkness but we don't want to be in that so if we now but if we walk so he says if we say we have fellowship I'm going to read verse 6 again if we say we have fellowship with him and walk and walk and darkness we lie and do not the truth but now notice where it says but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another that's us in God and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin so he's laying out a principle if you walk in the light as he is in the light then your fellowship you and God if you walk in that light and then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you from all sin but over a billion people upon the earth claim the cross but walking in the light of their hour that's from the scripture I'm going to show you this all the way through the Bible is not just some funny idea that's been cooked up someplace this is all the way through the scripture the people received who God sent they received that word and they were redeemed under that word and those who rejected the word they didn't receive Redemption and we all want to be redeemed do we not we want to be restored back to what we were meant to be in the beginning do we not I mean so we must walk in the light as he is in the life and then we have fellowship one with another us and God who wants fellowship with God today and not just today but every day their life Lord I want to walk with you I want to hear your voice I want you to accompany me through life's journey that is not me leading myself it's you amen but if you reject the light you're in darkness and you're not walking with him I mean but if you receive the light hallelujah then you're walking with him and then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses from all Al Elson Amen now I want to let's go I want to continue so this this is the first job we're just still reading down he says if we save them we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us amen now let's go to Genesis chapter 4 we're gonna I'm gonna take this all the way through Genesis chapter 4 as the first record we know Adam and Eve worship God in the garden but this is the first record of believers bringing a sacrifice to to worship God now let's just read the scripture there more then we'll go and he says now and Adam knew his wife and she conceived and bare Cain and said I've gotten a man from the Lord and we know all life comes from God and she again bare his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of the sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground and in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell that means he got angry he got angry at God that God did not receive his worship he was angry that God did not accept his sacrifice and in Hebrews 11 it says Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain so Cain offered an excellent sacrifice he wasn't coming hard I'm half-heartedly he wasn't coming full of doubt in his mind he was a believer he was a believer and he knew that that that his parents fell from from eternity from an eternal state and are now in time and centered come into the world and he is trying to offer something that could give him access back into this eternal world that's why that's why they offered because I want to access heaven they want to speak to God God I want to talk to you I would have worship I want to worship you I want to give you an offering I mean I want to be forgiven of my sins my fallen state I wanted to be covered over I wanted to be done away with but he brought his this is the best I have I mean he brought something and it was an excellent sacrifice but it's not what God required Abel knew it was blood in the garden and Adam and Eve were covered in an animal skins when they left the garden and he knew it was they had to be a a life for a life hallelujah and so he knew he knew it wasn't it wasn't vegetables it wasn't an apple it wasn't an apricot that their Eve ate amen but there's a blood sin in the garden and blood was required to restore fellowship again and God received Abel's sacrifice and I don't have it in my notes but you keep reading down and God goes to Cain and God says to Cain just through like your brother did and you'll be accepted why don't you just do like he did you don't need to understand the fullness of what's going on you don't need to comprehend what's going on you don't even need a revelation just do like your brother did you'll be received I mean anise and that same spirit that was there as prison in the South I mean brother Bram says and god of this evil H he tells us that the same spirits able worship by revelation and Cain worship by intellectual understanding they see it those same spirits he said I standing here in this tabernacle this morning I mean they were standing there when the messenger was delivering the word and I'll say that same spirit is here first spirits are here in this place I mean you've got to think about it now are you worshiping God because of intellectual understanding and I understand this and I agree with this and this makes sense here or is it a divine revelation that God has revealed himself to you and that's why you worship hallelujah it's like this this Bible because of tradition we believe this is the Word of God by tradition in by fair we believe this is the Word of God but it has to go beyond that God has to reveal this is me in print form this is me in print form hallelujah it's going to be a revelation this is God's Word and God has protected us word all the way down through the ages we don't need a multiple bunch of translations and to know the original language you've got to know the author of his work and go pre Texas word and God will guide you into his word hallelujah so those same spirits are here I trust you worsening by revelation he died for me on Calvary and it's more than a story more than a tradition more than because mommy and daddy told it to me when I was little but something became he became a living reality amen now this is this is brother Branham and so I don't have the message title he sees he wants to be religious as his main he wants to be religious though but he wants it in his own way and he's so much like Cain Cain wanted to be religious so he went and made his own religion and when he did he brought up before God with something like this here's the best I got this is all I can do about it now take it or leave it that's about the way man does today I helped build the church I've seen my children to the church there I put my money in every year now that's the best can do take it or leave it Oh see he wants his own way man wants his own way you know sin didn't start on the earth that started in heaven and it started in the heart of a being called Lucifer and it started when he said I will I will ascend I will be like the Most High amen that's where sin started when he said I will become this I will be worshipped I'll have up my own way and that same full of nature is now because the original sin has come into humanity and humans say I will I'll do it my way I'll do it how I feel this is more convenient for me this makes more seats this is more inline with the popular opinion of the day who cares about those things I mean Jesus was our example he said not my will but thy will be done hallelujah he gave his example he showed you this is how you should be as a believer I don't want my will I don't want my opinion I don't want how I feel about it I want his will and as well as his word God's will is his word people say I'm seeking the will of God and here it is in print form I mean we're gonna live in a hundred types of God's message being sent and the will of God is recorded in that spoken word and people say I need the will of God for my life spend some time on your knees and prayer reading the word and you'll find the will of God hallelujah because every situation life is in this word hallelujah how I raise my children it's in the message how I should treat my wife it's in the message how does it treat my husband it's in the message everything is in there you got a search program go look Amen would be foolish not to hallelujah now that's the best I can do take it or leave it Oh see he wants his own way that's the way Cain did but God still loved them and he still went after him what did God tell Cain you'll do well if you'll just worship like your brother Abel Abel came God's Way but Cain wanted his way and God said now Cain I've got nothing against you but if you just come over and go the way that Abel goes you'll do well but he hated Abel he thought Abel was a Holy Roller he hasn't changed his opinion he thought was a religious fanatic and he still believes that that's his formal ideas in his culture of his own brain it's better than that of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen I don't want to fulfill that category of person myself now we're gonna go here this is a foundation of the scripture in Matthew 16 when Jesus comes and he speaks to his disciples he wants to know what's being revealed to them and he says when Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the Son of Man end and they said some say thou art John the Baptist some Elias or Jeremias or one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God now I know I've probably gone through this many times but Jesus wants to know he wasn't really interested about the people thought of him he wanted to know what do what do these disciples that I've gathered what do they think of me who what has been revealed to them that I am hallelujah and Peter had the revelation thou art the Christ now art the Messiah you're more than a prophet you're more than a religious man your God became flesh I mean that was revealed to him hallelujah and he says jesus said in jesus answered and said unto Him bless it up now Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it now notice the Catholics say that the church is built upon Peter the partisan say many that the church is built upon Jesus but you see from this chapter this scripture here the whole conversation is about Revelation what has been revealed to the people are your son prophet what's been revealed to you are your the Christ it is blessed art thou simon barjona because flesh and blood has not revealed thus you at see the whole conversations about revelation my father in heaven has revealed us to you and upon this rock the spiritual revelation of Who I am the spiritual when God reveals it to you this is the Christ the Son of the Living God amen that means you're built upon the rock the rock of Revelation and the Prophet tells us I mean we need to pray for Revelation and of his word we need it's more important than you even understand I mean to have the revelation of who Jesus Christ is it's incredibly important because if you know who he is then you know who you are and nothing that happens in this world can move you doesn't matter what your family does what your country does what your neighborhood does your standing upon a rock and you shall not be moved amen now this question who do you say who do you say I am this question is not just back to the disciples it's easy for us to read the scripture says yes Jesus is the Christ he's the Messiah he came from God to die you know he came out of God came out of God's bosom was manifested in the flesh ami took our sins upon himself went to Calvary hallelujah went down to hell took the keys off Satan ascended hallelujah came out of the tomb released his spirit on the day of Pentecost week it's easier to say it because it's history it's recorded even historians that didn't believe in Jesus being the Messiah I mean they still recorded he was alive I mean Josephus was a historian back in that day and he was saying that the disciples they stole his body and ate it it's recorded in history he's a historical figure but I tell you friends that's not enough it's not enough just a point back in history and say yeah that was Jesus back there that same question who do you say I am now Jesus is his word Jesus is his word John st. John 1 and 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God drop down to verse 14 and that word became flesh and dwelt among us he is his word he is his word I mean so it's more than just saying yes that man of Kelly was the Christ I mean but what about in your day in our who do you say I'll say who do you say the Ministry of William Branham is it's not a man from Kentucky I mean it's not just a prophet's ministry it's God revealing himself through a redeemed son the son of man Jesus Christ revealing himself through a son of man as the scripture said it would happen so who do you say this oh that's just his opinion that's just he's molded boys upbringing a certain way and the culture of the day and that's why he preaches the way he does no you gotta go beyond that that's just human understanding but it's got it you've got to hear the voice behind the voice I mean you got a something's got anchor in your soul this is more than a man never a man spake like this man a man it's more than a man speaking this is God speaking this is God speaking hallelujah and if and if you can understand that that word is the Christ amen your life will be a whole bunch different you built upon the revelation of the word amen now we see an um we see in the Ministry of sorry win Cain and Abel were here Cain rejected God's provided way both religious both worshiping but Cain rejected the way and then now he comes Noah so you got to identify the life you currently live you will be identified with someone in the Bible not just believer make believer unbeliever the spirit that's on you now will identify with someone in the Bible doesn't whether you like it or not you're fulfilling something and it doesn't matter what even you say you are it's what you are it's your life proves what you are because Jesus is by their fruit you shall know them not by the not by the tag that's in front of the tree saying this is a cherry tree or this is an oak tree or this is whatever tree it's you don't look at the plaque in front of the tree someone might move the plaque you look at the fruit that's on the tree and that's how you know what it is that's the same thing with a Christian Amen you know they say we people say too much sometimes but it's not it's not your words that prove what you are to your life it's what comes out of you that proves if you're a believer or not hallelujah coz by their fruit you shall know them now he comes Noah let's go back to Noah's day it had never rained in there but the atmosphere and everything was different it never rained and the Bible says it even trade like it does now and here comes a man it just says Jew felt every night that's how the place was watered the earth and so he is he comes a man it's gonna rain God is going to cover this entire world with water I'm gonna build an ark he's showing me Oh heavy has anyone else know about this no it's just this one man I'm gonna build this up anyone who gets into the sack it's gonna be safe from the flood one man he didn't have a whole church backing him up he didn't have some great big movement backing him up one man stood there this is the gods provided way of escape at this endtime because the need was coming upon the earth at that yo of that way of life and so he comes Noah get in the suck no dick no doubt there would having people and they would have said I don't have to get into the sock my for beer Abel offered a lamb coming out of Egypt I mean coming out of Eden and he was accepted I'm just going to offer another lamb I'm just going to offer another land because there's always been blood sacrifice all the way down through I don't need to listen to this man I'm just going to do what Abel didn't know from the past what happened to those ones they died they became souls that are in prison because they rejected God's provided way amen now that's and that's in the beginning of the Bible everyone who didn't get into that Ark perished they could have offered all the lambs they could have they could have been more sincere even maybe that Abel was they all died they all died you say well that's awful rough that's this is a Bible principle if you walk in the light as he is in the light I mean those walk in the light that Noah preach they got in the ark that was the proof that they were actually walking in the light in that day now I've got some titles the Ministry of Moses he comes Moses down they are slaves the people of God are slaves in Egypt and it comes a time now where God has come to fulfill his word God sends Moses down now by this time Abraham Abraham has already come and gone 400 years before this and they were circumcised all the male Hebrews were were circumcised Jews and now he comes he comes Moses and it comes to win the death angels going to strike Egypt and he begins to make an announcement take a lamb for the house keep it about 14 days and take its blood put it on the door and lintel and then roast that lamb you know with bitter herbs and fire and eat the whole thing and if you do this and also push the living out before you do this and he says if you do this then the Death Angel will not not strike they will it will not strike your house now the Hebrews were not immune they were not immune to the to the death angel coming and striking the house amen it was only those who applied the blood only those that applied the blood and they had to they had to eat the entire lamb and if anyone's left over had to be burned with fire go read in Exodus so it wasn't just the nice parts of the word that they had to become one with and wasn't if some knife cuts in the ribs and whatever in the rack and whatever things amen that they did they had to be identified with they did it all doesn't matter what their opinion was I'm not gonna eat that kidney I'm going to eat that liver why don't they eat that yeah it's not it's not your their opinion that mattered God God gave a commandment you've got to become one with the sacrifice you've got to eat the sacrifice hallelujah and if you do this then the death angel will not strike now they could have stood there all the Hebrews they could have said did you hear what Moses said the other day yeah we've got to we've got to kill a lamb and put that blood on the door and lintel of our house and we've got to rush that lamb with bitter herbs and we're going to eat it and and they could say no I'm not doing I don't know about this Moses fellow he's gone a bit funny in his doctrine he's gonna bid off you know in his in his ministry but I know that our father Abraham was circumcised and that's good enough for me because it wasn't a revelation see to someone who said that kind of thing I just accept what God did in history and it's good enough for me now what would have happened to that house I guarantee you the first one would have been dead before the Sun came up death would have struck that house and friends it's not physical death that that we're to be covered from in this day an hour it's spiritual death I mean we're spiritual death can strike a family because the head of that family does not stand for this word does not really stand on the principles of the scripture and saying me and my house are going to serve the Lord and purge out the leaven and apply the blood amen those those houses death strikes I know it's awful strong but it's true it's awful it's true amen spiritual death will strike a family that the people do not have a revelation and they do not even will they say I don't have a revelation Cain God didn't tell Cain you've got to have a revelation I'll wait till you have a revelation came then do it he said just do like your brother did they're like your brother did and you'll be received I want to be received I trust you want to be received as well I mean what's the point of this life if we come to the end of it amen or if we're still alive in the rapture guys and we're stuck here what's the point what's the point of this life it's all in vain amen this whole life is a preparation to go to the next world and it doesn't matter if you're an atheist or whatever it is there comes a point where every man will die and what then oh I don't believe I'll tell you what the first second on that other side everyone becomes a believer that first second everyone becomes a believer like the rich man that Jesus tells the parable of the rich man and Lazarus and the rich man I mean he went to health and he and the poor man died and went up to Abraham's bosom there's a gulf between them and the rich man is being tormented in the flame and he any calls Abraham send Lazarus with a bit of water on the end of his tongue I mean end of his finger and he can put it on my tango be you know a little bit satisfied and he says no is a gulf between you and I he can't come to me I can't cut he can yo you can't come here he can't go there amen and then he says he says can I go back and tell tell my brothers see now he wants to become a preacher now he wants to evangelize no now he's got a burden for his family you know now because now he's a believer beforehand he wasn't a believer because his life proved he didn't really care he had all the riches you know I mean finally he has all these riches he's he's now risked my soul he's trying to find a way to find rest for a soul and riches won't give it to you religion won't give it to you Jesus Christ is the only one that can give it to you amen so now here he is and he wants to go and convince preach to us brothers they said no even if you rose from the dead they won't believe they have the word and the word is enough amen so we don't want to do friends we don't want to end up like him just take it from ground you know we sung that song it so grips me do not pass me by he walks through a place just like Jericho is telling my girls about about Zacchaeus and the tree that was a kiyose is only opportunity to see Jesus because in a few days from there he was going from Jericho to Jerusalem to Calvary that's where he is going and it was blind bartimaeus by the gate as well and that was the last time Jesus in his physical form in that way was going to walk through Jericho that's the only chance he had but at least he went and looked we need to see him not to criticize I'm gonna see this one I want to behold this one hallelujah and I and I told them you know because Zacchaeus went up in the tree to yo to see Jesus and Jesus is walking along and Zacchaeus is hidden in the branches of the sycamore tree and he knows Jesus knows he's there and he knows his name he stops that he'd never met Zacchaeus before and he looks up sees Zacchaeus come down I want to have supper with you and then God moves on his heart and he says Lord if I I'm going to give half my goods to the poor and if I've rubbed anyone cheated anyone I'm going to give them you know I'm gonna repay them was it fourfold and Jesus is now salvation has come to this house and I'll told them if Zacchaeus did not climb that tree salvation would not have come to his house that day and that was his last that was his only opportunity as the son of man was finishing his earthly ministry and here we are today these son of man Jesus Christ is walking among us he's walking upon this earth he's fulfilling his word amen and we don't just want to watch it pass us by and have some indifferent opinion about it I mean but we I trusted something in you says Lord I want to touch the hem of your garment and me because this is my opportunity I have a need that that the world can can't solve I have this blood us you have this problem of this for setting sin that I can't overcome and you know I've come from a broken home I may be in an orphan or something and I don't know who I really am just touches him touch the hem of his garment and in by faith and you'll find yourself turning a different person there's only he can't and it's simple faith don't try to work something up just take him at his word then Lord you would promise this I mean I receive your word hallelujah don't let the devil lie to you say well you could just live this kind of way he's a liar that's an enticing spirit and we'll go on to that soon now he sees here Peter Peter said this is from the token message in Bakersfield I believe it is he says you mean of Israel Jesus Nezzer some man made known by God by signs and wonders you took with wicked hands and crucified Him who we're witnesses of his resurrection when the Holy Ghost had been poured out upon them now we find out that this and this great thing that God was identifying himself with Israel back there requiring that identification this is the blood on the door and lintel he says many Jews want to say he was a Jew speaking of Jesus many of us want to say he was a Jew he was neither Jew nor Gentile he was God and he was a created being by the hand of Almighty God he created a tabernacle he lived in which we know is the Son of God that's right the deity the supreme deity of Jesus Christ because God dwelt in him now we find out here the Jews could say well wait wait just a minute I'm a Jew I'm in the Covenant of Abraham I'm circumcised the Covenant it was annulled if the token wasn't displayed it didn't even wasn't even considered if that blood wasn't on the door and lintel the circumcision did no good absolutely no good I mean I'm talking of a token of this day if that blood wasn't displayed that token I don't care how much you could show you was a Jew it's the same thing with how much you could say you believed you might have been a rabbi priest or anything but that token had to be applied no ins or outs yes or no until he saw the blood he would pass over doesn't matter who they weren't God is without respect of persons God is without respect of persons if you come according to his word you will receive mercy if you do not you will not receive mercy doesn't matter how religious we are it doesn't matter how much we know the Bible doesn't matter how much we can quote even the messenger how devout we may be amen unless you come God's provided way unless he reveals his word to you are you following me amen you're in trouble and if you come a court try and come according to this and try and work out everything amen that's not how you come you come by revelation they had to they had to receive Moses ministry they had to receive it doesn't matter how much of a devout Jew they were even down in Egypt they had to receive it and they had to live out what he commanded them to do amen and then it came to a point where where Moses he sent 12 spies into the land and 10 of those spy said we can't take it and two said they could you know you know what was anointing those 10 spies they were enticing spirits they were spirits demon power to them to to give them unbelief against the Word of God and they believed an enticing spirit greater than what God said the promise for them was and I'll just say do you know why people could not reach up and receive the promise you know why people maybe just get wounded by the word they don't die on the altar it's because they listen to an enticing spirit I mean above the Word of God friends after the devil can anoint your emotion he can anoint your memory he can anoint your reasoning and it can all say I'm very good I'm in but if it's against the Word of God you got to forsake it but the other yo you're the Bible says casting down reasoning what do you mean by this is casting down I'll cast it down I'll have no part of it you got to cast down reasoning I mean but what will my friends think what will society think whoa what will my peers at work thing well my buddies that I do whatever we think what will God think who is your God because if you yield to someone else's influence above God's influence they your God and not Jesus Christ the word and enticing spirits came upon them and see if we can't take the land and this was the reason they came out of Egypt to take the land but to were not anointed by those lying Devils they said God's giving it to us let's go and they received the promise now they came a time this isn't seeking Chronicles 18 we won't read it but here's a head and this story here King Ahab is joined with the king of Israel and they're going to go take ramoth-gilead which used to belong to Israel but the Syrians had had taken it over and so Ahab goes to the other King Jehoshaphat or some what I may have that wrong but just go read the story and he says Remus Gilead as how's this go take it and they join themselves together and a half now Jehoshaphat is more of a godly King they see his let's pray inquire of the Lord to see if this is the Lord's will and I have says I've got four hundred prophets Hebrew prophets I got four hundred believers four hundred preachers here's my ministers right here and we'll let them have a prayer meeting and we'll see because they they hear from God and so if they pray an affair one mind to one Accord that yes this is the will of God then we'll go take ramoth-gilead and so these 400 Hebrew prophets they begin to pray they begin to sing and they begin to have a church service and a spirit comes among them and they begin to rejoice and the head the head of this whole four hundred he made two horns of iron he got it and he got inspired he got excited and he said buy these hogs I mean you'll push the Syrians out of the country and you'll take the land now it sounded awful good it sounded awful good and would have been it would have sounded really quite convincing because the Bible said RAM of Gilead belonged to Israel Ramnath Gilead belong to Israel but something had happened in the between time where there was there was a prophet called Elijah and he prophesied that the dogs will eat Jezebel a Habs wife and now look the dogs will lick a Habs blood this was the prophecy this was the word for their hour this was the prophecy that had to be fulfilled in their day an hour and there was another prophet called macaé and he wasn't part of these four hundred because you have Jehoshaphat see don't you have another one doesn't there one more and and I have sinking it's four hundred four hundred prophets right here why do you need one more isn't he just one more yeah there's this McCoy but I hate him but anyway you know go call from then a man goes and calls for this this this McCoy and he tells him as they're walking now you know what the head of the organization did he made some horns we had a pre-meeting God came down it was an incredible time and this is what the Lord spoke through us that we're gonna take ramoth-gilead and buy these horns we're gonna push the Syrians out of the country and now you haven't been in fellowship for a long time if you want to come back in because we still love you because God loved and you know we love everyone and now you just come and let's have fellowship again and then but but they Makai said I'll pray and I'm gonna see what God sees he didn't let the influence of these 400 influence what he would say and then so here was a man and he went and prayed and he knew this from returning Jubilees he certainly they hated him he was a real prophet he said he's Emily the son of of Micah the organization put him out long time ago don't have any fellowship with him he said let's hear him I always said I hate him a herb said he hated this man let the King not say so but let's hear what he's got to say then some of the priests Peter's run over told him said all the bishops and everybody said this and that you must say the same thing he said I'll just say what God puts in my mouth I think that's a good attitude dude I'll just say what God puts in my mouth amen how we ought to have brother zip here now to sing a main chorus for us yes sir say what God puts in your mouth he'll never say nothing but his word but his word we must have an absolute in this day we must have an absolute and we've got to have something we're going to have a true interpretation of the scripture and this multitude of denominations and schools of thought and they all argue upon one another it's got to go beyond intellectual understanding and collecting what scholars say and just try and find a consensus that's not how you find the true interpretation yo God says I'll do nothing till I tell to reveal to my servants the prophets first there's a scriptural foundation and the Old Testament and the new amen the Apostle Paul he may be an apostle but he is also a prophet many of the Apostles they prophesied things the Apostle Paul most of his writings a prophecy he says I'll do nothing till I reveal to my servants the prophets first it means that's all their New Testament and it's got to be the same thing today well how do we know what truth is that's what God seemed to Elijah and thus our to show us what the Bible actually says amen it's not it's not just a supernatural ministry in some opinion I know I've probably gone to the end of most end of my sermon but I'll maybe come back to there again but it's got to be it's not our human opinion and then we take someone else's what we think is opinion and say let's try and marry it up and win it and when ours differs from hers well let's just leave that a little bit no you got to understand that's God speaking through that vessel and and it's a voice that came from this word it points us back into the scripture a meant later but anyway he says now a prophet a prophet is a teller forth the same as 1/4 dollar true he said I'll say what God says then he checked his vision then he checked his vision let me have tonight and see what the Lord says the next morning he came out and had thus saith the Lord why he checked it he knowed that that real prophet before him which was Elijah who the word of the Lord came to had to be right I mean he cursed they have told him the dogs would look his blood and Jezebel would be strode over the fields and so forth he knowed nothing good could come out of that thing with a hypocrite and I tell you friends that same spirit there that was on Ahab and Jezebel is here present I mean John saw it in the book of Revelation that woman Jezebel who suffers to teach a man which is the Catholic Church and all her daughters I know it's strong but it's in the scripture amen and that's a spiritus here upon the earth and you know there's only two just well I mean do you know there's only two spirits there's only two spirits upon the earth working doesn't matter how they appear there's God in his word and in the devil in a myriad of different ways there's only the two so where is your inspiration the music you listen to the sermons you listen to I mean the things that influence your life in a spiritual way where is that influence coming from where is it coming from it's either coming from - and doesn't matter how good one may be to you is it God or not you got to think about that he says I'll tell you that God will never bless the church as long as she organized herself and sets herself to one side which God has proved down through the ages as he's cursed show me one group of people where God raised up a revival down through the Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Luther cama light whatever it may be when he raised up a group of people and started a revival when they organized they died and they never came back how can God bless what he's cursed I return Louisiana this is returning Jubilee I return Louisiana the year of Jubilee is on and it's the same thing here don't just put God in a box and say now I've got them all sorted out you don't put God in a box that means you've organized a meeting when you organize you die you can't put God in a box now work them out he goes beyond the box he will not be bound the Spirit of God will not be bound by your understanding by an organizational understanding he will not be bound neither will the Bride of Christ be bound hallelujah so don't put him in a box and say now I've worked them out amen he goes beyond it this is what the devil wants you to know just to put a full stop now I understand it all this is just how does put a full-stop that's all he wants you to do and he's got you if you do that I mean with God as always unfolding himself in his word to you hallelujah I'm so glad that's the case I mean we have just plateaued and then bouncing around and some some ideas God's revealing himself more and more in the scripture I trusted he's revealed himself more to you than he did when he first met you hallelujah should be that way if it hasn't if he's not there's something wrong amen now certainly notice then he went up on the hill the year of Jubilee son returned to your own returned your inheritance notice certainly noticed and then he went up there on the hill and lost his life that's a habit died in that battle just exactly because notice that Micaiah saw his prophecy and know that his prophecy compared exactly with the word of the Lord certainly what was to be done to us done the same thing we took the multitude of counsel for safety there goes in another place of scripture so they had to there was the challenge now if they received Elijah's ministry amen they would not have had this catastrophe but Elijah's prophecy had to be fulfilled that's why Makaha could stand there and say no you will not be successful he says I see Israel scattered like sheep with no Shepherd and then that and then that he'd Minister with who who made the horns he slept them in the mouth and he said now when did the Spirit of God leave me and coming to you he's basically I don't believe it and then makai said I saw I saw a scene in heaven and God is upon his throne and he's having a meeting he's saying now what can we do to make a have come to this battle and to fulfill Elijah's prophecy and that a lying spirit came out of hell and said I'll make him come all the night those ministers they don't know the word Vegas no excitement and and and being excited that and I think that's a vindication that the word is manifesting and and so God said now go and it was a lying spirit anointing those four hundred and they were enthused and they are excited and now having a wonderful time I thought but it was actually demon as a demon worship going on think about it if they only went back to Elijah's prophecy and said he prophesied a hams gonna be killed Jesus Belle's gonna be killed this is gonna happen they they just said O king live forever don't go you will not be successful because Elijah said this is what's going to happen but they took what God did in the past above what God was doing in their day now he says now no to differentiate what is right and wrong there's enticing spirits in 55 macaé knew good and well that it wasn't the Lord that was with them preachers but what was the matter with those preachers notice what they did they had a dress the best they had been fed the best they had come together and their parties and so forth and their alliances until the place had gotten so where they only knew their own theology and the Bible says the Makai when he looked at the vision he said God said who can we get to go down there and deceive a have this all in second second chronicles 18 or it's in first Kings as well and a lying spirit said I'll go down there and I say help through those preachers because they had to go out there in order to bring the Word of God to pass now today so many people are listening he says now Sunday school now Sunday school I love it look so many P listening to enticing spirits and instead of taking the Word of God and we are not immune to such things amen what do you want to take who do you want to take who do you want to take you by the hand choosie this day I want Jesus Christ the word the Living Word to take me by the hand I do not want an enticing spirit to take me by the hand because that will lead me to destruction but he will lead me to glory hallelujah now it's very easy it's very easy to look in the look in history and say yeah they should have received the prophets that came to them why didn't they receive them if I was staying there in that day I would have received it glory to God I would have been with the Apostles that I would yeah but it's very easy to point back into history to see the same see those heroes what about today what about today Jesus's main opposition was from religious people it was not fraud it was from the church world who crucified Him we say the Romans crucified Him but who orchestrated the whole thing the church will pilot didn't want to crucify him Pilate he said I find no fault in this man I find no fault in this man it was the church world that found fault because they were trying to catch him you read the Gospels they try and catch him they were trying to catch him in his words that's why they asked him hard questions they thought in different things they're trying to catch him in his words and it's the same thing today if you come here to try and catch me in my words amen you'll probably find something because I'm just a man I mean just like they try and take the message and dissect it and try and find fault with them when it's God revealing himself amen but they try and find fault and I said but then they said we are Moses disciples we know what Moses did it was easy to believe what Moses did because if Moses was thousands of years or a thousand years whatever before this and it was historical it was it was received or considered in their culture as a fact their culture said it was a fact if you went from Israel and then you went to China and he said you know Moses came and took us out of Egypt that's a we know about this because it wasn't considered a cultural fact in China and that day but it was in Israel so because of tradition and history they could receive it as a fact but when the truth when the one that Moses spoke of became manifested in their day an hour they rejected him and Jesus says here do not think that I will accuse you to the Father there is one that accused with you even Moses and whom you trust for had ye believed Moses had you believed Moses you would have believed me for he wrote of me now hold on here was people that had given their life you just think about standing there in the crowd and you're one of the Pharisees and here's a little man who doesn't look like anything great but yet he has a presence around him like no other and he and he speaks things that no other man has spoken before and hears us the Pharisees and we say we have Moses we are Moses disciples oh how we love the words of Moses and we love the prophets and how great thee how great the word that God has given us is and how we love the feasts and all they gave their lives these people were devout they would devout people they couldn't just be well it would have been a Saturday June you know we talked about just being a Sunday Christian you know they just want to assemble Jew there were every day a Jew this is our identity this is who we really are but then Jesus but then here's this man called Jesus Nazareth and he's saying if you really have believed Moses you would have believed me and that's the only saying of course we believe Moses we've given our lives to follow Moses teachings we study Moses teachings we read about it we we debate it we yeah we have Bible teachers that have given all their energy and all of their life I mean to study Moses teachings and this man says we don't even believe him but they didn't they didn't actually believe him what Bible character are you are you becoming I trust it's not one of the scribes and Pharisees but he says now if you we believed Moses you would have believed me because he wrote about me but if you believe not his writings how shall you believe my words amen how could they believed the words of the Son of Man in that day if they didn't believe the Bible they only received the Bible out of tradition it wasn't a revelation to them now I trust that and it's the same thing today we can take this and also who believes this is the word of God and but also Amen I trust you would absolutely I believe this I'm a Bible believing Christian but then how about when God sends a voice in this day how about when God sends a voice in this day and he said but if you believe not has he said no you don't actually believe the writings of Moses because you don't believe me the proof of the pudding is if you really believe the Bible if you believe in Him who he has sent and the words of whom he has sent amen this remember history repeats itself this is not just clutching your straws this has happened all the way down through the ages people don't change they meant the devil hasn't changed either and God hasn't changed God takes his man or the devil takes his man off the scene but a spirit is still here and the same spirit that was anointing them back there as anointing people in this day and hour and don't put it whatever you do beyond the four walls and don't start pitch for King and other I hope this person receives that hope this person you got to lay the pitchfork aside you got to say Lord Here I am at your table it may taste bitter it may taste sweet it may taste everything in between but I know you're serving me the right kind of food because you have my best interest in mind amen so I trust see this is what they said about Jesus now John I know time is running away but the people in Jesus's day I'm sure you'd all agree they had to receive the Ministry of John the Baptist because the minister John the Baptist was to be a voice of one crying in the wilderness to prepared the way of the Lord today so the people had to receive of course they had to and then they had to receive the Ministry of Jesus of course they had to receive the Ministry of Jesus how could you not receive the Ministry of the Messiah but then I want to just read this because I want you to understand many times we sit here and we say we have to work out what's going on and if I can mentally understand how everything fits together then I'll believe it but revelation goes beyond this revelation is not any a mental understanding that's when God speaks down here and God reveals it down here now here's here's the disciples Jesus is just spoken about unless you drink my blood and eat my flesh you have no life in you now if you go back into the woods of Moses he said you shall not eat the flesh with the blood in it he says it more than once so if you just fundamental in your mind you'd say this man cannot be the Messiah because he's just contradicted the words of Moses but they didn't have and the thing is he didn't explain it you go read John 6 he never explained unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you he just says it he's going to see now what's holding the people what's really holding them why have they gathered and then he says so he started with 5,000 people in one church service everyone leaves them apart from the disciples there was the people there are 70 ministers that did supernatural supernatural things he sent them forth two by two to God heal the sick and do different things they left them and then he says this here and he said therefore I say unto you that no man can come unto me except to be given unto him by my father from that time many of his disciples went back and walked with him no more then said Jesus unto the twelve will you also go away then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou has the words of eternal life and we believe in assure that thou art that Christ the Son of the Living God now no doubt you could have you could have asked Peter and the disciples did you understand what he just said about eating flesh and drinking blood his own flesh and they would have said no we don't understand this but we know that this is the Messiah we can't work it out up in here I know you're very quiet by thinking about what I'm saying I trust you are don't worry about tomorrow tomorrow take care of itself now worry about next week it will take care of itself there are about Christmas it'll happen we'll go we'll move on we'll have New Year's Lord willing whatever it'll take care of itself but they could they didn't understand what he was but they deal with something in them this is why revelation goes beyond mental understanding the devil always place to here but you got to rely on on God revealing his word to you because they didn't understand what he was saying but and they see it this is God in flesh this is God in flesh and because they knew was God in flesh they they stayed with him they walked with him they join themselves to him because this was the Messiah manifested upon the earth hallelujah and it's the same thing with the woman at the well she didn't understand yeah he's a man who looks like a Jew sitting by the well that she always came to at that hour of the day and he just says bring me a drink and she says well how how can oh you've got nothing to draw with and then he just changes the conversation a little bit he said if you knew the water I had you drink it never thirst again and then they begin to talk about different things and then finally it hangs down to we know when Messiah cometh because he just sits there and the Prophet says he is just contacting your spirit and and Jesus says go get your husband and then the woman says I have known and Jesus says that's right the way you've had five and the one you're worth is not yours hallelujah and then something energy said we know when Messiah cometh he will do these things she didn't say now tell me all your doctrine and then I'll reconcile it with what I believe amen what church what church do you preach at where's your website what are the things you believe that she just said we know when Messiah cometh he'll do these things and he just said he that speaks of them he hallelujah and she dropped her water pot she dropped her old life hallelujah okay for overcoming power Amy by her receiving the word I didn't redeem her hallelujah that she wasn't she didn't go back to her man trouble anymore she was looking for love in the wrong places and she could not overcome that in her life I mean but then when Jesus came and he wente just came her way she said this is the Messiah hallelujah and she left that old life and that's why it's such a powerful thing if you can hear the voice behind the voice of the messenger and if you can hear that voice behind your voice we know when Messiah cometh he'll do these signals and that word that message is Messiah speaking hallelujah if you can recognize that your life will be different I guarantee you that month you're at the workout how it all works out he'll lead you and guide you into all truth amen he will lead you and guide you into all truth what does that mean he says now come here I'll show you this and we may not understand all things you got to know it's him you got to know it's him because when the devil comes in with his reason John Hastie writes when he's writing then writing the gospel he was put into the temple people's reasoning if you're looking for an out is plenty about but if you're looking for them these and then and what do you want you want eternal life see Noah's sons received the word that Moses had Noah preached to them sons it's gonna rain don't reveal to me we're going to build the Sun you see this farce we're gonna cut it down we do this favor see and his daddy did daddy's preacher hmm and they believed it and they got into the ark and they were reading Caleb and Joshua received the preaching of Moses they received it they didn't just receive the signs and wonders they received that word that was coming on that problems pal and they recognize this is God to us this has got to us and then they were redeemed they came out Oh see it's not just to come out of the world well stay in the wilderness you to go with every tension you're gonna come out and go in and so a mini came out under the supernatural onca supernatural ministry isn't this wonderful the Red Sea I could look at the plagues wasn't that incredible we've got to go beyond me that's a vindication that's a vindication that that the ministry is true are you gonna go beyond that it's the words that's the word that is spoken it's going to grip your soul it's got a grip you hallelujah and so Caleb and Joshua they received that ministry he said we're gonna receive an inheritance Barnea with all the rest of the spies and everyone else turned against us but I stood with you Joshua now give me my here's what he wanted I mean it's the same thing with us friends I trusted something in you what do you see I mean faith is even greater than your own down you got to cast down your doubts I mean this is a very different kind of a service maybe but God has seen to word upon the earth in the same time goddess in a word that came from his Bible hallelujah and he sent it to prepare a bride I mean to take her in a rapture hallelujah the woman the well couldn't understand all things what is this doctrine on on election what is this doctrine on the Godhead what does he believe about everything she said I don't know but it's the Messiah come and see a man that told me everything I ever did hallelujah now I mean the people now let's go to X 18 I don't sorry I don't have it on the overheat I thought I did it's got X 18 actually sorry first you may think what is this got to do with walking in the light let's go quickly let's go to John 5 and verse 33 I'll show you very quickly light in the bible is the word manifested that is what light is it's not a natural light all there's a glow no it's when the word has made manifested that is light so here in John 5 and 33 now so I don't have this in the John 5 and 33 mother our amanda's working Alleluia he says ye sent unto John and here bear witness of the truth now if we go Nick's next verse but I received not testimony from man but these things I say that ye might be saved as being of John the Baptist next one he was a burning and a shining light and you're willing for a season to rejoice in his lights and let's go to the next verse but I have greater witness than that of John for the works which the father had given to me to finish the same works that I do bear witness of me that the father hath sent me thank you thank you brother Amanda you see he says John was a bright he was a bright and shining light what was he he was the prophecy the voice of one crying in the wilderness he was that prophecy manifested upon the earth he says you're willing to receive him to walk in that life but when Jesus was standing there speaking to the disciples John had already probably been put into prison his head had been cut off I mean his ministry had finished but the people couldn't stay back in history they had to walk if you walk in the light as he is in the light they had to they had to follow John John introduced him to Jesus then they had to walk with Jesus I mean they couldn't stay with John they had to walk on because where John was that time was now darkness and it had been fulfilled it was still true but it wasn't the present truth anymore is now past he following me I mean so let's go to X 8 take No now read from verse 24 now we're going we're jumping from when we get to X 18 it's now AD 54 so it's been 20 20 years since Jesus had died you know this death be a resurrection as 20 years on now and here's a group of men that are preaching that Jesus was the Christ but they only knew the baptism of John so the light had moved on but they were there actually in the past you following me he sees and there was a certain Jew named Apollo's yes there we are Alexandria an eloquent man and mighty in the scriptures came to Ephesus this man was instructed in the way of the Lord and being fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord knowing only the baptism of John so he so he had he admit the forerunner he had mr. must you know here I'm against the priest that Jesus was the Christ but he had mr. de vino' cough and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard they took him unto them and expanded unto him the way of God more perfectly and when he was disposed to pass into acacia the Brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come helped them much which had believed through grace for he might flee convinced the Jews and that publicly showing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ he was a believer he was a believer but let's go to the next chapter chapter 19 and 1 and it came to pass that while Apollo's was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper coast came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they said unto Him we have not so as much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost and he said unto them unto what then were you baptized and they said unto John's baptism then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him who should come after him that is on christ jesus and when they thus they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied and all the men were about twelve so here were people we're actually living in the past the light had moved on so now here was Apollo's here was the challenge laid to Apollo's he could have reason like Cain but I've done this I've preached the gospel I've convinced the Jews from the Old Testament that Jesus was the Christ I've I've forsaken all and I'm following this Jesus but it was a Jesus of history I mean he had to receive what Paul told him he had to receive the light think about it you say but he's already received it in the past but there was the past he had to come into the present truth he had to come to the present truth and so here was this challenge would he receive it and stay in darkness or would he I mean so I reject it and gone to darkness or receive it and continue walk in the light and you see he received it there's many a policies in this day many many devout Christian people good people but you've got to walk in the light as he is in the light you must walk in it not be next to it not just say yes that's light you've got to walk in it you got to walk in the word I mean you got to receive the word for what it is Alleluia and now here we are you say well but now we're in the New Testament this is in the book of Revelation that Jesus has seven stars in his right hand and though the angels to the churches and we know an angel doesn't preach the gospel and a heavenly angel doesn't preach the gospel and angel means a messenger God uses man to preachers gospel he doesn't use heavenly angels he uses an earthly messenger right so those seven stars are the seven angels or messages to the churches and there's been there's been seven Church ages down through and the believers in those ages had to come under the light of that of that star and if they came under the light of that star they will walk in the light for their day amen and now we've come down to this hour and there's a star has come and the light has been shown and we're called to walk in that light if you don't walk in that light you're in darkness you say that's awful awful strong but it's true do you want to be like Moses I mean gonna be like the scribes and Pharisees but we have Moses you know oh we believe Paul's writings we believe the New Testament well if you believed if you believed those writings you'd believe his voice in this day because the voice in his day just speaks of those writings doesn't take you off into something else it's like back to the baptisms being restored and you read the scripture we don't need a revelation on baptism you just read all the scriptures about it it's not being baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost what is that name the name is the Lord Jesus Christ I mean people say well I'll take the words of Jesus above the words of Paul or Peter on your next to I'll say well who was speaking this is this is if you're a Trinitarian God is one he's not three people but they say he's three persons in one purpose well if they are then they'll be saying the same thing will they not but but people say I'll take the words of Jesus the Sun above the words of the Holy Ghost through Peter and acts 2 well that means they're contradicting if you take one word above the other what Peter said be be baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ a remission assert that is the name of the father and of the son of the Holy Ghost that's the same thing being said amen and then we come down to this day now that in which we live where God said when you see the days as it was a days of lot and as it was the days of Noah so shall it be when the Son of Man is revealed again when I am Jesus Christ is revealed again and we live in the days of Noah do we not go read the days of no it's his man began to multiply upon the face of the earth Google will world population it goes from just a couple of billion up to seven billion ramps up like this we're living in that day man's mind is filled with evil continually we're living in that day amen all these things are happening a lot what happened in the days of lot Sodom and Gomorrah were here the whole world is filled with it amen and there's a whole group of Christendom who's a lot and they're in Sodom and they're vexed by it and they want to try and fix it and let's try to make America great again let's try and Christian dies the world and all these things and they're Vic's boat but they can't do anything about it even though they try but there's another group there's another group that's not in Sodom that have been called out of Sodom amen and they're being separated Abraham wasn't inside of his on the plains of Mamre I mean he's waiting for the coming of the promised son hallelujah and then now God God makes a body and he makes - boy he makes he makes a body for two bodies one one for two angels I mean you know one each there's three of them is God back the body for himself he makes two bodies for two angels I said let's go down visit Abraham because now is the season now is the season where these bodies are going to be changed that they can receive the promised son and so it walks down there and Abraham now this is repeated again today what Bible character you identified with and then now he comes God down and a body of flesh and Abraham sees him it's three men walking but he says Lord come and have a meal with me and then after they have the conversation which I've gone to two of them walk down into Sodom but he says the Lord stays of Abraham and then so here comes here comes God and flesh and they have a meal and then Sarah Abraham's wife is in the tent behind them and God says where is Sarah thy wife she's your she's in the tent behind you and God says to Abraham according to time of life you shall have the promised son Allu and she's in the tent behind them laughs and she laughs in her heart how can I am nearly a hundred how can I please you with my lord gourry Genesis 18 that's where I'm quoting from how can I please with my lord since we're past age we can't have children and then God says to Abraham why did Sarah laugh and she comes out said no I didn't laugh said yes you did but you'll have the promised son and so so what was happening the thoughts of Sarah were being made known by God and flee and then Jesus we read about the woman at the well the same thing happened with her cuz that same God that visited Abraham became Jesus Christ hallelujah so the same ministry was repeated and then God said now in the end time when you see the world in this condition I will come back again and I'll be revealed now here comes some light you got to walk in this light friends and so now God sends a prophet upon the earth as he said he would well know these things but you've got to be established and present truth because remember in this in time there's a blinding coming upon the Gentiles there's a blinding because the Jewish eyes are coming open just as it was that the opposite happened when the gospel first came so you got to be established in these things that the blinding doesn't come upon you amen so they're here so here is here's a here is a prophet here's a man from Kentucky yay tall and and it happens multitude at times now this is just like us yeah this is justice just like Jesus and the woman at the well and he begins to tell her this is what's wrong with you this is your name and then you begin to be seized I'm waiting for someone to come that's right that's the angel of the Lord and now he's here go watch it on the deep Gulf to the deep yeah go watch that it's on YouTube go watch it even it even just the last 15 minutes if you can't take an hour of it just the last fifty multi standing there thousands of people packed auditorium he says you you know I'm waiting on something I'm waiting on him cuz I'm just your brother I'm waiting for him to come he says now he's here I take every spirit under my control and these people come in front of him and you see a woman there won't hurt you that's just him his son Billy Paul said you didn't need we didn't need to wait for daddy to say the angel laws there he felt his presence come in the room if I knew he was there and a holy hush came over the whole place and then he began to tell the people as the Ministry of Jesus is repeated again it's not just a supernatural thing God is trying to get our attention this is me speaking this is me speaking this is redemption coming to you I mean if you walk in the light as he is in the light then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin al Elson and this is light coming to this is very important friends and so now here he is and he tells them what's wrong with them and their address and who they're praying for and then the Spirit of God moves out upon the audience and he points people out he doesn't say someone has a backache someone has a tummy ache someone's got a sore knee over here he says you you and that dress you there in that shirt this is what yeah and this is why you're praying for him this is all wrong eating him sometimes I you know I count we're now well into the discernment sometimes gonna be about a dozen things one person you couldn't even guess that this is what's wrong and this is where it is and this is your name this is your address and you're praying for this person as well and this and this and this as just details all the way down through what is that that's God speaking and God is doing that to tell you to show you what this man just preached is the truth he says if I be a true servant of God let him come now and prove that it's true that's quite a challenge he's challenging God now if I've said the truth you have to come vindicated then God comes into the place and there's sometimes he just goes down a road and you and the person next years got this person if she's got this person X you got us down down down what he's showing God as God is proving now this is me speaking this is Messiah speaking amen if you receive him that I send you receive me hallelujah and as many's believe there were baptized the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen you receive the word you get Redemption if you do not you're not redeemed it's flat but it's out as it is what it is we have some musicians to come please that's what I'm so thankful I was like the woman at the well I was like blind bartimaeus he was there the woman at the well just going through life but then one day he came to me he's got him he's got to meet you we get caught up and so many do and things that's like marry one of my favorite I think I've seen it before one of my favorite parts of the Scriptures the resurrection and the tomb is open Jesus's body's not there the disciples go to the tomb the woman come to the tomb first and he's not there and he's married and she's burdened she was bringing spices to to anoint his body and then he's a little I don't know how big she would have been but you know she she turns around she hears a voice behind her she thinks it's a gardener many times we wait what's going on and she sees if you know we're taking them tell me where is not a church this is not some religion that's not some different way of life this is God coming through his word claiming his bride taking it to himself to carry her away hallelujah and that's why I'm sorry thankful I didn't know a whole bunch of things but when I heard that prophets voice I was sitting in my room with headphones on and I was scared my flatmates would come in and bust me listening to sermons they didn't know I had any kind of desire for God they were the Christians at all but when I heard that voice and he spoke about being sealed into the kingdom by the Holy Ghost and being to be redeemed and completeness and enjoy something moved upon me I said lord I know I don't know you but meet me that I can change my heart take everything out of my life that's country to your word that I can know you and he did may take in a walk as I had to surrender to him I had to be willing to let go of my friends and what people think of me lay my life down I tell you I've never regretted it it's been over ten years ago all kinds of all my friends left me everyone left me I wasn't worried I didn't even gives us why then I may have told this before but how repeat myself one of my best friends first year of uni we were drinking buddies tell you what we could do a lot of things he doesn't live with me he's living somewhere else couple he yeah and we're not studying the same thing and then here he comes I meet the Lord I see him in the supermarket I haven't told him anything and we have a brief conversation and he looks at me as if I don't want to spend another time in your presence I think that was one of the last times I ever saw him again I didn't tell them that I'm a Christian now and how glorious it is or what happened to me I don't know how wood gets out hallelujah but he just and I don't know where is God now that's how it was and you got to think yourself sometimes does that friendship you have does that association you have even I could say that family pulled that you have does it really debt worth it in the long run is it really that worth it if it's holding you back you'd say Lord set me free set me free because if your friends are not pulling you towards the Lord Jesus Christ I say they're not your friends they are not really your friends they don't have your best interest in mind they just have their best interest in mind I want you around me to have a good time that's all they want they just want to have their own good time but what about you do they really care about you they don't really care about you I'll just walk with God we have receive friends I'm so glad in this dark world everyone's opinion is upon social media everyone's opinions on the internet well I think listen that God can come and find you he says you shall know the truth you shall not you might or one day if you're good enough ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free shall make you free amen they that seek me with all their heart shall find me they shell if you really seek him with all your heart you shall find him nada not a substitute not a religion you'll find him and that's that's why we gather that's why we believe what we believe because we were found I'd rather he found us I trust if he hasn't found you don't reason out well I've done this and I come to church and I do doesn't this has he found you has he found you has he changed you has he redeemed you I trust if it's a no you want to pray say Lord deal with my life I'm sick of being you know we get enough religion sometimes to make ourselves miserable I was there for years I was listening to this message and I was in the world and I couldn't break free of this as a tug of war but then God knows how to change situations that you finally get can you say I'm sick of this if you're sick of it just say Lord just take my life I don't have to work out what I had to give up I didn't have to work out now well I guess I've got to stop you know I know I've got to stop drinking I've got to stop playing computer games gonna stop listening to this you know music and watching movies and dressing an ungodly way with shorts and different things and I didn't have to work out I didn't think about those things I just said Lord take my life put me on your wheels mold me take everything that's country to your life out of me they even come and dwell in me that's I'd never Church to deal with me I didn't have anyone to guide me he guided me and that's how it should be I'm in easy a guide you you have to work out we'll have to give up this drive to keep this no just just receive home receivers work and then he'll take care of everything else hallelujah he's in the business of transforming people I mean you say well I can't do it of course you can't do it man's are fairly to begin with even our educated society and all our psychology doesn't do us any good I mean there's more people in this country that are depressed and on drugs and suicide and all different kinds of things this has been to be the first world this is me to be civilization made people empty and broken why because there's no God in this place I mean but if you have him you have everything holy you have everything if you have him and personally I'd rather have him because one day this thing will stop beating and what then I want to have no trouble at the river I don't want any trouble down there and I know if I surrender to his word here and everything even if I don't understand just do like your brother did he calling me a cane I'll tell you this cane could not be born again under the blood of bulls and goats his nature could not be changed but under the blood of Jesus Christ I believe anyone who truly wants it can be can be changed from a cane to enable I mean there's a power in this room right now they can change you from a cane to an able and from a Judas to Jesus whatever it is I mean II thought or Jacob whatever character you want to put in there's a power here they can change you amen let's let's just actually just pray gracious Father Lord we love you we thank you for your tender mercy thank you feel goodness Lord father
