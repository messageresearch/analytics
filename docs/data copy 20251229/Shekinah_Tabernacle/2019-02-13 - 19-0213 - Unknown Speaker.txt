sorry about the technical difficulties praise the Lord we don't need to you know the end of the day worships not about projectors it's about the revelation of Jesus Christ in our hearts I mean so let's go to Ezekiel chapter 28 and we're gonna go then we going to go second Corinthians chapter 4 see kill 28 verses 12 to 19 so once well tonight Amen Son of Man take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus say unto Him thus saith the Lord God they'll seal us up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in beauty thou has been an Eden the garden of God every precious stone was thy covering the Sardis the Topaz and the diamond the barrel the onks the Jasper the sapphire emerald and the carbuncle and gold the workmanship of thy temperance and of our pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and I have set thee so there was upon the holy mountain of God thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire that was perfect in my ways from the day that that was created till iniquity was found in thee by the multitude of my merchandise have filled the mitts of thee with violence and now has sinned therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God and I'll destroy the Oh cover ensure from the midst of the stones of fire thy heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of our brightness I will cast see to the ground or lady before Kings and that they may behold thee thou has defiled by sanctuaries by the multitude of thy iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee it shall devour thee and I'll bring thee to the ashes I say I'll bring me to ashes upon the earth and the sight of all the end of behold be all they that know the among the people shall be astonished at thee thou shalt be a terror and never shall there be any more hallelujah so I mean this go to 2nd Corinthians chapter 4 so the devil has an expiry date that is that that is the sum of that last scripture as he shall be no more and when he is no more we shall be hallelujah hallelujah 2nd Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 6 now one day I want you to notice the very it's very very contrary scriptures one as he was made perfect there's beauty in all these things but now notice the Apostle Paul and speaking of of the journey that that he he goes through and and every believer here so second Corinthians four and let's read from verse six and it says here for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh enough us but life and you we have received the same spirit of faith according and as it is written I have believed I believed and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many read down to the glory of God for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal hallelujah and we're just gonna read one more verse and and flipy in chapter 4 and we're gonna read verse 19 just as a bit of a maybe a bit of a context oh I'm gonna take this a little bit of a different way but Philippians 4:19 and the Apostle Paul he says but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches and glory by Christ Jesus amen let's bow our head in a word of Prayer gracious father Lord just reading your word makes us happy Lord because we thank you Lord that our enemy will come to an end and he shall be no more but yet Lord by your grace Lord we will still be we will still be a lord will be eternal with you forever and ever and ever Lord and we will never run out of time to worship You Lord we know there's no time there but Lord Lord we will never stop worshipping and thanking you for what you've done for us father because you're worthy of all honor glory and praise and dear God I just pray for other as we Lord we thank you we can meet Lord here one more time and I ask father that you would take preeminence in every life law that you would bind every spirit contrary to you in the name of Jesus Christ law that the devil would be under our feet Lord and not just for these few moments in this place but Lord every day from his fall father may you grant it Lord we just want to commit the service into your hands and we thank you that we belong in your presence Lord your bid us to come into your presence Lord you want us in your presence and we thank you lord you say here we are Lord we love to bathe in your presence Lord just to be near you for other means the world to us Lord we thank you we're not just with you Lord but you're in us till the end of the world so father I pray you're blessed the reading of your word now bless the service now father and be at those who couldn't make it tonight father beef baby lamb who's not well although still watching Lord be their portion Father in Jesus Christ's name may you grant it amen I think god bless your friends you may have your seats tonight I'd like to take a title from that last last scripture he read but he he gives us what we need now brother Branham would he would and and the message looking at the unseen he comes down to thee to the end of that service and he's making an altar call and he's calling out for the people to come forward and receive the Lord and he and he and he says while you're standing on your feet praising God how many wants you you that raised your hands a while ago believes that God will hear my prayer for your salvation of your soul come walking down here now as we sing I will praise them I'll praise them come on walk right on down the aisles here now write down to receive Jesus keep your hands up keep looking at the unseen that little pulsation in your heart come right right on down as he pulsating to you and then his voice changes he says I'm the Lord that raised up Christ from the grave I'm the one that sent the Holy Ghost I'm the one that gives the promise brother Bram has nothing to do in this I have he surrendered his life to me I'm using his spirit I'm talking through his lips that's me I'm the Lord and he goes Becky says come down so what happens is God makes himself known and that service he's been speaking the entire time through his prophet but he he he steps and you can say in a slightly different way that we would know that it wasn't a man calling us but it was Almighty God was calling us through this message hallelujah that we amen that we are not cool as he said Willy a brother brand has nothing to do with this this is me it's the Lord I'm using his lips Amen so we need to look to the unseen hallelujah because we know that that unseen one that was there is present here among us hallelujah that he is not back in 1965 but he is yeah now we have to understand that our our journey is as in direct contrast to to Lucifer Lucifer was made perfect we just read about him there in Ezekiel he was the anointed cherub that covereth he was made perfect in the day he was created he was perfection amen but yet the bride does not start off in perfection we started off in chaos we started off in darkness we started off like the world was in Genesis 1 and 1 I mean that darkness covered the earth and water covered the face of the earth but then God moved the Spirit of God brooded upon the waters hallelujah and and he did that because there was seed in the earth that he wanted to come to life wholly and that's why that's why you've got to go back when when he first called you I mean because the Spirit of God brooded over you because there was a life in you then he wanted to express I mean he doesn't just call now when I talk about the call of God tonight I'm not talking about some big blanket call right I'm talking to a personal invitation to the wedding supper to you Rice's no I'm not talking about some blanket call when I talk about being called by God I'm talking about like Abraham was called of God Abraham was called God spoke to him personally he said leave this land I'll take you to another land it wasn't some blanket call it was a personal call to Abraham so when I speak about the call of God that's the call I'm talking about okay so I'm gonna define some terms you know where I'm going okay cuz sometimes we can miss out you can misunderstand when I say the call of God whatever more but I'm talking about a personal call and God called Abraham because God knew Abraham was part of his word right Abraham did not but God knew it and that's why God called Abraham that's exactly the same as you and I the reason we have been called by this message is because we are part of the word we are part of our Lord Jesus Christ he didn't just say oh I wonder what they'll do he knew what you would do he knew your response he knew you'd surrender your life he knew that you would walk with him he knew for every danger toyless there you would still trust him hallelujah and he knew that that's why he called you a man as brother BAM tells us God does save a man just to lose in the next day when you're sealed away into the kingdom you're sealed no one can break the seal until you've made it to your destination holy that means devil no tampering and he won't be able to break it anyway now as I said Lucifer was made perfect but we came out of chaos Lucifer does not understand this he does not understand that how a holy God remember he was in God's presence he was the anointed cherub that covereth he wasn't some angel in the back somewhere he was right there here's the anointed cherub that covereth so he knew what has to be in the prison's of God he knows to be right there where God was hallelujah he knew what it was like to to be there in the presence of this holy God and he was also the the worship leader in heaven no doubt he would have been inspired to write some songs but the songs that he wrote are nothing compared to the bright songs because even brother Bram says about the Angels have done for those ones who keep their first estate they all have to hang their heads and be silent when the redeemed sing of the blood right because the angels can't sing of redemption cuz they're never redeemed they were never lost they were never found they never healed you know they were never that way so they could never sing about those things but the Bride of Christ can holy the Bride of Christ can sing about redemption and unity and oneness hallelujah I am being called by the word and being made in His image I mean but the angels cannot sing that way so Lucifer cannot sing he could never be inspired to write the songs the bride writes holily because they he never had the experience that we've had I mean because we know every song was written out of experience Amen Maryam picked up the tambourine because she just crossed the Red Sea holiest Moses sang the song of Moses because his enemies have just been dragged he could sing hallelujah and every we know every true song is written out of revelation hallelujah every true worship is out of Revelation amen that's why we can sing a song that the brought that the devil can never sing even when even before he fell he can't write half the music you could write because he knows nothing of being a child of God he knows nothing of being the bride he was just the servant angels the servants neither hired help they're not the family I mean they're just servants right servants are told what to do amen and even and even a servant that is fallen that has been fired still has to obey the voice of the father hallelujah amen so now brother Brahim says in the exposition of Church ages ladies in church age he says he says he says the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it's it's own mouthpiece so God is turning on hear her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her yes it is for us the day for it says the last chapter revelation verse 17 and the spirit heard me and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated as it is in the first Age holiest he says that he says now he has cried out to this last age you have the word you have more Bibles than ever but you're not doing anything about the word except dividing and hacking it into pieces taking what you want leaving out what you don't want you're not interested in living it but debating it I will sooner you are cold or hot if you were cold and rejected I'd stand there but um if you would get hot white hot to know its truth and love it I would praise you for that but when you simply take my word and don't honor it I in return must refuse to honor you I'll spew you out for you nauseate me he says but thank God at this moment this age is not over here's yet crying and as cry as not only in the spiritual ears of men by his Holy Spirit but once again a prophet as in the land once more God will reveal the truth as he did to Paul in the days of the seventh messenger in the days of the latter C&H its messenger will reveal the mysteries of God as revealed to Paul he will speak out and those who receive that prophet and his own name will receive the benefit effect of the prophets ministry and they will hear him and they that hear him will be blessed and become part of that bride of the last day who I mentioned in revelation 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come I mean the corn wheat the bride wheat that fell into the ground at lady osya we'll come back to the original word grain again praise God forever yes listen to the authenticator prophet of God who appears in this last age what he says from God the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride will say the same thing and they will say and and what they will say will have already been said in the word they are saying it out now come out from among them and be separate the cries guide out the cries going out how long will the voice cry we do not know but one thing we know it won't be long for this is the last age I mean but once again the world will hear from God directly as they did at Pentecost because the word is in the Bride of Christ hallelujah so now when we you know we know that's more than preaching that's living a life oh yeah Lucifer can't live the life you live I mean you're here to be safe sanctified and sealed into the kingdom of the Holy Ghost seem to be your brother the prophecies but he can't live the same car he can't worship the same way you worship and our life is a worship now Lucifer started off perfect he cannot understand how a holy God that he and he's been in the presence of God like that could have had mercy on vile wretched creatures such as us I meant he cannot understand that it doesn't even come near a sinking and but you know so he does not understand how a people could come out of chaos and to be made into the very image of God hallelujah but now brother Bram says in the masterpiece I trust you're just following my thought but he says he says in the masterpiece is Lord Jesus the inexhaustible fountain of life flows through us today Lord cleanse us from all under there we might stand in thy presence now knowing that there is need among us that we know that we are sinners and not worthy of any blessing but then when we think of whom who came and took our sins then when his blood is there it's not it's not us in the prints of God it's him it's just our voice through his blood his blood is speaking our God thing cleanse our hearts from sin and unbelief give to us the desires of our heart for we truly I have these desires to serve you who has a desire to serve them amen in these weakening conditions and afflictions and things of the world that's put upon us sometimes to perfect us we've been told we've been told that then he said thinking not strange when these trials come they're only working out for our good to perfect us to bring us into that place these great deserts of experience we're righteous men are molded into Saints we thank me for these experiences Lord we would have no means no ways want to do anything contrary to your will but we pray father that in this we'll be bought closer to you and when the burdens are so heavy we can't go no farther then we'll raise up our hands and scream to our Father then hear from heaven Lord heal us make us well for the kingdom of God's sake he says bless thy word this morning Lord thy word is the truth so he says these great deserts of experience we're righteous men are molded into saints you know I was I was driving along a few days ago in the scripture in Philippians came along he will supply all our needs what do we need many times people take that scripture they think money and houses and land and you know all those things sure we need to be you know but jesus said that life is more than raiment it's more than food it's more you know don't think about tomorrow to look after itself it's more than those things but what do we need we need character we need God's character that's what we really need I mean we need God's character in this age that is the thing now PO may be taking that scripture a little bit differently but that's what we have need of amen brother Brahim says in the church age book he says this and I'm just gonna read a little bit further up because he because he drops in he speaks about election now the biggest thing the devil always fights is who we are after Jesus was baptized Satan came against you Jesus filled with the Holy Ghost goes into the desert what's the thing he says if they'll be are you really this one claim yo yo prove it he's attacking his identity and so the devil comes against us the same way are you really the bright are you really a believer are you really one of them maybe he doesn't talk about that way but he but he comes to us and he and he always tries to get us a thinking first person like we're thinking am I really saved am I really a Christian am I really gonna make it as it just me because the devil tries to he never says no he never comes as he really is and stands out there and appears to you and begins to talk you know he speaks to you and here but he tries to make you think you're thinking it hallelujah but you were to take those short you say no where's this gonna lead me it's gonna lead me down so I'd get rid of it I mean because the Lord wants us to be established strengthened and settled wholly he wants us to know who we are on him when the bride knows what she is in the rapture will go when she knows what she isn't she's the word and the reason that the message that word has called you is because the word has come to the word and then the word never went to care for since the word never went to the Pharisees the word never went to the sanhedrin the word came to the word the disciples and they received it and that tells you that they were part of that work because they received the word hallelujah sorry giving Anna so so to me you just got to take that into consideration only belief has he caught you this is real I if I if I repeat myself well I'm just gonna repeat myself has he called you like Abraham was called has he called you that something speak to your soul leave this life you've been living go to another country go to another spiritual atmosphere go to another position and something and you said I think oh well hallelujah and every bridge Oh what are you doing I'm burning that one I'm burning this so I'm just walking on holy away cuz I've heard a voice for me Trinity I'm looking to the unseen hallelujah and then the devil comes along and puts a whole bunch of question you said no hold on that's not the voice of my set now hallelujah my set damn is the voice of God you know how you can see it it too accents in these things right God's voice is a pet to kill away and the devil's voice is a particular way I would I would turn off the devil's voice I don't have I've only got 24 hours in the day I don't have time to listen to too many things I'm a limiter I'm limited right so what's the point in listening to the devil in his deception I don't have time the devil tries to sidetrack us and all these things I say sorry I'm too busy come back when I've got free time I never do oh how convenient it is convenient I'm busy hallelujah hey I think we should just worship hallelujah should we just live a life just give God praise are you gonna be walking down the supermarket wherever glory to God hallelujah you know what I mean oh what's wrong with you I found the real stuff Holy Mother empties a man could be drunk on the Spirit of God every day of his life till he leaves this world if he said it I believe it and I believe it's for me hallelujah we just passed the bottle round you know the devil I wouldn't just honestly we're too busy to listen to Satan hallelujah now he says this now this is from the Samoan age where the you go back to that church age is great persecution upon the church and he says that now the Lord God Almighty says I know there he is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he stim the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation I am not at all unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling block this is to so many people like Israel they wonder if God really loves them how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches people suffer that is what they asked and malachi 1 1 2 3 the burden of the word of Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you saith the Lord yet ye say wherein has thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother saith the Lord yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness you see they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said his love was elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that we were chosen unto salvation because God has chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering is he to job that is his prerogative he is sovereign but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose and he would be the author of frustration and not of peace his purposes after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled hallelujah hallelujah he knows what we need as job said he put strengthen us job 23 6 the beeper you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he is actually made perfect by the things that he suffered Hebrews 5:8 tonight though he were a son yet he learned learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey Him in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and according to Paul he has left us Church a measure of suffering that they to by their faith in God while suffering for him will come to a place of perfection why did he want this James 1:2 - for my brethren count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have a perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing here we are and why does he stand by the reason is in Romans 8:17 18 and if children then heirs heirs of God joint heirs with Christ if so be we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him we must suffer to reign the reason for this as character simply is not made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't reign because power apart from character is so as a satanic but power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and has hit down on his Father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and a little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what treasures are laid up for those who willing to enter his kingdom through much tribulation hallelujah so we need character that's the that's the sum of that we need cap that is what we need he will supply your need and that need is christ-like character hallelujah and so that is why we go through trials and suffering and hardship is because he is refining us bringing out his character in us amen Joseph Joseph had a dream he had two dreams they're both basically the same thing his family would bow down and worship Him he didn't have the character when he had those dreams to actually come into that position he needed to be molded and shaped he so he wanted those dreams to be manifested but he God needed him to go through a process that when it came when the dream actually became reality he didn't get revenge on his brethren but mercy was administered hallelujah so that's why that's why he went into Egypt because God had to refine him God had to mold him God had to shape him hallelujah and the same thing with us you know we are ordained to be made in His image the bride has been called hello have you been called hallelujah has it been granted unto you then you be arrayed in fine linen clean and white the righteous of saints a house the garment does it fit you just right he always makes his government's fit just right he makes the word fit just right right so there you are you've been called so this is where you're going but you've got to have the character to get into that position right but we we're the government now he received the coat of many colors went here you know when he was that young an order for that covenant to be in him you know to actually manifest those dreams he had to go through some trials and hardships to receive character and sometimes like Joseph he had the dreams he thought Here I am it's going to happen and then his brothers sell him as a slave and he thinks he's going in the opposite direction of what he thinks because he's going away from his family he doesn't know when he'll see them again and he thinks he's going in the opposite direction of where he thinks he should be going and God has him exactly where he should be and he's going down into Egypt and then he's there a part of his house he becomes in charge of all part of his goods he may be speaking to think now this Potiphar was kept with the guard now maybe it'll happen now and then he gets him to prison because he becomes part of his wife lied he's going the opposite direction he thinks again but he needed to be in a prison he needed to be in the prison hallelujah in the butler and Bakic come and God tells him the your interpretation of the dream the gift is operating he's in charge of the prison anything and then he says to the butler I always get them mixed up whichever one that loves remember me when you're a restored and he forgets about them and he's in prison and sometimes we think why does this continue God's God is never in a hurry all mean but all the devil is is at all to bring out what's in you this life is like a dark room you hit the analogy that you know old school not digital pictures some of you I don't even know what real real for for years it's like at my old job we found some floppy disks and some people took them and and and and show them to the younger workers than me some of them knew what they were people think I was just a save icon no it was a real thing but so you know darkroom this is like our negative right but we ever like so so we like film and it's got to go through a process so that M pert that's on the film has to come out so we're being developed in this darkroom this world is the negative heaven as the positive program says if there's a tree struggling for life here it's reflecting a tree that's living somewhere Amen to this world as a darkroom and God is developing us hallelujah and God always does a good job we may not understand what he's doing but he's doing hallelujah Joseph was in the darkroom he had to be a he had to be be at the right hand of Pharaoh he's languishing in prison do you think he was rejoicing remember me when you get out and he's out and one day goes next day goes surely now third day goes I think it's hot would a thinker but yeah maybe singing have I been forgotten has God forgot me in this place sometimes we think that has God forgotten me he hasn't forgotten he can't forget a part of himself that's why the devil will not get any of God's children into the lake of fire and if God cannot lose a part of himself even the smallest but he can't lose it hallelujah so now Joseph's ready and then the butler remembers and then he's exalted to the right hand of Pharaoh and is the famine all those things happen and then ours brother brothers are here and now the dream can be manifested because now he's ready to administer mercy to the ones who actually seen him into slavery and we were ruling reign with Christ hallelujah so many times we think where's life going God knows where it's going what do you have need of we have need of character lujah brother Bram says in the absolute he says of Christ as your absolute you're tied to him in that manner no matter what anybody says how hard persecution gets how bad the storm seems to be how it looks impossible for it to happen if something has happened in you that Christ becomes your absolute any promise in the Bible becomes your absolute if you're sick you are praying for healing and and something becomes that strikes that promise in the Bible I've got it there's nothing going to wave it from you hallelujah Joseph was fixed on two dreams he didn't have a Bible to read he didn't have Church he didn't he couldn't listen to 1,100 messages he had two dreams and it gripped his life it became as absolute hallelujah Abraham had an absolute you go read the records of when God spoke to Abraham it doesn't take very long to read I don't know how long the actual accounts were just a few moments in the presence of God over 25 years no Bible no church just a visitation but it gripped them they gripped them there's many voices in this age I'm too busy to listen to any other voice yeah I was joking while I sounded joking before but I am too busy what's the point of listening to a voice that won't give you a rapture what's the point of listening to a voice that is not your identity what is the point of listening to a voice that will just leave you to to lead you to destruction I would rather listen to my father's voice I mean the Bible says because we are sons he gives us the Holy Ghost not because we became is a big difference not because we read in Galatians because we were sung He shed forth us his spirit upon us we cry Abba Father because we always were why did this message call you because you always were the bride how Lou your brother Ram says that we are born with this unmerited predestinated winning band of His grace on our fingers we were born with it we didn't receive but we always had it hallelujah before you even knew you're even alive you had it on you well I could say you had it on you and nothing can take it out of you amen nothing can take it as you know that's why you take David David was a man after God's own heart the Spirit of God came upon him one day he was anointed by a vindicated prophet that's why I'm just trying to emphasize go back to win God meet you go back to that time just go back to that time what happened to you you say well there wasn't a big lightning thunder time but something in here said yes something in you said I'm gonna follow so I'm going you says I give my will over to you something in me said yes I'm I'm walking with this word I don't know exactly hey we know that we know where we're going but there's a lot of detail in the middle that we're not told just like Joseph he knew where he knew the dream would happen he to know the detail David knew he was going to be king he didn't know the detail hallelujah and we don't know the detail but we know where we're going but you've got to go back to where that moment when he called you because that moment when he called you is like when brother Brown speaks I think I mentioned a couple of weekends ago and spiritual amnesia and the soldiers with amnesia right as I said in the beginning the devil always attacks who we are amen but brother band when he dramatized that story the soldier saw familiar places and he began walking following those familiar places until it lead him home it didn't lead him to the neighbor's house and lead him home hallelujah and when he got home his father came out of home and embraced them and brother him when his father said son I always knew you would return and embrace them then his eyes came open their knees are lifted and he knew who he was because something led him it's the same thing with this word sometimes we made wait we don't know who we are when we're born meet I think well I'm a New Zealand or South African or Korean or wherever you're from on this planet you think that's my nationality this is Who I am that's not who we are that's just a natural birth God allowed it because you want to reveal himself to us but we're not some nationality we we have a passport it's a kingdom of heaven holy and we have our visa the Holy Ghost amen that's our nationality I meant but it's when father embrace them cuz it took them home and brother mom says you you you start wandering through the Bible you may find yourself identified as a believer haloo you and so why that's all done he uses that illustration because he's trying to get you to see the Spirit of God brooded over you doesn't matter where you were that's irrelevant but he brooded over you because there was a seat not because you're you're this taller you have this voice you're the snow you're the seed in the seed of election that was buried and it could have been under concrete it could have been under whatever complex or pain or religion that's irrelevant where it was buried as long as I was there and that's the reason he says like little you know the lily pushing through the mud and the mire there's something in it that it must come out to the sunlight it must push above the mud come out above the water holy it opened herself before the Sun there's a life in it that must come out and that's why well there's my experience you go from one thing and you don't fit in here okay you go here you try something else well that doesn't work and then you go over here and you try something else and it didn't work either and you just think I don't fit in here what is this what is this and then finally you come to the right place you come home you come back to the word cuz you're part of the word you come home and there's something in you that says this is this below I belong here this is my city of refuge this is my Haven of references where I belong hallelujah and God wants you to know that's where you belong he doesn't he doesn't remember we are not bystanders we are not just visiting heaven we're not just visiting the message we're not just visiting our Lord Jesus right we are part of him hallelujah he didn't just call you just for you to take what you want to walk on no that's not as purpose his purpose is that you would know you are part of his word hallelujah hallelujah we and what the Christian needs today in this atomic age this is an absolute again and this time of uncertainty we need something besides just an experience of joining church we need an anchor and absolute and you know because churches will fail people will fail but Christ cannot fail peace the absolute to the believer and if Christ is your absolute you're tied to him and if he is your absolute and you're tied to him then you're tied to the word now now this tells whether you've got the right absolute or not if you can read in that scripture something that Christ has ordained or commissioned us to do and because of some twisting around if someone would tell you that's for the disciples or for someone else and then you and you don't hold on to that then Christ is not your absolute that person that leads you out of the ways your absolute but if that word Christ still hold see then he's your absolute we mustn't let anything steer us out of the way of the word see hallelujah now that doesn't mean you won't have hardship or trials doesn't mean you'll be tested amen but the anchor still holds God likes to test the anchor rope he likes to test it because he wants you to see something's holding you it's not us it's not us holding God you come to that conclusion in life I trust you have you will one day if you haven't it's not you being it's not you holding on to the Lord he's holding on to you he's the one with the strong hands it's not that I've got him by the hand it's he's got me by the hand hallelujah say your little children you you take them by the hand they can go like this and try and get out but if your grip holds hallelujah their hand is staying in and his grip never comes loose hallelujah so as long as he's got us by the hand he's holding on to us that's why the devil can come in but something deep down still holds and it won't let go and it can't let go hallelujah Amen now the living words spoken to you that's supernatural power of the word of this message that is our absolute that's our identity that's who we are amen you know I think often of Mary coming to the tomb she was part of the resurrection she didn't realize it she had come to a point none of the disciples were happy that Dad the crucifixion none of them were rejoicing he goes the Lamb of God up that hill with this sin Healing is released eternal life is being released the blood the debt was being paid in full hallelujah hallelujah the lamb was going up the hill with it the perfect lamb you know Pilate said I find no fault in this man he was examined hallelujah every life came to nothing and here he was with the sin of the world for this course I've come into the world and he's walking hallelujah and the blood flowing down his back brother and says this go there you see a man is howling mob saying crucify him crucify him and see a pool of patch of blood patches of blood four-month in his robe it becomes one big one big amount of blood black dong Downers legs as he's walking up Calvary that day they weren't happy they were broke him but if they knew what was going on they would have be the happiest people who you imagine that there he goes hallelujah I'm sorry I'm just gonna get happy for a little bit you can join me you can just say what's wrong with that guy I met him that's what's wrong with me hallelujah mention that there goes and he had to do it no one else can do it you imagine if you really recognized what was going on that day it may go hello yeah you must you must be a curse for us you must hang upon that cross hallelujah it would have been a rejoicing day and then when he hung up there between humans and Earth he says it's done or it is finished do you think they were rejoicing no idea the man they believe that was Messiah was now dead he didn't defend himself he has done before his accusers like the Bible said he would be haloo you Judas win and hung himself well the ministry killed themselves the rest of the ministries blocked themselves away in some room and this is - on the way to Emmaus walking back home what's happened our world just fell apart and nothing can put it back he's been there sometimes it's like who can take this and put it back together these deserts of experience how we thank you for them O Lord and here they were walking and then a stranger comes up to them and he just appears and he's acting like he does know what's going on and they begin to say with modern events that are going on but they're not made clear by the prophecy this is what's happening today in the paper didn't you hear this man Jesus of Nazareth is the property it's going to be the Messiah we believed to be the Messiah and he's probably maybe put his hands behind his back Oh what do you mean why are you saying what's this guy going and here he is you just think about this the greatest victory a human being is ever won hallelujah he took your sin down to hell hallelujah he took your sins down to hell that you don't need to go I mean here is your son offering he went down there he kicks into the he kicks the door of hell down hallelujah takes the keys of held in the grave of Satan ascends up hallelujah goes into paradise hallelujah and this paradise is a bit of a stir in paradise because this man just walked in the door and there's Daniel there sir who you and Abraham's sake who's this guy and he says I've known as the thief I don't know what his name was it's not recorded and they're having the epic testimony meeting times no more this having testified he what what the what God did in their day then this one stumbles in they ask him so what's your testimony well I was in Jerusalem it was a lot of uproar I was condemned to die on a cross that's how the road that's how the leaders and it made me fool the moon this man called Jesus of Nazareth I've never stood in the presence of a man like they had he stood silently he didn't say a word and the governor tried to wash his hands of his blood and he he just stood there and the religious people about a were like a howling mob crucify him crucify him and Pilate said it's my custom to release a man to you show released you Barabbas he was a murderer he's a wicked man worse than me he's still alive and as he show released Barabbas or Jesus called the Christ and I was thinking my mind surely they wouldn't they wouldn't ask for Barabbas and they dead and brevis was released friends we went live we were released from death her Lucas he took our place Olu yeah cuz he took our place and then so brevis goes and then they lead begin this terrible procession he was in front I was carrying my cross too and then finally we were pinned on the ground we were now to it we're hung up it was excruciatingly painful and I looked at this man there's another thief with us and we both mocked him this is both some Optum both mocked but in something and me happened like and I can't explain it I looked at him again and he wasn't the same kind of man and I said Lord remember me when you come into your kingdom and he said today I'll be you'll be with me in paradise now I'm in paradise but where is he and then there's a knock on the door and then ashamed in the Lord steps in Here I am and he says come on children let's go a little higher I mean never gonna match up into glory and David on the procession and David by the spirt rode down looking up you gates be lifted up to the king of glory shall come in and then he finds himself living out the prophecy that he wrote down and then now they're up there Jesus comes back into his body he's walking with them now what's going on he just had the greatest victory man in his evil one and he's and he's pretending he doesn't know and he's he's - walking along said and then he begins to open the word to them and the reason he does it why does this message make the Bible of life to you is because God wants you to know you are part you are the resurrection that's why that's why it's not Kentuckians voice to you that makes no sense that's why to you it is the love of God being spoken forth that's why to you it's pardoning grace that's why to you it makes this alive you say well I don't know about that what made you European to be baptized what made you leave the world what made you walk with the Lord what make you in spite of persecution and voices trying to pull you back what made you keep walking have you thought about that that was God that's because you're part of the word hallelujah I trust this means a little bit to someone I mean cuz it means a whole bunch to me huh and so he begins to open the word to them that they would understand they are part of the resurrection because it wasn't just Jesus coming out of the tomb a bride who's coming for hallelujah a bride was coming for amen and part of the resurrection was Jesus said the Lord said I'll pour my spirit out upon all flesh so part of him coming other tomb was a day of Pentecost he needed 120 in there that's why he went to the howl ouya and then he bring us open the word to them still they don't see him they don't understand you know mention this you're trying to tell this stranger what's going on and then the stranger turns around says Oh full slow of heart nears and then he begins to tell you what the Bible really says about what just happened he fills in the blanks hallelujah and then now and then he K and then they come into the house and the person who breaks the bread is actually the head of the table so Jesus takes the head at at the table breaks the bread he did something he did before he died and then their eyes came open it's helped hallelujah and that's why there's something in us when the Spirit of God comes down when you listen on tapes and hear the discernment something in you says he's done that before hallelujah and it's not just a scratch of religious search something in you says he's alive he's come out of the grave he's resurrected out of 2,000 years of bagged annihilationism he's come forth hallelujah and because he's come forth you've come for hallelujah and then they run back and then they tell the disciples he's risen now but before that all happens there's a girl called Mary we left her at the tomb her whole life was falling apart just like them what did she have need off she needed him to come I pray the Lord does something just now she needed him to come she needed more than someone giving answers she needed the answer she needed him they went to the tomb with spices because they knew a lot about burying the dead but they never knew anything about someone coming alive who didn't need the spices he was alive and she comes to the tomb and the stones rolled away this is unexpected but there's still no answer in an open tube they look in there's a barrel close an angel speaks to some of them still that's not the answer she needed what do you have need of we need him we need him to come and then she comes out and she's still warning what's going on and she turns and there's a young man standing there and she says she thinks he's a gardener sometimes the Lord comes we don't understand sometimes we you know where is he gone and you're actually looking into the word he's saying where are you where are you and he wants you to see I'm right here I haven't gone anywhere I've been here the whole time and then she says to him sir tell me where they've taken his body that I'll go and carry him away lujah but she wasn't me to carry away a dead person she thought she was going to carry where I did person but she was meant to carry she was going to meet a resurrected living and the big difference she was looking at him but it's when she called when he called her by name Mary the inner eyes come open Lord it's you hallelujah I bet you she was not sad anymore she was not sad anymore she was not broken anymore she was not confused anymore because her need was him and he came down and spoke to her directly hallelujah and then all the sadness left mention that your whole world is gone that's one you loved that's one you have how could they do this to him the only healed the sick race are dead hallelujah cast out Devils and this is what they do where's he gone and you go to us to me stop there and then he's there in a different way in a different form hallelujah he calls and he calls her by name that's what I going to say you got to go back to when he called you by name you got to go back when the word called you by name we say well I never heard no audible voice say my name but when the word quickens to your soul that's God calling you by name holy that's God identifying that you are the bride Amen you're not just a religious remember this is not a church this is not a church this is not a gathering of just a larger people this is part of the redeemed of the ages of gathered that's what a church has gods gathered was redeemed ones that he's gathered to himself that's what the churches where the bride call but I've says that the bride call will come right through this through the message and it has and if a bride calls gone forth it who has responded to the call what does that make you say it right what does it make you you got to say it hallelujah if you've responded to the call and it's a bridegroom call it's a call for a bride and you responded that makes you brave and so basically you take that ignore everything the devil says you got to do that no I'm being deadly serious because he will fight you to the very every moment of every day saying you're not worthy you're not part of them you're not accepted you're different we're all different hallelujah but it doesn't matter it doesn't matter where we're from hallelujah God has a God of variety and we love the variety hallelujah God is not just a one-hit wonder he's a God of variety eat with me and then so now the important thing is have you accepted the call yes I'm going through a lot of battles Joseph would have had a lot of battles in the dungeon why am I still here why hasn't he told Pharaoh I'm here on a trumped-up charge again but yet God had him there because God was molding him hallelujah King David you go read the story of David same thing say God repeats himself causing for wanting you to see that the path they walk does the path you will walk amen you see you meet God God anoint your life transforms you conquer some Devils like David killed the bear and the lion and and Goliath and then and then the enemy comes in sometimes you and there's a lot of hardship you know when he's crying out in the Psalms he's not sitting in his palace the enemies all around about me did it I don't know he's hidden up in some cave fearing for his life he had a lot of hardship deals a lot of clothes shake you know imagine him he's gone he's running into the Philistine land he was desperate he's thinking how am I gonna survive I just killed their champion not long ago my fellow Israelites sing a song that I've killed tens of thousands of these people and they would have heard it how am I gonna and then he acts crazy in front of the king and he survives you know sometimes we get into pretty ridiculous circumstances you remember the God has put a pattern in his word right and if you look into the scripture look into the characters you'll find what you are going through as be already happened amen that's why he says it's Persephone's you look around in the word and you'll find yourself a believer because you'll be able to identify well if David had to go through this or Joseph or whoever more and I'm in this predicament well it's because if they did it then that I will fear the shadow and I'm the reality well you know the shadow matches the reality and so and so he had to go through that way because when he became king he could be a righteous King because he needed the character to go up on the throne it's the same thing with us rings we have to we have to go back and old and I'll close with this you have to go back to when God called you and you have to remember that was real amen that was real when God spoke to your heart I don't know God is not a cookie cutter but he called you just like he's he walked with it on the way to Emmaus because he wanted him to see one I'm alive and two you're part of the resurrection and that's why this message has come to show one he's alive - you're part of the rapture you're part of what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is a bride coming out of the tomb attacked and emotionalism and the devil can't put us back in a tomb he may try but he'll never be successful hallelujah you look at what your ordained to do and you say Lord I agree with what I'm prophesied to become you shall become it hallelujah is a Josefa my family has to bow to me his whole life was hooked to that prophecy same thing with us but if we were going to look at what the we listen to what the devil says you know the devil is never going to encourage you I know this is quite pretty elementary he's never going to help you in your Christian walk and you can do it oh it's gonna be all right he never helps you he's never gonna be encouraging oh this is who you are and look at this no he's never gonna do that he wants to destroy you he wants us to be of two minds he wants us to think we belong on this earth we don't belong on this earth we belong in heaven Amen God wants us to know who we are what we are we are the word hallelujah I mean let's have the musicians please I think we've ran out of time but I want you to think about it friends go back to when he called you go back to that time the Apostle Paul recounted the road to Damascus experienced more than once a mint and he knew God called him so it didn't matter what happened to him he was anchored by that experience he had an absolute and we must have the same I mean let's stand to our feet shall we this bow he's in a word of Prayer gracious Heavenly Father the Lord Jesus just for you to call us Lord we thank you we can look into your word Lord we think of Lord Mary at the tomb Lord how glad we are Lord we can see ourselves in that word Lord because you came Lord when we were in despair and lost you you called us by name Lord Jesus father and our lives have never been the same and Lord we know the devil Lord how he wants to destroy us and rob us of our identity but father we thank you that you are greater Lord Jesus that the lies of the devil I just lies he's nothing but a bluff he has a defeated being and we want to thank you dear God he will be he will come to nothing Lord Jesus but we shall still through the eternities praise and worship you so father I pray just take these chopped-up words and lord may we just rejoice in every situation Lord we do thank you for these great deserts of experience Lord how we thank you for them father Oh Lord may we see Lord I pray father you bring to our remembrance Lord that when this message came our way Lord it's a bridegroom call I believe that Lord has come to call the bride and you see these ones that have gathered Lord those who are watching well the reason why you have supernaturally called them is because they are your bride Lord Jesus that's why Lord they are part of you and you've loved them with an undying love father we thank you Lord that your love is elective Lord you called us before the foundation of the world and Lord we want to thank you that nothing can stop that Lord we can never be lost father we may be feel very wayward upside down many times but Lord we're so thankful you hold on to us so dear God I pray Lord your sweet presence with brood over every heart now father lord I just pray that you'll take us back to when you called us by name Lord all the mine battles would just go Lord all the lives the enemy would just vanish away Lord that we know Lord Jesus we are your children we thank you Lord you're a father of reassurance dear God you reassure us how the Lord that we are part of you
