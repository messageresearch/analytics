========================================

that was a beautiful special by the way um so I'm going to sing a song which was written by a friend who lives in the states um the inspiration for the song comes from when Jesus is preaching um about unless you eat my flesh and drink of my blood you have no part in me and most of his disciples from that time went back and they walked no more with him and then Jesus said unto the 12 will you also go away and then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God from John 6 um I'm trying to work on when things seem impossible to just keep trusting in the word of God to whom shall we go if you have the words of life and where can I [Music] run there's nowhere to run to whom shall we go if you have the word words of life and where can I run there's nowhere to run I could run to my own understanding I could trust what I feel or what I see but my heart fails me my heart fails me I could run to my own understanding I could trust what I feel or what I see but my heart fails me my heart fails me so are un to the rock of the a I will stand on the word The Original Seed cuz that won't fail me see God can't fail me so are unto the rock of the ages and I will stand on the word The Original Seed cuz that won't fail me see God can't fail me with a resurrection power peace in my darkest dark a strong and mighty tower and his words Speak Life to me with a resurrection ction power peace in my darkest star a strong and mighty tower and his words Speak Life to me to whom shall we go Lord if you have the words of life and where can I run there's no way to run to whom shall be go [Applause]
