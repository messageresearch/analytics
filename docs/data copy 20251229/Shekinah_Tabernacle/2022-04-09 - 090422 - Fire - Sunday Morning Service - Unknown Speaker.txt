refresh us all flow from your throne lord god by your spirit lord and we just pray you would continue to pour your spirit out upon us this morning lord may may each heart be refreshed here in the holy ghost lord we don't want to be a dry stick lord but we want to be soft and pliable lord and with the the refreshing rivers of god always making us soft and tender lord keep each heart soft i pray lord that that we can be pliable in your hands lord that you could mold us this way in that way lord and we thank you for this time that we're living in lord we're living in an oasis father there may be a drought all around lord but we're in an oasis lord and our roots go down deep by the rivers of water lord and our leaves won't wither lord we're an evergreen tree and we just thank you for that lord jesus so i just want to pray that you'll bless each heart this morning lord bless continue to bless our service bless those who couldn't make it bless those who are streaming bless pastor ben and his family lord may just watch over them this morning to our prayer and just thank you for your grace and love to us lord in jesus name amen amen praise the lord you can um take your seats this morning thank you brother anya thank you musicians praise the lord who's feeling good amen amen amen it's good to be alive i think christians enjoy being alive who likes being alive when you can wake up and breathe man there's hope there's opportunity there's there's an opportunity for god to move in your life when you can wake up and breathe there's something there's there's an opportunity to lay hold of faith and see god answer that faith in his word there's opportunity if you see this when we die there's no more opportunity to do that so let's not be fearful let's be bold let's make the most of the opportunity that we have that we're alive and that we can have this faith you know as solomon says there's none of this is in the grave now i know we can't carry on living but you know naturally speaking we're not doing anything in the grave but while we're here let's let's make the most of what we have let's and you know i've always said i'm gonna i want to go out on a blaze of glory you know and that's that's but that's what we have as believers you know we're a people full of faith and and i've got a um i've got a thought this morning that i want to um share it's been a little bit tricky the last few times to get something together because we're living in a new place and i think it's psychological you know you kind of your mind's not really settled into your new place and where are all your spots where do you go and it's a bit smaller too so there's a lot more i've got a lot more people around me all the time because the other house was very big so you could sort of it's like we had a few houses here you could be in a separate place but this place is there's people everywhere everywhere you go there's people there people and i haven't quite got outside spots to go yet you know so i have a few but yeah so it's been psychologically it's been a little bit um i haven't really found my little you know i don't think i'm getting old but you know you get used to something and then you have something new and you're like whoa whoa whoa hang on hang on this is not what we're used to um you'd have you'd all have that right so you know you have your and you're getting your habits and you have your little places where you go maybe you sit down and you read in that spot and you do it in that spot here and you get familiar with it so when you go back there it's kind of like psychologically you can just be a bit more peace when you're there because it's familiar surroundings you know we we like familiarity as humans we're like that's that's what we're like we get comfortable you know we like this is familiar we like that i thank god that we can become familiar in his presence you know so when we're outside of that we're like well this is not familiar i'm not i'm not comfortable here i like to be in a familiar place but i have managed to sort of battle through and figure out and get some little quiet places here and there but it hasn't been i don't think it's been anything spiritual i don't like to give satan too much credit that he oh you know i've been under such attack you know he's always up to that anyway you know i was always it was a struggle to come to church this morning well when isn't it you know it always is he's always going to try and do his thing but you know you just say look i don't care i'm getting up you know i've often thought getting up and going to church is one of the most easiest things a human being can do in this day and age really all we have to do is just wake our body up you know put some nice clothes on it hop in a car most of us got vehicles you know and just drive you know we turn up it's not there's not too much of a spiritual battle going on there like can we just tell our body body wake up hop in that car start it up and drive to that building and go and sit down in there you know we have the ability to do that you know it's not like we are going through a war zone and like wow man almost died on the way here you know you understand like like we need to we somehow sell with such a battle we give satan all this credit to that he's doing all these things but really you know it's quite a simple thing to get up and go to church that's just well maybe that's just my opinion but that's the way i've always thought of well do what you want satan it's not i can't actually unless you physically maim me and i can't actually physically hop in my car i can i've got the ability to get there and go and do it you know and i think that's what we do as christians that's why you're all here you know because you you've made that effort and god sees the effort you know you we god sees all the effort we make you know and and i'm going to get to my sermon shortly but i was thinking you know that that what when we do that it's called the fight of faith you know we are battling for the kingdom of god and it has an effect when you when you make an effort for the kingdom of god it has an effect on you and it has an effect on those around you it has a positive effect on the kingdom of god like if none of us made an effort and came this wouldn't be here but but we make an effort we come we fight the good fight of faith each and every day and it has it pushes the kingdom of god forward you know and every everything that we do for the kingdom of god is not in vain it doesn't it doesn't just have no effect it has an effect right because you could be doing something the opposite against the kingdom of god and it would have an effect the other way so be encouraged everything that you do for the kingdom of god has an effect you know and you're you're all you're fighters you every like now you're you're what you're doing now is standing up and fighting back you're saying no i'm fighting back that's what you're all doing here your mighty warriors saying i'm fighting back i'm making a stand i'm pushing forward and and if you push forward every promise in the book is yours there's no promise that you cannot have in the name of the lord if you want it you can have it just push forward and you'll get it some of them come straight away some of them take a long time but that's what it is when you're a soldier you can push forward and claim it all so what we're doing here is having an effect it's having an effect lives are being changed the kingdom of god is being pushed forward the kingdom of satan has been shaken and disrupted so be encouraged amen the sermon that i the thought that i had on my heart this morning was fire and i'm going to go quite fast through this if that's right i've got i've got a certain portion to get through so i want to go quite quick once i start start doing it and i've got lots of scripture verses here so i didn't really do any verses at the start so this is we're just going to make a start so i want to talk about fire who likes fire when your boys love fire who do you like fire boys is you know as soon as you make a buy or you have like a campfire what's the first thing everyone does is grab a stick and put it in the fire you know and then there and then you get about 10 little kids around them before you know they've got these flaming sticks with burning amazon looking around and talking to their friends and these we have a rule whenever there's a fire no children allowed to put sticks in the fire you know not we're trying to spoil the fun but you know you're going to get people are going to get branded you know with a brand mark on them we don't want that but you know that's we love fire fire is an amazing thing i think i think god loves fire god made this thing called fire and god actually really likes fire it's it's it's something special to him this concept of fire and and i think as as christians we should love fire fire such a great thing we often think of the fires of hell and we relate fire to this darkness but you know that's not really actually fire belongs to us fire is a great thing you know and god god's a god of fire he loves fire and i'm just going to take you through some of these verses and then i'll carry on these are just different things i found that god associates himself with fire and the angel of the lord appeared unto him unto moses and a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush decided to come down and appear as a fire you know he could have appeared as a person or different things but he appeared as a flaming fire in this bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed that's the fire of god god likes to associate himself with fire amen god loves fire here's another one and the lord went before them by a day and a pillar of cloud to lead them in the way and by night and a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night so god led the children of israel with a by a pillar of fire at night he could have had some other maybe object to do it but he chose to be a pillar of fire this is where moses was up on the mountain and the sight of the glory of the lord was like a devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of israel so when god was when god was anywhere there was fire up on top of this mountain the children of israel looked and they saw that the top of the mountain looked like it was going to erupt with fire because god was up there i think of the story of brother branham when he went up to finger rock and god met him there and people said that they saw a fire coming down and up onto the mountain because god's a god of fire he loves fire for our god is a consuming fire that's what it says about god he's a consuming fire and here's another here's another aspect of fire when the when the holy ghost came there were there was tongues of fire as it would seem fell across each one so here's this great god of fire came down and separated himself and all these little little piece i wouldn't say pieces of god but a separation of god you know from a fire you can take out you can take out a bit of fire and put it somewhere else that went on top of each person and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as fire and it sat upon each of them so here's this fire people people looked around they saw fire because god's a god of fire he god loves fire i'm just gonna take you through some real simple facts about fire that that are so simple we all know them but you need three things to make a fire well the first thing is fire is actually uh it's actually uh an event it's not really a thing it's a chemical reaction so it's not actually a it just comes and goes you know it's a fire is a chemical reaction and it needs three elements to react it needs uh fuel which is essentially hydro hydrocarbon hydrogen carbon but fuel like hydrogen and carbon which is essentially anything that burns there's a good chance it's got hydrogen or carbon inside it because it's burning and it needs oxygen and it needs heat and if you get those three things together then you will create a chemical reaction called fire because you could have you could have fuel and you could have oxygen like this disc and oxygen but if this won't catch on fire unless i unless this gets to a certain heat and then this chemical reaction will suddenly trigger at a certain point so all if i want to make this catch on fire i just have to figure out a way to make that there hot because we've got oxygen here and eventually it will actually burn it will catch on fire this chemical reaction will will kick in and we have been man has not so much now but up until maybe a hundred years ago fire was massive in people's lives it was basically your whole life revolved around fire you know for since time began our whole life revolved around fire fire was the you know you take out fire out of a out of a person's life up to about 100 years ago you were done life life no longer was going to exist very pleasantly for you as what it used to with fire it was an essential element of survival way way back this is uh i was going to take you through a few of these because most people they they cooked from fire and then they got heat from fire that was the general idea the indians would get creative and make like you know american indians they would have like smoke signals with fire they would if they you know cover over and let the smoke go up and then someone in the hill a long way away could read that signal the chinese used to have um fire lights on the on the great wall so they could alert someone they would light a fire and then someone on the furthest part of the wall would see that fire and they would relay that message so they could get a message back hundreds of kilometers within a few minutes you know back to to say someone's attacking this part of the wall and then they could send a message back through these these fire signals but this here is actually that looks like a modern day cooking appliance say that's a roman cooking appliance is that the romans cooked so because they had iron they they knew how to use um fire to make you know heat that's a heat iron so that that was these guys probably ate quite well this is a roman cooking these people i don't know this was somewhere these guys use pottery you know some people would would heat up get clay and they would they would do all their cooking and looks like a clay grill in a clay pot some people were a bit more primitive just had a fire with a stick over it with a pot hanging on it you know andy will like this next one this is an old pizza oven but this this is probably still there and it was probably built a thousand years ago you know some of these things but but this this all revolves around fire here's some what are these things what's this bro there's a big thing there yeah what's this there's some sort of other big oven thing she's cooking in there yeah what what is it it's not like an oven mmm looks good if it looks like it'll cook some nice food in there this is all fire everything this if you took a fire away none of this stuff would exist here's a this is an old english stove you know the cooking up till not very long ago was done in a it all revolved around a fire you want to make yourself some food you like the fire same with this one this is different big old open fires in there it has a nice old kitchen doesn't this look nice something natural and nice about fire you know when you look at fire you think this is nice you know it's a relaxing how many times have you looked at fire at a fire burning in the the little um sparks are just rising up and it's giving this nice glow you know the glow is like a yellowy glow and it goes back and forth it doesn't just we turn these lights on and they just go they're on you know there's no this thing's falling off my head there's no um there's no thing on it um that brother it could you just while i'm talking could you just i'll see how i go you know you see the yellow glow this has fallen off me it's got no piece on it um you see the yellow glow coming up and it's it's very nice here's here's this is my last one of the this is an open fire very inefficient but every home back in the back in the back until we got like back until where's that little piece for it not very good technology it's a new one it doesn't work it's all up we'll try it now who knows how to start a fire really easy you get like a um they call them cigarette lighters but that's only because people like cigarettes with them but it's essentially just a lighter that's or matches that's what you know and anything with anything else generally not how you use a what we call a cigarette lighter or matches you know and they they create like a cigarette lighter the way it works is is you've got the um hydro hydrocarbon which is basically the gas that's what that's your fuel you've got a you've got well that that kind of uses the you've got oxygen in the air and then the way that the works is when that when you turn it it sends off a tiny little spark when it rubs over the front you know go like that and it rubs the flint real quick and it sends a little spark shooting forward and it ignites the the fuel it's quite a basic little thing you know we think well look at this lighter but it's very simple technology but um there was a time where people didn't have a lighter or matches you know so and that was for the whole millennium when people use fires they didn't have the simple fire lighting equipment like we have you know you take for granted like say the maori people you know that that were here how did they light a fire you know it's quite a hard thing to do really you think man like if we got chances are if any of us got stuck in the bush without a lighter or without a some matches we will probably not be able to light the fire but you could easily easily get two pieces of wood in light of fire it's not actually very hard if you want to just go on youtube you'll see especially um pacific islanders there's one that these guys do it's very simple this one here was they just had a piece of wood about that long and another piece of wood and you just make a small groove and they just rub it back and forth in the groove if you do it slow at the start and then it builds up tiny little dust particles because you're pushing it to the front and it builds up a tiny little you know you might have a square centimeter of dust particles then you just go a little bit faster and it just smokes before you know it this little bit of smoking it takes about all of about one minute to do it for 45 seconds and you've got and it's smoking and then they just get a little piece of um anything anything dry like dry hay or you know dry grass or something very everything has to be very dry and they just pour that those tiny little particles they just it's basically dust they pour the dust in and just blow that and then it within about two minutes you've got a fire in your hand from two pieces of stick it's not it's very it's actually very simple you think it's very hard then you see these guys do it the romans that so that that was the a lot of the pacific island people this is how they started the fire and they had lots of fire so this works you know they always had fires the romans used to have a piece of flint or or a piece of fool's gold with a piece of steel and they would do this and they would get a they would have there was a fungus that grew on trees and they would take that fungus off and they would just scrape tiny little particles it's all about getting dust sized particles because they would scrape off little dust sized particles to about a square centimeter on a table and and if one spark hit that it would just form the tiniest little fire you could think of it was only like one dust particle was caught on fire it's all you needed one little dust particle and then they would that would catch on to maybe two or three we're talking a tiny flame and they would just let that go for a bit then they would the same they would always scrape that dust onto another piece of dry material and then that would catch on fire but the indians similar technique they would rub a piece of wood this way into another piece of wood but they would make these little grooves on the side so that as they they what the fire would start in there and then the reason why for the groove was because then they could pour that into the whatever else they wanted to light you know so they would go like this and this is this doesn't you're not sitting there for hours doing this if your water is dry these guys are not as fast as a lighter but within a minute these guys have got a fire going you know it's all the greeks you know how the greeks did it they had um they had they had glass they had um they because all you need is heat right so they just had they had a little substance there and they would just get magnifying glasses and use the sun a lot of them would just use the sun because it's probably the sun's always shining in grease and it would just it would create heat on a certain spot and eventually when you get something to a certain heat that chemical reaction kicks in which is fire and that would it would burn you can actually light a fire with ice you know you think oh i'm in the i'm out in the arctic how am i gonna light a fire but if you you can people do it they make a get a block of ice and you form it like a dome on one side shrine it up and the sun shines through that onto whatever it is they're trying to light and they let's say your light fires that would be how the eskimos look fires and they didn't have wood you know it's quite common so if you get stuck in the snow and there's icy you could light a fire with the ice um but you know god often return talks about us having a fire in us you know and that's the fire of god and you know we as well as believers if we're if we're a christian we've got this fire burning in us you know and at some point god's letting that fire in us you know he's gone to the trouble to light a little fire here we are we're like this fuel and oxygen but we need this little spark somewhere at some point we need this little spark to come come and light us you know and i've often thought you know god's a consuming fire so you know if god comes near you maybe if our wood's all about wet if that fire starts to come near you it starts to dry everything out you know you see someone when god starts to work in their life you just see you see god start to draw close to them and it seems like they're starting to just change you know the things they used to do they're not quite doing any more they've got more of an interest to come to church they're more receptive to the things of god it's just all that fuel's drying out ready to catch on fire you know because it's hard to like wet wood you know so that god's drawing close and they're just starting to all the water's evaporating it's all getting nice and dry then at some point that that little maybe god just draws just just that little bit closer you know so there's the flame of god just looks over to that to that dry wood that that's you that's your spiritual life and it just sets you on fire it's not always it's not it's not a usually fires you know when you light a fire people often make a big one like this you know and then you light it that's not really how you do it you actually just make a fire that big you just have a small one because after the time when you do a fire that big nothing burns then you end up you're just focusing on a small spot anyway but that's actually how you do it you just have a little small spot you just put little bits of wood bit more bit more you just you only need one spark and that's how god does it you know sometimes you might not see what's going on but there's a little someone's warmed up and then that little fire started in their heart you know i've seen people like that you don't realize god's doing something but there's a fire now it's already listened you didn't know it and they tell you months later man that back there when i was at that meeting this happened to me you know there was a little fire burning and then it just and god just continues to put one on that fire and it gets bigger and bigger and bigger that's the nature of fire if you just keep putting things on it it grows you know and and i think that's what happened here you know these these men were already these guys actually these guys have been in the presence of the lord for so long this was all this dry wood ready for a bonfire you know this this and they were all together so when when that spark of god came down to this gathering it was like tinder it was a tinder box in there you know the whole thing just caught on fire and every heart was just on fire there was no you know this this is probably a i think this was a bonfire spiritual bonfire not not all fires start like this but sometimes you know you get the right fuel it just goes boom away you go another way that they used to light fires in the olden times was they would um not let the fire go out it was a that was a good you know because you didn't want to have to do this all the time or rub your wood or do you flint so you just generally didn't keep your you didn't let your fire go out because then you wouldn't have to go through the hassle of starting a new fire but if it did you could go to your neighbor's house hey buddy my f my fire's gone out can i have some of your fire you know and you could get some of that fire and i think there's a good lesson in that you know that's that's this is about fellowship you know if you know sometimes you might be a bit down and you're you're all a bit you know the fire's gone down a bit you go and fellowship with a believer that's on fire and it their fire burns you off but lights you up you come back and you how many have had that you know you feel refreshed it's like wow i'm on fire again you know that was that was a good experience being in the presence of those people they've given you a bit of their fire and that's why they say you got it it's a good thing to come to church you know because they say the easiest way to for amber to get to go out is to take it out of the fire to sit it over there by itself and before you know it it'll go out because you know when you put embers in a fire they all actually burn each other so that it all keeps each other burning so if you want to stay on fire for god just stay amongst fellowships they're amongst believers that are on fire and that flame their flame that they are and that you are everyone is will be guaranteed to light each other it will keep everyone burning and with the fire of god in between that that's right i've got this quote here brother branham said like i was saying this morning of hudson taylor me being me i'd like to know who's hudson taylor well i kind of already knew who he was he was a um hudson taylor was a um uh he was a missionary in china very um a lot of the there is a still a big missionary organization that go around asia and he was the one that started that organization but i actually didn't know this but when we went to china we ended up in a place that we just ended up there we didn't know where it was and what was actually in this hudson taylor's hometown that where we ended up living in taiwan and you know we didn't go there andy you went to south china tie you in and so i actually went to hudson taylor's house in china where he where he lived there but brother branham's got this quote i want to read it he said like i was saying this morning of hudson taylor when a man told him a young chinese boy said mr taylor i have just received christ it's burning in my heart that's what christ does now i'll have to have four years to get my my ba and my doctor's degree and so forth mr taylor said don't wait till the candle's half burnt before you try and try to show your light said go do it now you're on fire man what are you waiting for just go you know this is what it's all about that fire it's not learning what it is it's it that's it you don't need to learn about that just let that burn just put fuel on it it'll just burn amen that's right don't worry around this that or the other great big schools of theology they're right they was in the days gone by but brother what we need today is not a school of theology we need some lit candles listen if you don't know know more about it go tell them how it got lit and let them light off of that and somebody light off of that we'll have another return to pentecost because that's what happened there that's right just as soon as it's lit that's all you know about it go tell someone else how it got lit sometimes the cemetery that was a stroke or seminaries takes all takes all the light out of you that's right you're persistent just tell them how you got lit say i was standing there and all at once the holy ghost fell on me if you'll do the same thing it'll happen to you tell that much if that's all you know then just tell that's enough hey what more could you what what more what greater thing is than getting lit by the fire of god so if you've been lit on fire just tell someone this is how i got lit this is it at the end of the day that's what that's what god the gospel is all about is the fire of god lighting people's hearts so if you're on fire just hey i'm on fire you want to know about it you want to do you want to know how it happened do you want to know something because and the more you put fuel on that the more it will just burn it it doesn't have to be taut it doesn't have to be it doesn't need man's it's not a man fire it's a god fire it just you just put spiritual wood on it it just keeps on burning man doesn't have to do anything to make it work it's not from man that spark of this fire of god in our life didn't come from man so you don't man doesn't need to mess with it i've got another fact that i thought was very interesting i like this there's only fire on earth you ever thought about that there's there's only fire on earth fire is just reserved for us you know because it needs oxygen there's no oxygen anywhere else so this this reaction called fire is it's just for us you know it's like you know people think is their life out there i don't know last i checked there wasn't the last sign to subject there wasn't but you know there's life here and where life is is where the fire of god wants to be so it's a spiritual type you know like you can only have this fire here god's just interested we might be this insignificant planet but god's interested in us here and this is where he allows fire to happen here because he wants his fire to come and be with us here now we might think you know oh this is modern day we don't really use fire these days who thinks that you know who's like when was the last time you lit a fire like this year that's oh you've got to fight okay some people still have fireplaces in their homes right but if you don't if you don't have a fireplace there's a good chance you think man i haven't lit in a fire or seen a fire for oh yeah you know never even had a lighter in your hand or a candle maybe romantic people looking candles but but you know the the simple fact is we use fire is still an integral part of our life you know it's down to very simple basic technology of driving a vehicle all that is it's just setting gasoline on fire and it blows up and then our car moves along a bit because it turns the piston and then another bit of fire petrol blows up you know it's basically a lighter doing this and we you that we basically drive around a piece of fire you know well you know you think oh that's why you say let's walk i'll warm up the car what you're meaning is i'm gonna i'm gonna set this car on fire you know i'm gonna start the fire in the car that's what you do you know you have this modern key and everything looks all modern and slick all you're doing is starting a fire in your car you know you think i need some heat we're gonna it's gonna blow up this air that happens because you're little fire in the bonnet you know and you some of it's even modern you push a button but all it's doing is starting a fire in your engine it's just all contained so it doesn't blow the whole thing up but it's just and that's what it makes the sound boom boom boom boom boom you're burning fire and you know like even everything that you touch like all this it's all been molten the it takes fire to and these um to mold all this iron and all these things here just that that's all been made with fire all your phones everything it's all we actually if we took away fire from our existence we wouldn't really exist in the capacity that we know today and you know even so much so that part of the major problem that some would say that we've got today is that we're actually burning too much fire you know this we think oh fire it's a thing of the past there's because when you when you burn fire it creates carbon dioxide as the byproduct of it and that goes into the atmosphere you know and then you get more carbon dioxide there's no more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now the more it was when people use fire for everything apparently there's there are there are more now because we're actually burning more fire now than what we ever used to there's just fire fire fire everywhere we're just burning starting off with our vehicles every one of us burn a fire every day if you commute for an hour you're burning a fire for an hour every day if there's five of you in the family you know you only have one fire in the house so that was divided by five now you five drive a vehicle you're burning fire fires you know we there's a lot of fire going on these days so if you think oh fire's the thing of the past it's not really we use we we all use fire these days i want to talk about fire as judgment because you know a lot of times and through especially through the old testament god used fire fire was a form of judgment upon people was this was fire i've just got some scriptures on that and when the people complained it displeased the lord because god had done so many things and they just kept on complaining the children of israel and the lord heard it and his anger was kindled and a fire of the lord burned among them so fire burned among them and consumed them that were in the outermost parts of the camp and the people cried unto moses and when moses prayed unto the lord the fire was quenched and he called the name of the place tebura because the fire of the lord burnt among them god used fire as a judgment because fire has got a consuming capability to do something that is to make it is not you know it's there now it's gone and and this fire has a capacity to do that to take something that exists make it not exist like this pulpit here could be burnt with fire and the majority of it would be turned back into something that it's like a you know like a tree like a fire is just burning stored energy like a tree going in reverse essentially because the sun shines energy down it makes photosynthesizes that plant and makes it grow up and it stores this energy inside it all a fire does is reverse that process and bring it back the other way because there's energy in it and it just releases it it's like a tree growing in reverse is when you catch something on fire it's using up stored energy that was housed in it here's another one that you all know sodom and gomorrah when the synod got so bad and god wanted to destroy it he used fire to destroy it and the lord reigned upon sodom and gomorrah brimstone and fire from the lord out of heaven i don't know how that worked but i can assure you something came out of heaven and burnt the place i don't know scientifically how it works but that's what happened it's like the red sea you know people say how did the how did the sea open up how did they go across you know if you blow if because the bible said in east wind blue if you blow on something for long enough you're gonna form ice right you like you go on an aeroplane that's why you get ice particles form outside windows on airplanes and there because it's the the air moving really fast creates gets really cold and creates ice so one man said you know it's very possible if you blow ice if you blow water like a fire blow a powerful water down on a stream of water it will actually get cold and cold and it will form it will form ice walls there and i could i could walk across the bible said in east wind blue is that how it happened probably i don't know but that could scientifically happen right and and all is here's another one in all israel we're around about then this is when um dathan and what was the other person's name right when they when they god opened up the earth and swallowed them up with the earthquake but then there were still people that didn't fall down in that chasm and all israel were around about and the people that were still there fled at the cry of therefore they said lest the earth swallow us up so the people that were left ran away and then it says and they came out a fire from the lord and consumed the 250 men that offered incense so the ones that didn't fall down he destroyed them with fire here's another one and elijah answered and said unto the captain of 50. if i be a man of god then let fire come down from heaven and consume thee 50. and there came down fire from heaven and consumed him and his 50. and he did that three times sometimes i wonder what were these guys thinking this 50 men went up and they got burned with fire and then they sent another 50 and it happened again i think man after one time i'm not going up there say what you want you know i'm not going up and here's i just want to talk about this for a bit about god and himself being a consuming fire because a lot of the times this one here is when when the angel came to gabriel and he said prepare this prepare some cakes prepare that and the angel of the lord we need to finish that the angel of the lord touched the rock and a fire came out and consumed the sacrifice you know god's a consuming fire and that's that's a that's like a type in our life we offer something to the lord and the fire of god will consume it and that's why i think we talked about this last week in gideon once it's happened gideon perceived that he was an angel of the lord gideon said alas o god for because i've seen an angel of the lord face to face and the lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not thou shalt not die then gideon built an altar there unto the lord and called it jehovah shalom so that's the place where god consumed his fire this is another common one that you'll all know when elijah was praying and you know the prophets of baal were there and and then the fire of god came down this must have been a very very special fire because it said it consumed the rocks last time i checked rocks weren't really hydrocarbon they generally but i think you probably could get some fire hot enough to burn to burn rocks you know like 5 000 degrees fahrenheit you probably can burn some rocks but this fire here that came down burnt the wood that burned the meat and then burnt the water evaporated the water and burnt the rocks and it disintegrated the whole thing that's the power of fire one more where where solomon when they when he built the temple they offered all the sacrifices it said the fire of god came down and consumed the sacrifice just came down this is the god we serve god loves to display himself in fire he's a fire breathing god and we get near to god we get on fire we get this fire in us that's that's christians are full of fire we're just that that's what we're like we're full of fire and god's not scared of fire lo he said this is the lo i see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the force is like the son of god so this natural fire is not going to do anything to the god of fire just walks in the fire this is nothing you think this fire is bright you wait till you see the fire of my fire this is just your natural fire which types of spiritual thing you know the natural fire just types the spiritual fire of god far more powerful far more effective than this natural fire that can't even burn you know has a hard time burning steel you know god's fire just evaporates things and i want to talk a bit about god's about fire being an attribute of god because and how god uses fire in our life and here's this one here that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth thou be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ so god uses his fire to to burn out any unbelief to to try our faith you know it's now fire makes things hot and makes things intense it gets rid of things that shouldn't be there it it disrupts things you know you put a fire through a place it's probably not going to look the same as what it was before the fire went there if god comes in and if the fire of god goes into your life and goes somewhere does something it's going to have an effect it doesn't just sort of pass through oh did you hear the fire went through the city i wouldn't have thought wouldn't have guessed you know for fire went through the city half the city's gone and when the fire of god comes in and god uses his fire to refine us to refine our faith and i like this type here that the the things god references that his things are unburnable by this fire that that there are there's a certain substance which are the things of god that his fire they they stay when the fire is burnt they stay there you understand this that's an important principle because there there are things that when the fire of god burns they're gone they don't exist anymore they've been broken down to their temporal and that's what you call eternal things and temporal things and there are a lot of natural and spiritual temporal things that the fire of god is going to burn naturally and spiritually that they're not going to be there anymore that's why we say don't focus on natural things too much because eventually the fire of god is going to burn everything that will be that will that will eventually burn out but the things of god are unburnable so our we need our faith our faith is an attribute of god and all this the love the actual attributes of god are unburnable when the fire of god comes in those things stay it's all hate jealousy wrong doing things of satan things of the world those things are burnable when the fire of god comes in they burn they they don't exist and that's what we want is those things to burn and for our faith this is why corinthians it says for other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid which is jesus christ talking about the foundation of a believer is christ coming into them right and that's that's that's like an unburnable substance that's god himself now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones so you can you can build the things of god and you could encourage a believer to to to do right to do the right thing and to and the genuine word of god and build the house by the word of god and that you could do that or you could just encourage them to do something that's not that because it says you can build on that precious stones wood hay or stubble another substance that's not that and he says every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire meaning one day this fire of god is going to burn that person and all that work and to see which stuff who sowed into his life you guys all did okay let's see which one which of you people sowed the true word of god the things of god that are going to stay and which ones have you sowed this nonsense on their life that's going to be gone once i put this fire on it and it gets burnt you know and if you wasted your time with people in building this other nonsense in their life and encourage them to do certain things that's just of the world and no substance there's a time where that's going to be gone it'll be gone and you'll be like you know and it says here that you'll still be saved you know because you're going to look at your work and think well that was a complete waste of time wasn't it all that work i did look it's all gone because it wasn't a true it wasn't god's substance it was just the man-made it was you know so we and that's what this here is you know you put a fire on this i tell you one pile is going to stay one pile is going to go so so when you're sowing into people's lives when you're building the work of god make sure you're building the right thing because you can easily we can easily and even in our own lives we can easily let this stubble this stuff be built up that's why god says i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that you might be rich because in this age we're chasing after natural things god's saying that's all just going to burn my fire will come and burn that naturally and spiritually that naturally it's going to burn and spiritually that desire that wants that is going to burn too that's that's of no substance either so naturally and spiritually a natural fire is going to burn on this and a spiritual fire is going to burn if that was your desire it's going to burn that too but he's saying buy of me gold tried in the fire real substance the the unadulterated word of god get have that in your life you know come and get that from me that's what matters and because that fire is going to burn everything you know this could just be the gospel according to isaac and this is just in fellowship you know but we when you think of the fires of hell you think that's a bad fire but you know i often think based on that more than likely that fire of that that the fire there is probably more than likely the fire of god it's because it's going to burn up there's a certain point where see natural fire can destroy natural things i think the spiritual fire can destroy spiritual things right so that this this same spiritual fire that burns in our heart and that burns out the the the unbelief and out of our life is the same fire that's going to burn the source of all unbelief and all sin and everything that's there it's going to burn all that because it's all carbon it's all um hydrocarbon sitting in there it's not gold that can stay it will all actually it's all going to burn and i believe that the that when i look at it that fire of god is that's what's going to burn all that eventually it will become no more that this fire of god is going to burn all that stuff just like it's going to burn all this world naturally i want to just do this and i've got two more thoughts for you this morning this is a i want to talk about the fire of god setting us free but i want to you know we often like who likes freedom freedoms good day you know i often think you know there's no real such thing as freedom in it and if you just put the word like i'm free well there are there is but you say what are you talking about well when you talk about the word free you have to be associated with free from something like you say if brother ed says i'm free say i'm free i'm free hey praise the see because it has to be in relation to something you cannot just be free it's like okay what are you free from oh well i'm free from this oh i see that's you know you can't just exist in freedom on its own it has to be from something that's why that's why you've got two sides of the story of this perceived freedom like someone would say oh i'm sick of being having to be dragged along to church and do the things of god and that i want to be free from that so then they go into the world and and they say now i'm free well you're free from that right that's what you're saying in fact now you're in bondage to something else because everyone is everybody is in bondage to something right there's no such thing as freedom in that sense we're all in bondage of something so we we're free from that chain me up to you right now that's why paul says i'm free in christ so he now says i don't want the things of the world i'm free over here and the lord says and he he's now a prisoner of christ right chained up to here see so there's no real freedom it's just i'm it just depends on the revelation god's given you i'd rather be free from sin and a prisoner to christ then free from christ than a prisoner to death you know and and that's what this picture here i'm gonna if i could if i could in my mind just put an image to it you know no one's really free right let's get that idea out of our mind no one's we're a prisoner to somebody you know that's like this brother brandon had those t-shirts i'm a fool for christ he saw that slogan i'm a fool for christ who's full of you because we're all somebody's full we're we're a prisoner to somebody and this essentially is how is how it is in each one of our lives you know this one on and but you know when we talk about the fire of god if i could analyze it and sort of put it in a visual context you know you know we talked about breaking the chains but you know it's not really the chain these chains that hold us are powerful things i don't know give too much credit but chains i don't think humans can break these chains like that the chains of the power of god and the chains of the power of satan are very powerful they're hard you know this is just an analogy right to break it's not the chains that break it's almost like like when satan puts something on us like his wrong idea it's like it's like we take it and it gets fixed onto us you know and then his chain has got a little special you know you have couplings and like this certain like a vehicle's got a tow ball and then this here we'll hook on to that you know and it's compatible sometimes when you get the wrong size toe ball you go to put a toe ball on there it's like oh that that that's different than that so i won't hook on but you know satan satan puts what he does he puts his he puts his lies on you puts this thing he says he take this and it hooks on you and then he chains on to that and that's what holds you is that he's got an anchor point in your life you know and the more you accept all of his ways he just gives you more and because you take this you take it hooks on that which you end up like this you end up with all these anchors on you and you're chained you know now good luck trying to break those chains they're powerful you know but that's not really what i'll just keep going on but this one here right i put this one here and as well because you know to visualize what happens when sometimes people cannot have a not have been moved by the power of god not have a real experience with god but still try to go to church essentially just end up like this where you've got these chains that like you're you think i should really go to church because i should be a good person and i should do that you know that that's what that is i'm you know or i shouldn't sin because that would be wrong so but it's a natural you know because there is a natural we can naturally be good you know like not not everyone that like you understand this is what brother brown talks about you know can have just as enough christianity to make you miserable right because you kind of you're sort of being pulled this way pulled that way but you've you know it's all just making this is a miserable state because you know you kind of it's it's this is a you can be a man-made christian quite easily you know i should really not do those bad things you know but it's a it's that's that can also be just another anchor and then you've got one this way and you're before you know you're the most miserable person out you know either be god says be hot or cold you know don't live in this state if you're gonna sin go that way you're gonna serve god let the fire god come in and go the other way you know but if i could put it like this too this is the way that i look at predestination you know like there's a there's a there's something in us that's the anchor point that that's held by the the chain of god that you know this is a predestinated son or daughter of god that it doesn't matter how many chains and hooks and everything the devil can have on you you can never ever be lost there's always that one chain that's eventually that's never ever going to break that's how many of you have experienced that in your life you know you you go and you you there's just something holding you when it looks like you look you see something you think man there's no hope for that person but you know if there's this here there's there's no hope for satan you know there will never be but you know this is what i want to type about the fire of god what happens in our life is is because everything of satan is temporal right it's able to be burned so if we if we get this situation here where where god is you know when the fire of gold comes into us it just it just burns out all those the lies from satan all those little anchors that he has because it's and and then the chains no longer have any effect right because it it we just get in the presence of god we don't have to try and work it out but those those things just get burnt out and that's we we then we then call ourselves you know i'm free but we're free because that thing used to hold me it's all being burnt away the chain's gone i'm i'm now i'm free from that you know and it's a real simple process there's no scientific uh answer to it you just get in the presence of god and all these things of satan just get burned away that's how the gospel works it's a supernatural occurrence you don't have to do these 10 steps to figure it all out just stay in the presence of god and this is what happens in your life if you're just new serving the lord just stand as presence all of these anchor points all of the stuff will just get burnt those chains satan will go to pull it and the whole thing will break apart because it's the anchor point's gone that's this is it's a very simple simple gospel we just let the power of god and i often look at it like this like you know we can either get tried by fire now because that's what this is we get tried by fire when we go to cross over from here to eternity it's like we have to pass through this fire you know we pass through the fire and you know it's like we swing on the on the in the crevice of eternity you know now if you've got that that if you if you've got the anchor of god on you you're going to just swing over and get to the other side you know but people if you don't have that and you go to swing over that what's going to happen to all your the the couplings you're just going to break you're going to you're done see so that's why we get we get what we're hooking on to now is going to take us from this world to the next because when we pass through that fire which everybody has to pass through that fire we're going to go through to the other side if you if you're like this you're going to swing through right because when that passes through that fire it's already been through the fire you know you're gonna make it through but if you're like that you swing through the fire like that all those the fire of god's gonna it's either gonna burn it now or then you get two options you wanna burn now burn it later on we all we are all going to pass through the fire one day and this is what i want to be when i go to pass through that fire because i know these anchor points are going to hold it's going to it's going to take me through things of the world all this natural stuff things have satan they're all just going to burn away it's not going to hold the last thought that i've got and this is kind of what i wanted to point out to us is a world that's on fire and this is this is an important point to just see the the magnitude of the the amount that the world is on fire you know and and this is a real thing this is not so we've got two fires you know i think there's two massive fires burning now there's the fire of god which we're talking about you know that's burning in brother anias's heart and this then there's this fire of lust there's this fire that's burning in the world i want to talk first about the fire of lust because this is a this is a massive thing that's happening that an actual thing that's happening let me talk first about this scripture here the bible says there are three things that are never satisfied never quenched uh one or four sorry four things that are never never quenched the grave the baron worm the earth that is not filled with water and the fire that say i thought it is enough like a fire if you put a piece of wood on a fire that won't say oh you know what i've done enough burning for the day i'll just leave that till tomorrow no it's never quenched never you put on it's going to burn it the more you put on it the more it's going to burn it will just keep burning it it never never stops it never says oh that's enough i've had enough burning for one day you give it water it's going to burn it never is satisfied never ever ever that's the and that's what solomon says the this is what fire is like you know now keep that thought in mind that this thing is never ever quenched this fire is never never quenched now the original sin that was in the garden of eden was a perversion we know that's what it was you know so as a result the the you know because they they it was a sexual act and as a result what we're going to have now that the fruit of this original seed that sin that we're in is going to have we're going to have a massive harvest now to that right that's just the way that on the laws of sowing and reaping we sow that we're going to reap that at the end massively when the bible talks about this thing of this perversion and that when it talks about it always refers to it as a fire he says can a man take a fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burned can one go upon hot coals and his feet not be burned so he that goes to his neighbor's wife whosoever touches her shall not be innocent it's always relating this thing to fire because there's there's this there's this passion this fire that's just and i'll show you that it's just burning out of control amongst this fire of perversion is has swept the world the whole world is on fire with it it's just burning the world up like you wouldn't believe like never ever before have we had such a fire of this perversion in the history of mankind every time it happened god would destroy that little place like like we talk about sodom and gomorrah that was what was happening there was this fire of perversion was burning there that the that you gotta the the your answer fire with fire you know that it's like god sort of judges it with the same thing that it is you know so because that was fire of perversion burning god just burned it with fire but any time it gets to that point god stops it and this is this one here and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of women burned in their lust one toward another it always refers to it as a burning men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving them to unto themselves the recompense and error which was met now the reason why i say why this why are related to burning is because it's something that if you let it burn out of control it just keeps burning this this whole perversion this desire thing it it just burns it doesn't say oh and i've had enough it'll that's why it's so popular why it sells because it's just burning it just you know you could put a whole lot of fuel on it one day you think oh that should be enough for the day the next day you can throw a whole lot more fuel on it and we'll burn it all again that's why they say i don't like using the whip that's why they say sex cells because it just burns the next day burn burn and ever it's just burns burns it doesn't have an end to how much it burns you understand it just it will just stop then and the bible explicitly talks now this is not just about what people do this is about what people look at all the pornography all that sort of stuff it's just a it's a flaming inferno in the world flee fornication every sin that man does without the body but he that committed his fornication sinners against his own body there's mankind just got this damnation against themselves you know like not everyone is a thief not everyone is a murderer but you'll find the majority of the unbelievers almost everyone that's not filled with the fire of god are filled with this fire in them now everybody the world is on fire whether you're going to either begin to be on fire with the fire of god or with this fire of lust and this fire of perversion it's just burnt the whole world up you're going to spend time with people they'll just commit you that it's just it's just this is why i want to this is my analogy of it like now god knew that's what god knew he was dealing with fire you know with adam and eve when he did what they were did he's like i'm now dealing with fire here this thing is fire so he had specific guidelines of this is how you can this is how you can control this fire this way you said you can have a man and a woman with anyone else you get together you'll be married and that's you you contain it and then that's that's that's how you do and i'm going to liken that to a fireplace like this you know it's a it's it's a dangerous apparatus a fireplace but if you have it within this means you can put a fire in there you can burn it and it's going to work for you right you can contain this fire it's in it and it will do all right i'm going to liken that that's like god how he said this is how you control it he knew it was fire so he said this is how you do it you control it this way if you open that door of the fire and let the embers go on the ground and let it go what will that fire do it looks all nice and cuddly and warm we'll look at that nice fire sparks you know a little sound of the kindling crackling you open the door and let some of the embers go on the ground what's going to happen that fire is going to burn your house down it's a lethal evil this hair is lethal and it has no mercy a fire won't just stop if it's dry i'm going to burn it ain't going to stop it's going to burn the house down and let me tell you this like in this day and age because people haven't done this the world is on fire they've just let the fire go everywhere it's burnt down household spiritually speaking mentally marriages everyone's perverted this it's just this raging fire has just burnt the whole world the world is if you looked at the world it's on fire with this thing it's it's literally burning on fire i don't like to read this stuff but this is what jordan peterson put in a simple way when you think of the magnitude and he couldn't perceive it but he's it's now possible for young men to see more naked women in one day than any man in history had ever seen that's not something that's not nothing that's something so he's breaking down saying this is where we're at it's now possible it's it's now we've never been here he's saying that society has never been in this predicament but what he's what he's looking at is he's saying everyone is on fire this whole thing is on fire the world if you looked at the world like this it's just burning this is why we're going to have a fiery judgment on this earth because fire is going to meet fire this is this is actually the main like the internet searches i think 20 percent of people's phones are for this perversion you're telling me that that the world consists of 20 of this there's so many other things you could research pianos cars whatever whatever 20 is this nonsense and you realize how many tera gigabytes quadrille bytes of the stuff there is and it's just about 30 of what's all online you if you put all the information in and you stacked it in photos it would fill a hole it would fill cities with photos and garbage and what the stuff is out there it's a raging inferno this is where we're at this is the and that's why the bible says flee it young men young woman flee it just flee it and but you know we've got we in this age we've got a we've got a combat you know you don't need to focus on the negative we've got a fire of god we've got a fire of god that can burn in our heart that it just burns that desire out you the more you desire the fire of god the more you let that burn in your life that doesn't that fire's no longer attractive you know you just you just want the fire of god and it it burns out the other stuff you want to overcome you just get more of the fire of god in you and amen and i want to tell you this in this day and age the world everybody's going to be on fire you're going to be on fire with one or the other that's it you're going to you're either going to be on fire with the fire of god you're going to be on fire with this fire of lust and fire of all this other perversion there's only there's going to be two fires burning in this last day and this is where we're at and that's why i say we'll be on fire i'm glad that as believers we can be on fire that god god came down that's why god came down as a fire to show i'm actually a fire too you think that's why look at this fire that's a real fire it burns out the dross and it it makes you warm with the holy ghost makes you happy it just keeps you alive that's the that's the real fire that we want and when you think about it the whole the whole everything all ends up to be in fire the whole this whole everything like this world here you got this raging inferno of fire of this perversion and that it's all going to be done away with fire you know but brother brown said that fire is just going to consume the whole lot every molecule everything's going to be gone this new heaven new earth is gonna be because the old one's just been burnt to smithereens this world's gonna end in fire you know when you go in in the in the the the lake of fire that's gonna end up in fire there's this fire of god is just gonna burn the whole lot all this unbelief all the sin all the stuff but that's that whole thing is going to burn the place where we go is going to be a place of fire you know it's just going to be but we're not going to we're not going to burn up because we're the only thing that can dwell there is that the things of god that can dwell in that presence of fire because god's still a consuming fire so it's going to be a place of this fire of god and that's why there's going to be so much love and that it's just just going to be burning everything's going to end up in fire that's that's the way it's all going to be and i'm glad that instead of being in the the lake of fire and this other you know where we where we get we disintegrate that well i'm glad that we can withstand this fire of god and just be in his presence this this pillar of fire is going to be you know the on the the great pyramid it said the the light was the lamb was the light there of you know if you get a light on top of a pyramid it just this this great light the fire of god just lights up the whole thing and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea brethren the more fire of god we get in our life the happier we are and and this is an actual this is an actual thing you know it's not just so we did we talk about it no you know it's a good story you get amongst believers you talk you get the presence of god coming there's actual fire the actual fire of god on the day of pentecost they just happened to see it you know this that's all these are is one day god just decided to come out from this pillar of fire be here now right here now he said where two or three gathered together and mine and there are months the pillar of fire is here now it's just now and then god just decided i'll just i'll just cross over to another dimension so you can just see me for a bit then i'll walk back but by faith he's here there's a fire if you're a believer that's what that's what we have we have the fire of god with us all the time and i believe god did this just to show us hey forget about all the other fire there's my fire it's going to be i'm going to be with you amen i've got a song i want to sing i want to sing two songs actually and then i'll hand over to um brother anya so i want to sing a slow song and i
