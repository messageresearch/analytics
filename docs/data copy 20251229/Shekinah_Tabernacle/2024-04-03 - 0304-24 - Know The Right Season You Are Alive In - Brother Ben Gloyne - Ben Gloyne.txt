last Wednesday was a prayer meeting so we're just going to have regular service tonight but uh so we got uh let's go to First John 3 and verse one sorry I don't have a slideshow tonight um but yes so we're going to do a go go a bit old school amen so 1 John 3 And1 say Amen when you're there amen great to have the noes here God bless bless you amen praise the Lord you know we had a tremendous time over Easter but I'm so thankful that that same presence goes with us as we go into our everyday life and you know like Jesus you know he was with uh you know Peter James and John up Mount Transfiguration they had a glorious time and they went down the bottom of the mountain they found problems and troubles and all these things but the experience they had in on top of the mountain took them through the valleys amen so amen so 1 John 3:1 says behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of God and it do not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is I like that now we are the sons of God now not tomorrow now praise the Lord let's bow our heads in a word of prayer tonight amen gracious Heavenly Father truly you are great Lord you the Lord You're the Lord God Almighty Lord there's never been a time that you have failed Lord to prove that you are the same yesterday today and forever there's never a time you are not the almighty so we're so thankful we can bow our heads in your presence and give you glory Lord we're so thankful we can gather in the middle of the week and come into your presence we pray dear God you're an anoint speaker and hearer one more time may you have your way dear God May May the Troubles of life just vanish Lord as we come into your presence and may you be glorified in our midst we so thankful we can be called the children of God the Most High We Praise Your Name Lord we love you so much we ask You' be with us and touch each one who's not well Lord those who are streaming Lord may you be the app portion and may just have your way in our lives Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can you can have your seats tonight so I just want to take a bit of a uh a bit of a uh um subject about you know you got to know the right season that you're alive in and um you know we we live in the most tremendous time that there ever has been in the history of man because there's a people upon the Earth that that that walk with God and shall we not cuz God's going to take them I mean so the same God that that called you that saved you that redeemed you that shed his blood for you is walking with you and he's going to take you one day so it's a glorious time to be alive amen now but it's amazing that you know God is you know um you look through the Bible it's whenever Trouble Comes God comes on the scene it's incredible where God would you know it's amazing when you know like the three Hebrew children in the fiery furnace that we've you know many of us have looked into it was the Fourth Man stepped into the fire when they were in the fire wasn't when they were Outside the Fire wasn't when they were in Jerusalem Before They carried away but God proved himself to them in the fire you you take you know you take Moses and his troubles and Joshua and all different ones down through the Bible take Jesus when he he would prove his great Supreme Being the Supreme deity raising the dead Healing The Sick doing all these things it's when trouble came into life and and and that's what God wants to show us is he wants to take us from from from leaning on the five senses of Faith uh sorry not Faith see taste smell hear you all those things he wants to take those things that we don't lean on those things anymore we don't lean on our imagination our reason our conscious our affections our our memory all those things but we lean on faith alone that's why God wants to prove himself in times of trouble and he does prove himself there you see our God loves to keep his word brother Braham says in Christ is he identified the same in all generations he said but he did it that it might be f fulfilled he has to keep his word and he loves to do it and he will do it because he's God and I pray tonight that he'll keep this word also that's promised for this hour amen and yeah I believe he he will keep his word promised for this hour it's impossible for him not to keep it because he's kept his word down through every generation now he loves to prove his word yes our God loves to prove himself amen he never backs up from a battle he never backs up from a trial he never says no I I'm tagging out you tag in and tell me how it goes no he loves to prove himself in the face of the devil amen he loves to prove himself in times of trouble amen and so you know he loves to prove I'm just going to read a couple of quotes here and proving his word he says what would he do he was proving his word proving his position proving that he was God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and God is the word am mean he calmed this the wind and the waves to prove Isaiah's prophecy he shall be called The Mighty God the Everlasting father see he also M multiplied the bread and Fishes this virgin born son what was it to prove the word all scripture has to be fulfilled he proved the word by saying he was Jehovah made manifest he was the beginning of the creation of God beginning of the creation of God God in creation God made a little part of the creation here that God was living in himself he was the beginning of that creation of God for he for for him begat many sons not he also multiplied the fishes he is the word and the proof of the word now we know that we are his children we're made of the same material we're not made of different material now I'm not talking about your flesh not talking about your mind how smart you are talking about that Gene seed of God placed God placed in you that Soul amen the ability to take God at his word and believe it amen because as God believed his own word and it came into pass so he put something within us to believe his word that he would fulfill it in our lives and that's an incredible thing am mean in this age of skepticism and and and factchecking and all these things on the internet of false news and fake news and and you know deep fakes and fake voices fake video all these things there's a people on the Earth that can take God at his word amen amen and so I believe I'm looking at those people tonight amen that you know in spite of trouble circumstances what's going on we can believe his word yes sir and we hold on to it above all things now as I said in the beginning I want to talk about knowing you know it's essential to know the right season now we're living in the season of The Rapture this is not news to any one of us but you know I just pray that we'll just be encouraged tonight amen because we're living in the age of the Resurrection we're living in the time of the Resurrection this is Resurrection season now you can know the natural you know Seasons By really what it boils down to is the amount of sunshine because the amount of sunshine that's that's that that's that that's upon any place of the earth will will produce an atmosphere right so we know summer because there long days lots of sunshine we know winter because it's short days and where' the sun go cuz it's winter time you take you know like even like Alaska places where there's very short growing seasons for most of the Year short days not much Sunshine everything's covered in snow you know it's doesn't look like much is going on but there's seeds under the ground but then now when when when when spring comes and the days get very long they may have a short growing season but it's very powerful growing season why CU summer the sunshine is is is pouring out in its strength to bring forth what's in the seed and it's the same thing today you know friends we're not living in a winter spiritually you know you may feel like you're going through a winter but but we're not in a winter time am mean we're living in a summertime we're living in a Harvest Time am mean we're living in the time when there is much light am mean this is not a short you know a short daytime a lot of night time no we're living in the time when the sunlight of God is shining in his strength what is that to to bring forth you and I into the image of God Amen now see it's the but you see whenever there's a harvest time you know there's a lot of sunshine in a harvest time and it's amazing how many victories how many battles how many troubles happened during a harvest time so for example Joshua crossed the Jordan River went into the promised land uh during the time of harvest because it says in Joshua 3:15 says and as they bear the ark that came unto Jordan the feet of the priest that bear the ark were dipped into the brim of the water for Jordan overfloweth all his Banks all the time of harvest so they came into their inheritance in Harvest time they had a lot of battles but they were coming into the promise amen just like we are coming into every Divine promise of God what we are living in a harvest we are the Harvest amen we are the Harvest am mean we are God God's Harvest amen and same thing with Gideon Gideon was threshing Wheat by The Wine Press why was he doing that he was you thresh wheat during a harvest season and that's when God you know the angel of the Lord came down and and and said go on thy might thy Mighty Man of Valor here's a man hiding afraid hiding from his enemies all these things but God looked at him and said you're not a coward Gideon you're a mighty man of Val as the same thing with you and I friends we're not cowards amen amen no no we're mighty men and women of Valor amen who take God at his word she was threshing wheat during a harvest season but there's a great battle Ruth came into the promised land in the beginning of the barley Harvest I means all these things would happen during a harvest time now even even shamgar we need um slay 600 Philistines we know the Bible doesn't say it but brother Bram would dramatize it it's after shamgar got his harvest in then the 600 Philistines came to take the Harvest away so shamgar had a mighty victory in Harvest time he realized who he was in Harvest time I mean brother said that you know he already was a circumcised son of Abraham living in his inheritance nothing changed he only realized who he was so his attitude towards what God had made him changed amen and I believe that's the same thing with you and I when we can really see we're Sons and Daughters of the most high God God has made us thus we have not made ourselves this way I mean I believe we'll walk different act different talk different we'll we'll talk Victory I mean our language will be Victory Amen in spite of trouble what's going on we'll talk Victory yes sir amen not a negative confession a positive confession sure the You Know The Enemy may may be swallowing up the land but God is with us amen and if God is for who can be against us that's right amen but you see now during these times like brother BR would speak I know they speak about Harvest but you know the the the evolution of of of of Technology brother Braham says show something in the spiritual because I want to tell you who you are tonight you're an astronaut you're God's spiritual astronaut amen where you can live in a sphere of faith of only belief amen this is who you are amen so so he said you know there was there was there was an evolution of Transport where where it was once the horse and buggy and you know horses and that was for a very long time but then there came the automobile And Then There came the airplane and then now we're in space and he says it was the same thing you know with with under Luther it was the horse and Buggies that was you know one horse is one horsepower we know that ain't so if you had two horses you had two horsepower you had twice as much power but then but then then there came Wesley you know it was it it was more than a horse and buggy era it was you could say an as an evolution showing in technology is now the motorc car age and you know the fastest well this is the fastest electric car sorry I know it's not a real car but hey it's still a it's got four wheels amen it's the taian turbo GT I think it's a Porsche it has 1,93 horsepower that's a lot faster than one hor or two horsepower 1,093 and you think man I can drive pretty good with a over 1,000 horsepower But Then There came the restoration of the gifts where brother BR said men got off the ground they were flying around like like the right brothers or the brother who was down in you the man who was down in what South Island flew over hedge apparently the first man to fly but it wasn't verified all these things and you know now the Boeing 747 it boasts a total Cruise power of basically 60,000 horsepower that's a lot of horsepower right but you see that is nothing compared to the Space Shuttle NASA would boast that their space shuttle when it takes off it has 12 million horsepower see you later B 747 you see 12 million horsepower now brother B said now we are spiritual astronauts so you say so you take the power that's in a horse you multiply it by 12 million you got the power that it takes that's requ Reed for a person to leave this world's atmosphere to defy gravity and go into another world that we cannot see from here I'm talking about you can't see what it's like in space like being in space being on the earth you know what I mean you got to go and look at what does it look like from the space station looks totally different than it does here right so it takes 12 million horsepower to leave Earth's gravitation now brother Bram says that we Are Spiritual astronauts right so the power that was in a horse you times it by 12 million You've Got The Power of a you've got the power of the Space Shuttle now this is far greater the power of the Space Shuttle is far greater than than a horse and buggy a b 747 or or electric Supercar right but there's a big difference now because remember he wants us to live in a realm of only belief he wants us to take God he wants us to take him totally just at his word not at what we think not at what we see taste feel smell hear imagine reason out he doesn't want us to live by those things he wants to live us take us from the five senses into a realm of faith and that's why God comes in trouble to prove himself cuz he wants to show you you have made a material that will take God at his word in spite of what your eyes tell you your hearing tells you your emotions tell you your reasoning tells you your conscience tells you you live in a realm you're built of a material that will take God at his word in spite of everything if everything is contrary to that word you've been made to take God just at his word amen praise God Amen Enoch took God at his word and he walked with God was not cuz God took him amen Noah took God at his word built the ark sa you know saved his house you know Moses took God at his word I mean went down to Egypt delivered the people Joshua took God at his word took the people into the promised land Elijah took God at his word amen and rebuilt the altar of the Lord the fire of God came down you know elishah took God at his word and wanted to follow Elijah and the mantle that was on Elijah came on Elisha you know all these ones took God at his word the disciples took God at his word John the Baptist took God at his word we're no different friends amen God has made I see I want you to see see remember end time evangelism brother bam says is Malachi 4 the restoration back to the original Faith amen that is what M time evangelism is amen that's what the message has come to produce to return us back to the faith of the fathers where they just took God at his word amen amen so there's a big difference now now if you look at the if you look at the um you know the awesome buggy the car and the plane and and the space shutle there's a big difference in in those things now you have to physically drive a horse unless you know you've got to have the rains in your hand right right if you're flying a plane you there's times when you have autopilot on but you've got to drive the thing even even even cars that bow self-driving capability there's a time when you've got to drive it right you need to drive it this the astronauts that get into the space shuttle they don't drive it there is no human they are not there's not there they they don't drive what do they do they get on their astronaut suit amen amen and they walk into the space shuttle and they sit down and they put on their safety seat seat belt and they wait praise the Lord and then what happens it's Mission Control drives a space shuttle they cannot drive it themselves they will crash they'll because the way they have to go through the Earth's atmosphere is to be at a particular trajectory right it's yeah it's got to be a particular direction and it's the same thing with you and I it's when we give ourselves to the Lord and he takes over right that's the big thing many people say I've got to get the Holy Ghost no the Holy Ghost has got to get you and I it's when we quit we give up say Lord take my life that's when he takes you over amen so so it's a big difference a pilot can fly a plane but you don't fly a space shuttle amen I'm talking about leaving this Earth's atmosphere it's ground it's Mission Control that does the countdown it's not the astronaut says okay we're going to fly today no there's a whole bunch of studying of the weather the atmosphere's got to be just right how many times you heard of a launch be canceled there's too much Cloud there's Crosswinds there's there's winds right up in the atmosphere you can't see or feel but it's up there and they say we cannot launch today right so the atmosphere is going to be just right friends and I'll just tell you something I'm not a weather man but I got a different kind of a weather a weather pattern I'm looking at amen and God's word is saying the atmosphere is good amen for a launch amen we're living in the end of the seventh Church age where the Rapture is going to take place the weather's real good amen amen and you may not realize it but you're strapped into a rocket ship amen amen you're strapped in in spite of you see the astr could be sitting there and he could have trouble and think about what's going to happen when he's going on the mission and what's going to happen when he gets back home and what just happened this morning and there can be all kinds of things going on emotionally in him but he's strapped in the astronut you he's strapped in the space shuttle see it's not our feelings that get us wrapped ready it's the word of God Amen cuz remember now Rocket Fuel cometh by hearing I mean no faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God see and that's why we get filled up with the word and the goodness of God God's pouring in Rocket Fuel am mean he's pouring in amen the the the the power to make us leave this world yes sir Hallelujah see it's not the astronaut no it's not human ambition that drives the space Shadle of the pilot no it is the ambition of mission control and we have a mission control it's not in Houston it's not in Mah here it's in glory amen that's our mission control and so he is he has placed Us by his word into his space shuttle because remember people are trying to get to Mars they want to live on a new world and that's only reflecting there's a people getting ready to leave this world and go not live on Mars thank God Amen but to go live in glory amen cuz why the natural types the spiritual Hallelujah so everyone's trying to get to the moon amen they want to get off the Earth to go to the Moon brother Ram says don't you see the spiritual application the spiritual astronaut got into Jesus listening to the countdown of the word of God and fixing to take off to Heaven Hallelujah that's you and I now if you look at if you look at you know you can wear the same clothes to ride a horse and buggy to drive a car or fly an airplane you can wear the same clothes I could do all three if I knew how to fly a well you I've been on a horse once but as was a horse track I think horse was driving me but you but you know I can ride a horse like this I can drive a car like this and I like well I probably crash a plane but you know I can still try and drive the plane you know but I need a space suit I need a different kind of a suit to go up into orbit amen I can't go with natural man you know for this atmosphere cuz we live in a different atmosphere an astronaut works and lives and dwells in a different atmosphere than an Earthbound atmosphere amen there's a different you know it's it's a totally different world World up there it is here and a world of faith is totally different to a natural man I mean because a natural man just looks at symptoms signs troubles and all these things but an astronaut or a spiritual astronaut sure those things are there we don't walk around like this in our hands like this and you know we don't walk around that sure we see all those things but Faith overrides them amen like Abraham he felt like he couldn't have a child he saw with his eyes if he had a mirror him old Sarah old you know their speech how they were the aches and pains all these things his five senses his his emotional real everything declared he could not have the child but faith overrode those things because it was a revelation he says Isaac's on his way amen it's the same thing with you and I we are built differently we've got you you know you're wearing an astronaut suit not like NASA builts but this is the best one this one's made to change dimensions in amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen is the astronaut suit Hallelujah that that that that the Lord has actually dressed Us in amen I trust everyone's worth me don't be nervous we'll be over soon amen but you see now you know we are We Are Spiritual um astronauts yes sir Hallelujah because if you got to see if your life is Lord I don't want my ambition I want his ambition I don't want my will I want his will I don't want to be glorified I don't care about me I want him to be glorified I want him to be made know I want him to be exalted in my life that's a good sign you're an astronaut hallelujah amen because there's a lot of you know that's a good sign you're an astronaut why cuz you're surrendered to Mission Control because Mission Control says astronauts you've got to get in the ship now they get in they sit in they're already amen and what do they do they hear sermon after sermon they're in meeting after meeting what's happening there's a there's a pipe being plugged into them cuz God's got some tanks hallel God's got some booster rocket tanks amen that are strapped to your suit strapped to you amen you don't feel them because hey Faith is light faith is not Grievous Faith doesn't wear you down Faith builds you up I mean the word of God preaching Faith doesn't make you worry it doesn't make you feel double-minded doesn't make you feel troubled it makes you feel empowered it makes you feel stable it makes you give you Vision see where you're going it gives you confidence it renews your strength amen that's what faith does so so so these tanks we carry are not heavy amen they're light amen and what is God God is filling up those tanks amen you open your Bible what's happening he's putting in the fuel line amen glug glug glug glug it's going up to full full and God knows and then but there's a lot of gauges that you know they check they're not just checking the atmosphere they're checking the whole thing I don't know how many senses I didn't Google it but there'd be probably a good maybe exaggeration but at least a million censes on a space shuttle cuz it cannot disintegrate when it flies amen so there' be a lot of test pre-flight tests they do you know I've seen I've sat there with brother Tony Murray in the um cockpit of a little plane that goes from well Nelson to here a little little thing and they're doing all these pre-flight checks they go through times that by a whole bunch and you've got a space shuttle there's all these pre-flight checks and that's why you know that's why God inspires Ministry to preach on love your neighbor don't hold grudges that Grudge T tank needs to be removed you can't have any grudges that's got to be taken out cuz that will hold you down you won't be able to fly with a grudge all the unbelief is burnt out by the Holy Ghost because unbelief tank we're we're taking because we have a lot of Earthbound things that Hold Us Down naturally that we're born with but God does a restoration not a Reformation a restoring of who we TR truly should be so The Grudges go the you know the unbelief tank goes the worry goes sometimes it takes a while to drain but it's going yeah amen you can look back maybe maybe you worried a lot a few years ago but now you're like hey praise God and people think you're blaz no you're not blaz you just trust in God more what's happening that worry tank is going away amen all the Fring and the stress and all those things anxiety goes why God is emptying you of those and pouring in faith hallel pouring in pouring in his word amen pouring in confidence Hallelujah that's what he's doing what is he doing he's getting you ready for a flight Hallelujah and it doesn't matter what the you know the devil's atmosphere he tries to put over you to stop you taking that potential flight the devil will never do it that's right brother Bram says in Christ your mystery of God revealed he says she won't be closed up speaking about the bride she'll be taken up amen so we won't she won't be closed up she'll be taken up amen so things may start looking bad and dark I don't know but we won't be closed up we'll be taken up hallelujah hallelujah so it doesn't matter what the devil tries to do now we can walk in confidence amen amen now so this is why it's so important we let God fill us with his word his tanks canot overflow you know get too full amen What's Your Capacity just enjoy them more amen and it's not in vain do you think every every ounce of the fuel because they calculate how much fuel they need on those on those space shuttles and they tailor it in Things based on the cargo capacity and whatever they're taking up into the space and so on all those things are worked out so every ounce or whatever fuel that they put in it's for a purpose it's not in vain so we hear the word you think maybe it's just Wednesday after Wednesday Sunday after Sunday God's working God's filling you up amen God's getting you ready and you've got the already amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost is there to ignite it amen so the so the fuel's getting filled up you're sitting in the tube I trust you're sitting in the tube and you're ready to go who who's like that who's like that now we have been proved to us over and over again the power of God brother BR says in the unfailing realities of the Living God because we got to realize that we can read through the Bible we can hear testimonies and and and what it really is to me is it's the proof of Rocket Fuel hallelu not just Enoch going in a Rapture not just Elijah going in a Rapture but everyday Believers down Through the Ages them living the life expressing the words for their age and whatever part of the body they meant to be and that's Rocket Fuel being tested I mean that and not just talked about you know I do I do environmental testing at my work and we'll look at different compositions of different uh milk powder and just just different things I'm not talking about just looking at what it's made of of the word I'm talking about the proof of it living the ignition of a like brother B says in um um uh it is the rising of the sun he says you take two cars both just off the assembly line just both made exactly the same and they can have a tank full of gasoline but only one has a spark plug the one that doesn't have the spark plug ain't going nowhere it can talk about how great it is it can you know look at it look at my stats look what I can do look how fast I can run look how far I can travel but without that spark plug it's going to sit right there amen so so the one with the spark plug has the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's got the fire to make the gasoline operate the engine make it start going and we have evidence after evidence of the rocket fuel of God Amen igniting in people's lives taking people to promises taking people through overcome you know trouble and you know you know with overcoming power now brother Bram says this here in the unfailing realities of the Living God now the holy spirit will not behave itself in one person oh sorry the holy spirit will not misbehave itself in one person and behave itself in another it'll make each person come into its character now that doesn't mean we're all become quiet all become loud all become boisterous introverted extroverted no it'll make us come into its character what is the character of Christ believing his word taking God at his word amen Above All Things see because it's the spirit that leads you it brings it makes you subject to its nature you don't bring it subject to your nature it makes you subject to its nature amen and the Holy Spirit makes you live and love uh to do it oh how you love to give up the things of the world when the Holy Spirit comes in how it cleanses you washes you and puts a desire in you to follow him and a thirst and a Hunger for More of it just bathing yourself he brings realities now when God placed man here in the days of the Lord Jesus he gave him a true road map to his power a road map is something that tells you tells you which way you're headed if you want to go when you leave the next few days I've crossed this country so much my wife and I were amazed to think of it just PD me for the last few years I could mention to you where you want to go I mean you could mention where you want to go I could tell you any road that leads to it and within 15 minutes of time you'll arrive from here to California I haven't missed it a time uh in um I don't know sometimes right to the dots Z calculating my time of what the driving time is and the average of time I've been just back and forward up and down back and forward till you just know it that's the way God wants us to know his word we know it we've traveled it we've tested it we've tried it and you know where it leads to amen how how true is that for you and I amen we've walked up and down his word we've tested it we've tried it amen we tried does the baptism name of Lord Jesus Christ work yes it does does a true repentance work yes it does can we receive the Holy Ghost like that in the book of Acts yes we can and yes we have does healing work yes it does does Deliverance work yes it does Amen does prayer work absolutely amen amen does living a holy life work absolutely does overcoming power is it a real thing yes it is why because we have tested it we've walked up and down it we've tried it amen and that's why I say so what have we done we have tested and proven and shown that it's Rocket Fuel amen it's not just the Believers of the old times but today we have tested by God's grace and and actually he's proved it Rocket Fuel let's be honest it's not us testing it it's him testing proving it to you cuz he wants you to know he's the same yesterday today and forever he wants you to know that he's alive and well and he wants you and I to know amen that his word is forever true amen hallelujah amen now his road map is his Bible the Bible is the road map that leads to the power of God faith leads you to the power power produces the promise amen and he says we need power and I'll say we have power amen God has given us Power by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen by his presence living in you and I he has given us power to produce the promise not by our desire but by his desire not by our will but by his will praise the Lord hallelujah you see why he has made us to be spiritual Astron astronauts because he is conditioning us to live by faith alone that's what he wants us to do live by faith in his word alone he is preparing us praise God I'm so glad we're going forward aren't you we're not going backward we're not just going around a mountain aimlessly no we're walking into a greater walk with God we're walking into every promise amen you look at where you were and and and how much see God saved you what happened you walked into one promise that's a glorious promise Glory he took you out of Egypt it's a glorious promise you're baptized in his name that's another promise am mean he took you through a sanctification cleanse you and cleanse your spirit that's a great promise you cross Jordan death to sou you received the Holy Ghost that's a great promise he healed you that's another promise what is he doing he's leading you into all of his promises that's right amen isn't it a wonderful thing amen so how we know him now and how we used to know him we know him far greater now why cuz he's revealed himself more and more and that's why it's so important that we walk with God let him speak to us let him minister to us Amen Let Him reveal himself but you see he we have come to a place in our journey I believe that we're living by faith more than you realize brother Ram says in the church age book I don't have it here on me but he says you know we Marvel at the martyrs that gave their lives in the arena do we not and those who are tortured they suffered terrible things and we think how could we ever do that but he says we fail to realize the same Faith they had to overcome in their day is the same faith we have to overcome an everyday life am mean cuz remember we are we are anointed to overcome the challenge of our day our challenge is different to their challenge amen we're not being rounded up thrown to Arena and feed the Lions we're not tortured like that we're not you know but the same faith we have because what causes us to overcome the world our faith faith is the victory amen so so our everyday life we live we are overcoming amen praise the Lord to be a believer in Satan's Eden is a glorious thing it's a supernatural thing where you walk in a realm of faith and you're sure the World tries to grab you and try to get your attention but something in you says no I'll not bow amen that's right praise God I may wrestle I may fight but I'm not giving up I'm not quitting I'm walking on with God I will not let this world devour me I'm going to walk on its head I'm going to walk Victorious doesn't matter what's going on what what's happened that is Supernatural yes amen you're you're a supernatural thing sure was a supernatural thing for people to be murdered at all those things they are anointed to do it amen but we're under an eagle anointing the same holy GH in a different way they Anointed with an ox anointing they overcame Hallelujah I believe I you know I believe with all my heart there be such a there was such a joy in them cuz they realized what they're about to go through wasn't their end they were going to see him they're going to see the one that suffered and died for them just in a few minutes they're going to be in his presence amen and if we just keep that Joy before us couldn't be maybe it's not many days now these bodies will be changed Hallelujah we have a different kind of pressure than they did but how they overcame is the same way we overcome so don't diminish your Christian Walk Don't diminish your don't diminish what God has done in your life don't let the devil try and put you down saying you're nothing and you're a ladyo and you're not getting anywhere no we are the Overcomers of this age amen God has built you to be an overcomer just like astronauts they're selected not just anyone you know you can't just go what are you going to be when you grow up I'm going to be an astronaut many people say it but many are called you can say but few are right many try and join but there's only a few that actually get on I don't know how many astronauts lined up to be where Buzz Aldren and um thingy Armstrong was that landed on the moon I don't know how many men or women lined up to try and get that job two got it right and you think about it in the natural people have an ambition I want to become that but when we're born we have no ambition to serve God there's nothing within man that actually wants to be a spiritual at um astronaut the Bible says it right so it's not us enlisting saying I want to be that it's actually God comes down and says this is who you are I'm going to reveal who you really are amen and he reveals himself to you you give your life to him and what does he do he opens your eyes to see I'm a spiritual astronaut I'm ordained to sit in that Rapture chair Amen brother Braham says that when Elijah went up on that in that Chariot of fire he says every every Bush and tree had a had a chariot hitched but they've got your name on it hallelujah amen they've got your name on it so God has called you because he sees within you you're an astronaut amen but he wants us to leave the five senses behind and walk by faith just to take God at his word amen see but when the six sense comes in faith it denies all of those things what faith um see taste feel smile hear all those things and moves a person straight into the bosoms of God he that cometh to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him by Faith by faith Abraham by faith Isaac by faith Jacob all by faith it's the sixth s sent that does it Sixth Sense denies all symptom all symptoms anything contrary to God's word any feeling emotion somebody say oh well I was prayed for but I didn't feel any better Faith would never stand still for that the six sense would say it's a lie I feel better and I'm getting well if remember faith is a revelation if it's been revealed to you you can walk into that take everything else contrary to that if it's being revealed see it's the super sense it's the super above the senses it's a greater sense it's a faith it's a power that stirs and drives amen it's something that makes you do things that you never thought you would do it's the Sixth Sense the super sense that's why Revelation is more important you got re Revelation is more important than you realize that God himself has revealed himself personally to you that's a powerful thing you can't earn it you can't work it out you can't study enough you can't try and be humanly good enough God does it sovereignly amen so then well well then what's the point of trying the no if you believe that he is and he's a see he you must believe that he is and is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen so if so if you know he's real then you seek him you'll be rewarded for it you'll find him you'll get what you need amen I trust that came out okay see some people say there's no such thing you know an atheist Infidel was was challenging some people thisen the message of super sense and you know there's a you know there's an Infidel saying you there's no such thing as God it's all emotion and you know there you know it's just all nonsense and brother BR said there was a guy there and you know he was just eating an apple while this guy is pouring it into these Christians saying there's nothing to it this man's eating this apple and then and then he stops eating his apple and he ask the guy saying there's no such thing as God says what does my Apple taste like is it sweet or is it sour and the guy looks at him annoyed saying how do I know I'm not e the Apple the guy says I thought so just walks off why but same thing with God unless you taste and see that he is good amen then an argument will never stack up to a testimony see the man eating the Apple had tasted the see before he ever tasted it you could debate well it's a granny smith it must taste like this it's a br bur it must taste like this a whatever an eve apple or whatever Apple it must but when he tasted there's no more debate in his mind cuz he's tasted the apple he knows exactly what it's like and it's the same thing with the Lord once you taste and see that he is good amen amen that he is alive and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him all the debate has gone praise the Lord amen I'm so glad for that Hallelujah now he is as I said now and I'm just going to finish soon with this as I said that we are we are um dressed in a astronaut suit amen it is it is made to live in a different Realm okay now the believer is covered by the blood it that is the best armor that is the best protection that is the astronaut suit amen if you're covered in the blood you see an astronaut suit can go into a realm with these clothes well I just explode in in space I'm not pressurized in these clothes my eyeballs would explode I'd freeze I'd be gone but if I'm in an astronaut suit same man in a different suit I'll be fine in any condition on Mars I'll be fine on the moon I'll be fine and the rocket I'll be fine outside the rock it'll be fine even on the earth I'm fine in my suit amen it's the same thing being covered in the blood of Jesus Christ amen it doesn't matter what the devil tries to do doesn't matter how much he comes against you it doesn't matter how much trouble comes in your life you're dressed to you're dressed for the occasion you're dressed to overcome amen you are dressed that the that the devil cannot win amen that no weapon formed against you shall prosper it is the best covering amen Sheen's got nothing on it come on now hallelujah amen nothing of this world compares to being covered by the blood praise the Lord didn't get many amens there that's fine but hey we see maybe I'm just going to go down this track for a while we're going to realize who we are now amen that's right that's why I read the opening scripture now we are the sons of God not one day oh one day our will be one day one day one day no no now now we are the sons of God right now your present State now you're a son or daughter of God Amen Hallelujah you're in your astronaut tube you're in your spaceship and you're dressed in that in the see it's not one day like Brother David silus said at the camp many people put the carrot far away like a carrot before a donkey one day you'll be like this one day you'll be like no no we are now God has made us now amen we don't need another message to perfect the bride we don't need another word we don't need someone else to come and open the word to us no Christ is fully revealed amen and he has appeared Among Us so when we see him we shall be like he is amen and he has appeared in these last days his spirit is upon the Earth proving his word amen and so what does he make us like him how's that we believe his word we take him at his word hallelujah but you see now we are walking see he does not see us you got to realize if you're in in this astronaut suit you're covered from head to toe and toe too right there's not one part of you who's ever seen them when there's like the film over there you know they're outside in space you can't see their face you can't see any part of them they're covered in an asut suit right and it's the same thing if you're covered when you're covered in the blood of Jesus Christ when God looks at you he doesn't see you glory he doesn't see your Humanity he doesn't see your mistakes he doesn't see your mind battles he doesn't see your trouble no he hears your voice through his blood Hallelujah he hears your voice through his blood you see we can get so caught up with the man in the astronaut suit that we forget about the suit who's ever been maybe brother M and you've been up in the bush but you're wearing the right kind of clothing you got confidence in your clothing right you know if I go up there with you in this the weather changes man I'm going to be an icicle on a hillside you just march on fine why because you're dressed you're dressed for the conditions amen it's the same and you have confidence in your clothing right so the same thing with you and I we're going to have confidence in the blood of Jesus Christ we must have confidence in our clothing that no matter where we go we're safe Hallelujah why because he doesn't see us just like an astronaut you don't see the astronaut in the suit you just see the suit amen and when God sees us he doesn't see our Humanity he sees the blood of his own son see see there's an interview that you know there's a it's called private interview interview of sister Bruce and sister Bruce is worried about the astronaut in the suit herself but she's forgetting what she's clothed in amen and then how many of us because we just living everyday Christian Life we think well we're not really getting anywhere but I say the tanks are being filled up we are not retreating we're advancing amen and then so she's wondering is everything okay with her but she didn't realize that the life she was living presently was how how God wanted her to be because she was built a certain way that she'd get someone in her heart and she would pray through for them and that was her position in the body she's just living life I don't know if she had a job I what she did you know outside of church all these things but she was walking in her astronaut suit living everyday Christian Life in her pre-ordained position by God and she's wondering is she really fine so she asked the prophet about it he says now brother Braham says this just coming halfway well most the way through the interview says but remember me being a sinner and before God I'm not a sinner neither are you right we've got a blood sacrifice laying there God don't even see us he hears our voice but he sees the blood blood of Christ that's it he sees the blood of his own son it's our voice Christ's blood then it's Christ that's talking through us to God so therefore we're not Sinners no more we are Christian how many times people they they fall they fail they and they feel like they need to go back and start walking with God like go back to you know like playing Monopoly you know you pick up a chance card or a community whatever and you got to go back to go you know you're about to buy that big property everything's going to be a great big victory but you pick up this card you got to go back to the start it's the same thing many Christians they fall they fail they think they go back and start get saved all over again no but no but the thing is you got to realize if you've really given your life to the Lord you don't go save sinner save sinner save sinner all the time no you go from sinner to saved sure we've got to confess our sins and make things right right but it doesn't mean we got to get saved all over again who's with me who understands what I mean we're not going back and forth all the time no we're Christians just like he said we are no more Sinners we are Christian amen praise God Amen I believe you to be a genuine Christian woman brother says I remember says but sister Bruce says I make so many mistakes I fail so many times then brother R says that's why Christ had to die so that you with your mistakes wouldn't be lotted to you amen so let's stop looking at the man in the suit and start looking at the quality of the suit the quality of the word that we're covered in the power of his blood amen see that's why Christ had sorry I'm just repeating this but so that you with your mistakes wouldn't be a lot of to you see he took your mistakes you desire in your heartest to serve him sister Bruce says yes all right that's what he died for so you could serve him see your mistakes are not looked not lted to you see he is your propitiation see he is your sin offering your sins are not known you're not a sinner before God Christ took your sins and became you because your desire is to serve him I think that's a marvelous thing yes don't you think so that we can that we can realize you know if we can realize who we really are not one day we are we're not Sinners anymore you say well I'm living in the same house yeah but another one's come and lived in here amen if God steps in faith really steps in amen it's not you living no more it's Christ Living in you you may look like the same old person but there's a different life going on in here amen the life you were born with did all kind of crazy stuff I know from my experience but then one day God stepped in God came and said hey you're an astronaut you're not meant to be an Earthbound creature going up and down in the with the clouds and the troubles and all these things no fly up into the Heavenly Realms of only belief amen and he changed my life to make me realize I am an astronaut praise the Lord how many astronauts do I have more than NASA we got our Heavenly amen I don't know what acronym it would be but you know we're not working for NASA we're living for the king Hallelujah so in these times of trouble God wants to prove to you you're an astronaut that you can live in a realm of I Take God at his word amen he he had to prove to Abraham who who Abraham really was Abraham thought he was from the cheles and he was an idol worshiper and all these things but God called him out because God knew in him he was the father of Faith but God had to show to Abraham who Abraham was just like Gideon he thought thought he was a cow he was you know he was threshing wheat and secret all these things but in that time of trouble God had to prove to Gideon what Gideon was made of see David I know what he thought he was but God through his life proved to him who he was amen and it's the same thing with you and I God wants to prove to you in times of trouble who you really are but he doesn't want us to lean on the five senses he wants us to live by faith alone and SP no matter what I see no matter what I hear no what no matter what I'm told I believe maybe we should sing that song tonight amen let's have the musicians amen but God wants to prove to you who you really are well how can I let him do it surrender to him not my will but thy will be done cuz remember an astronaut doesn't get trained and says now I'm going to fly the spaceship no they get into the spaceship they strap themselves in they let Mission Control takeover right and it's the same thing with you and I okay we never get to a place now Christian walk where we think now I've got it all God take a break I'm driving no Jesus was always the Lamb of God he was always surrendered to the father's will Amen brother Braham had to come to a point where he said not my will but thy will be done popularity pulled him different things pulled him but he had to walk by faith alone and God wants us to walk the same way amen I mean it's not popularity it's not what people said no it's what his word has said for us not my th will but thy will be done amen that's an astronaut amen I believe you're made of that kind of material people children you're astronauts amen amen you you're made to live in that Heavenly realm of taking God at his word you say I've got a lot of things I want to do in life let him be your ambition amen let him be the one that leads you and you'll go places you'll do things that you never imagine You' do amen far greater than what you think you want to be he'll take you far further praise the Lord amen let's um let's stand tonight don't want to be too long but let's just Worship the Lord tonight amen amen let's sing that song he's a miracle he's a miracle working God am mean you

this cycle of over and over again of troubles and rejoicing in troubles let him break that cycle well how do you let him break that cycle surrender to him and walk by faith in the trouble amen don't let you don't let yourself take control let him take control amen no matter what I see no matter what I hear no matter what I feel I believe no matter what I'm told no matter how it seems no matter what it cost I believe and if I look and it seems like it's broken I'll lay I Hallelujah on the Altar and and if I look and it seems like it's [Music] over I'll lay a Hallelujah on the altar because
