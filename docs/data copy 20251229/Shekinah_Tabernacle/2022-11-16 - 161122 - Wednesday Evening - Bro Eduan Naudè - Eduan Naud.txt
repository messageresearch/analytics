Psalm 136 who remem us in our low estate for his Mercy endure forever and hath redeemed us from our enemies for his love or for his mercy endureth forever who giveth food to All Flesh for his Mercy endures forever and it's still here on this Earth right now oh give thanks unto the god of Heaven for his mercy endureth forever and if we can just quickly jump to John 9 from um from verse 6. from verse 6 John 9. when he had thus spoken he spat on the ground and this is now Jesus speaking to the uh and demonstrating his power to uh to the blind that was born blind spat on the ground and made play of the spittle and he Anointed The Eyes of the blind man with a clay and said unto him go wash in the pool of silhoum which is by interpretation sent he went his way therefore and washed and came seeing and if we drop down there to verse 11 this is now where they're talking to this blind man he answered and said the man that is called Jesus made lay and anointed my eyes and said unto me go to the pool of Siloam and wash and I went and washed and I received sight and dropped down to verse in 25 if you may he answered and said whether he be a sinner or not speaking of Jesus I know not one thing I know that is where I was blind now I see may I quickly just jump while we stand Standing to verse 4 of John 9 where Jesus is speaking and saying I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh where no man can work as long as I am in the world I am the light of the world Lord bless his reading of his word you may be seated and I'll take the comfort of standing right so um apologies that this might feel all over the show and um all over the place I thought maybe uh I had so many thoughts and I was trying to sort of get them all together I think um I think the the title might explain it and and my title I would think for tonight for this little message is is the testimony in the revelation so whatever you've received wherever your new walk when are you looking past when you're looking right now where are you walking the testimony of that what have you received the the truth that you have the the faith that is that is that is building and and growing so just see this as all small little pieces of Mana that you that you may pick up um like the Israelites there in the in the desert and then stop chew on one of the two pieces and then move on because I will move on and we'll pick up another piece and we'll we'll we'll have a uh a gastronomical uh Jubilee tonight yes I I truly believe we will now oh brother Chris welcome I saw you there from the back end there's only one guy that can enter in uh I love that hey oh man you should have given us a special or something man you you sing Next Level oh it's good to be happy here um yeah so I had this thought right and I was I was sharing this with brother brother Arman now um me being a bit of sometimes a drama uh type of guy I'm thinking Jonah and in the Wayland that's this has come now over the pool but a bit um and is sort of trying to the Lord is trying to build our faith muscles the Lord is trying to to to stir up something in us to say there's not long to go you need to get in your position you need to pray you need to you need to stand in the Gap you need to be in the breach you need to claim your family and claim your friends and claim those that is are far off and um you be the spearhead of this Warfare of this war of these soldiers right so there I was thinking about a good old Jonah and um in the belly of the whale in the fish and uh one thing he said now as soon as he and this is the attitude that I like about if you look to you know towards the prophets I was talking about David as well the attitude immediately when they when they face the trial when they see they were wrong when they made the the wrong choice and they went the wrong way um there's this repentance there's this coming back to the Lord immediately as quick as I can rush to him because you know where the truth is it's here okay we've got one goal we've got one objective on this Earth as to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ and while we're doing that people will see that people start asking questions and their seed will be will be planted right and that's that's where we're going so this Jonah he's in in the Billy of the wild now imagine you were sitting next to him maybe where you are now in your spiritual walk you might agree with them right but you were sitting there uh and you're looking at the circumstance now uh sorry to spoil your your little Hollywood picture maybe or your cartoon but the the belly of the whale wasn't that big that he could walk around and push up his hands and have a little Jubilee in there it was endless yeah it was it was you know it was not comfortable you know if I can get that cross right if he had to move you know arms was like and there he's saying I will once again turn my face to the to the temple I will pray all this around me is lying vanities now you're sitting there next to him Jonah you were you were losing it you you are Looney you're crazy you're insane just open your eyes well I can't because I'm blind because I'm in the belly but in that moment now to the world I can't explain this but that this there's your faith right there's your there's your testimony of the Revelation that he received right there Lord I wasn't in your will you came you brought this I saw the Tempest of the water still when you tossed me over the boat and all of a sudden I'm in this predicament but once again I will face turn my face towards the temple I will pray upon the Lord and he will receive he will get me out of this little predicament this conundrum right what did he do spit him out and he went and he turned that whole city around right through the grace of God yeah right so with that thinking about crazy thinking about we need to change our thinking we need to we we can't be we can't be in this world and thinking like the circumstance is impossible what with the situation I'm finding the trial I'm having the yada yada yada we we can't think like that anymore we can't be in the scene we can't be here and and and and the the five senses that's deceiving us their brother being sent on the 16th beautiful beautiful message and it's just inspired me again and if you look back in the scriptures but by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent Sacrifice by faith Abraham when he was tried when he was trialled when he said when the Lord said go and sacrifice Isaac again now he's standing next to him and you're walking up this hill and you hear I need to do this but the Lord promised you see sand people and you're taking the only one and he's gone it would it will not make sense right but by faith he comes and he delivers him now what I'm trying to say there and I might be jumping a bit but take Easter Now Easter now I need to find my notes for Esther knew what was coming for her people the king gave a Grace gave her time and prepared her to equip her for this trial that was coming so when we preach and when the ministers come and when people are talking and ministering and so we we we're never away from trial so as I'm standing here I'm in a trial right the Lord is is really refining us and and polishing us and saying well I want the Spotless bride and we've got this Christ of La crust of Life still on us so here he equipped us he he give us Grace and he prepare us and equip us for the trial he's not going to throw you in something that you cannot handle it's scriptural it's in the word and it's a promise hold on to their promise so whatever is coming just just know just know okay so I'm back where my original note so God and all the prophets now are looking down and I'm telling you they are looking in all of us and waiting for us to recognize that and awaken the faith that they had that they know it's already in US because Hebrews 13 8 and showed us uh sorry and tell us so they told us they showed us they had the signs and wonders it is in us so they sitting there and waiting the time is coming time is nigh what are you doing pick up your faith pick up your sword witness and experience God on a Sunday and a Monday and a Tuesday and and make him part of your life every step pray without ceasing like brother man said you know walk this walk it doesn't matter up and down again taking a step back you are outside of that it is it is you can tell me I'm Looney you are outside of that realm here use your faith that you have to put yourself and say like Paul said nothing moves me right now I am in this flesh and I might not be where I ought to be but by God's grace I'm no longer where I used to be now with that I want to make a little introduction there to parfani that's been that's joined us I love that guy he is I I love him and he's he's like a dad he knows that I I don't have to I don't have to lie um but you can go no behind my back and you can I talk to him about stories just don't tell him too much detail of this guy where I was right um yeah I'll tell you a little story right so so there I was and uh uh and me and Lundy could have been our first trial actually and um a lot of things happened and I I had a massive uh temper right maybe my boys would say I still have a massive temper but um stormed out of the house their house right and I jumped there in my car where I wanted to now London knows when I'm angry I'm seeing black and and I know where I'm going so she doesn't want me behind the steering wheel so she loved me and um and and I just wanted to get away I want to get away from the situation and at that point I could argue as much as I want I was innocent I wasn't innocent I was never innocent right so anyway fleeing from the situation right and there I am and we're screaming outside and yelling and crying and not flying and I smash my own car I I hit my car dancing I'm like why not my dad-in-law's car you know you do not think when you're just in that state and you never want to be in that state right it is horrible and no yeah bless bless my mom-in-law also the softest person ever on this Earth beautiful Christian and she comes down the steps and oh what is what is this rigmarole and I just in my you turn away from this and you go back in the house okay so here comes Paul funny right now you can imagine in yourself now again let's take this General situation the guy next to Jonah the imaginary guy right I'm thinking he would come here and he's going to to polish me he's going to flatten me he's going to throw me over the wall and he comes with this gentleness he comes in his what is wrong and he puts his arms around us and he prays first thing he does he prays and I just break down I just let it go and they're dissolved the the whole scenario the whole situation dissolves there was many many more of those right it didn't just stop there but now there there's an example there's someone that's and it was yeah you could almost say it was in that moment that I knew Lundy as a keeper just looking at the household looking at the health that's there you know and um and and and looking at I needed that I needed that stability and well if you know my dad as well um man of the word and and really in it but I took my journey I took my wrong turn and here is not another hand on this Earth placed here to just leave me back just to bring me a little bit a little bit back a bit more recently I would say just when you sincerely call on the Lord so I start I want to start sort of changing now sorry I didn't start my timer here I want to start uh change it to um the testimony to what you've received up to now the Revelation now how do you utter it how do you um enjoy explain it to someone that's maybe there in the world how do how did that condesa how do you how do you dialogue with that right now just a quick testimony after the camp um before the camp me and Josh came up for a bit of prayer because you know the season changes we know we're going into Camp mode and you know um the the the our bodies are impacted by that you know I my my nose bleed you know so many times and then people that knows when it bleeds it doesn't stop just within seconds so then there's a whole rigmarole need to go sit down but and after the camp you know you would be trialled so I'm standing there and but Andy it's you that gets trial there when you brush your teeth hey when you can't speak back to the to the devil so I'm I'm in the bathroom and and the nose starts bleeding and in my in my mind in my spirit I'm I'm talking to the Lord and say Lord just take this away I really I really don't like this I don't want I don't want this I just it just it's it's just awful it's just you know it hampers your your speed your your Cadence you know now you need to sit and pause and think maybe I should think upon the Lord while I'm doing that but at that moment I did and um and I walk into because I had to blow my nose right so the testimony from the prayer is that at Camp the only time my nosebleed bled was when I blew my nose not no other time and ironically that was on London's birthday in the mornings so I couldn't even happy birthday because I um was in the conundrum but anyway coming back now and and I blew my nose I had to and I and I can feel it starts bleeding and I'm saying Lord I just don't want it and I come into the mirror look in it and I say like that and I speak spake it out I spoke it and I said like this and it's bleeding and I plug a little bit of toilet paper and I pull it out threw it in the toilet paper and I'd stop bleeding oh good no but this is not this is not normal and and I even I didn't even share with Lanny now forgive me that I didn't share this because in myself I thought it was going to bleed again I thought I'm going to walk out the bathroom or whatever sniff sniff and whatever and it starts bleeding again and I never did and it hasn't since so I'm going praise the Lord yes this is a small thing but it's a big thing because you have to trust them there and he wants to see what you do with your faith and that smaller situations what do you do with your faith when you when you we're in big situations okay absolutely so the Revelation that you've received what do you do with it and how do you witness now I've got a few papers here well the one I think is a prayer request and uh the other one is just a blank paper but you don't you don't grab you go you've received the Revelation here's here's your here's your nugget here's your little Mana for the day right um actually I should have put it the other way around you've received meat and veggies you've received over years and years of of coming to the message um talking to the Lord how he's opened up his word um he's received he's given so many things and then you look back you go but that's not how I understood it then this is so much different because of Revelation right now you start witnessing to someone do you take this paper and you go do you know the soup and Seed so taking Sunday's message do you come there with wrath so you come there with to be different do you come there with there's only one true baptism what is your attitude when you start witnessing right and how do you add it is not it is not easy I grant you that but how do you do that the Lord must tell you that right so in his word he he does I'll give you another little testimony um we were in the car the one day we were um that was when we're slaughtering the the sheep for um for Robin and we had such a wonderful time because that was just after our Easter services and um driving back in this friend of mine um now brother man can witness do this we never spoke about gospel we've we've just we spoke about rugby we spoke about the Free State we spoke about South Africa we spoke about beautiful right to sort of get a channel open up a channel be friendly how can we how can we share this in the future so I jump in the van with him he takes me home and basically the first thing he asked me is like what church do you go to I said well okay Lord I wasn't ready for that I would still have blood on my fingernails so how do I share this now his angle was and none not not his fault or anything not good or bad but his angulars what makes us our gospel different do we different to who right now by the Lord's Grace I wanted to go there because that's the that's a question he answered so or the question he asked I'll answer him that way but by the Lord's Grace he just pulled me back and he said okay give them give them scriptural truth give him scriptural truth I said well firstly I need to know who I am I worshiping what's my identity who am I worshiping where is he what is he what is his name who am I talking to am I talking to three five or seven people who is this where is he does he have a telephone right so I sort of broke that down and say started with a bit of a LOM but for a bit of um Genesis and I said now he's got all these attributes and he says I'm a redeemer but what am I redeemed of so how how do I get saved okay so then we look at baptism I said okay so I go to the book of Acts and it says oh repent of me baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit I said okay and then I said but now I'm redeemed but I still don't know what am I redeemed off sin right right so where is this sin how to understand sin what is sin when when is it sin and when is it not so by the Lord's Grace I could explain it in that way that it is not different to any belief there's a lot of difference yes but I might my attitude was not to go and find and pick the differences my my attitude was here's the truth how can I expose you to that whether you agree or not I can just come back to the infallible word of God right just now recently today actually talked to one of my colleagues and she actually she's a Buddhist and she started acknowledging that there is a great one on the way allegedly they might they should already be here that would have a neutrality and a peace with wisdom now looking through my lenses I know that there's one on on the way and if we look at the prophet's life he says that it might be overdue already um and then I go well how do I witness do this now how did I actually want to go one back and say what did I share so what did I make her say that and how does she respond because we were talking about she's going to Sri Lanka and the life the the the the the the the countries the turmoil the war the everything and I go yeah yeah and and she knows I'm a Christian she knows I've got a bit of a spiritual eye and I'm saying well what I'm what I'm seeing is when I go to when I go to the scripture and I see David and I see there's this Wars and his hands were made for war but I feel that this age is coming to the end where we go into Solomon and we go into wisdom we're going to peace and I go I feel we're getting to that age to that end of that season where we have to have this war but it will end and she also had a end date so she talked about some something like February or whatever according to the stars and Saturn and whatever so again I said I said I uttered I said awesome and she goes no that's not awesome because you know the world's in normal turmoil I say this yeah it's not awesome but it's got an end date it's got an end date right so and and that's the way I I didn't like well I mentioned the scriptures never never mentioned Jesus or but you can you can infiltrate you you you can be the reconnaissance you can be you know we we are specialized troops soldiers right and we were chosen we were hand-picked right we are not that little foot soldiers that came in and you know still went behind the years the Lord has given us a lot of ammunition a lot of Revelation what do we do with it if we want to be that spearhead if we want to be the three from David if we want to be that hand-picked we we've got to move we've got to change we gotta show we gotta we gotta uh get in school and they go you're different why are you different you've got to swim against the grain you've got to achieve above what you think is possible that's where the faith faith muscles comes in and that brings me to how do I minister to other people should we focus on what what our differences is or should we say what do we agree on with our bravery Brethren from other churches from other groups and again I just want to reiterate infallible word of God that's still living today and I'm still getting Revelation today I don't have to go anywhere else right if you have time if you have patience just sit down and listen to the Lord the Lord the the the word is so so rich uh I was just reading the daily altar there at the back and I'm like this is this is awesome this is such good manner for us in today and yeah so never stagnate never stop walking now just push on I was also listening to um brother Dawson Riley's testimony you are man that's such a good testimony but that showed me God comes in Simplicity as well and God comes God comes your way you know he comes and he sits with you what do you what do you do no I'm a lion hunter ah okay so you know are you crack shot are you good yeah yeah I'm not too bad and you know that starts the conversation and then liaison Manson weeks on the Lord comes throw up a rock see what happens see Faith rise see that there's something different see that thus saith the Lord has just been spoken you know see see faith in action right and then you can make what that what you want but the Lord's come your way he's speaking on your level he's not a cookie cut to God kids he's not a cookie cut the God he will speak to you in your way if you like your music if you like your your reading time if you like I don't know spending time with that and Mum he will find a way to come to speak to you on your level and talk to you and saying I love you I've got a plan for you you have not stopped we are right now we have to still walk I've got this massive plan for you come with me right and that brings me on to to worship God in the midst of trouble so like I said we all have trials because you've received the revelation of who he is who is control who has placed you here where you are now wherever you are in your life and who has greater things planned for you you've got to have confidence in him if he brought in I I'm I testify if he brought me from that Old Blue bull supporter to where I'm now he goes you you you you can you can you can make it I can see the end amen and with that I want to testify and this is the Bold statement for tonight so if you want to press record now or stop the video I don't know the worst place that you've been since you've received the revelation of who Jesus Christ is is still better than the best place without that I can testify I've been in really really good places we've done service here for Christ maybe a little small testimony as well where we are counseling people that's in need through the word and with the knowledge that we have and I don't want to take that away again if I refer back to brother Bean's message on Sunday if I I came in here in this message and go for 30 years I've been lied at so I wanted to approach it with the wrong attitude and God bless him he he said no that's not the way so praise the Lord I had the best place where I served him where I found you know when I was in solitude when when he comes to me speaks to me and you know I used to I used to write poems to the Lundy you know and that was my way to you know went over um but that that all began that all began in in service here it All Began because of I was seeing his Beauty and I I couldn't Express that how do I express it and you know start writing that and I had an awesome time in that and still really and well if you think now the opposite the worst day and I've had pretty bad days since I've been in a in this message and since I've been this the the Christian I am today it's still better it's still better and I have to say that I have to truthfully honestly say that while I was in that deepest deepest trial and it's very you know it's reasonably recent that in that I still had Joy I didn't look at but I had Joy it could not be stolen and I could just glorify his name through everything and like I said Paul said these things do not move me so can we walk past that can we get now to say whatever your circumstances I mean where's where's pravin I thought no hey that month's now you're struggling with your with your leg you know you the attitude that you approach that you know how much you have changed so if you approach that now four years ago you know and how you approached it now and saying Lord you've got no attention you know we had the one day now where Josh broke his Tower Jonah got his leg open and get seven stitches on the same day I said Lord you've got my attention you know brother I meant you preached at me you preached me on Wednesday that's why I was so quiet I said yep yeah I'm I'm listening Lord I'm listening and if that was a way to get my attention Praise Him what flies with this right um I really want us to pray this if you stop and think how many how many things they are to pray for how many people to pray for and not only for healing eh there's people just that one's just a little hope you know and that's um Dawson Reilly's testimony is talking about a little lift you know oh that tastes let's go and listen it it is incredible the way the Lord worked and and lifting him in times when he was just really just down um so I really want to pray for these people that um needs a hand needs a hand of the Lord and needs a little a little persuasion maybe that needs you know just that that light so can we put up that last slide I think it says Josh slides um from a little piece there in adoption and if there's anything that burns within my heart and I hope never leaves me in my years to come and a little context remember where I was now and the best place I could ever be now taking that before the message all right now but the best place you you spiritually have been right put yourself there um that'll never forget what happened last Sunday morning as a week it has done something in my life now I like this it's revolutionized my life I want you to be revolutionized in your life to go out there and say the faith I have you know the joy I have whatever the the world's not given this to me the Lord's place it in me and I Rise Above This I am flying like an eagle I do not fear I have I have not fear of death death has no fear at all it doesn't uh for you if you understood now maybe if if you um have to have the experience to know it because there's no way to explain it you cannot find words because it isn't lay in the English dictionary or no other dictionary because it is an eternity no yesterday no tomorrow I like this it's all present tense and so I'm feeling pretty good in an hour from now I don't feel so well and another hour I feel good again it's present tense all the time never cease just a glorious peace that presenting so take that best place in your life spiritually we've ever been I mean you can multiply that by whatever but if you had that moment forever I mean that's already there and now he's saying you are so close you can you can make this we are seeing the finishing line that door of the Ark is creaking as has never been creaking before get there run run be the best in what you what you want uh for Your Life by what the Lord wants in your life there's no yesterday there's no tomorrow it felt so well into the scriptures of of Hebrew 13. and that's the present tense God maybe present tense in your whole life and every aspect of your life in every moment ask them pray worship him in that in that deepest value that you have worship him because your your joy is staying if I can call up the musicians we'll sing a little song and um and then we will go into prayer we've got a few um a few prayer requests um thank you sister Shannon for writing that out um I've got a prayer request here for John Maloney uh his friend Nikita has passed away and praying for the family Sister Christine actually we're praying tonight and saying and thanking Lord for for healing for complete recovery and restoration hey and I've just added um Josh spoken to me with uh Charlie Gibbs Charlie Gibbs so um he's uh actually a former colleague of mine's son that's going to his school and he they had a little accident with the the base amp popped in his ear or something like that and he was he was quite in pain
