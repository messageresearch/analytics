abundantly amen we're here for a prayer meeting aren't we amen it's tonight we all ask abundantly amen oh lord there's so many things that is a need in the body and and tonight let us be encouraged that that the lord has a plan and a purpose and and and he has prayers he's got a burden on his heart and and i believe that tonight we're going to just pray that hallelujah who who's looking forward to just praying as well amen and and praying through amen we're going to pray through tonight amen burdens will be broken and lies will be changed and things will change because prayer changes things amen i want to speak tonight on a subject called you are life-changing you are life-changing amen your life is changing but you can change other people's lives amen because the spirit of god is inside you amen and let him flow from you amen because jesus says he that believes out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water amen so i just pray that tonight with these words that he gives gave me by inspiration that it will cause that river to flow better in your life and it will cause more waters to flow out and and it will cause people's lives to change impossible situations to go good amen he's that he deals an impossible amen you know that who believes that tonight our god deals in impossible matters and i believe we face many impossible things but our god delivers us out of them all amen and so we can give him glory tonight amen hallelujah amen praise the lord we have thank you musicians amen well it's a happy atmosphere hallelujah i like a good happy atmosphere who likes a happy atmosphere hallelujah amen well why are you standing hallelujah let's turn our bibles to 1 corinthians 14 chapter 1 and you know this thought's been here for a long time and i've never been given the green light to preach it but praise god tonight is the night amen and it was a the lord just came straight away so praise god you are life-changing amen just accept that tonight accept it for yourself hallelujah because you see it's not just others it's your own life you know they're in your heart as a throne as an altar of life change oh my yes okay so let's read before we're standing hallelujah 1 corinthians 14 chapter 1 and it says follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy may the lord add his blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated hallelujah we're not going to be long tonight i've just got a small thought here but you see i've always read that scripture there and i've gone i don't quite understand it because you know we talk about we hear strongly don't desire spiritual gifts don't desire a ministry don't desire to have have gifts operating in your life just let god do what he wants to do right do we hear do we agree that god will put in the body that god will use you how he wants not how we would perceive ourself but you see i've read the scripture here and actually that word gifts so it says follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but that where gifts was added it's not actually in the scripture it was added by the translator and so it's actually saying that you should desire and you should pursue divine love and follow after the supernatural amen not to follow gifts or to desire gifts it says desire be zealous for the supernatural do we have a people here tonight that is zealous for the supernatural who want supernatural things to happen in their lives to happen in their family because you see without it there we can't go any further so the to get any further would there must be supernatural hallelujah where you're at right now you ain't going nowhere without a supernatural event to take you further because the devil devil's not going to let you just walk into your victory oh my you've got to fight into your victory and it's god's power behind you it's like a river to break forth all the walls amen it wasn't israel that broke the walls of the freed rahab was it amen they just followed the word of god they followed the instruction of the captain and the captain gave them the the very thing that they would never who could you do you think israel would have come up with that idea no way and the victory tonight that we're going to win in prayer for whatever the needs are it says let your request be made known to the lord the victory tonight the lord will reveal that how to pray amen he'll reveal what to pray and i just encourage you tonight avail yourself to the leadership of the holy spirit so that he can pray according to his will and pray through you not because you're worthy or you've done anything to to to earn it it was because he's worthy it's because he is worthy that we can pray and he can use us to deliver to change for you all of you from the youngest to the oldest are life-changing amen so gifts you know this that to see that that was added it just opened it to me and actually i went into the original uh emphatic diagram that we that brother branham used a lot to see the original and it says here it says pursue the love which is the agapo love and be zealous for the spiritual be zealous for the supernatural amen but more that you should prophesy amen hallelujah so there you have there is something that he's telling you here that you should pursue love the divine love of god goes first pursue love get god's love in your heart get god's love in your life till you're so saturated that all there is is love amen hallelujah i would rather have divine love than all of the supernatural gifts operating but when you do have divine love that is the key to the supernatural operating it is the key to holiness did you know that that living a holy life if you do it because you have to you've missed the mark but if you're living us a holy life because you're so full of his love that his commandments are not grievous oh the supernatural will flow through you he will manifest himself to you he promised to he said he that loveth me keepeth my commandments and i will manifest myself to him and her hallelujah but love comes first and so i asked you the question if you're living a holy life why are you living a holy life why are you doing it what is the objective what is the motive behind it hallelujah amen so it says here and i just want to reiterate this pursue divine love and be zealous for the supernatural amen but more that you would live love and speak by inspiration a divine influence see god wants to be a divine influence on your life and he wants to reflect it that's grace amen and when divine love is projected sovereign grace will take its place out of your belly shall flow rivers of living waters do you believe that amen it starts with humility humble yourself say lord here i am i'm not going to do these things i just lord lay my life at your feet i lay my life on your altar you made provision for me i'm i'm coming before your throne lord deliver me and whatever it is that's stemming the flow unblock it lord be specific because there's things in our life the devil does everything he can to stop this flow of the supernatural but the lord has made provision for that to flow to constantly flow so that you can be a tree planted by the rivers of living water amen no and every season fruitful an evergreen tree we don't need to be deciduous you know you look out there the trees and the branches and you can see trees in the winter they lose their leaves and they become deciduous but there is people on the earth there are trees on the earth that never lose their leaves amen and there is a people that are planted by the rivers of living water a man who believes that tonight that can stay fruitful that can stay green amen so that you can let the light of god shine on you and fruit will come and people will be changed because a fruitful tree that is green is a life-changing tree and you can be life-changing trees tonight and i'm encouraging you tonight be life-changing god wants to use you you may feel unworthy right now but it's not your worthiness that'll make you a life changer it's the grace of our god it is what he did on calvary he did that for a purpose so that he could use you and change people's lives oh my hallelujah i believe lives are going to be changed tonight i believe god's going to use us tonight to change people's lives to change situations hallelujah amen wow it's good to be here you know amen unwound from years of pressure hallelujah years of pressure marion's got a little taste amen hallelujah god bless marion hallelujah give him a handclap of praise he's doing a gallant deed by doing that job because lots of things are opening up for us as a church but it's also for businesses and for the movie to be made all those things it's all part of the plan and so it's not easy all of these things are not easy but they are part of god's plan and so when we find ourselves doing his will amen we find that the more that god places in the situation it enables us to go and do other things and develop so praise god amen hallelujah i just want to read from 1 corinthians 14 23 let's just build this out a little bit so it says here and we'll read down to verse 25 it says if therefore the whole church be come together into one place and all speak with tongues now it's a continuation from what we read earlier at the opening scripture um but i didn't want to read everything on that chapter there but you go back and read 1 corinthians 12 all the way through to 14 and you'll get a big picture of this narrative that we're dealing with tonight um and it says here if therefore the whole church become together into one place and all speak with tongues and and there coming those that are unlearned or unbelievers will they not think that you're mad right but if all prophesy and there coming one that believeth not or one unlearned he is convinced of all he is judged of all and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on his face he will worship god and i'm so glad that see we have a a course here that is showing us and i looked at this and i thought does that mean we're all going to stand here and begin to just tell the the future but it's not meaning that what he's meaning by that you should prophesy and he's saying and he says it a few times in this 14 his desire that you may prophesy covet earnestly that you may prophesy what is he talking about he's meaning be inspired be inspiration in flesh let the spirit of god take you yield relax let the tension go down and crumble like rahab's past amen let it crumble because you don't have to hold it and it's those things when you try and make it happen you try to conceive god's plan for your life you try and you get tense and he can't use you you can't work even on a day-to-day basis when you get tense and when you get stressed and when you try so hard oh i just want the supernatural to happen and it says be zealous but part of that is relaxing part of that is letting go and letting god and just waiting i've got a quote later on and it talks about them in the upper room and for so long i've always thought they were crying and praying the whole time but he didn't say that he said terry wait wait there's a difference i thought my they did i thought for a long time thought they would pray for 10 days or however long they were there just crying out to god but he didn't say you should pray all this whole time he just said terry in jerusalem terry and wait for the spirit of god the promise of the father to come and so there's a waiting on god there's a waiting and tonight while we're here while you're listening wait on god wait on the spirit wait on him he's going to say something to you he's going to speak to you who expects that tonight that god will speak to you amen he will he will do something for you hallelujah and he'll prepare you because you see the purpose of tonight is that we would pray amen the purpose of tonight is that that after we hear the word we will we will pray and lives will change situations will change healings will take place cancers will go lives will be changed people will give their hearts to the lord the holy ghost will be poured out revival will strike hallelujah he will turn deserts into blossoming roses wildernesses into edenic conditions amen in lives in situations in places where there's strongholds of witchcraft and strongholds of darkness he will change those things believe it hallelujah and he wants to use you he wants to use these girls he wants to use all these children avail yourself to him because you're not too young neither are we too old i saw something on my facebook feed of a 100 year old man getting baptized and i rejoiced i thought praise god you're not too old or too young amen if a hundred year old man can get baptized i thought that was just powerful amen hallelujah i was going to send it to my family i thought well i might get in trouble but oh well we'll just let it happen [Laughter] oh my you know the devil will say that people are too old and they just think it's just past it but they're not past it today is the day hallelujah oh glory and so i just want to show you here that there is a powerful message of what paul is saying here that that there's all these tongues and supernatural but it has to be done in order and there is something far more profitable than the gifts operating there is a prophecy to unfold for the people a prophecy of inspiration that your life it says here that they are judged of all these people that would come into this church they would come in those doors or come into your house or come into your workplace come into where you're sitting and all of a sudden the spirit of god comes down and he begins to say things through you that's just as natural as can be but you're speaking the very things of their heart discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart who believes that god can use them that way that god can use you and prophesy through you he can inspire you he can give you a word and sees and how sweet is it when an unbeliever and you begin to speak at everything they're thinking and what they've been talking about and what they've been wondering god answers that hallelujah hebrews 4 12 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing a part of soul and spirit and as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and that word is here that word is in you that word is in me and it can discern it can change people's lives because what does it do it begins to get down into their life and it begins to divide and open up and reveal truth reveal who they are only the word can do it there is power and inspiration of god there is power in a prophetic utterance of god and when none of us are out of its reach i'll read it let me read one corinthians 14 39 i'll get to this wherefore brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues let all things be done decently in an order who is eligible to speak under inspiration let me let me let me share this with you from questions and answers on the holy ghost says but how do you get into it them gifts are in the body how do you get in the body not by speaking your way in but by being baptized into one body not one by one spirit we're all baptized into that body one corinthians 12 13 and and it says here one spirit we're all baptized into that body and subject to all the gifts the lord bless you it says so you see there's not one person in this room with the baptism of the holy ghost and even i mean you could even venture to say that even without the baptism of the holy ghost the spirit of god can still get upon people it can get into their spirit realm and and begin to do supernatural things how much more a spirit-filled believer who's sitting there is resting as worshiping and is entering into a place with him where he can use you hallelujah maybe something's blocking in your life right now in the next five seconds you can it can be dealt with because the blood is enough the blood is still there the blood's still speaking so if there's anything in your life maybe you came in that door with something hanging on you it doesn't have to remain on you because we're going to pray why pray with something hanging on you why pray with an unforgiveness or a scornfulness or a discontentment or or any jealousy or any fear or any lust or anything why we may have walked in that way but we don't have to remain that way and so here is your opportunity just say lord let it be gone oh forgive me father take it away from me cleanse me and let me be a river oh my let me prophesy i could desire earnestly that you would inspire me tonight i want to pray for something and let it be changed let lives be changed and let it change the course of history amen you know that you can change the course of history amen hallelujah you know that you're a very powerful people tonight a very powerful people not by your own intellectual your own might or you not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord that power that dunamis a dynamite is where dynamite comes from the word dunamis power god has got dynamite in you and in the power of your tongue he can release the dynamite and that dynamite will break any wall it will divide any small you know this no matter how thin the slices there's always two sides but the word of god can discern between the word of god can take all matters and make clear and bring balance hallelujah so maybe there's someone that of your loved ones that may be in something wrong or going down the wrong way sin the word amen said god speak through me hallelujah of all the testimonies we've heard of how people have come up to prayer life and and and ask for their loved ones and then hours later they've come running through the altar from their houses and their lives have been changed because the spirit of god goes out and finds them because they spoke the word can god use you are you anything different than them no as we just read here one spirit we're all baptized into that body and subject to all the gifts subject to god using you can god use you yes he can god can use you mightily hallelujah just remain humble just humble yourself under the mighty hand of god and he will use you humble yourself the way up is down one corinthians 12 7 it says but the manifestation of the spirit is given to some men does it say that hallelujah that word manifestation is the supernatural operation of god so the supernatural operation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy now in this case it's prophecy as in a prophecy to where god would speak lip to air or begin to speak through a person to tell a future thing that's about to happen or to another discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one and selfsame spirit dividing to every man severally as he will never rule yourself out of being used of god in a supernatural way and i believe tonight god is going to use you in a supernatural way and i just want you to own that for yourself i want you to say no matter what i feel about myself no matter how i've performed today i've been maybe been a failure all day i maybe doubted things but i'm asking for forgiveness and lord tonight i'm going to stand and you're going to use me you're going to speak to him i'm going to pray and something's going to happen amen hallelujah hallelujah oh my babies can be healed old people can be healed lives can be changed tonight who believes that who wants to walk in that reality because this is our reality what you see is not complete reality it's just physical it's just a physical thing but there is a greater reality there is a greater power there is a greater sense that is the sixth sense that is the sense of your faith let that faith put all those other senses subject amen what you see what you hear what you feel what you taste and what whatever else there is let them be subject amen to the sick sense of faith hallelujah it's just a gift that you just humble yourself or relax before god and he uses your speech god has no voice but yours and mine he our hands are his hands if we can just be so submitted to the spirit that it can use our voice and use our hands and use our eyes oh lord help me now if you don't have to you don't have to do these things but god just sets those in his church whoever it's signs that the people might know that god still lives it's jesus the son of god working through his body that he has redeemed we're not worthy certainly not but he's worthy can everyone just say he's worthy he is worthy amen hallelujah oh my prophet says this i just want us to this is like a checkup for us because and and if anything you know because you see with the grace of god see there's grace for us to be changed there's grace for us to remain evergreen there's grace for us to stay fruitful there's no excuse for us to be stagnant there's no excuse for us to have festering wounds or festering troubles or something that just keeps haunting and haunting there's no reason to remain that way no reason the moment you you'd reject that it's a lie and and really reach out to god and believe and you receive your healing or you receive deliverance or closure or whatever it may be that the blood can speak over your life amen you can be free that's what grace is for amen but sometimes we let these things pay tribute like the children of israel they got the promised land they were given it all god gave them the power he said little by little i'll give it to you but just keep getting it but there was many times and he said don't don't don't just save nothing get rid of everything and just take the land don't take prisoners take no prisoners but what did israel do many times you read later on there's all these hittites and high bites and whatever and they're part of the economy they're paying their taxes and they become comfortable and it's the same thing in our life sometimes we let tributaries start to work in our life and we just get comfortable with these things but tonight you don't have to stay comfortable with those tributaries because those tributaries are not part of your body change those tributaries are not in your heavenly body so why leave them in your earthly amen because there is grace tonight for those things to be done hallelujah hallelujah and if any of those things are affecting your influence with god because that's what they do they affect your influence they affect your standing in faith because they they twist your perception of things and then god can't trust your discernment because there's something in there that's taunting you or causing a twist of your perception of what's happening it clouds judgment by having these little tributaries and so tonight let god's grace just say you know you just make yourself to the lord and say lord i'm going to pray tonight without anything in my life that's going to hinder my judgment oh take it all out all of it amen and now i read this amen then we just take the name of god and use it anyway prophesy it when means nothing but some kind of carnal influence and so forth and say things that never happen and act like it never pay any attention or if you say something and honestly it didn't happen and repent and tell it that you were wrong then your influence will come back the man is honest so he's a hypothetical situation says these angels he's talking about influence and and and isaiah as he saw the lord high lift it up and he saw those seraphims and how their wings and everything was covering there was a reverence and a humility and yet they were perfect hallelujah but they were reverent humble and an action he says and so he's talking about them here he says these angels seraphims never know sin or nothing about sin they just burned the sacrifice and to make a way for the worshipper the saints and they have to have their faces covered what would that be up the side of uzziah the one that went and burned incense out of his position cover their holy faces in the presence of god with reverence god help us with our reverence he says the prophet says here now i'm not that this here if if if this hits your home then just repent if it doesn't then i'm not saying it's hitting people's homes but it's going to go over the church right now and if it hits you and you're honest with yourself just make it right now there's no reverence there seems to be that we can just do anything in the name of the lord oh my lord help us and get by with it just as long as we belong to some certain message church or that's got a good social standing and they don't take our papers away from us the presbyters and the bishops and so forth don't call our papers and we still have a good influence amongst the people but and this is the but that really struck me what kind of an influence do we have in the presence of god because you can have a great influence in the presence of the people but what about when you go before god does he appear to you does he come down into your prayer meetings when you're at home does god come if he doesn't why not be honest because there's grace here to let any festering issues not remain there anything it's all to be changed it's all to be made right and it's destined and it's planned for you to be freed from anything that would block the river from flowing because there is a river that flows from god above that's filled with his love that can change people's lives and tonight if there's anything that has struck your home or anything that has hit you and you've gone that's me then you've made it right i believe by faith you've made it right right now whatever it may be so that we can pray without hindrance so that all of these tributaries will come into a river and flow and reach heaven so that god can answer with fire and with change and with prophecy hallelujah i like that but what kind of an influence do we have in the presence of god the prophet says this does our rep prayers return void or are they answered and that's a personal question for all of us if you have embarrassed the balance and the answer if you abide in me and my word abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done so if you abide in me and my word abide in you you've got the mind of christ he can you your discernment is right there's something taking place where your prayers is exactly what he wants you to pray there's no other hindering spirit or some tributary or some sickness in your mind or some hurt from your childhood or some past thing that is blocking and tilting your perception tilting your judgment he's got but when there's a word you abide in him and his word abides in you he corrects you and you stand in the stature of the perfect man you stand in a way with clear discernment clear judgment the mind of christ operating in you so that when you pray you're praying according to his will and then he answers then he begins to appear in your life now remember this is not based on performance now hallelujah there's a there's a motive behind this and we'll get there in a second if you abide in me and my word in you and ask what you will and it shall be done he that believeth in me the works that i do shall he do also amen who believes that tonight even more than this shall he do for i go to the father amen hallelujah i believe that we're in the age where that is being completely fulfilled that christ is appearing amongst his people christ is appearing in the mama the data christ is appearing in the pastor christ is appearing in the minister christ is appearing in the brother the sister the the children he's appearing in the people hallelujah and he's doing the changing in the people amen that's his love so why would you live a life that he would want to do this love and that is the real essence that connects us to that walk so i encourage you don't go and beat yourself up right now oh i fail and oh i'm so wrong just fall in love fall in love with jesus and if you know you can say oh i want to fall in love you just get down and say lord oh i just want to fall in love with you jesus really cry out the fervent and effectual prayer of a righteous man avail of much touch heaven you know these people that approached jesus when he walked they didn't approach him haphazardly they really meant it they were sincere she said bartimaeus was sincere you think he cried out he cried out and even though jesus couldn't hear him he heard the cry hallelujah amen hallelujah he was walking and he stood and i believe that you can cry out tonight to let god unblock the channel that love can flow that that motive behind your life to live for him would be cleaned out would be clarified would be calibrated would be in line not by your works not by your own merit nothing to do with it not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the lord to bring you into alignment just by humbling yourself and praying and letting god do the work that he has already provided says here what kind of an influence even more than this shall i do for i go to the father where are we pentecostal people find ourselves on the road map this morning this evening let's not be bypassed let's not get bypassed no sir there's one road to heaven and that's the road of holiness the righteous the righteous walk in that road of holiness and when they fall they get back on the road and then they make a mistake they get back on the road and then they do this and they get back on the road because there's grace for it but what i'm speaking of is a festering issue that doesn't need to fester that doesn't need to block your prayer life that doesn't need to block your influence in the presence of god you can't you can fool people you can have the greatest prayer life in front of everyone and they think you've got the greatest prayers and you just break through to heaven but what does god think what's going on in heaven oh my hallelujah and so we need to be honest with ourselves we're in the last days saints we're right at the end it's no time to play church anymore there's no time to try and put on something in front of people but then yet you're rotten behind in front of god because you're not accepting the grace that is available to change you just because of something that's blocking and all you need to do is say lord i lay that at your feet oh here i am jesus all your grace is hear your blood speaking hallelujah this brings us now to the importance of prophecy when your life is inspired or a little a young girl gets up and sings a song and sees it god let them and then that song begins to deliver people and that thing that was festering gets delivered how important was that prophecy how important was it that that prophecy happened that someone was inspired by god and then someone gets up and they go and say something after the church service to or to somebody because it was on their heart to say and it was exactly what that person needed and they were inspired desire that you may prophesy you are a life changer and god has got a body hair that is functioning that is eligible for the supernatural so that the supernatural can flow in your life so that he can appear before you so that when you pray hallelujah there is an influence in the heavenly realm that begins to come down and begins to settle in your room and you god begins to speak and lives begin to change and walls begin to crumble and healings begin to take place and the dead are raised and the lepers are cleaned amen my hallelujah amen the righteous walk in it the unbeliever laughs at it depends on what yeah john says here john 14 21 and we're just bringing this out now to a close almost he says this he that hath my commandments and keepeth them haters that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him amen there you have a love connection to your your behavior to your life there is a question is your life worthy of the gospel because the gospel is the power to transform your life it is a supernatural manifestation that is available to the children of god to change you to equip you to empower you to deliver you to heal you so that you can function in full function and power so that you can be the fulfillment of she or he that believeth on me the works that i do shall she or he do also the provision is so available it is so here right now whatever you're going through whatever there's troubling you whatever tributary that's been in your life that's been easier you can live with it but you know it's hindering just lay it at the foot of the calvary now lay it there now and see god move in your life so that those commandments become easy become non-grievous the bible says because it's like that he that loveth me the commandments of god are not grievous to those i think it's in 1 john 5. amen hallelujah says here and these are this is just my questions i just want to ask these things one wonder why the supernatural does not manifest check up your motive and your objective are you living right yes okay more importantly check up your motive for your holiness because this is the keys here 1 john 2 15 it says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him so if the love of the father is in you there's no way you can love the things of the world because it's full of god's love there's no other room for love or affection because you see god's love trumps your affections trumps everything when you're in his presence no lie no veneer no scheme of darkness is plausible this complete and full discernment by the mind of god when you're in when there's love is in you hallelujah fall in love hallelujah that you can be enabled into a life-changing situation hallelujah it says here now watch this influence that comes down on the day of pentecost he says watch him he didn't go around and say this is peter now after the spirit of the lord had come down after they had tarried in jerusalem and the power from on high the thing that would change them came down and it says watch him he didn't go around and say some kind of a creed he went right straight back to the word this is what the spirit of god brings us to this is what real inspiration real influence of heaven brings us to the word your life goes back to the word the things that you say anchored in the word and it takes you to the word and it's the word that speaks and lives a change that's why it's so important to be inspired of god hallelujah don't warm that pure in your strengths for 20 30 years and live a life of mundane christianity that's not our portion hallelujah it's not man ages we're going beyond that we're going beyond an intellectual understanding we're going beyond it to a supernatural inspiration to a supernatural so i encourage you be zealous be zealous for the supernatural who here is zealous for the supernatural who loves it when god moves i believe tonight god is going to move hallelujah when we stand and we pray god's going to move because i believe that through this time as was spoken that there if there's anything in any life that's fixed it's sorted because i believe we're sincere people and sometimes all we need is peter says to bring to remembrance little things and under the inspiration of that moment god begins to knock on you like he knocked on peter's side he was stuck in a prison if the head of the church can be stuck in a prison through some devil's you know temptation and got him physically in a prison the head of the church and then an angel comes and knocks him on the side and says rise up peter and walk out of this prison and peter had to walk out of that prison and walk right out under the word of the angel of the lord hallelujah so if the angel of the lord's come to your seat tonight and he's begin to knock on your side you see what happens when you stand up and those chains begin to fall around you because you're the word of the angel because there was people that were praying under inspiration and they prayed and they touched heaven and he sent his angel to peter and rescued him amen you may be peter or you may be those people tonight but whatever you may be god will change lives because you are a life changer just accept it can everyone just say i'm a life changer i am a life changer hallelujah amen god christ in you the hope of glory amen it's christ in you amen hallelujah out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water amen lay everything at his feet now be prepared now as we pray hallelujah it says here peter didn't go around and say some kind of a creed he went right straight back to the word and said you men of jerusalem you that dwell in judea let us be known unto you and hearken to my words they are not drunk as you suppose seeing it as the third hour of the day but this is that that was spoke by the prophet joel and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh they were influenced by the word to the word oh i like that it's so solid across the solid rock i stand all the grounds are sinking saying when i'm influenced of my king it anchors me in the word it anchors you in the word it brings solidity and foundation so that you can stand and speak and let him inspire you to be a life changer and i'm not just meeting tonight for this prayer meeting but i mean forevermore because you see the game if you want to call it that excuse me for the terminology but this last game you could say this last stretch of the race this last part of the fight that if you can take an og in the old organ you pull out the stops and you and when you pull all the stops out it's just all of its glory all the sounding all the symphony everything all the stops have been pulled out the devil's got all his stops out all of us stuff's out on the earth he's doing everything he can to stop the river flowing in your life but there's nothing to stop the shout that is in god's people there's no devil no resistance no lie nothing that can remain plausible when you get in god's presence and tonight i believe that we can pray and we can just really reach heaven we make everything right hallelujah it doesn't take long it just it just means a sincere heart before god put those things aside put all those resentments aside put unforgiveness aside whatever anyone's done just forget it lay it all at god's feet and let the blood cleanse you so that we can enter in and there's no hindering spirit so that when we come together that and god's influence and the presence of god will be clean by his grace by his merit not our worthiness his worthiness his worthiness amen and all arises they were influenced by the word to the word it ought to do us the same way they got an actions yes when his promise was fulfilled when they seen that jesus promised them that he would send the promise of the father upon them luke 24 49 behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry you terry don't mean pray it just means wait terry means wait wait up there at the city of jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high and when this influence of the holy ghost struck them it filled them they sing the word that jesus promised fulfilled oh glory hallelujah now i wonder if it would take the same influence on us this evening if we seen what he promised to do in the last days fulfilled what kind of an influence would it give us what all we have seen done in these last days ought to put us in action hallelujah it sure ought to with reverence and humility and an action who believes that action you know we as human beings we get exposed to great things and it becomes common but i i just want you to pray to the lord tonight lord reverse that amen reverse the commonality of this glorious message of all the supernatural that's taken place right here in this place with this vision let alone all that's gone since the last uh of the 60s and when the when the message came but what about now oh lord let us never make it common you know the ark returns and we gotta dance amen david danced around that ark he got excited and i just want you to ask god bring back the excitement bring back that zeal for the supernatural let me rejoice at what he's doing because i want to be impressed by it i want my heart to be touched amen oh it's a normal human thing to be things to become common but we can reverse that we don't have to surrender to a humanistic fallen nature thing glory now i wonder oh i've read that he goes on to talk about the pillar of fire and the appearing of the third exodus and you know we read these things and we've seen every type and we've seen every shadow and we've seen the glorious word unfold even before our eyes and our hearts and we've rejoiced for many years but never let it become common never let it become i've heard that before amen but make it so real to me lord excite me lord bring back that that first love experience hallelujah let's stand we're about to pray maybe we'll sing a song let's just sing a song hallelujah before we pray amen i want to sing that song the battle is the lord's amen and i just want to read this as you just sweetly play as romans 8 verse 1 because you know what i've spoken now you know for those that in our conscience may feel condemnation like you can't match up to this type of life remember there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen who believes that so you are walking after the spirit tonight you may have failed today and you probably have because i have and i've made it right with my god and and and you've made it right with your god because that's what grace is to do is to change us to forgive us but not just that but to make it right to cleanse us to deliver us amen it's not your battle it's his battle he's fighting for you he's fighting for your family he's fighting for those situations he's made the provision and now tonight we're going to speak to these storms amen we're going to let lord move in our life and change things for the better for the good amen all faith no fear no doubt i bind the spirit of fear i bind doubting spirits in jesus name that we may pray and believe in the blood of jesus believe in his sovereign grace amen hallelujah oh amen no condemnation to them who have a desire towards god who walk in the spirit who want him is everyone here want god they want to do right amen that's what he's judging you upon what you desire amen hallelujah not your performance or not some person that you may be or not be but what you desire he's looking at that desire hallelujah amen let's just praise him and sing the song and then we'll just go to prayer i mean is there prayer requests do we need to read out prayer requests amen abigail we know the situation and our god is a as a healing god and the atonement is already sorted it goes into action amen the moment we hear that news the atonement goes into action because it's already made real hallelujah there is a soul in time
