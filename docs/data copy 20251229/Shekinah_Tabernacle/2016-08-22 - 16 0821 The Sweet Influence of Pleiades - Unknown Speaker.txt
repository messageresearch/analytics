before we get everyone to sit down is there a testimony that someone would like to share come have a seat Saints good morning everyone I know I sh this at the Wednesday Bible study but singing The Jubilee song just really brought it back and so just maybe for those that didn't hear it we've gone through a lot of change in our household from our month needing to change jobs and then wanting to sell our house and a lot has changed but the one thing that I just really feel that I need to share is when Arman started his new job a fear started inside me for his health because if he doesn't work we don't get money and so I was constantly fearing like oh must get sick bought vitamins and I'm looking after him and making sure he's warm and you know like really just but it's good though amen spoiling him he feels like a man but um so the day that he had texted me to say he hurt his shoulders and his back I was just a big because of everything that happened that was just too much for me and I couldn't handle it anymore and I was really close to just breaking down and I still said Lord I I can't take anymore you've just pushed me too much this is one too much and when I started praying I realized I was praying every day for his safety and I was praying that he would be okay but I didn't actually trust the Lord with it and so I'd pray be praying but I'd actually be taking it back and worrying about it myself and so when I got that realization that I wasn't trusting the Lord I just left it and I just decided Well Lord you know the needs I need a husband that needs to be able to work that brings money in to provide for the family so I just said I'm not going to worry about it anymore and the Lord has since reveal when he revealed that to me and since I've trusted him I've had such peace like I don't worry about that every day anymore and that's just the of the Lord that God can do and it's nothing that I can do by myself so praise the Lord um oh dear um I don't enjoy public speaking but this isn't for me this is for the Lord because I have never seen a miracle until just a few weeks ago in my life and um and I can't hold it in Hallelujah just forgive me for my speaking but um yeah um yeah I grew up in a Christian home and I've um gave my heart to the Lord when I was seven and I've always had a desire to love the Lord I've always wanted to to be with him and um I was baptized and I went off the rails a bit um quite a bit in my teenagers and I came back for Lord when I was 22 23 um through my husband Maru and um and there was a definitely a turning point in my life and um brother Tony maray who was my pastor and Mar we were in a room together and um and the presence of the Lord really came down so strong and um the air was just it was so thick and heavy it was just real milky and um it was a really special time and um I believed that that was the time that I got the Holy Ghost cuz that's what I was told and I I definitely it was a turning point you know and um yeah and I got married to Mar and things were it was pretty good you know I was I I um I was living a Christian Life and I loved the Lord but I had so many struggles and I had so much doubt and fear right inside you know and I and I just I didn't know if that was just me or I just I I really just didn't know if I was saved you know and um anyway so it was okay you know life was it was a r struggles but it was it was okay and then we started coming to you guys church and um a few months ago and that was the first time that I have seen God and his people you know I like God is a liar and he's in you guys and I it just awakened something in me I really hungered for it so much and I didn't know how to get it you know and I was feeling more and more challenged at home so like would go home and the home life was getting really was getting worse at home you know CU I was just in such a turmoil inside cuz I was really starting to realize that I I didn't have it and it was quite scary after all these years you know it's like what do I do maybe I'm not seed you know and anyway um I had really a bad week I just I couldn't really even function um I was um it was about eight weeks ago and for that whole week I just pretty much stayed in bed with I had Elijah and Noah and Lily were feing for themselves and I didn't tell Mar I didn't tell anyone I just felt like I was going to end up in a crazy home you know it was it was a really a low point and it was the week that brother Ben had said um he feels a real um a real burden for the lost and he wants us to be witnessing and I was like oh no I can't never could I ever do that because I was um I was watching and he put the link for the youth camp meetings where the um brother was saying about the how to witness stuff and I was watched that and I really and I realized FY was I just I knew I didn't have it I couldn't witness to people because I didn't have it myself and um and also through the time that sister Vanessa shared her testimony about um that lady that you that you met and so I was messaging her a bit and saying I really enjoyed your testimony and she was messaging me and it came to the Saturday of that week and Maru and Noah got up Ear and went for a hunt and before they went Marty prayed that um he would just pray he prayed that you would come the Lord would come to me and because he said that naami is crying out for you and I thought that's kind of a strange pre I didn't know that you knew what was going on inside and anyway so they went off and I went back to bed and I was reading sister Vanessa's um messages and I was just so upset you know I just I knew like what do I do you know and um I was crying and then all of a sudden the Lord's presence came down so oh it was just so incredible I was just I just felt like a cup and he was just pouring himself in and I couldn't do anything I could just accept it you know and I just I knew that this is the Holy Spirit and I knew that this is the Lord you know and I I just felt so filled up and I just was lying there and I was just rejoicing and I had to get out of bed I was outside it was frost on the ground I was freezing cold I just didn't care I was just rejoicing I was just I just knew that the Lord had met me for the first time in my whole life he actually had met me finally you know Hallelujah and I phoned Mar and usually he doesn't have reception where he was going hunting but I was just praying I just had to tell him you know and um and was I phoned him and he answered almost straight away and I was crying I said I just got the Holy Ghost like what what's happened what's going what's wrong I finally got it out and he I'm coming home right now like don't go go hunting and he's like no I'm coming home right now and um so he came home and that was a really awesome day that day was just way up here you know and Hallelujah and yeah and so and for the next four weeks yeah I was I was still up there such a high you know and um just so many struggles that i' had just totally just went you know like I'd always had um really struggled against um oh sorry sorry um yeah just really struggled with um fighting against the desire of the world you know it was like I felt like Lot's wife you know I was like I was on the right ground but I was always looking back I really had it was just the world was so fascinating you know I really yeah I just really enjoyed watching what was happening and you know all this stupid celebrity stuff I was I was always fighting against that you know and and now it's just just I don't care at all you know but um yeah so there was a really awesome four weeks and like I just my attitude was just amazing you know like nothing was sticking doesn't matter what everyone else was doing I was just such a joy you know and um and I thought that was how I was going to always be you know but then um life sort of happened a bit but and I have had some you know bad days but it's so different now it's like I know that the Lord like when I fall the Lord is still with me amen and I just need to I I pray and he he totally lifts me back up you know whereas before it was like I fell and it's like how do I get myself out of this you know and it was just a real mental battle all the time whereas now it's like I can just I look to the Lord and it's like if I fall like I'm sorry Lord but it's still your problem to help me out now and he and he does and um yeah and yeah I think that's about it but yeah I just yeah I'm just so grateful to the Lord I just oh yeah I'm just so so grateful and thanking you guys as well for um being such a really strong light such a testimony for me and just Awakening that desire so hey praise the Lord yeah Hallelujah God bless [Applause] you brother M do you have a testimony love the Lord amen real Amen brother uh good morning Saints um just wanted to share quickly some of the stuff I've been doing at the Salvation Army um I the Lord put on my heart I to go in there and do some some work in there so I did and I ended up doing some chefing for them um but I got to eat with some of the people who there's a marriage course that we do it for and an alpha course which is an introduction to Jesus and um I took a couple of those um seven Church ages books and bits and pieces home the week after I started working there or the week yeah before I started working there and um some of the CDs of William brenham's life story and I said to um one of the at the table was asking me why I was convicted to come in and work there so I I told her and she was a bit um blown away at the fact that had know Jesus is talking to you and tells you to do these things and I just you know told her what I felt and anyway I said to them around the table before you come back next week you all going to need to ask the Lord a question that you want answered here for yourself and he'll talk to you if you want to know he's real and they all looked at me like I was bizarre but they um so the next week came back and one of the woman came running out of the room she she she met the Holy Ghost that night he came down she asked was she was the only one who asked a question to the Lord and he answered her in two different ways um directly spoke to her and somebody else gave her something else so yeah so that was really cool it was praise the Lord that that happened for it but then it gets bigger the next week somebody else her family extended family all started asking questions and one of them actually prayed for what sort of meal he wanted um and he did he got the meal that he prayed for is what I actually ended up making which was nachos and everyone thought it was really silly but you know he knows how to get your attention like you know if it's insignificant to everyone else it's big to you amen yeah so he got that and also on the first week backtrack when I was working there I was out having a break in the Sun and this this moldy lady she was she was wound up and she was giving this sweet old deer a heck of a time about sorry um a time about she's not impressed with how everyone works at the Salvation Army sorting the clothes out and her standard's much higher and everyone should be better and I felt like I had to interrupt her conversation cuz this poor old 80-year-old woman was getting an air for and she didn't have the answers for her so I said to her look I have an expectation of my work and the food standard is pretty bad and I expect everyone to do what I do and they don't and I've just had to start praying for everyone at my work instead of trying to change my work so maybe you should just start praying and she didn't want to borrow that so I said look I don't know cut a care whatever you're into just give it a whom um and she said no I'm not having to borrow that at all anyway um I was having dinner with uh the rest of the people work with me at the end of the Salvation Army on and having went some dessert and they said oh a new woman came in on Sunday came to church and so I gave her this little Jesus book The Sally's one uh one of the guys said and I said well is that lady like a Mari lady like quite know big tall bigger than me she's like yep um and I said I've actually been thinking about her I had a chat to her and I'm surprised that 3 weeks later she's coming and she came to church by herself and she's asking questions about the Lord so yeah and I um said well I've got a present for her too so I had that William Brandon audio C I thought somebody like that will dig a chilled out story um so I was telling them about it next thing you know all the elders at the Salvation Army around the table and I'm talking to about William brandham and um it was interesting so there was a knock on the door and this woman came through and she wanted to thank the chef for the food and then when she saw that I was the chef she didn't realize why I was there the weeks before she just said thank you so much didn't really go into it much and I said I got a present for you and I gave her an audio CD as well so there's been a few of them given out in that that territory and hopefully things keep happening but it's just simple things e that that that do it and it's encouraging me because I'm standing up for our profit now end time and um you know there's a testimony I heard on his audio CD the other day where a woman had cancer but had came back and she was around all her workmates and they just told her that William bram's nothing you know and he he's false and all this sort of thing and she believed for believed in him and she said if he could just pray for me one more time I reckon it would go and um she stuck up for what she believed in for the Lord and then the Lord I think contact William brand said you got to go pray for her again because I heard her standing up for me in front of people that were doubting um uh so just little things like that enough to boost my faith every day to keep me happy and focused on them I just wanted to share that with you guys cuz yeah we've all been praying recently about how we can approach the world and I think yeah sometimes it's just a couple simple words and Y yeah and people will catch what they what you have so yeah thank you brother amen we'll just do that one that one and then we'll finish on that one we might do the last one if you would like to [Music] stand oh sweet Jes take my life all it failings all its St you're the only thing I've been done that's [Music] right I

God bless you Saints I embrace you in the name of of our wonderful Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen it's a real uh considerate a real privilege for me to stand here and uh I'm just uh honored to be asked to to preach to the Bride of Jesus Christ and sitting back there I just thought I know I'm in a message church I know it and uh uh hey you might be seated for a few minutes I just want to go through a few things and thank you music and uh one of the things is where I appreciated the comments that brother Ben made and I it just seems I don't know how long ago but I was sitting in a meeting and brother Ben and Brother Andy was sitting in the meeting and the talk went around and I felt the presence of the Lord come down and I thought something's alive and well in Wellington amen that was before they before this started and and it life brings life and so what I experience seen in those two young men I see it manifesting itself and uh and I I know I was right when I saw life and uh brother Bim reminded me of uh something many years ago I went and preached in a in a place and I'd known the brother for some time before from some time before but through events and that we had gone our separate ways and and then we hooked up again after a number of years and I came down to the uh to preach for him went to preach for him and uh he stood up there and it would have been great to get back together he says Brother Bruce he said and I go way back and many of you people don't know him but we go way back and he says I want to tell you I have complete confidence in Brother Bruce hearing from the Lord and he started and I started to preach and the brother was sitting in the front and I saw him going in a seat going on like this as I'm opening up and so and but then after a little bit he rose up and I said to him uh after I says what was going on he says oh brother when you started and the scripture coming when you were going he said I thought Lord if this isn't of you it's going to be a disaster and I says so where was all the confidence you told the people that you had in me so we're trusted it won't be a disaster this morning I will tell you that I'm usually nervous before I preach but I was I I'm really I was really nervous about today um with what I got to bring and uh then I hear those songs going on and I think well I don't even know why I feel to preach this way but um we trust the Lord amen and uh don't try to Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word not of the word by the word and if he comes if you just hear of the word that doesn't bring Faith but when you hear by him then it brings Faith amen and uh I hearing those testimonies I thought they were just wonderful and I I just wanted to I thought I want to share a testimony too if that's right I know I'm cutting into my time you took my time so I'm allowed all that at the end right fine because I'm also nervous that's also got me nervous is that is that I got a a fair amount of hay on the fork and and I'm and I've been scrambling trying to pull stuff out and it's it's really difficult but I wanted to share this because you know the following the Lord is so simple if we allow it to be simple and sometimes we put things in and it's got to happen this way and that way and uh uh around about Christmas time before after Christmas I can't remember exactly when but I was busy working it was about 10:00 in the morning and I was busy working uh busy working at the um on our little property we just got a about a three acres and I was doing something with a G or something I don't know and uh and a text came through and it was to say that a brother uh elderly brother um was in the in the local hospital with or pneumonia and some some things that Wen good and I and I love this brother and and his wife they're very simple folk and lovely folk and I thought I'm but I can't not go down because the hospital's not very far away from us it's just a small hospital and so I went down I walked in and he was in the hospital and sometimes people can get ideas that they've got to prove their faith faith is just Faith you know Fai don't don't don't try to I don't judge anybody I know what I go through you know this is sist I go through that you know I I I actually have a job to stand up in front of public and and and all sorts of things so I can't judge anybody else I come through Grace that's all I come through I'm just a sinister saved by grace amen and and uh and I went in and and the brothers there and because of what some people say and some nonsense that goes around and he said oh and I says Hey brother what you doing in here and uh he say Oh Brother Bruce he say you know and he and he says I'm on oxygen and and I've got to take these antibiotics you know and he's apologizing to me he's taking antibiotics and I says yeah and you take you take the whole course I says because people don't do that and I says you take the whole course brother make sure he goes yeah I said yeah and his wife there and she's just a lovely sister and and I said let's just let's just pray first before we go any further I put my hand on his shoulder and I just said a simple prayer and I said Lord you just say lay hands on the sick they'll recover and I says and we take you at your word we believe your promise take you at your word and I just that was it and I stood back and as I stood back I sense something not good in the atmosphere and I waited and I looked at him and I said brother you are disappointed in me you're disappointed with me and he hung his head because I hit the button I said you're disappointed because I haven't said a shouting prayer and told that devil who he is and all that and I said brother the devil can shout louder than me he can make more noise than me I can't frighten him I says but we've taking God at his word and I said look I'll come back and visit you tomorrow and he says I'm going to be in here 3 or 4 days and his wife was there I went back the next morning to see him again he was in his good clothes and they were sitting there and he was smiling and I said uh I says what's up here he says and his wife she said Brother Bruce from the moment that you laid your hand on him yesterday he just improved he was off his oxygen and they've said he can go home you know and yeah I praise the Lord for that it's simple you see we don't have to manufacture anything but one of the things that happened that was really good because this brother actually he struggles with believing he's got faith and so we can always seem to allow the devil to make us think negative thoughts about ourselves amen it's dealt with under the blood then let it stay there don't let him bring it back up to us just deny him that and the day before it's just a little hospital and there was he was in this bed and there was a h a married CHF over in this bed an older married CHF over in this bed here that I just knew he was there you know I just noticed him never talked he never spoke a word so we just talked a little bit and the nurse come in and said uh hey are you guys still here you know we're just talking so we got up and we start to walk out and for the first time this Mar chap over here he just said I thought you'd have what's that word Cara kakia is that the word he says and he just spoke up he says I thought you to have a kakia and I I I hadn't heard well I don't think I'd heard that but I realized what he was saying and I said oh we didn't want to disturb anything we would I was thinking we'd have a prayer out in the carard you know know whatever but this brother who's got no faith and he got got he was using a walker and he just turns and starts to walk over the brother's got no faith starts walking over to this man and I looked at the sister and she looked at me and I smiled and I thought what's going on here and no and this man's going he's talking to him you know you don't need to come over here doesn't even lift his head up just walks over the bed so I says I think we ought have follow him we follow him over and he goes right up to the bed and this this chap in the bed's like he's in a bit of a bad way but you know he's like you you didn't need to come so we walked over there and as I walked over as we walked up to the bed I felt the presence of God and I thought what's going on and I thought this man in The Bard has got some man of some sort you know I thought there's something happening here and the sister the brother's sister she come up and she was beside me here and I put my hand on the brother's shoulder and I just did what i' done before I just said Lord we just take we just thank you for your prom for your honoring your promise to us and I I started to pray the present this presence just come down and I heard the sister she felt it too and she I heard her go like this and I was just praying and I stepped back from him and something caused me to step forward and I put my hand out to this man in the bed and I said I said would you just put your hand in mine and he says you know I you don't know I don't want you to pray for me uh you know just talking about him I said no I I didn't say I was going to pray for you I said I just want you to put your hand in mine and I'm so aware of this presence he put his hand in mine and something happened to him he said I'm Healed I'm Healed and he was healed praise the Lord a man that didn't want prayer a man that just thought you know go through the ritual and it was a ritual and he said something me and he pointed at me and anyway and said something and I thought that's pretty amazing and the sister said to me she says what happened just then and I says what was said you I said don't keep it to yourself I said it just bring confusion to people but I said she said why doesn't that happen in church amen and I says I can't tell you but I was thinking because we get too intellectual and I find when God works a lot of times it's just with one or two okay just Legend don't don't try to figure out how God's got to do it he'll do it according to his word without you even realizing it brother and we walked out to the car and this is a thing that I I just I just always fight against is we shouldn't Elevate man at all amen you know and we W and he walked out and and the sister's walking behind me and the brother goes out to the car and he gets in the passenger seat and he's sitting in the passage seat as we come up she's asking me a few questions and he puts his fing up at me and he's going to and he starts to say something and it's going to elevate me and I says hold on before you go any further hold on before you go any further I says who was it that followed the leading of the Lord to walk over to the man because it wasn't me amen amen that's right I says it was the guy without any faith he goes what I says when you walked over the man you were following the the leading of the Lord amen and you didn't even know it and I says and when the Lord would heal somebody he would put Faith outside how come he would take a faithless man and put him over against a man he's going to heal and the brother come alive he come alive he stopped putting it on other people and he realized that God was using him that God used him to get us to that man that that man might receive this healing amen amen let God work with us in simplicity amen talking about going out and and and and now this is not my time is it I'm not using my time anyway you just don't need to to to get Welling words of wisdom to tell people just go in the name of Jesus Christ he'll work it all out just be open vessels amen hallelujah I've got uh uh PowerPoint there and this is this is shouldn't should still not be my time I just want to my time starts when I when I open with a scripture all right yeah that's cool I I'm joking a little bit but I am always conscious I I don't like long-winded preachers and I don't want to ever be a long-winded preacher but um I want to go through these things to just a I want to go through these things okay can we have it up brother and and in a message why he said about 14 years ago this woman being around about 48 years old came into into the meeting a German Canadian she said the Lord told her in the prayer line through the sermon that she was Barren and the doctors said she would never be able to have a child and said you're suffering from a dreadful disease of tuberculosis so when this woman come up this is what the Holy Spirit through the prophet told her was was her problem and she said that's true sir and I said go to your home for you're are healed of your tab beat and you're going going to embrace a lovely little 8 pound boy baby thus saith the Lord I'm so thankful folks we got to thus sayith the Lord amen amen and she went home and was solid and well and so her TB she was free of a TV she was solid and well all right and the doctor said a case was a retired I guess we'd call it in remission or whatever you like but and so and about after about eight years passed she said she got into a church that told her said sister if it would have been of God it would have happened and she believed them if the about the baby had have been of God it would have happened she said healed of a TB but the second part hasn't come to P to pass and and he says she believed it and as soon as she made a stand against the prophecy she broke out again with the TB because you see the prophecy was a two-part thing and to deny one part is to lose the other Faith doesn't come by healing right right amen Faith doesn't come by healing oh if I just have an experience I've I've heard heard people in the times past if I could just hear from God and sometimes we do hear a little voice amen but when the when the preachers preaching the word of God you are hearing the voice of God when you listen to a CD I have heard the voice of God I know the first tape I 33 years old because there's some faces I've seen before and there's some that I haven't seen before 33 years old Bound in sin when God came to me and pretty much straight away I was given I was given the CD I've heard people say oh you can't give a person this CD or this CD be too too heavy and all that the voice of God speaks to the seed of God inside it don't go working it out don't go working it out the seed of God can take anything from the voice of God and and and my and M and I we were listening to this tape in those days cassette tape and we were crying and we didn't understand hardly anything we just knew we were listening to the voice of God behind the voice and so you know when you s there are songs The Jubilee and everything like that I thought why am I preaching today why why why we just carry on here because that's was a preaching going on sorry uh and she broke out again with TB and went and then the preacher not aiming to I don't believe he said I was a psychiatrist I was a mind reader I was just reading what was on her mind and a loyal husband stood up and said but he told her thus sayith the Lord and the preacher laughed at him and his wife took to the bed with TB I was up in Northern British Columbia on a hunting trip coming to down from Inon I stopped in about 2 hours and after the service a man came up and he said brother brandom I'll give you my overcoat and I said aren't you brother doble and he said I am I says the welfare of the wife this is the man you see he says the welfare of your wife and he said brother brandom told me the story she's real bad with TB I said why did she doubt it he said well brother brandom it lingered so long she begin to doubt she doubted about the baby she had a healing of the TB but she doubted about the baby and listen to this see this is this is what is our promise he said I don't care how much he doubts I saw the vision Saints you have doubts and and different things going on a proper to God says I don't care about your doubts I saw the vision Amen brother brandham had a vision of the Bride walking perfectly in line any of you ever have doubts right oh well then I can't be part of it he saw her walking perfectly right on Amen but he didn't care about our doubts I saw the vision Hallelujah I saw the vision she was holding a big plumpy baby boy it shall come to pass regardless of what she says or what she thinks because God's already said so the a vision cannot be hinded it can't be hinded by your doubts it can't be hinded by the days you down because because actually our faith isn't in here our faith is in the soul realm our faith is locked up it's just this battlefield that gives us problems about two two two years ago or three we was up in Prince Albert saskat you and a telegram came in Mrs doel was on her Road up there within the space of three days of having a baby and they brought her in a special car because of her at that age they was afraid she could not go through it I prayed for her and she said one thing brother brandom I confess my unbelief but said one thing I want to ask you for confirmation you said it would be a boy I said it will be a boy see the prophet had so much faith in the vision he said it will be a boy and it was just after they could return home she had an 8 pound baby boy that's running around in Canada today uh tonight of a mother over 50 years old because God keeps his word he never fails Saints it's not the the Rapture is not relying on us we see ourselves in in that promise and then Satan's going to thresh you whatever he can to try to but it the the vision cannot fail amen praise God for that amen healing doesn't come by faith if I could just have a have a healing in my life if I if if this happened to me I'd believe God no we believe God by the hearing by the word amen now another thing I want to bring and and uh it's on my heart it was on my heart to bring it after hearing the songs I thought why am I but we'll we'll get a attack and people say things about this message and Satan causes people to say things even within it and many say we' gone on from the prophet and either blatantly or subtly they'll they'll infer things and one of one of the things that the usually the reason one way or another they bring it is that the prophet represented the law and we're now following the ministry of Joshua and you'll get many many preachers even around a message that was saying you know I'm the josa ministry brother Brandon was Moses and we gone on from that and it's said it's Joshua and they'll take parts of quotes and take them out of context and say you know um I'm here for the perfecting of the bride and so forth we are under Joshua but I want us to have a look what these people are saying because it's not right and in the message Paradox he says about two few years ago he said I would take a Bible and hey folks if I say something I'm just an old man I notice there everybody around here is Young you know I don't know why you let me in um this is a youth group and I see these Dynamic young preachers and brothers and new Dynamic people and the sing Dynamic and I think why you want an old guy like me in here that's one you let me in I must have got special dispensation or something all right but if I say something you know and you have a query on it or you don't hey we're brothers and sisters just allow me just just allow me something you know just say poor old guy's in his dotage and you know but we'll find a bed for him afterwards or something like that you know he's out of his mind but the these things are so real and true to me you know and and I know I know the heart of brother Ben so if I say something wrong please just forgive me and you know you you get brother Ben will put it right he'll doctor you I would take a bible let you hand me the the Bible when I first started my Ministry and would just take your Bible just hold it open like that and say Lord where is this message to me and I if I can put it in my words where am I in this message where can I find me in this message it opened to Joshua the first chapter any Bible you'd hand me he said it will open to Joshua first chapter for him until one night a vision came and I seen that Bible that Bible come down from heaven and a hand with a collar on cuff on a cuff uh like this went went down the first nine verses of Joshua just skipping down now we find Joshua representing Grace or some propitiation that it could not exist in the same time that law was in existence neither does any message that forwards people on ever coincide with a past message it will not do it that's where you have the trouble today and Joshua could not at all come into his ministry until after Moses is gone and this is what people have has told me I was getting this in 83 1983 from the time I come to this message from the time I come to the Lord I was seeing that God in my heart was putting emphasis and the and the the prophet of God became my anchor and people would say things like Oh Brother Bru you got to keep your balance and every time they go like this you got to keep your balance I go yeah you're balance because everybody has an agenda it seems okay and and and I just say this to Mar the other day I says you know the balance because I would never tell you you need my balance I just trust into God that his grace will keep me in it amen because because some would have me not go as far as I've gone to keep the balance others would have me go further than what I've gone to keep the balance and they're out of balance and I said to my I says you know the balance this is just the other day I says the Holy Ghost is a balance amen the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the one that gives us a witness inside it's not been able to explain my balance but the Holy Ghost and it just keep your balance if I say something wrong just keep the balance I trust I won't this's another problem I have is memory I don't know where I was at oh yeah come into his ministry until Moses is gone so you see the very first verse here Moses my servant is dead now arise and take this people to the promised land Moses representing the law had served its time they started out and this is wonderful thing they started out really with grace to begin with before they had law they had Grace that atonement had been provided before there was any law what do we say by the law by Grace was said by Grace the atonement was made before any law amen Grace was be was before law during law and after law so there was Mo there was Joshua representing Grace was right along with law but could not be enforced as long as law was in its proper place Joshua here today is a type of the last day Ministry and this is what people use but but let's keep the balance now remember those three stages of the journey all of it ceased first the law and everything had to ceased so that Joshua and Joshua is the same word as Jesus Jehovah savior that took them from their Wilderness into the promised land and to encapsulate this I'm going to take a quote out of the out of the supernatural book six bring it all together and it said ever since that day in 1952 The Prophet had known he had known that his ministry would somehow parallel the ministry of Joshua amen that's right when I come to this come to the Lord and he brought me into this message and we were singing these songs that Jubilee and I and and I haven't heard that song before but I just loved it and I love the songs you're singing okay but people sing these songs about how we're brought out of that and they and they apply that to the prophet but they say it was law I never saw the prophet as law I never saw the prophet as law I could not I could not I had no witness of their bound the ones that would say oh he's this he's that we've gone on and so forth sure the bride's Moving on but I tell you what it's his message it's his Storehouse that keeps opening up and opening up and opening up and feeding my soul right and I I tell you what oh used my T this is such a glorious message it's all locked in it and God is opening it up and people are going past that where they can't get anything opening up more so what do they do they open something else up that's not the word of God and suddenly the man becomes something hallelujah hallelujah I haven't been run off yet and a message uh no for no no go just just go back one brother I'll I'll just read this out no get oh yeah that's it fine just hold it there I haven't got this honor just it was just come to me when I was sitting in the car some I preached the other day in a message be not afraid of it as I brother brah said God so loved you when you was a sinner an alien away from God an enemy of the Commonwealth of God he so loved you that he gave his life for you sure if you get a spirit in you if you get a spirit in you that you're better than someone else then you're worse than anybody else I know of am I've seen churches that think they're the better one of they're the best Church in the country I've seen people I've seen ministers that think they're the best Minister I've heard them say it over pulpits to the folks you know well who would be the best Minister and I'm going what am I hearing here where do we come from with this I I just want to let the Lord check me I don't want to but I I I feel as I was sitting in amongst a bunch of ministers about 80 months ago and one of the it was it wasn't a New Zealand Pastor don't go thinking who it was it wasn't a pastor from New Zealand but I heard this this Minister say because you know that the pastors of the Tree of Life and the and the deacons and the deacons are the cherubin they guide the people to the Tree of Life they took it away from the prophet they took it away from Jesus Christ and and now and now I've heard and I tell you what I got up I walked away I looked around I thought I see everybody and I got up and walked away because I thought I'm going to say something here because this is so so wrong the spirit was wrong and I walked away I never went back they had a series of meetings and I never went back to another one I heard that that one that said it now has been saying things where back home that people are ringing up even brother Vin do you go along with what this man's saying you see once you start away from a balance once you start elevating especially of it's yourself you're just going to go further and further off the taret Saints just stay with a simple gospel amen I told you I'd come feeling nervous but when I sitting at the back even before the song service I just started feeling really nice because there was an atmosphere coming in with the folks he sister I I agree when you were saying that and i' I've been here before I don't get invited very often but I I but I don't know why I I think brother Ben doesn't want me to get too happy but amen all right okay now my time starts we're going to could we stand and read a scripture amen remember I I got I got at least another 20 minutes from what it really says on the clock just pray for me please because uh I will really want to get to the end but and we'll just pray and we'll go to Revelations a one and uh well let's just pray first Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just thank you for your presence and Lord It's a a very welcoming atmosphere Lord we we we experience and father God we believe you're here in your midst not because of any funny Sensations or that but father God you you said you'd be here Lord in the midst of us and Lord with all our heart we just hold your word we we lord I we I just thank you with all my heart that you did send a prophet you Lord father God not to not to just use it as a cliche but father God where would we be we could see nothing and Lord we have an anchor for our souls it's so wonderful and it's not the man it's Jesus Christ in the man Lord that you used that vessel you made it so obedient to your to your needs Lord and we we're the recipients of that wondrous Grace just pray you take this now help me Father God not to digress or anything but Lord if there be a question in any anybody's heart just pray that there might be an answer come in Jesus name amen amen God bless you Saints and I I you may be seated oh no we haven't read the scripture I'm getting too excited and I turned to see the voice that spake with me in because we know this is John speaking and John is the type of the Bride amen and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like under the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the pets with a golden GLE his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like under fine brass and they burned as if they burned in a furnace and his voice is a sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as a sun shineth in his strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I'm the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I'm alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and death write the things which thou which thou has seen and the the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter The Mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sest in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks the Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks which thou sest are the seven churches amen may the Lord had his bless the reading of his word may be seated and so we we we got here and and John had John has walked with Jesus for for for a period of time when he was here in the flesh and he's walked with him and he's had a wonderful time with him and he and he's beloved of Jesus and and he's and he's sat with him and he's and he's ate with him and he's rested his head upon his chest he loves him so much and this is this is John now is having an experience into another realm so just walking with Jesus is not enough but yet he had a wonderful time walking with him but when he sees the when he sees Jesus is he really is he says when I saw him is the one he he' lean on the his bosom he lean on his chest he heard his heartbeating R but when he saw him like this he said I fell as one dead prophet of God just comes to me prophet of God when he was with brother Bisal he says every time he comes to me like that he says it's just like I could have died you know and so there was times when we were rejoicing in that in the Lord but there's times when he comes personally to us and it's just like I could have died you know so that mystery of the Seven Stars which th sawest in my right hand the the Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches could we go to Isaiah now Isaiah 9 2 and 67 yeah the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath the light shined For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder just these just this in mind I I'm going to call this the government shall be upon the shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace his name should be called counselor if you want counseling you need to get to Jesus Christ amen amen when you go to your pastor don't go you know brother Ben I really need some counseling and expect brother B just come the right man but you're saying Lord when I go to to my brother because this is the way you order things Lord you are the government the government of the church you're the government of the body you're the government of my life and Lord I believe that you can take that vessel because I'm I'm I'm respecting what you're doing I'm not elevating The Vessel but Lord I believe that's the way you work you have a way of working it keep it simple and I believe that you could cause brother Ben to say something that would help me amen okay the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government the government's on his shoulder but of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end so his government isn't flatlining it's increasing that's right of the increase of his government there should be no end and his peace and his government brings peace there there there are so many people want to take us back into law and there is no peace in law because law kth right upon the throne of David upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with just with judgment and with Justice from henceforth even forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this and so we see this and this is in the Old Testament and they're talking about this and brother brandham said that tells us that the first Bible was written in the heavens so the Bible we're reading now must align with the heavens because that's the original pattern amen already inscribed in the heavens so I want to entitle this the government shall be upon his shoulder so keep that in mind Psalms 91 to6 now I I was telling Brother Andy I I preached this not this message but I preached what I thought was this message back in and it might have been the late 80s or 9s so but I don't want I'm not saying that that you think oh so we're going to get old sty food but something I that happened um at her brother Marcus Becker from Germany as last Miss in 2015 when I saw you guys last uh said something to me it just spoke to me reminded me of of the of a message that I preached that I called this back then and and and then so come into my mind and then something happened I I heard somebody telling folks nonsense and I thought that's that's not message that's not right and it brought me back to this okay and uh and and but I couldn't I couldn't find out any archives so I had to do it all over again and I was seeing things I never saw in the first place of was government there should be no end we see things in the message now that we never saw for those of you that go back a long way we never saw it back then I mean you fresh people you just got it all over us we had to stagger through into we're old and and people come in and US seeing what it's taking us this amount of time to see so some haven't come on the journey some have gone on further because they got where they think to a placees but there is a wonderful balance in this man in in the word of God and in this Prophet if we keep him in in the place he's in he's he's my Joshua God through him but he's my Joshua he's not Moses I'm Not Looking Back saying yeah he just preach law amen a Psalm of David the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork day unto Day utth speech and night unto night showeth knowledge there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard their line and and the in the Amplified version says their voice in evidence is gone through all the Earth and their words to the end of the Earth in them hath he said set a tabernacle for the son so this is his handiwork in the heavens and it says there's no speech nor language where the voice is not heard and and that's exactly true the Seven Stars and all those things that are talking about there were people that I was talking to about this and they says I says Ah that's Miki and suddenly God has talked to all languages right which is bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoices as a strong man to run a race his going forth is from the end of heaven and a circuit and it means Circuit of time space under the ends of it there's nothing hid from the heat thereof so everything is written in the heavens and I tell you what that's the first the first Bible now this Bible we have now man can do all sorts of things to try and corrupt it but he can't take away from the original and the original has an influence still has an influence right we say the Bible we open it it has an influence on our life the first one has an influence that our minds and our thinking and everything can't dissipate it influences our life to the to the Natural man the Bible is just ink on paper it was to me I just thought it went before I knew the Lord I thought yeah yeah it's just a whole lot of me and I used to have an argument with a charismatic man that used to testify to me and he would just testify simply and I'd go if somebody and you feel a little connection and he's going now you know I don't believe that don't lose heart this man stayed with me I'd see him once a month for two or three years he'd be saying he just dropping something like that just he wouldn't push it and I go oh you know I don't believe that I didn't feel animosity to him I just didn't believe that you know and one day after his perseverance and because he didn't give up on me after the first try or the second try but probably around about somewhere around about the 12th 15th try see Faith cometh by hearing by the word I went and something made kind of sense but I didn't understand what but the Sons and Daughters of God it it becomes life it's just ink on paper but when to sons and daughter it becomes life amen it's a living reality just like God's first Bible in the heavens is alive and moving into positions of influence from the different for the different seasons so does the Bible and so the heavens we think we can think just I I can't comprehend it we can think what a wonderful thing that God throughout those stars and put them in their in their positions and and we think that's a wonderful thing right but it past my even thinking what a wonderful thing it is to think that when he put them there they're not static and they're moving constant they're alive constantly moving and it's and not only are they moving but he perfectly ordained them that at certain times there's an alignment made and and so when those Magi were gone down to following that start to say Jesus they were excited because they had seen in the F in the [Music] heavens that this is the time when we read that Bible here this is the time Messiah is born yeah I didn't go down thinking oh oh that's interesting let's see where that leads they' seen that this is the time because the heavens had moved into a place at a specific that's wondrous to me that is mindboggling the billions of stars and there different influences on each other and God has it that from this little tiny planet that there's going to be be predestinated seed to look up and say and be influenced by it yeah amen and there's another season to come and it's and and stars coming into alignment and prominence to declare it's time for the voice of the seventh angel that's right right and brother Bram goes down and and the medium this is even before he comes into his ministry and this this woman says you got to I can tell you when you were born and he's like no you come you I can tell you when you were born you're born on such and such a day at such and such a time how do you know that that's right because there's a star amen is it what about me mate no no no there's nothing there she predestinated and SS of God I believe I believe that there were certain stars coming into alignment that you were born on a certain day not to be a prophet but to be a Son of God to realize your place and go and God says it's time for influence on on Ben's life it's time for an influence on Naomi's life and something was there all the time and God says it's it's time for an influence on this sister's life this brother's life it's time for an influence it's time for them to come into recognition of who they have been all along and we can say he did you see your name in the Bible but if it's in this Bible it's got to be in there too amen that's right hallelujah hallelujah I I preached this at a at a at a this is where brother Bram says if you think you're been than somebody else I preached this at a little church i' just been gone to abouted every two or three weeks and they're all new people and I tell you what I get more drawing from them than at some places I preach that have been around for a long time and know everything CU they're hungry right and when I started preaching this and I'm going to go into the into pades and they said they they they don't they don't know about they don't know about they in churches sit like this and keep very quiet still because that's the rules and so they haven't leared that the rules and the laws of the church so they're a bit noisy and they're getting quite and and and and and they're getting carried away and and I'm getting a little excited believe it or not you know yeah you say hey man that old guy's passed time for Dynamics and all that but I was getting excited because because it was a real drawing of the spirit not nonsense in the church but but they were really drawing on because because the voice of the planets is H in every nation and when I started talking about pades they said that's that's Miki and when I started talking about the sweet influences and that and then now they're aligning with Miki they says do you know afterwards they said do you know Mar rii is the start of the Mari New Year and the sweet influences of a new start and they got really excited they started getting me excited because I thought look at that I'm preaching the word and they're saying yes this is the word voices heard in every nation right down to New Zealand those stars have an influence people were already seeing this and the word Miki uh is uh it it literally means said I looked it up in a mar thing online it says it literally means the eyes of God matariki the eyes of God it's wonderful isn't it uh job n if we go to the next one brother I'm I'm I'm I'm sorry I'm just going to have to rush through these much faster than what I what I want to if I can then job answered and said I know it is so of a truth but how how should a man be just with God if he will contend with him he cannot answer him one in a thousand he is wise in heart and mighty in strength who ha hardened himself against against him and Prophets and as Prosper so he's he's talking with these guys and he's in in this but he says how can we argue you against God and prosper tell me who's done it who's ever gone against God and prospered which alone verse eight says which alone spread out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves of the sea which maketh Arcturus Orion and pleades and the chambers of the south in job 38:31 it says who can th bind the sweet influences of pleades or loose the bands of Orion can't th bring forth mezoth in the season or can't th guide aror with his sons knowest thou the ordinances of Heaven Can thou set the Dominion thereof in the earth so he's saying can man do this because he's saying God put it up there to have dominion and influences in its time and they come into place and being and and and they have influence and he says man can't do that God's placed them up there and so we find that when he's looking talking about these things and Orion is a type of Christ the the son of Iran has a serpent that's biting his heel but he's got control and it's it's it's actually a deacon part of of of the Star Sign tourus okay but but but he brings ples into it we noce he brings pades and he says they have a sweet influence those that cluster of stars have a sweet influence and the sweet influence is upon the Sons and Daughters of God numbers 23 just bear with with me I know I'm going fast I for me it's fast brother you put an old graft to us into the into the F and even that the fact that's moving that's fast and I know brother Ben or Brother Andy could have got up here and all I've done is they could have whipped through in 10 minutes they go hey let's go and have lunch but but you know I'm just a I just said all afterward and the Lord met balum I I don't want you to think I just keep it simple don't think I'm trying to confuse you I'm not um I'll only confuse myself but but but I want you I want to lead up to a picture all right and I want us to see what we follow and and who we are the Lord bent bam and put a word in his mouth and said go again unto BAC and say thus and he came in to him behold he stood by his burn offering the princes of Moab with him BAC said unto him what have the Lord spoken took up his Parable and said rise up BAC and hear haken un me th Son of zapor God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken and shall he not make it good it's like brother Brandon was saying a vision can't fail I don't care what you think I don't care what she doubts I don't care what she thinks a vision Can't Fail amen please take heart in what I brought there at the beginning because this woman had thus saith the Lord this bride has thus sayith the Lord this woman was thus sayth the Lord even even when she got a healing she still doubt the other part in that because we're still in this cursed human makeup but we have thus say the Lord and that's more than this Hallelujah behold I have received commandment to bless and he ha blessed and I cannot reverse it you want me to curse him but I have received Comm and because of what God has made me even though I I'm I'm I'm after gold and and and and everything like that and I'm easily influenced but when it comes to God I can't say except what he puts in my mouth I can't reverse it amen he says and then he goes in he says he hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel the Lord his God is with them and the shout of the king is among them and in the Amplified it says God hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob for He Is Forgiven amen yes sir Hallelujah not because he suddenly got good amen that's right not because he picked his game up amen that's right but he is Forgiven I don't see iniquity there because he is Forgiven he has come to me and I and said Lord I am that man GL but Lord if you could just show me mercy and God shows him mercy and he says he's not that man anymore he's forg neither has he seen Mischief of perverseness in Israel for the same reason because he's forgiven anything that you do it anything that God does for you anything that God sees good in you is because you are forgiven not because you're big or something like that and you strut around God hates that every bit of Glory goes to him amen hallelujah in numbers uh we I just feel God verse 22 God has brought them out of out of Egypt he has as it were the strength of a unicorn surely there is no enchantment against Jacob neither is there any divination against Israel according to the time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel what God wrought and the word unicorn there is RAM and and we're going to get into what Ram is and and and people have all different ideas of what a unicorn is and little kids know what a unicorn is it's a little pink horse with a golden snout you know and some people think it's uh you know hey if I if if you've got any pet Theory and I I say something against your pet Theory you look just forgive me and hold your pet theory if you want to I I saw this when my son is uh older than what he was I can't remember I think he's about 40 coming up 40 39 or 40 but as a little boy in tanaki he called us into his room and he given his heart to the Lord at 7 years old and uh and he called us into his bedroom we're out the country and he's pointing out the window and he wanted us to see something and we went to the window and we looked up and be without him pointing out we just saw what he was pointing at he was pointing at pades and it was extremely bright and where we lived there was no city lights or anything around and we were looking at pades and something struck my heart and we'd only known the Lord maybe a year or two and something struck my heart I know I didn't preach about it for another 10 or 15 years but but something struck in my heart that that had an influence there was something about that I'm not a stargazer astrologer anything like that I don't have a big telescope at home but there was something in that that struck my heart and I an affinity with it I felt a connection and I couldn't understand it if you said what do you mean I couldn't I couldn't tell you all I knew was it was a connection I felt this drawing this connection I put it aside and and then some years later it came back to me when I was reading the scripture and and God reminded me of that connection as it were a unicorn now uh the next one where are we now I've tried to cut this down go and so in numbers it's once again God brought him forth out of Egypt he hath as it were the strength of a unicorn of AR he shall eat up the Nations his enemies and shall break their bones and Pierce them through with his arrows and that has a and we'll look at it a bit later but the word REM there and I've heard ministers say it's a rhinoceros well when we look at the word Unicorn through the it it that word doesn't mean rhinoceros actually when we look at through there we see some scriptures that actually identify and help us to see what this R is but it means the Primeval Ox it was actually an ox and uh and it and because it's as far as they know it's extinct now then then man thinks well if it's not around where it can't be but it was and Julius Caesar H and so forth we'll get into that a little bit uh in time now the sign if we go to the next one this is this is the ARX this is what we call as Taurus and this is the rim this is the Oro whatever you like but this is the rim and so if it's in God's Bible it's got to be in the heavens and this is where it's in the heavens and and it and it's Taurus is the Judgment the Judgment that's what it means in the great judgment period which begins at the house of God by catching way of God's just hold it on there for a while Brother Andy uh and uh sorry it begins at the house of God by the catching away of God's ready and waiting bride to himself in the Heavenly regions and then breaks in Fury upon the ungodly population still left on Earth so this is the time of the Judgment God's going to take his people and then comes the judgment and then it is that Jehovah's enemies Shall Perish and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered and the the Horn of the seed of the woman shall be exalted like the Horn of the rim to fulfill his desire upon his foes which is which is the precise seene pictorial pictorial represented in the sign of Taurus the names in the sign in Hebrew AR Arabic Syria Latin and Greek mean the same as the English name the bull it so the voice goes to all the heaven you know through all through all the Earth but the figure is not that of the common bull or of any known class the horns are greater and differently set from those of domestic cattle the attitude and energy displayed are likewise far fiercer and more Nimble than the common arc ever shows so we have the scripture then of in Psalms the voice of the Lord break of the seed is yay the Lord break the seed is the Lebanon he Mak them also to skip like the calf like a cal Lebanon and Syria like a young unicorn um rhinoceroses don't skip if you thought it was a rhinoceros or somebody's telling you the rhinoceros you no they don't skip but oxes do I've been I've been a farmer most of my life and uh and I tell you what you see cars skipping and and and and sometimes they're just out there and the Sun starts to warm them up and they're just walking and the next minute it looks like they have a fit they're just skipping around with a exuberance of Youth amen that's only a past memory for me but but but youth has exuberance unless it's buried on Facebook or something but these days but in my day yeah we were outside all the time when we were young you couldn't keep us inside beo foot and muddy amen so it's not some mythological fantasy created in the mind of man and this is what man's mind comes up with also that is not a unicorn that is that to me is a travesty because that's satanic that's bringing into because it's taking the word of God you know it might seem as humorous and and and in a way it is but in another way it's it's ungodly it's Satan going I am going to take the word of God and I'm going to transform and if they can't believe it's a unicorn then I'll make it some myth some Fantastical creature with a go horn of gold and and all that and then then because Satan wants to work on the young children then he comes then he comes to a uh to another one next one brother and so for the children he makes it this and and we get get it for the kids and you know and hey you're not going to hell if you got one for your kids but I wouldn't get one for your kids now brother BR I was going to buy one this weekend my little Georgia I kind of wouldn't and uh I I kind of think we might have had one for our kids way back so that all popular you know but but it's just Satan pulling down God it's just another father Christmas it's a Santa Claus it's it's just nonsense amen we've got such a pure word of God it's just another way that Satan amans and ridicules the word of God is the it is the REM of the T the Oro the bull of your the fierce Mighty and untamable Wild Bull of the Prime Evil Ages and a most expressive symbol AS Christ as the irresistible and angry judge the mighty creatures is now as far as not entirely extinct what once common in North uh Western Asia or Syria and and middle Europe remains of it have been have of late years been discovered in the north of Palestine and Julius Caesar in the account of his Wars describes it as being hunted in the something forest in his day it was known as the Primeval ARX or while built different altogether from the Bison of the great anop sometimes taking for it it was a formidable animal scarcely less this is from history this is from the ones that saw it scarcely less than an elephant in size this was huge but in nature color and form a true Ox its strength and speed were very great and was so Fierce that it did not spear man or beast when it caught sight of them this was an animal that even if captured as a cal could never be domesticated by man to me it's a perfect type of Christ because you cannot man cannot domesticate Christ amen man tries and he tries and he tries to bring people under his influence to to to realize that you know this is Christ and they put him in a box and Christ like this Ox he just breaks it a free Hallelujah I I this is this is just Bru I I believe this is the Lord but this B is me because I can't I can't show you in the Scripture it is but when I when I see this with these horns and then I go to zedekiah who is under an anointing with all his men they're having a convention another thing too that comes to my mind is when zedekiah and all these are having this wonderful anointed I mean inspiration flowing M wasn't with them ever thought of that M wasn't he hadn't attended the convention but they having this wonderful thing and then zedekiah under this anointing and under this impression forms himself a pair of horns and said we're going to drive this is this is just bro but I believe that because they were there in his day that he fashioned those horns after the or after the ram because that was what they do you couldn't domesticate it in Job 3 39 and 9-2 it says will the Unicorn be willing to serve thee or abide by th crib can thou bind the unicorn with his Bandon in the F will he Harrow the fields valleys after the you know it's talking about because that's what they did they used oxes to do it but he's saying you can't domesticate this thing can you can you use it for plowing can you do work with it you can't do work with it will th believe him that he'll bring home thy seed and gather into thy Barn I'm just I'm just feeling time gone there now can you give me a bit more time fine Brother B if it's just getting too long just get up and go cut you know if you suddenly see me flat down they go like that you know that brother Ben's just stood up right and if you need hey if you're getting tired of me you know I'm just a normal guy you know just stand up and you need to stretch your legs I just and sit down again that'll be fine with me I don't want to tie you out I'm very conscious of that um in the days of Julia Caesar that the the hunters it would be a massive thing if they could if they could kill one and what they used to do the main one was to dig big pits and kill it in the pit because you didn't want to go up against it with a horse on that and and fair enough hey it's a it's nearly the size of an elephant but it's got horns and and so so people were yeah they they'd parade the horns around if they could kill one they'd take the horns off he was a hero he killed a he killed the a unicorn and so this terrific animal appears here in that in that what we were looking that sign we're looking at dashing forth with Swift and impetuous energy and with his great sharp horn set as if to run through everything that comes in its way the Egyptian called it by name signifying the head the captain the mighty Chieftain who cometh this is the Egyptians so this is this is not just Israel but there was seeing it in the same way you know the chief star in the sign is situated in the bullseye and it name alabon means the captain leader or Governor the middle part and the middle and hinder part of the enraged animal includes the body of the enthroned Lamb out of which it seems to rise so Taurus is coming out of the lamb and if we could go to the next one I've Circle that there that's that's Aries that's the that's the lamb and this this this might judgment is actually coming out of the Lamb amen when John walked with Jesus he leaned on the bosom of the lamb but when he saw him with those eyes are like furnaces of fire and so forth he was seeing this guy amen we can't keep Jesus a Doty but to us he's the lamb amen yes sir but to the enemy is the mighty Ram is this is this okay amen I preach this in this little church that that that's um this is my time gone but in a little church I've gone to and the brother and the sister were sitting behind a couple that were probably in their late 30s early 40s and I still getting really excited and as I was bringing this the they told me afterwards the two people sitting in front of them like going to the church for the atmosphere and that but actually didn't see their emphasis upon a prophet of God and as I was preaching this they saw the people in front of them ah and it was this not talking about a prophet of God but this that they realized how important the prophet of God is this remarkably interprets with the reference to Christ in his church and the anger which he is to visit the Wicked World after the Church of the firstborn has been safely landed in heaven toward his church he's the lamb but towards the unsanctified world he finally becomes a terrible RAM and we see something else quite striking in connection with the sign among the Earthly Nations there was a widespread idea connecting this bull with the Deluge the flood and the pades the Seven Stars the dove the pecul star cluster of sweet influences with the with the Ark of no and those say but and that's where they they went with no the Judgment but we know by the word of God that that's not that's not the case and so they they uh but right through the world they were seeing these things and trying to put it up the Seven Stars which the scriptures connected with with Christ in Revelations 1:16 are on the back of this bull high up on its shoulder and the government shall be upon his shoulder where the thing right where the government and this is where that's where the government resides the Seven Stars that were in his hand signifying Christ control of those Seven Stars remember in in in Revelation we read that that it when he saw this Vision he said and in his right hand were seven stars and I fell as one dead and what did God do he puts his right hand on him and says fear not the right hand that's got the Stars he puts it on him type it John type of the bride and he says puts the Stars on him and says fear not fear not you're reing my governance I am a fearful God but to my bride don't fear me but I'm going to give you governance to lead you and to guide you not by laws not by laure in any way but I'm going to give you government to allow you to follow me that you can go back to and say what am I to do here and well well sister I I I you know I wouldn't catch you here you know it's not law but God brought Grace to us Amen in the form of his Prophet which was his government government for the bride that's why Satan wants to use man to try to deal with it to break it away from us to break us away from that government I I like what brother Marcus said sorry I'm gonna reverence brother Marcus but I I just I just C I was going through something oh man my Thum I was going through something with with and and a brother rich Richard Oliver was staying with me over th the days of the convention and something happened and and I said Brother Richard when brother Marcus Bea preached his last message I knew he was under inspiration okay and he prayed for some people and I said Richard he's under inspiration I'm going up and not saying anything and brother Marcus come down Richard knew what my my question was brother marus come down and and I said Just prayed for my brother and I was waiting for it I was I was trying to draw it Lord I want to hear from you because I want to know and he prayed for me when I went back to Brother Richard he says because he wasn't far away he was just sitting there just sitting there he said did I hear him say what I thought he said I says you sure did he addressed it you see the government should be upon his shoulder but one of the things that he said was and I have a struggle with is that people I talk with people and they say and I said Hey Brother B never said that yeah he did I said no he he didn't you know the balance is on our inside we got to have a witness and I thought I don't witness you know maybe I haven't I haven't read everything but or or got a memory that I can but it didn't witness with the message that I follow and I says and and and and his brother older brother he says he did I said no no he didn't and then a sister that was sitting there was about four people with me she said I just read it two days ago and I said because saints of God there's no way I want to tell you something that the prophet didn't say and also I don't want to say he didn't say something that he did say so I said to them still without a witness in my heart I says can you forgive me and how I've missed that but all the time I saying Lord why why aren't I feeling your your witness they went to make a cup of tea and I said I'll just sit here and I I went through my iPad and I I looked and I narrowed the field down and I and I and I tried to find it I went in and I says brother can you tell me where he says that I can't find it he says well maybe he didn't say it maybe somebody else said it and I thought I went through agonies even not having a witness I were right but but I went in case I'd said something the prophet said one way or the other see that's how important it is to me but to this brother well maybe somebody didn't care Saints I hold us dear to me my life is resting upon this and then and the sister and I looked at her and I says but well no no it wasn't by the brother she said she read in a message book okay she said message books to me she said well no it wasn't one of brother brother brandom's message books it was some other preacher message book and then brother and it was just before and brother Marcus come up and he says you know I don't have anybody write my books print my my I man you're a man off my own heart oh we've got a message that God said to a prophet stor up in my Storehouse he didn't say Bruce mcke you need to make another storehouse he says to me you need to feed from my Storehouse I've got there amen it's wonderful we've got a governor am we got a counselor amen amen and it's all in Grace this is a message of Amazing Grace giving government leadership to his bride can we go see if we got another one I'm get yeah see now this here is is plates up in there behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord he shall turn the heart of the children to their fathers he that's singular am if I preach my own message it ain't going to do a thing for your hearts amen when Elisha when Elijah was um going to leave and and the prophet said he he kept saying you stay say here the way I'm gone is too narrow it's too hard it's too narrow and Elisha says I'm going with you and and and the other ones the GU say don't you know the Lord's going yeah keep your peace I'm going with them all the way you know and the prophet says and I I kind of like it liking it to when sister had he right you know brother brand says you just said the ask whatever you want well Elijah said to Elisha type of the Bride he says ask whatever you want amen I believe Elijah could have asked anything the thing that he wanted most because he'd walk with him he says what I want is your spirit saints of God now we all ministered different than that but what I look for when I'm listening when I'm hearing a brother preach or hearing somebody say something to me or anything like that I'm looking to am I seeing the spirit of Elijah of Elijah and brother and I've got no time to go into it but you'll know and brother BR says God just so loved that spirit and that's there was the love it was the seed of God and it said I just so love that Spirit Hallelujah so with brother BR up there and this is the oncoming judgment no wonder he could scream out warnings of judgment to uh to A A Dying World in former and latter rign he said brother it's unsettled peace everywhere the nations are unsettled the church don't know what to do the people don't know what to do it's unrest what's the matter it's oncoming judgment he's sitting there he's govering and he said bride you don't want to be in front of those horns you want to be part of the Lamb that this has risen out of amen he says oh how look look listen to this here's a prophet of God seeing the judgments coming he says oh how comfortable it is am to see the oncoming judgments and feel that Comfort feeling of the Holy Spirit hear them talk of atomic bombs and just think what happens a peace that passes understanding amen that's what you were looking for sister W it and your testimony that's what you were looking for if this be right where's the peace amen Satan will try to take your peace away but where's the peace Lord if this of you where's the peace CU every time it's him he says fear not so it means he he he brings some things on us that is quite fearful but he says it's me fear not amen when I first come to the Lord and I and I and I went to my first house meeting and and I'm sitting there in the meeting and uh and uh a sister started speaking in tongues I I never even see I'm Bray I don't nothing and I'm sitting here and somebody a sister start speaking in tongues and I go what the will have I got myself into and as sweet voice come and says don't worry it's me see see if we don't understand something if it's him he'll say don't worry it's me I didn't have to understand what was going on I come to understanding later but I did he he if a relationship is with him he will bring peace he will let us know Hallelujah why the bum won't no more go out of the gun we all people uh oh what a wonderful thing brother let's just go down a few now to uh Isaiah 34 yeah come come come near your Nations and here how can you people let the Earth here and all that there is in the the world and and on all things that come forth of it for the indignation of the Lord is upon All Nations his Fury upon all their armies he hath utterly destroyed them he hath delivered them to the slaughter their slain also shall be cast out their stink shall come out of the carcass and the mountains shall be melted with their blood and the unicorns the Reams the precise animal that constitutes the figur and tourist shall come down with them and and the Bullocks with the bulls and their land shall be soaked with blood their dust made fat with fatness for it is the day of the Lord's Vengeance and the and the year of recompenses to the controversy of Zion in Deuteronomy just hold it there just the thoughts come no no no it's all right it's right just bear with me don't look at that Joshua is Grace Moses is LA Joshua goes into into Jericho and he takes the people into Jericho and they take Jericho right Grace and and Grace says to the two spices says go and get the hot and not just a harlot this is Grace we can see this he is not just the Harlot but a family and everything and bring them to me right and we go see that's great Lord she's aot she's not only aot she's not even part of Israel she should be killed by Grace saves the hot and her family with the red thread and they won a great Victory on this massive City and then Joshua sends people down to to a town of a place of a city of AI I don't care how you spell pronounce it doesn't matter but but he sends them down and they go down and they come back and they says hey don't send a whole lot down it's just a little city after the victory we' had here this is easy peasy two 3,000 take it easy because they had this wonderful Victory but while they're having this wonderful Victory aen takes to the accursed thing right and so Joshua sends them down just two or 3,000 and to this little easy peasy place and this little easy peasy place routs them and 36 men die none die in Jericho but in this little easy peasy bit of warfare and and they come back and Joshua is is distraught and Joshua lays on his face and he's saying Lord why did we even come across Jordan amen if you got the Holy Spirit and you have time you say Lord what is this happening don't let Satan tell you you haven't got the Holy Spirit the holy spirit in Joshua amen could start the question and so when we hear of Joshua we're talking of Joshua we see of Joshua and the scriptures we just see this mighty man of God he's Victorious and he is but it doesn't mean he doesn't have moments moments of trial hen yourself with that I just want to encourage you don't let that devil cause your cause the doubt that he can bring into your Battlefield to cause you to wonder whether you even got the holy spirit amen and God says to Joshua he says he says what are you doing land down like this see God does Lord I'm your son why you talk like that to me what are you doing here get up he said the reason that this has happened isn't because I brought you over Jordan the reason this has happened isn't because you haven't got faith the reason that this has happened is because there's a cursed thing has been brought into the body Joshua's Grace we just saw it with Rahab it says actually says Joshua says because she hid The Messengers that Joshua sent she found that Grace Hallelujah this man he h he also hides something but he's not hiding the messengers of Grace that Joshua sent he's hiding the accursed thing in his tent and so so it singles out and now Grace says why have you done this and Grace says under Moses when when people did things wrong under Moses God says to Moses Moses just stand back and God smites him with fire and things open up and smitten with fire and so forth Moses didn't have to do it un Joshua Joshua says take him Grace says take him I'm not having any accursed thing we can't have an accursed thing God won't even hear us while that's in the church and take him and take see the parallel to the Other Extreme with Rahab he says take him and his and his family and his children and his oxen and everything he has and stone him and burn him with fire that's our Grace you can't have Grace one side and Grace the other see the people think Grace is hey that's why they want to put Prophet off the scene that's why they want to make the prophet Moses amen it's not it's not for preachers to preach law and and everything that's not and bring people under under subjection and that but it is to say let God get rid of the accursed thing amen hallelujah I'll just be a few M moments more now coming down is that right coming down I I do want to get to this and Joseph and brother Bram said I read that Bible and there was a man that was nothing against Abraham Isaac Jacob and all of them had something against them but not Joseph what a man a perfect man a perfect type of Christ okay so now we're talking about Joseph and let's say a perfect type of Christ we're talking about Christ and he said blessed the Lord be his land for the PRI precious things of Heaven for the Jew and for the deep that couches beneath and for the precious fruits brought forth things of the earth and fullness thereof for the Good Will of him that dwelleth in the bush that dwell in the bush let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his Brethren this is Joseph and hisor GL is like the firstling of his bulock and his horns are like the horns of unicorns he's talking about the perfect type of Christ his horns are like the horns of unicorns with them shall he push the people together to the ends of the Earth and they are the 10,000s this is the sons of the sons of Joseph are the horns of Joseph that are going to conquer he says and with these horns of Joseph they shall push the he he shall he shall Joseph push the people together to the ends of the Earth and they are the 10,000s of Ephraim and they are the thousands of Manasseh Joseph so Jose and that's it brother Joseph and I'm closing now in a superiority of power is likened to the rim this Joseph can't be domesticated is what and this is under an anointing when he's blessing Joseph brother B said perfect type of Christ he said is liken to the rim of which his two sons Ephraim and Manasseh were the two great horns which were to P push the people to the ends of the Earth and to this Mighty untamable and Invincible ARX the Messiah Compares himself in connection with a great judgment upon this wicked world for then his horn shall be exalted like the Horn of the rim towards his church he is the lamb but towards the unsanctified world he finally becomes a temporal Rim if we looking at that type and says to God I I read this out in three meetings and I of that little church speaking to these new people and I and they caught it the same time as I did and I didn't see the type I'm talking about I didn't see but we are those horns of Christ that Christ is going to drive them with and I tell you what when I saw it as I'm preaching I couldn't I couldn't keep talking the enormity and so we think oh we're just nobody you know brother Bram says in a place he says you know hey you can you know you can preach that's all right and that just live your life he says what what what we need now is thousands of lives lived he says he says swelling words and preaching like Billy Graham and all that he says that that the devil can laugh at that but he says what really shakes the enemy it's to see a life am it's to see a life you know and you say Lord I want to do something for you if you're just living a life and people are watching you all the time and they Saints we might think we're just nobody and that's pretty good because you can they can help keep you humble you know I I hear heard preacher say like Paul you know well yeah when Paul was saying the things I do I do not da and I said well that was when he was a teenager or a youth no Paul was fighting the flesh all the time but he overcome because his faith wasn't in this but his faith and trust was in who he was yes sir who had called him amen and my faith is in what I can do or anything but my faith is in what he's done I don't want to try to govern anybody why wouldn't I want to try and impose my government on anybody amen because I have a governor amen I have a government I don't need any praise the Lord look Saints I thank you for putting up with an old man but don't talk negative about yourself don't allow Satan to bring negative sure we confess our faults once said can I just one more I'm breaking my word all the time said I'm closing that I had a situation once many years ago and I might have testified once when I've been down before but this is years ago and a door swung was halfast 8 at night had I on the Lord very long don't think because somebody's got a bit of time on them that they know things that you can't know the fact that we know Jesus is all we need to know amen sometimes I think where are the days of my innocency going I get family don't hinder my faith the world doesn't hinder my faith what hinders my faith in any way is actually brothers and sisters that don't believe the make Believers and the nonsense that just shakes me about I've gone through something just recently and I said Lord Am I Wrong standing my L Lord Am I Wrong Am I Wrong in what I'm seeing here and I just got this I shall give them over to strong delusion and that's talking about Believers you know that are make they delude themselves into thinking that something they not but sorry and and the door swung open it was at night about halfast 8 at night the door swung open and a brother came in and I was on the phone workwise actually and and he says put the phone down put the phone down and I I says sorry I got to go I put the phone down I says what he says come with me he said well I had a ring and he had a ring from a brother's wife and the this other brother he lived some distance precious brother he said I had a ring from his brother's wife and uh he says we got to go um she thinks he's dying don't know why she didn't call an ambulance but anyway she called us and we we went I never thought of that before and um and we went and we went in and um and she she she was really desperate and we went up and she says I don't know what's wrong but something's just twisting his body and and he thinks he's dying I think he's dying we went up and the and as I went through the bedroom door and his the headboard of the bed's here by the door and he's like this and as we went in I saw this this thing about this far out a demon and I just s go back into him and I knew so I knew I was dealing we dealing with a demon I'm a very young Christian you don't have to be an old Christian before you could deal with demons he you just got to trust him and uh we went in now this other brother I I let him do the leading of things and I didn't say anything and we prayed till I think it was nearly half 1 in the morning and nothing was happening and this thing would just all of a sudden grab and his whole body would twist and he'd scream that was a horrible thing but I I actually because I'd seen what I saw I wasn't looking at what was happening to him in the in a way that I thought Lord you showed me that for a reason so I'll just wait sometimes we just need to wait amen oh I know what it is and waited and so after a time it was about 1 half 1 in the morning the brother he'd had a he'd had enough and he was getting tired and I'd just been sitting there all the time just praying just saying Lord what would you have me do and so they went out he wanted a cup of tea and they went out when they went out I was left alone with the brother and now I now I got it from the Lord what to do so Lord just leave me and I said brother I said you've done something and this is caused by you've done something and it's caused it's caused the demon to come in and I said I've seen it and I says you need deliverance from that and he says no I haven't done and and this thing happened again and so because it it happened again he he says oh you know and he told me something from his past and I said I couldn't tell you what he said because I knew I had I was waiting on the Lord and I said brother that's not it because the Lord never showed it to me you know brother brand said if the Lord done he couldn't if you do something the Lord can't show it even to his prophet and I said brother and I got and what it was I had no witness nope not that and he told me about three things so he brought three things he allowed three things to come out of his past that were dealt with we shouldn't let Satan bring th things up out of our past you know remember when you did that Satan that was that's dealt with that's your that's your that's your that's your problem you know and then the brother told me something it wasn't very it would not seem very much and now I I knew what and then I the Lord showed me that was it I said oh brother now we can pray and that thing left him amen came out of him left him never had another problem after that you know but but what I wanted to say was that the devil was saying you did this you did this and here he is an extreme he's bringing things up that go when it's dealt with it's done right since when it's dealt with it's done if Satan tries to tell you yeah about call yourself a Christian what what about when you did such and such don't even don't even allow him to take you there because it's dealt with the blood is greater than that amen amen hallelujah hallelujah amen the blood is greater amen glory brother Ben want to come out up as we pray let's stand and pray sorry folks I've taken at least half an hour long AG but it got to the end the drive to us got there finish the far Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord Jesus that you're with us uh Lord there's nothing in ourselves we could do Lord but just follow you you the thing that your Prophet said about that Spirit of Elijah was that he was obedient and he he rested solely in you and father God he and the prophet also said was just a humble spirit and would just speak truth he would just preach the truth and father God I know my brother Ben Lord too um not that I have a lot of time with him but I I just see his heart and Lord with him all we want is not any elevation of ourselves we want to lift up Jesus Christ in the eyes of the people Lord Jesus to strengthen ourselves in the battle and father God to remember that when you said that we're an invincible Army and if we could just see ourselves meditate upon what we've seen this morning Lord for I see it Lord and I I can't I can't give a revelation to anybody but Lord if we could see ourselves that against Satan wear those Mighty horns in the head of Joseph and it's with the horns that Joseph was going to drive the people back and
