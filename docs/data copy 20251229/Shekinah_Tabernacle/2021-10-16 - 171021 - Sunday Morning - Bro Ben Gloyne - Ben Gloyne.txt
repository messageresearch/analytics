bless us we're expecting our lives to be changed and we're expecting to be refreshed and renewed and we know that we were approaching a good god this morning a god that that didn't have any reason to come and do anything for us outside of the fact that we would benefit from it which actually is love when you boil it all down that's what love is is is actually doing something that is of no benefit to the person doing it but it only benefits the person receiving it true love is that you know when when we waited all up we there was nothing really that the lord would say okay i've got a good reason to do this that's going to benefit me but we're so grateful that that's the god that we serve that he did it all to benefit us and we want to come gratefully this morning to the throne of grace

bless you great to have everyone else here today amen so we're having camp this coming weekend we are going to have camp i'll send out all the information tomorrow about what to bring time to arrive etc um if you could please but on monday we're going to find out if the waikato goes down to level level two if it does brother tazewell and his family can come so he can preach to us so we pray that that can happen and there'll be no service this wednesday because the sound and video amazing people in the back are going to pack everything up and get everything ready for camp so um praise the lord yes amen let's go to genesis chapter 24 everyone feeling good this morning hallelujah i know the master of the wind i mean i love that song because there's many times in papua new guinea where i needed to to do mission work and you're in the monsoon season and when it rains it really rains there and if it rains you can't get into the village you're going into i can't get out you pray lord i would ask the lord lord can you send the rain away and it would go away hallelujah and then when i came back to new zealand i asked my mum how the weather is and things and she said it's just the roads are like rivers because when it rains there it rains there you know so i know the master of the wind i know the maker of the rain hallelujah and not just those kind of storms he can cast away but spiritual storms as well amen but our god lives hallelujah let's go to genesis 24. uh we're going to read verses 61 down to 65 then we're going to zechariah chapter four hallelujah this is here in genesis 24 and verse 61. and rebecca arose and her damsels and they rode upon the camels and followed the man and the servant took rebecca and went his way and isaac came from the way of the well the harori for he dwelt in the south country and isaac went out to meditate in the field at the even tide which is the evening time and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming and rebecca lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she lighted off the camel for she had said unto the servant what man is this that walketh in the field to meet us and the servant had said it is my master therefore she took a veil and covered herself hallelujah and let's go to zechariah 4 and verses 6 and 7. and he answered and spoke unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto deservable saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art thou o great mountain before zerubbabel thou shall become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it it's not the headstone crying grace grace it's those that receive him because the headstone is not a piece of masonry it's a person amen let's just i feel like shouting around the building i'm trying to really to behave you know i feel there's such an electric presence here right now anything can happen in this service you know brother ram says when you feel the spirit of god he's circling the building but he's looking for hearts that are open to come into i mean so don't shell up just open up and say god fill my life change me right now oh god i believe he's circling the place i believe he's present i mean the very lord of glory we're looking for is here amen holy we'll we'll meet him in the air one day but his spirit is upon the earth working in the hearts of lives and man in our lives hallelujah it means i'm trying to behave but maybe i'll just stop that and just hallelujah but let's let's pray this morning shall we let's just all talk to him gracious heavenly father oh lord glory to your name lord jesus what else can we do but praise you for your goodness thank you for your loving mercies lord for your great grace upon us oh lord how thankful i am lord you found me i don't know why you did but you caught lord you did lord jesus father you found us lord we are wallowing in mcinner of sin lost in the world but lord you were searching for us and you found us oh god and you put something in our hearts to respond to you and walk with you and lord tune in very soon these these bodies are going to be changed father i believe there's a great sweep going on around the world lord and your people lord of your spirit father you're quickening us to your word you're awakening us oh god to the lord to where we are lord jesus with you in this time and father i pray soon and very soon you take us away come quickly lord father is our prayer father i pray you anoint this service lord like never before i pray father you're quick in every life oh god i believe you're in the building with us lord i believe it's more than just a motion but father you're here to make your word live in our hearts oh lord i pray you just remove every distraction bind every hindering spirit in the name of jesus christ father may we not let our minds wander lord to tomorrow or yesterday or next week but lord may we lock in lord and have a conference with you father may you grant it for your glory may you anoint speaker and hearer father one more time we just want to remember lord almighty lord who's had a fall we thank you lord she's not hurt but she's just shaken father i pray you bless her and omar robin father also the clifford family lord jesus father may your healing hand continue to work in their lives father may continue to heal the children give them strength oh god father may bless them abundantly lord jesus and we thank you for their lives dear god anyone else who's not here today be their abundant portion father in the name of jesus christ may pour yourself into them father oh god we commit our lives into your hands in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you can have your seats this morning i'd like to speak i just want to take this one um uh this one question that uh that that rebecca asked eliezer and when i first you know this we could really just think about this she asked the question what man is this that walketh in the field to meet us now we know that the book of genesis is the shadow of the new and you know the lives of the believers are acting out god's great plan of redemption and you know so so we can see these things but when you when we really think about you know because we're not meeting just a man we're not just meeting a man we're not just meeting a prophet but it's a very lord of glory made flesh the very king of the universe the high king of heaven i mean he has no he has no peer he has no equal i mean he's the god of the universe i mean the devil's nothing in his sight i mean is the all-conquering almighty god who made heavens and earth amen that came to redeem you and i i was a very god who made all things he said let there be sun moon and stars and there is hallelujah and when he was sinking when he was creating or singing a view in the back part of his mind or in his heart rather was you and now you're expressed upon the earth and then he's revealed himself to you and you know we're on this journey but when you think you think because we're going to meet the lord halfway hallelujah just like just like isaac he you know he came halfway he he met rebecca halfway in the field in the evening time hallelujah and and she asked the question what man is this that walketh in the field to meet us hallelujah i think you could spend the rest of your life pondering that what is this this this great man hallelujah that's advancing from glory brother man says in the seals he says you know how the lamb takes the book advances from the eternities you know he said if you just lay aside your sin sinful thoughts i mean the lamb will advance all the way for eternity to you hallelujah so just lay aside your problems and what's going on in your life and you're hurting your pain whatever baggage you're carrying just drop it think upon the lord and he can advance all the way from glory to you today in this service hallelujah amen what man is this that walketh in the field hallelujah amen our god is gathering a people and we happen to be part of that number hallelujah amen so now he says here on earnestly contending for the faith it was once delivered to the saints remember it was isaac that wanted a wife when the father abraham sent the servant out a very beautiful type of god the father sending out for his bride to get his bride his servant the holy spirit eliezer it was in the call of the evening when the beautiful rebecca came out to water the camel he says you know the story and then he comes down into the end of his ministry and he's and he's and he's having these different dreams about being back in the public service company different things and he's running what's going on he says and i close my eyes and just let the bible fall open put my finger on the scriptures genesis 24 7 eliezer abraham's faithful servant the model servant of the bible being sent to hunt the bride for isaac chills run over me sure that's my that's right with the rest of my message pulling out the bride he said swear that you'll not take a bride out of these but go to my own people we're made of a different material i'm not talking about our nationality our skin color our accent whatever that's not the material i'm talking about but we're made out of different material than that than other people and i'm just thankful that god made me out of a different kind of material because i'm the kind of material because rebecca was actually family was blood relation to isaac i mean and by the blood by the by the sea gene of god we are family we are blood relation to the lord of glory hallelujah amen i'm glad about that hallelujah this should just take all the blues away you know you think about this as you just take all the blues and troubles you know hallelujah amen yeah hallelujah now where are we yes here we are okay see then you're free of this oath i mean what if the woman won't come with me then you're free of the south he said and the god of heaven will send his angel before you to direct you he went straight out and began praying and he met the beautiful rebecca that became the bride of isaac just a perfect message back to the word go get that bride that's a duty that's what i'm here for that's what i'm trying to do is to call out a bride so i understand that elias is not just a holy ghost but it's also the prophet's ministry amen he was sent he was given all the gifts of the father was bestowed upon a ministry and he was sent to the earth go find my son a bride go find the right kind of woman not just any woman but the woman the elect lady hallelujah so he had all the gifts and even even gave some of those gifts because he gave some of the gifts to laban and the denominations they tried to you know explain it yeah you just read genesis 24 and you parallel with the prophet's ministry just perfectly you know so much of his ministry he tries to explain the gifts just like eliezer spent time and explained it to laban well you know abraham is my as my mastery and he has a son and now i've come to get a bride for him and now i'm here and the angel lord sent me here and these are the two gifts god commissioned me to take the healing gift of healing to the world one's in my hand amen one i'll know the very secrets of the thoughts and tense of the hearts begins to try and explain the gifts and the denomination tries to try to hold on to rebecca tried to hold on to the bride because the church was being blessed when the bride was among her amen but then there had to come a time where where eliezers are saying no no we can't we can't just stay in this holding pattern we've got to leave i mean because it's got to be uniting taking place between isaac and rebecca hallelujah amen and so now here we are we're in that story now when i talk about a uniting we are united now by the true baptism of the holy ghost you're one with christ now but there's going to be a meeting in the air right so when i talk about the uniting don't think i'm putting it off some other time but we're united now amen hallelujah and really if we if you look in genesis 24 this is actually god's focus right now in this earth it's the evening time he wants his bride home the journey's almost it's been 2 000 years the bride has been journeying because it's not just us that are the bride of christ but all the elect down through the seven church ages is the bride and they'll come forth brother abraham said that the same attitude and spirit they died with they'll come forth that same way it'd just be like a moment them like they blinked and now they're back again hallelujah i mean the apostle paul will still be the apostle paul i mean iranians will be arrhenius martin polycarp all them and the them under the messages they'll be the same kind of people hallelujah amen so now but it's now the evening time it's the evening time of time it's the evening time of the seventh church age there's no more church ages after this there's no time will be no more soon hallelujah time just can't go on sure we plan for the future but there is no future but we should plan for the future amen but time has run out brother abraham said if he knew he said that if he knew jesus was coming in the morning he'd get up he'd go to church he'd preach all the same amen if he knew his coming in the afternoon he'd go to work do everything all the same i don't know how you do that that's what he said you do right so he's just keep keep on keep it on but keep watching and waiting amen if it's not today it'll be tomorrow if not tomorrow be the next day if it's not the next day i'll be the next day after that but there will come a day the day we are looking for amen to see the lord face to face hallelujah there won't be any veil any dimensional difference between us amen but we'll be where he is hallelujah i'm looking for that day amen brother braham says now here in this so so now this people we are represented in rebecca who made their decision i'm going to follow this word because i know in my soul that there's a power within it to take me into glory amen he says in time of decision and it was in the evening time when isaac had wandered from the tent out into the fields to meditate and then he seen the camel's coming rebecca looked at him and then it was love at first sight she had to believe it before she went faith cometh by hearing she didn't know what the man looked like and it didn't make no difference it was god making the decisions it was god making the decision in her it's more than just a you know it's more than just a who wants to make a decision for christ like a top two inches mental it's more than that it's god that actually makes a decision you've got to yield to that decision but you know it's god because god chose us before we chose him and if he chose us he can't unchoose us right because god makes up his mind he can't change his mind he can't change his mind about his word i mean he can't change his mind about his election hallelujah and that gives me that makes me happy because even in spite of my humanity and my failings and my quirks and whatever bits you undescribe he still loves me hallelujah and we should love each other if he loves me i should love you and if he loves you you know how it works right amen i so get stuff mixed up sometimes anyway you know what i mean though if if he loves you and he loves me we should love each other now he says i don't care whether he's big or little what color he is that makes no difference to me he's my lord i'll love him when i see him because he's god's gift to me and to you she lighted off the camels she had the veil over her face and as her lovely eyes caught the eyes of isaac into her into his arms he into his arm she went and took her to the mother's place or the father's place and married her brother listen there's no time to linger it's time to make the decision what kind of effect i've underlined this what kind of an effect has the message made on you what kind of effect has this message made on you amen it's made you more than a church member it's made you more than just a religious person made you more than just a group of people i remember this message just quickened your soul and it made you a new creature in jesus christ that's the kind of effect amen it's actually turned your life i mean you're headed towards destruction but then god interrupted the devil's plan turned you back around i mean you started walking towards glory that's the kind of effect amen it's had on you hello even kant it was contrary to our nature we're born with because it says in the bible not one seeks after god it's not even in man but god overrides that by election because it's deeper because salvation is deeper elections deeper than just our flesh even our mind our spirit it goes down to the soul hallelujah amen and god calls hallelujah so what kind of effect it saved me from hell i don't have to go to i don't have to go into a tribulation that's the kind of effect this has had even to say you know this the effect this message has had on me is i'm sinless i'm virtuous i'm as holy as god as holy because i have god's holiness because of his blood hallelujah don't wrestle just say yes because it's what god has done not what you think you have done it's not what it's not how you view yourself forget that if you do that the devil's got you on a distraction and there would have been a lot of this is just me there would have been a few distractions on the way because the path they took was like state highway one there would have been other people you know some one my little mind is there's there's abraham and his people all by himself and eliezer just journeys through a wilderness and there's no one around then it comes to rebecca and there's laban a few other people then he goes back that there would have been other people traveling it was a trade route apparently it was the same same same journey that israel took when the babylonians took them into captivity they took them the same way so there would have been other men on the on the journey if you give me this liberty there would have been there would have been other people on the journey and maybe because because rebecca doesn't really know where she's going she's never been to the holy land she's never yeah and and i'm assuming that the geography and things are slightly different from iraq to there and so maybe they were getting close she began to ask the question who's that man who's that person and you know because eliezer he's a faithful servant the word that he sent is faithful and keeps us on track so maybe liaise is there rebecca's either going on the camel and she looks she sees a man over there says who's that man and ella and elias would say no that's just communism that's just socialism don't get off your camel to meet that that's not the right one amen oh then what's that one oh that's just politics don't get off and meet him stay on the camel stay on the camel i mean don't get off the camel rebecca that's not the one you're called to marry stay right on the camel amen well what is the other one oh there's gender identity don't get off that one don't get off and visit that one whatever is trending would have been a distraction but if she listened to eliezer which she did she got to isaac right but if she didn't listen to him and thought well that must be the one where she would have got off the camel and her journey would have stopped right there so don't get caught up with what's trending i mean be caught up in the word be caught up with the lord jesus christ hallelujah amen you know people get so worried about stuff it has to be here it's the even time what's that one that's pestilence and fear don't get caught up on that one rebecca look sure it's there but you know don't be distracted just stay on the camel what about that one there and now they say yeah you should keep an eye on that one because he looks so much like isaac but he's not it's that religious spirit that form of godless but denying the power thereof from such turn away look so close that religious spirit that tries to come and make us formal lukewarm powerless you know that one of the definitions of lukewarm just in the webster is lacks conviction and you can be very on fire for the wrong thing right you can be people are on fire you look at what's going on in the world some people are on fire for a lot of things but when it comes to the lord to his word they're lukewarm why because they're on fire for something else so elias would say to rebecca yeah you watch him because the prophet remember aleiza told us watch the purple curtain he says about communism when it's on its height and there's a fever pitch of nuclear war he actually says communism is not even a pebble on the beach everyone's crying about communism he said all the preachers and all this stuff and it's not even a pebble on the beach and on that and and in that day that there was a cuban missile crisis all there was you know they used to have i think it was in berlin where there was the you know the berlin wall there'd be different checkpoints and there'd be soviet tanks and and american tanks lining up on either side just standing there ready to go point blank there's a lot of stuff going on in the world he says don't worry about it that's just a tool in abraham's hand elias you would say it's just a tool everything's work don't worry about that have your focus on meeting isaac i will point him out to you when we get there hallelujah you know it's like brother donnie reagan said about um lions in africa where you know if you listen to those services which if you feel the blues just go watch them hallelujah yeah he said about lions in africa i think he's up in kenya or something and he you know they're on safari and there's a lioness sitting on a uh ant mound and there's all the gazelles and stuff around and things and you know but there's this there's this line sitting up here and and and said brother donnie yeah what's this line doing what's going on and you know the guy said oh no hold on hold on i'll look around for other lions because he said that's just the distraction it's the ones that are creeping in the tall grass you don't need a lot of grass to hide a lion we found out when we're in the kruger you know you don't need a lot of grass it can be this big in the iguana you know it's the ones that you can't see the ones that are going to devour it's not the distractions that's why don't worry about what's trending in the world today that's just a distraction it will make you get off your camel right and be eaten we want to stay with the word we want to walk with him sure these things are here we should be aware of them but it's just a distraction hallelujah amen now where are we i'm not sure where we are here we are now so he says what kind of effect so so rebecca was introduced to oh before i go there you know abraham told eliezer the angel of the lord will go before you so it wasn't even so so the angel of the lord prepared rebecca's heart to say i'll go before eliezer ever got there god was working as the same thing with you and i trust this is real personal there shouldn't just be some concept you should be able to see yourself by god's grace in the scripture saying actually she's she's living me out maybe just even in a condensed form but this is my life this is the story of my life where before i even heard the message god was stirring me up there's more to life than this i gotta what's going on and why is it this way why am i feeling this way why is everyone else seems unconcerned but i'm concerned about my soul what is it the angel lord begins to steal with you hallelujah and then the message comes your way and and she didn't even realize at the time because elias didn't say to her when she first when they first met the angel lord has come to prepare you to be a bride no he just begins to explain about the camels and gives her gifts and different things he actually testifies to laban to the denominational brethren saying actually the angel lord amen came before me hallelujah and all this has happened and then rebecca's by standing saying god moved on me this is why i've said yes this is why i'm stirred up hallelujah god stirred me up god made me respond it was god anointing me to say yes to his word hallelujah you know what i love is that you know that same angel of god we know i'm glad someone agrees the same angel of the lord we know we don't know a different god we don't know we don't know a lesser god but the very same one that that spoke to rebecca hallelujah the same one we've met you know i was listening to brother dwayne lawson he was preaching on the dynamics are here and and he was telling a story he was talking about daniel and the lion's den he said when daniel was thrown into the lion's den or the dean of lions i mean he said he felt the anointing come down hallelujah and then of course that made the lions be tame as little kittens and he said that daniel had a real good night real good night's sleep that night now i begin to rejoice because i begin to realize i know someone amen who's been in the lion's den who's had exactly the same effect where physically they should have been murdered i remember then god stepped down and intervened and actually took the enemy under subjection and they walked out free now you may be asking well who is that person was she's just through those doors there i mean where christine was was you know when she was younger about 20 the sisters in church up in town were trimming their hair some of them and she was feeling tempted to do the same she was struggling with some things but then she had a dream where she had some scissors in her hand and angels were standing around her and she was and she was about to cut her hair but the angels were crying out don't do it because if you do it we can't protect you and then one of the angels took the scripture and opened it up to first corinthians 11 he said for this cause a woman ought to have uncut here along here because of the angels and then she had a dream shortly after this of she was working in her father's knife shop now if anyone ever went to that shop you know there's only one way in and out that's the front door if you're behind the counter you can't hide because the back walls literally right here here's the counter here and she had a dream that a crazy man came in with a knife and was gonna try and kill her but but the man couldn't touch her because the lord came down and protected her and then it was a shortly time after this it was a public holiday and and every other shop had closed but you know albert being albert made to keep the shop open it's very quiet there in the arcade who's been in that arcade it's not on the street front it's a very quiet spot you imagine a public holiday no one's going to be in there they'll be at the beach or something outside you know so but then the man in a dream came in frothing at the mouth like a rabid dog so i'm gonna kill you started swearing and cursing and everything but and she was behind the counter she realized that she couldn't escape because he was you know he could easily reach over and stab her but then when he came and did these things she said she felt the presence of god come stand down i'm in between her and the man and then he just kind of froze and was shocked and then he ran out the building and then he came back a few minutes later all sober-minded looking sober and said sorry about that lady what happened that's the same angel that was with daniel amen with was with one of us we have a living testimony amen the same god amen will protect you if you take god at his word it's all about our attitude towards the word it's not that thou shalt thou shall not know god has put protection in his word i mean we've got to have the right attitude towards it i mean then a few years after that she was walking from work that that's why i said she's been in the lion's den twice she is walking i know you know these testimonies but i think it's good to tell them again you know because that same angel we know he's not an idea he's not a theory he's not history amen but we can go step back in the scripture because we can see our lives in the scripture hallelujah and then so she's walking from from work and she's going back home in this long a park area there by the motorway there in taranga and there's a man standing on the path in front of her there's this bushes and there he is he's got a dog on a lead and he's just standing in the middle of the path and she just decides well i can't act scared and you know turn around and go back so she decides to keep walking and when she gets up to where the man is three other men jump out of the bushes they are not they don't have looks on their faces like they're saying hello how are you they have murderous intent in them and then then so so she was surrounded but then she and and she even thought this is a bad situation to be in but then a revelation struck her because she felt the anointing come down again i mean they can't touch me because my uncut hair my vow with god and the angel of the god stepped down just like he did in the shop they all froze including the dog and she actually pushed the dog aside aiming to keep walking on hallelujah but then when she got outside of those those men and that dog she started running because she began to realize actually what god got rid of hallelujah see it's not us trying to say i'm going to fight the devil i'm going to deal with him no when the devil comes along i mean god steps on the scene because remember it's not us trying to fight it's god will come down and fight our battles hallelujah amen hallelujah so i was real happy driving in the car thing i know someone like daniel in the lion's den hallelujah he's all about god hallelujah a man you know brother brown tells a testimony when when his little rebecca was real young between about two or three years old and she'd just be screaming all the time and you know they'd be in a restaurant one of them would eat say sister mita would eat and brother brown would walk around outside because she'd just scream and scream all the time i don't know how long this went for but then one day he was driving along with her and the lord spoke to him saying this is the devil trying to get at your ministry and then so well there's actually a photo um i don't have it on me but actually in the field because he's driving on this there's a middle field there with your flowers and stuff and the lord tells him this he stops the car gets rebecca out prays for her and she turns to a sweet normal happy little girl and so now a few years ago now what i rejoice is the same god the prophet knows we know right and if the devil came against the prophet that way we've got to be sure he'll come against us that way but if we know the same god the prophet knows amen the devil will will be losing again hallelujah so now when our little gabes was real little like that date she would start screaming and shouting and just writhing on the ground you just couldn't do anything for her and then and then this was going on for quite a while and then one saturday night i'm preparing here and christine calls me because this is going on and i'm running home and that testimony of brother brown about rebecca came to my mind and the lord said this is the devil trying to get at your ministry so i went in and i pray she's in the hallway right by our kitchen writhing and shouting and screaming unconsolable we prayed for laid hands and prayed for rebuke that devil in the name of jesus christ and she turned into a calm little swingle that she is today hallelujah and then i promptly i probably came back here but then now christine's at home of course the girls are asleep and she's playing the piano and she felt like there was someone standing looking over her shoulder because that spirit was actually still in the house and then she went into the bathroom and the bathroom tap it was like someone turned it on fully on them fully off and she was anywhere near it and she realized actually that spirit is still in the house so she opened the window and she commanded it to leave in the name of jesus christ hallelujah we have the most peaceful bathroom in the world all the peaceful house in the world and the reason she did that is because when she was a little baby the devil tried to kill her in her cot and her parents realized they're on a rented flat they realized there was an evil spirit in that place and they prayed and then that that that devil was cast out of the christine as a baby but it was still lingering in the flats they opened the window they prayed again and the thing was cast out amen but we but we're going to realize the same devil that the prophet fought or the believers fought we fight but the same god that was on their side is on our side we don't have a lesser god you know the angel of the lord did not leave when the prophet left in 65 no that same angel is on the earth preparing a bride amen for isaac hallelujah amen and then we can go yo we were having family prayer talking about these things then christine said you know we have we have naaman's little israelite servant girl in the family too i've been gonna think a while i said yeah that's right remember the remember neyman had an israelite servant girl remember the bible should come alive we're living in the pages of the scripture this is not history this is not the the same life actually i was tempted today to preach on family traits maybe it'll be another take but you should be able to see family traits of the believers in the scripture usually those same traits and you and i of rugged faith overcoming faith hallelujah and so now so yeah yes a name and servant girl you know she said oh i wish you know naaman because he had leprosy you know that he would go and yo yo because there's a prophet in israel that can heal them and then so now we have a little lily about two or three hallelujah amen we're up from you know brother our monster chantal's house his mum had is going to get baptized and corbus's dad has said no i'm not going to get baptized very you know i wouldn't even raise his hands in church very religious kind of man but very strict or whatever you could define it as and then you know i'm there i'm reading romans 6. that's why i love to read this because there's power in god's word now all this time god was dealing with him because you know he was so getting so agitated because he because people would testify to him god spoke to me i talked to god he spoke to me he showed me this and he's getting so mad saying where's that phone i can pick up and call god i want god to speak to me but see he had this religious kind of covering but he had sin like naaman had armor but he had sin in his life had that leprosy tried to keep it hidden because once you're outed as a leper you're outcast and so there he was he had this religious armor on but he had leprosy of sin in his life corbuster and then so i'm reading romans 6 we were going having a baptism there going to baptise header and um you know in their bathtub and then corbus before this said i'm not getting baptized tonight the next morning they're about to fly to south africa three in the morning had to get up and take them or something silly you know the silly hours you know and so this is at 11 at night or something and they said they're they're here saying i'm not going to get baptized i'm reading the scripture and i'm standing there like this and then out of the corner of my eyes i'm reading i see lilia who was yay big and she would and she came along and i just saw her go like this at the court pointing up at the bible and then so during this time corbus wanted her to come sit with her i mean sit with him but she wouldn't she ran over pointed up at the scripture as i was reading it and then walked along got a little like toy like zorro mask and gave it to him and then he broke down crying because the lord spoke spoke to him saying listen to the word take off your religious mask that's why we gotta don't wear a mask this is not a masquerade party we're going to be real god wants real people who are real with him not trying to put up a front and all this and this and this no just be real if you need god say god i need you if you need help he's here to help this is not a place to condemn this is not a place of condemnation this is a house of liberty there's a house of praise there's a house of worship this is a house of deliverance amen so so he just broke down crying saying you know through this little girl name and servant name and servant girl because she delivered a message and when he obeyed that message he was washed hallelujah and so she and then so he broke down saying you know i you know i didn't want to get baptized but the lord spoke to me through this little girl through lilia said listen to the word take off your religious mask and do what the word said and so after we baptized header we baptized corpus and when he came out of the water he had his hands raised to the lord totally different man hallelujah hallelujah so you know we should be in the bible you know then then analysts say well what about me hallelujah and then well we said well you know you've had a thus saith the lord personally to you i said the lord i know what you think about when you lay down on your bed at night i am calling you i mean just come to me and i'll fill you with the holy ghost because she was she'd lay down on her bed saying i wonder is it god calling me or is it just me and is it just family and you know because it's what we do and god answered saying no no i'm calling you this is not your thought saying should i or shouldn't i no no this is god calling in the scripture those things are uh whole chapters where god people would seek and you know seek god god would come down and to give an answer to me thus saith the lord hallelujah we're all in the bible we should all be in the bible amen why because we know the same angel of the lord he's not a different god he's the same god and the same angel of the lord that spoke to rebecca's heart she said i will go has moved on our lives amen and we have said we will go and here we are we're on our journey we are on our journey hallelujah amen now we gotta not get off our camel now the camel in the scripture a beast in the bible represents a power and so those camels that that that rebecca was watering were going to carry her to her isaac and brother brahm says in enticing spirits i believe it is here he says and rebecca had to make the choice because he said she is the maid let her make the choice laban said pardoning and as soon it was was made to her quickly her mind was made up she said i'll go and she mounted upon the camel and went to meet look the very camel she watered was a camel that packed her to her bridegroom and all of her success who wants success on the way so it's not just to our bridegroom but it's to all of her success and the very camel the very power i mean the beast in the bible represents a power and the very power that we give water and praise to amen water life praise to the word is the very thing that packs us into the glory land to meet the bridegroom yes sir so the same word the same holy ghost we water with praise and thanksgiving it's the same power that's going to change these atoms of this body take us to that next dimension that's why we should be very very adamant let nothing take your praise from you let nothing rob you of your praise to god amen let nothing diminish it let nothing dilute it let nothing rob you of it amen but you should be praising god from a from a thankful heart i mean what you're watering the same power that's going to take you out of the world hallelujah amen amen why is it psalm see don't let nothing steal your praise you know some people think that people don't deserve to praise and shout and you know cry in god's presence because they haven't been through enough hardship to me that's nonsense no we've been through enough i've been justified that's enough i never did it in the first place his blood has cleansed me i stand in his in his presence undefiled without sin that's something to praise god about hallelujah and i've been sanctified he's taken all the worldly desires out of my life he cleans my life that's something to praise god about hallelujah amen and not only that but i've been filled with his goodness filled with the spirit i mean the very lord of glory dwells in me hallelujah that's something to praise him for thank you god you called me thank you god you washed me i mean thank you god you filled me with your spirit hallelujah amen so let nothing let nothing rob you of your praise hallelujah sure there's testimonies along the way and we just thank thank the lord more for them but if you've got nothing you think about praising god about just thinking where he found you he saved you for a reason he saved you for a purpose he didn't just call you just to just to see if he could do it no or just because he saved you for a purpose he saved you because he loved you hallelujah heaven has a spot for you he wants you there that's why this message has gone forth and we're going to respond to it that it can take us up into glory so let nothing rob you of your praise i think in the end time there should be more praise when we see the headstone coming down i mean that he's the holy ghost himself uniting himself with a people what that's crying grace grace unto it that means when we see the lord becoming one with us what should be our response grace grace what is grace magnified oh what graciousness has come upon me what divine influence has come upon my life just like it became upon rebecca's life i mean what kind of divine influence is this oh what man is this that's walking out to meet me in the field hallelujah hallelujah amen but the devil wants to shut us up but we'll say no devil this is the time for the bride to speak you've been accusing for long enough but now there's going to be a response hallelujah now it's going to be it's but it's going to be through your lips you've got to tell the accuser where to go get back to out of darkness from where you belong go back into chains of torment down into hell where you belong that place was created for you and your angels get back where you belong in the name of jesus christ hallelujah amen the accuser of the brethren he's going to make his last accusation one day but every every voice that raises itself up in judgment against you thou shalt condemn that's from isaiah says no weapon formed against he shall prosper there'll be a lot of weapons formed against you but they won't prosper when you begin to realize what is this thing i'm talking with that makes me feel useless and not loved and not appreciated not wanted not part of the body of christ not an overcomer what is this thing it's the accuser it's not your own self it's the accuser and you've got you've got to tell to shut up in the name of jesus christ because he's the one that's condemned you know what i love about this in the old testament under the blood of bulls and goats is all the believers failures hallelujah but in the new testament there are none of the believer's failures it's just by faith through faith by faith hallelujah when paul wrote the divine commentary of abraham's life you've got to think about this he would have known the five books he would have known the old testament by heart right but then he's inspired to write the divine commentary of abraham's life and he would say he staggered not at the promise of god but was strong giving praise to god being fully persuaded he is able to perform that which he has promised now that was god writing that about abraham that wasn't paul writing it about abraham but but the reason is because through the blood of jesus christ now it's actually it's not the acts of their failures that are recorded it's their victories of who they are because they believed and their faith was manifested in their lives but you know what i love in the old testament the sins of the devil are still recorded iniquity was found in me isaiah says you'll be brought down to the pit and in the new testament his sins are still recorded hallelujah because the blood wasn't for him he can't be redeemed hallelujah so you've got to take the book and say a devil hold on um this word's true you know it's true that's why you fight it that's why you try and tell me it's not true you know it's true uh ezekiel would record your life and say this and isaiah would say this and then uh have you read the end of the book not the maps in gloucester i'm talking about the book of revelation have you read that um you burn in the lake of fire that's where you get off and this is where i continue on and you can say devil devil this has all been just no we know it's not chronological but just bear with me just an illustration uh devil this part's all been fulfilled you couldn't stop it you couldn't stop moses you couldn't stop noah you couldn't stop enoch walking with god you couldn't stop elijah you couldn't stop david you couldn't stop solomon building the temple you couldn't stop the restoration of jerusalem you couldn't stop the temple being rebuilt you couldn't stop the walls being rebuilt you couldn't stop john the baptist coming you couldn't stop jesus coming you couldn't stop the apostles i mean you couldn't stop the church ages you couldn't stop it and satan you won't stop it now because you couldn't stop it then hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah he can't stop he'll fight it sure he'll fight it but you've got to make up your mind now i'm following this word this word will lead me to victory it won't lead me to defeat it won't lead me to empty promises no it will lead me to where my joys be full i'm not talking about just at the end of the road this is on the road hallelujah amen hallelujah so don't get off your camel to get caught up with other stuff amen well what happens when you get off your camel you no longer feel the sweet feeling of the spirit of god around you just get back on if you've got off get your if you're if you're off and everything's wrong and you're grumpy and fussy and troubles all around just get back on the camel because the lord knows infinite grace stops the camel when you get off i just believe it this way maybe i'm maybe i'm just too much grace i don't know if you can be but i you know because he saved me i thought man if you could save this guy this this mess of a life and put it into some kind of put it in order and restore it i thought lord you can just do it for anyone is anything too hard for the lord i'm glad it was all a no hallelujah praise the lord so get back on your camel it will take you to where you meet isaac halfway between this world and the next brotherham says in in ashamed in 1965 and so you stay under the spirit of god and your life becomes sweet tender like water brings this grass and soft buds he says in arizona wouldn't grow these trees would be cactus them leaves just wind up and become stickery that's what he said stickery that's the way it is when you get dry around the church everyone's sticking one another you know and you see we've got to have soft waters of rain soften you up and make leaves and shade for the pilgrim that passes by that's how you know you just you're still on the camel as that sweet presence of god makes you sweet brother i would say sweeten that temple with prayer amen just let god have an effect in your life no matter what come will go you just love everyone anyway hallelujah amen this isn't enticing spirits he says my i feel the rapture is just above the churches 1955. amen before the shout before 1963. he says i feel the rapture is just above the church how much above how much closer is it now when time and eternity is blending together hallelujah oh it makes me feel so good all sins are under the blood see the holy spirit likes the word the word is what the holy spirit feeds on you see oh my it comes down and gets among the people cleanses their sins takes away their sickness takes their blues away if you've got the blues if you're down and depressed amen just feed on a good sermon feed on a good song feed on the word and you'll find yourself at the blues what was i feeling bad about again hallelujah who's i felt that way you're down in the dumps and you're down in the dumps and then you then you just hear a message you begin to read the scripture and then after a while you just begin to rejoice and that joy comes back into your heart again what happens the blues go away you know substance abuse is a massive thing in this day right that's why because people are trying to cope with life they're trying to drink their sorrows away or whatever you know and and and really for a christian it should be the same way not with that substance right i'm talking about the holy ghost substance right because we need man needs something to cope with the pressures of life i mean but we just happen to find the spring of living water actually the lord found it for us he brought it to us take your blues away with me i am your joy i'm your satisfying portion i will keep you happy irrespective of what's going on in your life remember to overcome doesn't mean you take away the problem that's just taking away the problem no to overcome is actually you get given power to overcome the problem so it can be right around you but you can just walk on hallelujah this is not pie in the sky this is this is you and i hallelujah that rhymes here we go amen but we should be so just just just get filled up on the goodness of god amen it takes their blues away he says now i'm drunk just as drunk as i can be drunk on the spirit love drawing out of my heart no matter what anybody has ever done it's forgiven your bitterest enemy it's all over anybody has ever talked or said anything it's all gone all cleansed now hallelujah that's how we should be amen now hallelujah so we're living in this time and where time and eternity are blending together we're in reality and i don't even think i've really touched what i'm wanting to get it but there is now this time brother abraham says that he may not do it but this message will introduce jesus christ to the world right and i'm sure that is your testimony you heard this word maybe you're in church maybe you were just out in the world wherever you were but then you heard this message what did it do it didn't introduce a prophet to you alias's mission wasn't to get rebecca to fall in love with her elias's mission was to get rebecca to fall in love with isaac right as the same thing with brother brown the biggest disservice you could ever do to the prophet's ministry is fall in love with the man william branham and be caught up in his personality in what he did that's the biggest disservice you could ever do to the prophet but the biggest compliment you could ever give him was fall in love with jesus christ the word because this message he said i shall not do it but this i may not do it but this message will introduce jesus christ to the world i'm i was part of the world that introduced the lord to me hallelujah amen so we're living in a time there's no more church ages after this the dispensation of the of grace for the gentiles is almost done amen because there's going to be a meeting in the air amen and we who are believers have been going on this journey from this world into glory as we have walked with our lord jesus and through the message the scriptures have come alive revealing to us who our lord jesus is his character and his nature what he loves and doesn't love and yet don't get me wrong we're united with christ now by the true baptism of the holy ghost but there is a literal jesus christ we're going to meet right there is a literal heaven we're going to go to brother braham says in three kinds of believers see don't spiritualize everything some people spiritualize the rapture already no no there's going to be a literal translation of our bodies there's going to be a literal raising of the dead in christ it's not going to be a thought it's going to be a reality where we're going to see our loved ones walk through the door they may be buried in africa they may be buried in some other part of the world but they'll step into this place because distance will be nothing to them and they'll walk through the door maybe you'll say hello young man young lady who are you but somehow you'll know them hallelujah they'll speak to you by name like jesus did to mary and you realize the resurrection's on hallelujah it's been going on for a while i mean we were once dead and sins and trespasses we've made alive in jesus christ remember there's got to be a resurrection from unbelief and death and sin enter the living word into lord jesus christ before this thing can be resurrected before the dead in christ can be resurrected that's the reason i do believe that when the bride is called out and elected brother braham says in three kind of believers and sit in the book of life that there will come a sound from heaven that will take that'll take such a baptism of the holy spirit into that bride that i'll take it from the earth in a rapturing grace god promised it don't care how many signs and how many astronauts they've signed up and everything else and how many million miles they can see i don't care nothing about there is a heaven and there's a literal jesus christ that will come in a body form to receive his church to himself no matter how old the story seems it's still the truth god said so that's what believers believe amen so if you're a believer today you believe you will see meet a literal lord jesus christ in the air hallelujah and there's a literal heaven he's going to take us to amen we are going to be met halfway hallelujah now he says in questions answers 1964. he says that remember isaac had left the tent was standing out in the field meditating in the late afternoon which is the evening amen amen when he saw rebecca coming and he never saw him and he never saw her but it was love at first sight she fell in love with him and he with her and she was even veiled amen oh my and look when she seen him her heart was so full of joy she didn't know who she was going to marry but by faith amen so because remember there came a time when everything eliezer told her became sight it wasn't just a story isaac's like this and he likes this and this is what he looks like this how he dresses is how he treats his servants and this is how he treats his dad and that you know no it went from just a word like that to became material now we know that in our lives christ is becoming material right but there came a time if i put it this way where it went from faith faith became sight because she heard about him but then she saw him amen and now this is what this is what faith has done to us we heard about jesus but now we begin to see him right by faith hallelujah now we know there'll be a time we'll meet him in the air but actually our faith i believe is becoming sight it becomes reality amen brother paul that's right amen so now and remember jesus will leave the kingdom will not meet him in glory where to meet him in the air between heavens and earth where it's expanded to redeem us and he met rebecca in the middle between her home and his home amen took her into his home and married her and fell air to everything his father had amen oh perfect just perfect all right but he's saying here that glory expanded now or glory has expanded to meet us hallelujah says now it's actually there's been an expansion of glory now down to meet us hallelujah because he met rebecca in the middle so now this is what's happened in this end time you say heaven has expanded down upon the earth now we know hell's empties itself out upon the earth but heaven has expanded itself also i mean so the prince of god has come down upon the earth i could this is just me in a greater way than ever has in the world amen why because god is going to take a people they'll walk with him and they shall be made in his very image what the ephesian age was aiming to become the very image of christ but they but they were anointed to aim at and relax and eventually the church would go down to a dark age brother man says we'll come to an ephesians again but in this age we're not just going to aim at aim at the the high calling in christ be made in his image we will become it there will be the cycle will be broken hallelujah so now heaven has expanded itself upon the earth to redeem us to gather us up so now in his presence now i'm just going to list these off and then maybe we'll stop in his presence is the fullness of joy you've got to think about who is this man who comes to meet us remember his presence goes before him hallelujah in his presence is the fullness of joy this is the one this is the mighty one who walks among us amen remember it wasn't it wasn't aliases charisma rebecca was caught up with it wasn't his personality it wasn't his argument it wasn't even his gifts it was actually the angel of the lord moved upon her heart to say i'll go amen but now in his presence is the fullness of joy his angel goes before us as he did the children of israel amen he encamps about those who fear him and he delivers them all the angel lord it doesn't say the angels of god it says the angel of the lord that's the prince of god himself and camps about those who fear him and he delivers them all in his presence sin has come to repentance in his presence the dead are raised man this glory has expanded heaven has expanded to redeem us in his presence the devil has to leave amen in his presence the yoke of the devil is broken because the anointing breaks the yoke in his presence as children find out who they truly are hallelujah in his presence his enemy is defeated amen in his presence the power of his blood is fully manifested i mean because the letter kills but the spirit giveth life i mean it's in his presence the power of his blood is fully manifested that's why when the spirit of god fell upon you the power of his blood became manifested because why you are loose from the bondage of sin and death became alive in jesus christ amen in his presence all those who want forgiveness can find it in his presence he commissions his children to fulfill what they're ordained to do amen be a housewife be a preacher be a deacon be a farmer be a businessman be whatever we all have you know brother man spoke about adoption and he actually said that a housewife that's a position that's an adopted position in the body of christ we think of prophets we think of fivefold ministry no he see the housewife in her position she's actually come to her adopted position in the body that's powerful amen when you realize you're actually in your god-given position amen david realized by the anointing of samuel he was king amen over israel and any enemy that came into his ground had to die and goliath was so you're the devil so stupid you know i was thinking about you know when christine said about the tap turning on in the bathroom you know the devil just can't help but reveal himself and when he reveals himself then he can be cast out but he just can't help it you know he's so trying to look in the shadows but he's just got to somehow just get busted you know so now goliath goliath where they were fighting there was king saul's army there's goliath and the philistines that was actually in judah david came out of judah that is david's inheritance as judah so here he is now he's been anointed king sure he's not on the throne yet but he is actually the king of israel david god said david's my king saul's not my king anymore but saul was still on the throne humanly but in god's mind david's king so now here comes the devil into david's inheritance into his adopted position and he thinks he can win bring me a man bring me a champion and here's david anointed by a vindicated prophet of god he's killed a lion he's killed a bear he just looks like a shepherd boy but he's king amen and he hears the boast of goliath and he just says you know who's going to fight him why is he making this boast why is someone why are you standing here and not meeting the challenge of the day why don't you take your because you're trained to do it why can't you do it but everyone's afraid because they're looking at his height but david was looking at a promise with god harlow because he was anointed to be king so therefore any enemy that came against him had to fall because he had to go to the throne it's the same thing with you and i amen we're on our way to the throne we're on our way to meet isaac hey amen the meeting in the air any enemy that comes against us god will fight our battle maybe because it wasn't david that was going to kill goliath in his own strength it was god and him going to anoint amen david picked up five stones hallelujah went against them and you know and then goliath thought you're just mocking me you're making fun of me i've made this boast for 40 days and now now israel's just pulling a prank and he says you just said i'm going to feed you a glassy what am i a dog you come against me with a stick and a safe see the devil doesn't really realize what's in you if goliath knew what was in that shepherd boy he would he would have quit i'm done who wants was attacking i don't want to fight this one if he knew the god that was in him hallelujah but the devil and his pride doesn't look at really what's within us you know we've got a resource that can make worlds within us well graham said if there wasn't a law constraining it you could create a world and live a private life on it hallelujah so there's actually unlimited power as actually in the resources and you can tap into by prayer and supplication you can actually tap into god and god can do anything hallelujah and jesus said nothing's impossible all things are possible to them that believe so why should we limit god by what we pray what we ask for but it's going to be according to his will it can't be our selfish will amen and so so dave your glass just here to my dog you come against me with sticks and stones and and then and then david just said i'm going to feed you to the birds or whatever and everyone have you read it should we read it let's read it so this is what god does let's go to first samuel 17. and yeah i'm sorry i said i'm going to quit but i don't you know first time i'm i say i'm about to close when i say i'm about to finish just just having your mind about to i'm sorry i don't want to drag things out now let's read from verse 43 of of um first samuel 17. no no 43. and the philistines said unto david am i a dog now that they'll come us to me with staves and the philistine cursed david by his gods and the philistines said to david come to me and i'll give thy flesh into the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field then said david to the philistine thou cometh to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but i come to thee in the name of the lord of hosts the god of the armies of israel who thou has defied this day will the lord deliver thee into mine hand and i will smite thee and will take thine head from thee and i will give the carcasses of the host of the philistines this day and to the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the earth may know that there is a god in israel he didn't say we will he said i'm going to do it so he said basically i'm going to kill you and all of them all your friends here all these devils that's what he said he said i will hallelujah he's he's a shepherd boy with five stones you know i believe he could have done it himself because he fulfilled the first part of it he took glass head off he didn't even have his own sword he used glassware to cut his own head off this is i'm gonna i'm gonna kill you in this whole host hallelujah see the devil doesn't realize what's within us we're gonna realize what's within us i mean it wasn't david fighting the battle god anointed david to fight the battle hallelujah that's why we should be the same way amen that we were here we are he has the name in his presence he commissions his children to fulfill what they're ordained just like i'm saying david was just a shepherd boy but he was in his position and he defeated any enemy came against him just like a housewife anyone who's adopted into the body any devil comes against you you have a god-given authority to cast them out amen he has a name that's above every name everything that can be named in his name must bow to his almighty power in his presence the redeemed realize who their father is who he is and where they're going in his presence we realize who's fighting our battles in his presence we re we realize and believe that all things are possible in his presence we believe and in his presence the shout of the king is in the camp hallelujah the shadow of the king is in the camp amen it says in psalms 47 oh clap your hands this is a psalm for the sons of quran clap your hands all ye people shout unto the shout out to god with the voice of triumph this is how we should be amen with the voice of triumph not with the voice of sadness or or defeat or i think it might work no with the voice of triumph amen a triumph is the act or condition of being victorious or triumphant aiming to have victory or conquest it's a significant success or noteworthy achievement amen an instance or occasion of victory amen it was significant success when jesus died on calvary he conquered hell death in the grave that's significant that's the biggest understatement i could make in my life really amen but i was a noteworthy achievement i'm just using the definition amen so we should we are in a condition because of what he has done of being victorious or triumphant sure you have to fight maybe a lot of battles but it's god that's fighting the battle for you amen but oh i say this just stay on your camel i'm gonna finish this stay with the holy ghost because i believe this is just me we're beginning to see who is this man as we begin to meet the lord halfway who is this man that walks out to meet us you think about that soon and
