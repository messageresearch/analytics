there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all aflame with a fire to fail at Pentecost which cleansed and made them clean oh it's burning now within my heart all glory to his name I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them Amen so we're happy to be here with you we just want to give you a little encouragement tonight if you'll turn straight wait in your Bible to second Corinthians chapter 3 I really don't want to take time you know what to appreciate anything it takes a little bit of time so I trust the Lord will just give us the endurance we need this evening no it's a weekday night I'm used to preaching weekday nights that's what mostly what I do at the home and I really love it it's the dedicated people who come on a weekday night right amen there's always a reward if there's a sacrifice to everybody how small God knows our hearts and he knows what it costs you to be here remember this is invitation only you might think I just happened to come in here tonight and there are two meetings going on is the one you can see and it's the one you can't see that's the one we want is that meeting in heavenly places there's a there's another rejoicing I pray you're not just gonna be seated in your chair and watch what's going on here you'll be sorely disappointed you'll walk out just the same way you came in but we came for a transformation that's what we came for amen since 2nd corinthians going to take us a topic tonight born for this hour i have some slides i hope we can get them up if not doesn't matter we can we're you know God shows the picture it's beyond any picture man can make or what we can imagine and that picture comes from the Holy Ghost tonight from heaven directly inspired and with that's a picture of the word made life that's what truth is you know Jesus said I am the truth it's not written somewhere on the page he's not coming to rapture books he's coming to after people where the Word of God has been being made flesh in you and that's what we here for tonight 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 if you'll read with me while we're standing and verse 2 the Bible says ye are ye are our Paul speaking epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men since for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the bristle of Christ that means shown openly without that the mystery being removed now openly declared to be the Epistle letter of Christ ministered or delivered by US written not with ink but with a spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart let's just close our eyes again Heavenly Father we give you praise tonight we give you glory we give you honor O Lord you are the one in our midst you know Lord you hold our very existence in your hands you breathe you moved you desired and here we are standing as you've said in your word as we've just read Lord written epistles written by Christ written by the Holy Spirit of God in tables of flesh of hearts not in tables of stone and we pray this night Lord of that Holy Ghost will write another verse another chapter in these hearts are lifted up to You Lord as you are our only source our you are the answer to all our longing you you're what we want Lord you what we desire and we just yield ourselves to you now Lord and we wait on you in the name of the Lord Jesus amen you may take your seat now the the writing of God amen and really as I mentioned we want to look at you were born for this hour you could not have been expressed in other any other time because how your your whole makeup your genetic code if you can call it that and I'm not talking about your natural birth I'm talking about that new birth that spiritual birth the code of God for this hour is here to meet the challenge of this hour and so you don't have to feel just a general Christian tonight know you're very special and there's as I was ministering over the weekend down in the South Island there's a place at the wedding supper that has your name on it and nobody else can fill there's no substitute there's nothing that God you know there's not somebody else he's going to raise up to take your place you're the person that's going to happen to you talking to the young people the other day I told them you might as well accept the fact that it's going to be you it's not another generation coming so we better rise to the occasion this is it this is our our this is the moment we were made for to express this is our moment on the stage where we're supposed to say our line and do what God is he's firing us to do so I believe in a positive gospel absolutely I really believe God is here to bring you into a higher height to bring you in that email kind of a walk because this is the hour of the translation and talk on the word 1953 I need to find out pointed over there he says what we today are God's spiritual church with a spiritual law written on the tables of our hearts led in a spiritual form God's intention was to write in our hearts and that's what it was such a great disappointment over there when Israel said put it on stone for us put it out there but their desire didn't match that law that's why they kept on transgressing it even while God was writing it down they were transgressing the first commandment they could not keep that law because the desire in their hearts didn't match so he wanted to change the desire in the heart and not just to give you a commandment give you another set of rules is why for many young people it's ood is to try and live the message because it's just a hundred and ten commandments but if it writes it on your heart is no longer a commandment it's no it's something that comes naturally to you and that's why I believe in the Baptist where the Holy Ghost and experience with God not just a knowledge or a no so I knew it all my life I believe that all my life never had power to walk in it until God baptized me with that Holy Ghost then it was a different thing then you can't say out of it then there's somebody else he control so not in the output keeping of Commandments but a new and a living ways the Bible calls it he is that way who was either manifested word the Word made flesh and when you take on it's like we baptize people at the camp and I thought that's exactly acts 2:38 made flesh right there in the water in front of us the Word made flesh letting off the pressure 63 says this or trust in his promised work his words are written on our heart he's words our hearts are the tables of his word now think about it what did he write for this time behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in its jingling of an eye where is that written say it's written on the Bible it's written here that's God's desire not on the page not on a book he's not rapturing a book but he writes it on your heart he's actually writing his very creative word in you hell the Bible told us by the Holy Spirit that's why I believe the brother quoted right there the beginning and hearing the song services to worship Him in spirit and truth not just in truth but he spirit of truth because it's that spirit it gives life and spirited quickens that word and makes it live out in your life that's why the Christian life is easy as life there is it's a life of yielding it's a life of giving up giving weight to the Holy Ghost and that Holy Ghost quickens the word and he lives it out through you you don't have to manufacture nothing like the Sheep doesn't manufacture we'll just bears it how just like being a sheep amen it's coated in there it's written in there and you can eat as much as much grass as you like it'll never bear any wool because it's not coated in you but it's coated in there so where does it will come from not from the grass from what's inside the sheep already what's written in there by God so God writes in you the message of the hour it was here to be expressed so Paul told those people said the Corinthians and told them you are my letter oh you're reading a letter I wrote words but you are the letter because what I wrote is taking on flesh and is living out in the world today God who is rich in mercy says God is the word it was made flesh and dwelt among us now that he might bring forth the other attributes of God that's Jesus being the fullness of the word all that God was poured into Christ that's my brother Brown has said when he was on the earth you were on the earth when he went to the cross you into the cross we rose from the grave you rose from the grave that is not a thought that's not a mystical something out there not a metaphor not an example it's a literal truth you were in him because he had the fullness of the word in him and if you're part of that word that part for today you have to being in Christ what he walked on the earth so he says the body Jesus was the body of God and attribute Moses seen him passed the back part of him no man had seen his face but now we see him we have beheld him see him as the sacrifice he's talking about Christ being going to Calvary since now see he was he was an attribute of God being displayed the word when when God gave that promise remember when they were had to leave Eden but God couldn't couldn't see them go he loved him too much gave that promise the seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the serpent here was that promise now revealed that promise taking on flesh that attribute of God that he spoke there he's attribute of redemption it's walking out in flesh and actually performing the task as God had set for him and he says here he was the word being displayed isn't that exactly what Paul told these Corinthian said you are the word displayed over made open declared revealed you become the entire message revealed oh it's a mystery violets on the book but once it takes on flesh in you it becomes an expression of what God wanted in this hour oh you might as well accept it yes sir uh-huh he says that's what he was and when any believer comes to God any believer say well that was Jesus Christ he lived such a perfect walk you know he manifests with every word never put a foot wrong what about little old me with all my mistakes says when any believer comes to God he becomes God's attribute of his word he's used to manifest the word that's promised for that day so when God said behold I send you Elijah the Prophet he'll turn the hearts sometimes we think it's just speaks about brother Branham who are the hearts you're as much a part of Malachi 4:5 as brother Branham is because my heart was turned so I'm part of that scripture that's taken on flesh I'm part of God today the word expressed for this hour this is this is the hour and you are born for it oh my what a place to stand what a wonderful thing that's why you call you that's why you came in here not because you willed it or decide it or that nothing that that was a drawing power what was it that predestinate elective love of God and place you at this end time to take a rapture to live through this change of the body to defy all the filth in this world to live in the Satan's Eden that you could live in a condition that was just like the book of Acts that's the God that's the power of God it's available you know what sometimes you hear all these great high things you think whoa my little life is so far removed I want to encourage you tonight whatever is whatever scene the word is yours tonight you don't have to live under your privileges you walk out of here say God baptized me with that same power that same Holy Ghost make me that kind of a Christian and he's here to do it he's exactly here to do it if you'll yield to him yes that's what he's here for I believe in a present tense Jesus Christ this is not a lecture this is not an information session we're here the very words that you hear Amendment Cornelius house while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell upon them you catch the word of God the Holy Ghost comes in to make that word power if use if you'll just say yes Lord it's me I believe it this is my hour this is my day this is the time I'm gonna rise to the occasion I'm the actor on the scene here to live that word by the Holy Ghost power that comes into me praise the Lord oh wow you can see where we asked friends we're here we're in the hand of God tonight he says well God's purpose God's purpose our identity set out either scriptures whatever the Bible says is what you are not what you feel not what they tell you in this world not the identity to try and push on you or what you were born with your carnal little nature no sirs whatever the Word says that's what you are a man you were born for this hour you're anointed to face the challenge of this particular moment right where we are the anointing right now remember the Bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of God raises the standard man the Spirit of God raises the standard and he raises that standard in you in your life that's what the Bible says or you might not feel like it what's that got to do with it what if you gave a stage four cancer and you're gonna say well I'll look at the symptoms well you're dead yeah but you say but it's real it's there brother Brennan said sure it's there sure there's a real devil but the Bible says greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world so you've got something that will defeat that devil every single time regardless the symptoms so I got this complex I got this habit I can't break I've tried this I've gone to be prayed for I've been anointed I've done all these things brother what does the Bible say oh yeah an overcomer that's what the Bible says don't care how you feel you might be sick as a dog it's still healed yes sir a believer is what the Bible says exploits exploits we'll be done in this hour who's gonna do them that Holy Ghost in you that's who's gonna do it amen a wise virgin is what the Bible calls you Rahab Rahab Ameri you know an Abraham that's what the Bible calls you oh you might as well accept it tonight yes sir what the word says in type we will manifest and every type of speaks at the endtime we're here to fulfill that scripture what do you care whether you work in this city or that one whether you got a bigger salary over here then over there what doesn't matter you're here to fulfill the Word of God for this time bodies to be changed in the moment that's what the Bible says about you and the message Shalom 1964 I like the way brother Brennan puts it here he says now to you adults of Scripture is God's symphony God's symphony it's quite a complex story is told by a symphony it's not just a little bit of music to make you relax there's a big drama being played out in a symphony and it takes all the different twists and turns and different fragrances and and sometimes dark and sometimes light and sometimes happy and sometimes sad but it's all playing out to God's timing perfectly to express that great attributes of God since Oh the composer knows what it really means only the composer you know why cuz he heard it before he wrote it he heard it he had the exact expression there and then he captured it in that music and he gave little instructions there little hints along the way to the musicians who will be performing this in a director who bill directing it directing it but only the composer knows and I look at this and he says and he reveals it to those who are listening who are interested in knowing what the drama is what gave you a thirst like that what created that something in you you know it's the best evidence that you were part of God's economy if they're just and he calls it a little dim something a little tug in your heart the devil won't give you that tub and Jesus said those who have the talk I will in no wise cast out those that come to me won't be turned down so there's a tug in your heart tonight you know it comes from God and he wouldn't put it there unless you're part of that economy oh I don't care how miserable your life might be what a kind of a hypocrite you feel like you are it doesn't matter at all if God is doing the drawing there's nothing that nothing that'll prevent you from coming to coming to maturity so but you have to know what the sympathy the sympathy calls it here first I like that you see it's not just something you see it's the it's the changing the Junction's of the word or the music and we are at the greatest Junction ever we hear the Bible calls of the fullness of time we'll touch on it later says it throws sometimes it's going this away for a while a certain beat after a while changes all around what is it to you who wouldn't understand it or don't know nothing about it not interested in it it's just a racket just a fuss what are these people shouting about what's wrong with him why do they come here on a weeknight just a fuss praise the Lord says but through those who know about it they're watching for it they know it's coming they know it's coming remember that little Dew Drop brother round talks about oh it's been lying there all night long it fell from the heavens came down is sitting there on the leaf waiting waiting but just before that dawn on the Sun starts rising is a little tremble it goes through that little Dew Drop lie because it knows the power to take it back to the heavens it's coming it's coming and so they start stirring that's what's stirring your heart that's what's stirring the people today that power that's rising upon you right now right now because it's almost over we're almost there oh brother said God was not caught off guard you know he wasn't caught off guard when the madman man fell in sin he didn't have to make a plan quickly oh no sorry it was already written in a drama you already knew what the answer was and that promise who went out there you already had a lamb slain the Bible says he was slain from the foundation of the world there was already a way out provided and the quality of the Holy Ghost today faces the challenge of the day that's exactly what God does that is a living word that's a living way now the seat has to go into the ground we know the great symphony is God played it out through the ages that seed going to ground through the seven ages and how they how it worked out and not to kind of spend time on that we all know it well the church wasn't defeated at Nicaea it was supposed to go that way there was the sound of the symphony there was the sound of the drama it had to go into that winter it had to go into that darkness so the springtime could come around that a restoration could flow out say well it looked like a defeat from the outside there well if you looked at the outside of Calvary what did the feet that was not realizing what was happening behind the scenes oh sure he descended into hell - what as a sinner Oh - take those keys of death hell in the grave to take over that's what he went there for sure cuz the price was paid amen so we see those minor chords playing during the dark ages and here wintered setting darkness flooding the earth for that spring could be announced and the restoration could begin from the beginning all these heroes of faith you read the book of the Hebrews chapter 11 those heroes of faith and you see there they were prompted by faith moved by faith what his faith is the violation of the will of God for that hour it's not just a good life a moral life you could be as good as you wanted to be if you didn't enter the ark in the days of Noah you drowned with the rest so it didn't matter how much you thought you were patting yourself after God's will there was a particular particular instruction for a particular hour and you had to meet up with God's program God's symphony whatever God's director was showing at that point you had to be playing there you can't just play some random tune of your own and say well that's a good tune forget the good tune is God's tune or no no dude so able as the Bible says able by faith prompted by faith moved by faith Abel offered not not because you know Oh Adam whispered in his ear it's a lamb it's a lamb hey that didn't happen God was moving on his heart to show it will take an innocent life in the place of your guilty life and an innocent blood must be shed that's what was happening there you know what it's no different to the Holy Ghost today prompting you moving you when the whole Christian world is believing in a Trinity doctrine baptizing some strange way God takes you right into acts 2:38 God's takes you takes you through the water and the way they did in the Bible why cuz it's that same prompting of faith that same Holy Ghost moving on your life yes sir a more excellent sacrifice to Bible calls at Enoch by faith by faith Enoch was translated what is faith remember again it's not just that little something that you know I'm healed and so forth it's much more than a revelation of the God's will God didn't want to let him carry on war he just I'm not gonna just come on up home there it is we're living in that very hour that very time Enoch a type of you yes sir Noah my faith saved his household the Bible says direct instruction from God it only Noah could hear Abraham left his homeland by faith you go read that chapter again you see they did strange things they did impossible things why because the Spirit of God is moving upon them now think about it this is your hour this is your day the Spirit of God is here to move on you to do strange things to do odd things I love this one by faith Sara received strength Wow by faith we read about Sara we think all she doubted she laughed poor Sara God would have killed her if Abraham wasn't there gonna get stuck on that go read what God said about or in wrote in Hebrews 11 by faith Sara received strength to bring forth what about it friends oh you could be in whatever condition you like and never write anybody off never never write anybody off you just you just you just keep on reporting them to the management and he'll take care of it yes sir Isaac blessed Jacob the Bible through there you see some strange scriptures in this in this in this chapter of faith by faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning Saint things to come lady out there hold the course of their lives and their nations by that blessing by faith not by tradition not because it was the done thing or because Jacob deceived him that nothing's mentioned there it says by faith and inspiration from God Jacob did those things Joseph prophesied Joseph prophesied remember when he was down there he knew there was going to be a sorry I skipped that one Jacob blessing the sons of Joseph God crossed my hands he said you know and Jacob or Joseph being down there in Egypt in that you know he wasn't he knew there was going to be a resurrection way up in Palestine how did he know that where is that written between the Lions sure and he caught that inspiration by faith he knew and he said don't leave me down here when you leave how did you know they were going to leave things were going fine in the days of Joseph they were prosperous they were living down in Egypt they were protected they were taking care of the Egyptian armies were out there fighting their battles for them but they knew Joseph knew there was going to be a pharaoh didn't know him get rise on the scene why because God has given that promise to Abraham your siedel's sojourn for so long in that strange land then I will bring him out and he said when God brings you out don't leave me down here because there's going to be a resurrection over there in Palestine by faith he could look into the future to a resurrection Moses by faith Moses was hid by his parents that wasn't Moses faith no sir because the season was coming around for the deliverer and now God is prompting moving on people it's a season for the rapture right now God is moving prompting people bringing them into position oh yeah just Terry a little longer at the prayer meeting you just stay a little longer here just put that person on your heart to pray for you think that's my chance because you feel like it it's the Holy Ghost moving on you it's God preparing a people for the hour to face that hour amen there was Moses all his life refused the Egyptian inheritance by faith not because by a biological decision not at all by faith he refused that Egyptian inheritance I'm not part of this looks enticing looks pretty good but I'm not part of this I rather take my weight with the Lord's despised theory forsook Egypt the Bible says kept the Passover I thought he was kicked out didn't the Bible say Pharaoh banished sima kind of kicked him out in violence is here by faith he forsook Egypt oh God looks at it very differently passed through the Red Sea kept the Passover all those things the walls of Jericho by faith the walls of Jericho came down by faith Rahab the harlot yes sir it includes her in there perished not because she had received those spies what told her to become an enemy of the state Justin she's never saw one miracle just heard yeah and that was enough faith and that free inspiration for her oh well what if what about you hey you weren't in those big healing campaigns but here you what make you believe the same inspiration the same faith the same spirit of God moving on the people from the highways and the hedges the nobodies of the world I read the quote on the weekend the slums of the world brother Branham called he called you out of the slums of the world to be at that wedding supper all the heroes are the ages you go through and run through we'll just skip through here the that line anointing on the first age those the the anointing of the Ox the martyr is going into those arenas what they went in there by faith by inspiration by the Holy Ghost nothing else is here you read accounts even in one of our history socials books in the schools in Canada I know because I taught it for awhile they bring about this account first-hand account from martyrs going into those arenas two girls we'd say teenage girls standing that arena and the gladiator hesitated because he felt he couldn't kill them and they were so inspired to die that the only one of the two took his hand and guided the sword into her that's there was no pain there was no tears there was no crying they were singing all the way through they were so anointed they were so in God's program in God's Symphony like like we'd look at the very first martyr Stephen well the Branham said if he didn't feel those stones and Bible said he didn't die the Bible said he fell asleep and he was transformed in that moment he said I see heavens open something happened to him he was translated he said well he suffered he certainly did not it was the guy whose guys that killed him that suffer was poor Paul standing there they could never get away from that moment all the heroes going through the faithful martyrs it would give ever marbled and the Bible calls his name before he was even on the earth somebody's name is in the scriptures that faith Antipas my faithful martyr before he arrived I guess a lot of mothers must have named their sons Antipas although maybe they didn't want to be martyrs right but there he was God identified him by name before he arrived like was God knew the attribute God knew the expression in that time it was going to take on a body called Antipas and that martyr spurt that anointing this item is God take him through that martyrdom a faithful martyr say what about you how can we fail how can we fail to express exactly what God said for this hour we can't do it he already called you he already brought you where before the foundation remember in the in in in in visible Union he says where did he slip that ring on your finger before there was the world not now when you got married and now now when you took his name but you always had his name that's why you took it now because you're always the eagle in the barn yours is my perfect example didn't it wasn't changing to an eagle he was always an eagle that's why I could hear the scream would respond to it and that's why when it sounded over here there's nothing you can do that's the quickening power of God spoken the time you're in is going to transform you and you'll realize my appetites not for this barnyard stuff yeah others may crow on the dunghill not me I'm not interested in that I don't fit here there's a deeper calling my life I can't understand it but I'm not meant for this there's something greater for me and of course when that call comes well how it does change you acting out they're part of the symphony each one acting out the missionaries came the Reformers came all these people that the stock the stock shooting up and those those leaves going to the four corners of the world that the life that's coming through that plant spreading out why because it's the season and that's the nature was in the seed that went into the ground all right nothing no merit to the plant it's a life who was in the seed and here we are in that same seed life again now they Bible says without us can't be made perfect can't be completed the picture is not complete without you if it took human courage I would encourage you tonight but it takes more than that we all know it and that's why we are here for a baptism of the Holy Ghost every time you hear the word it's turned into power that's what it does that's the kingdom of God the Bible tells us so what are we to Express I want to kind of stand still a bit on that tonight what are we to express in this hour what does your life or it's your life supposed to look like and I'm not talking about trying to follow a some pattern or code of conduct or some ethics or a good life that the rich young ruler tried that didn't work brother Branham and I'm not gonna say these are all the qualities but I want to highlight some of them I believe God you know it doesn't waste time doesn't waste your time somewhere along the line he said and I always say this and it's very important I have a lot of information on the screen don't try and remember that there's no quiz at the end of the service yeah passing grade that doesn't exist he might speak just one line - you don't miss that line that's all keep your heart keep your heart so in tune with him and say lord when it comes let me hear it let me receive it it might be the whole service I don't know maybe you got a big pot tonight to fill up but I don't know some sometimes we don't feel that way you know really because we got so much stuff in our heads and so much on our plate it's kind of hard to juggle everything but there's a line coming for you that's guaranteed or you wouldn't be here so in the message Christ revealed in his own word 1965 where the Brennan says this talking about stabilizers and I believe very much in stabilizers that little picture up there you can see that ship that stabilizer on the side there and they got some fancy stuff today it kind of it knows by itself the captain doesn't even have to control that it's a there's there's a code there's a program in the ship and that's the sensors can pick up as their waters are getting a little rough and then it compensates there's something in your life it compensates when it gets rough when the trials come there's something in there to compensate brother Branham says this he says a fine Minister said a while ago say brother Branham if I could just have the joy of the Lord in my heart I said son the revivals over you mean we can't have joy of course we can have joy it's in the word and and it says the joy of the Lord is your strength right so if you don't have you don't have strength you know what you wonder what's going on oh maybe I don't have the joy I should have and it's enjoy the Lord take note not the joy of the world okay here what did Jesus say here you'll have tribulation yeah you're gonna have trouble but be of good cheer how can I be of good cheer when I have trouble because I have overcome the world he said so there we are there's a there's a joy that doesn't make any sense that's the kind of joy we're talking about that's the joy of the Lord amen not 1 - everything's going well when it's not going well that's tough I know I feel I failed there just about all the time but there's somebody who can't fail somebody's already overcome in my place since I said son the revivals over see the stabilizers being put on the ship great fearful waves are out here before us but we know just beyond that wave yonder we're nearing this the shore sea we're nearing the shore here's what a stabilizer is just stay stable just stay in the word stay with God no matter how you feel what anything else stay right with the word let it stay stable when you see all these great big old clouds around us and storms are coming and atomic bombs and everything else they're talking about but our stabilizer is right straight in the word God said it would be here we'll crest every one of them Amen it's already been spoken about you says yeah we'll go right over the top of them yes indeed they can't sink us they can't drown us you put us in the grave we'll come out again just this just all there is to it since there ain't no way in the world to keep it down there will Crist every one of them cause our great chief captain is calling at the other side oh if you can just get quiet enough you'll hear that call mm-hmm every time you open the Bible to Lord oh I'm so tired the days be long don't just get there just get quiet for a bit he'll talk to you out of one verse you don't have to read all chapter for your conscience sake just Lord speak to me what else there stabilisers I believe we are supposed to manifest faithfulness this is something special you know because we know it takes God's faith yeah Paul said the life I now live in the flesh is by the faith of the Son of God not my faith the faith of the Son of God Peter went through the gate beautiful and he said you're looking at us as if we erased that man up it wasn't us it was the faith of the Son of God Jesus faith takes Jesus faith in me that's what's gonna change his body I don't have much but there's something the Bible calls faith which really means faithfulness you're watching the in the church age book retire in age where the Branham brings it out sees when he talked to the AG says I know thy faith sorry you did I skip that I know thy faith since now he does not say as he did here to the church in Pergamos you hold my faith so what is our faith you want to want to ask because he's not talking about his faith now but he's commending them for their faithfulness see not faith faithfulness so what is that and as he does he also mentions their patients now faithfulness and patience go together he says in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness Wow just four it says in James 1:3 the trying of your your faith worketh patience right there's absolutely no other way in which to gain patience newsflash what is the trying of your faith when you don't get your answer immediately when you have to wait 25 years that's the trying of your faith that's why it works patience right and that was attributed to Abraham for what righteousness okay just has to come by the trial of our faith Romans 5:3 tribulation worketh patience Wow nobody volunteers for that I quoted this on the camp and don't misunderstand me I like to quote it from time to time and there's a context sure but brother Branham made this statement and when he made it I it struck me he said you'd had you'll have your hell here or hereafter here it's temporary there lasts pretty long time and it ends in the lake of fire but you're going to have to go through something there's no way to gain character or develop or be expressed unless there's a battle unless there's a struggle and nobody wants it I'm not saying Oh Lord increased my troubles I don't thinks nobody asked that since no Jesus himself he was on the earth and said look let the cup pass well how about that so it's not like we have an excuse to be weak but there's no way we're going to ask for a cancer there's no way we're gonna ask for you know let my whole family back slow nobody wants that but when it happens it's for a purpose there's a reason there's something God isn't some part of the symphony God wants to play and it's gonna be you it's gonna be your voice your patience your faithfulness Wow he says how highly God regards this outworking of our patience is seen in James 1 4 but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire lacking nothing since the God's will for us is perfection Jesus said so that's the requirement be you therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect okay let's just give up right now when Jesus the fullness of the Godhead and a sinless virtuous body on the earth when when the rich young ruler called him good he said don't call me good really so how dare we call one another good Wow he said God's will for us his perfection that perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting for God oh brother I thought it was seven steps up and then I tick off this box and then I move on to a higher realm and I'm more spiritual than you no sir it's waiting on God waiting for God yeah this is the process of character development wow I guess you know all these things I just underline things you know that's what I do so I'm gonna jump off there because we got a few other hurdles to go before we close we are supposed to manifest and this never changes this is ageless those fruits of the spirit that characteristics of God's Spirit is always there and say well I don't have like two of them I don't even know if I have one well they're yours and we and we take this by faith like everything like you take healing just the same thing against the symptoms against the temper tantrums against the rough edges in your character you say well it's not he's not refining your character either he's manifesting his character patience meekness godliness knowledge all those things temperance faith brotherly kindness the love of God how all by the Holy Ghost its fruits after what the spirit so it's the spirit in you that'll bear that fruit second Peter one I love this this to me is just a huge huge huge promise if you don't happy with yourself like me then this promise is for you second Peter one according as his divine power his divine power hath past tense given us what all things that pertain unto life and godliness already given it's already in here it's not coming from heaven tonight if you have the Baptist of the Holy Ghost those qualities are in you already since through the knowledge of him that hath called us to the glory glory and virtue that's your calling glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these what the promises we might be partakers of the divine nature God's own nature God's own character he'll by a promise and what happens to a promise has to be planted in somebody's heart has to be watered with praise thank you Lord for healing me when you're blind as a bat but you say it anyhow why because the word says it and by that watering a phrase what happens you're being transformed before you know it the world don't recognize me you don't even recognize yourself because God's transforming power will bring out of you the qualities that he has planted with this age receiving by faith what you cannot see remember faith is the substance of things we can't see the evidence of things we can't see can't feel can't understand we're here we're here to manifest that endtime light now I love these you know what God said about you when you talked about the end time in Zechariah 14:16 to pass in that day the light shall not be clearer nor dark but it shall be one day we shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass at at evening time it shall be light that's not the moon that's not the Sun okay it's not these big lights that up at the stadium what did Jesus say you are the light of the world so what's the light shining oh brother branham he's come and gone there's a message now there's a people Jesus never went he's still here brother Brad said the angel of the Lord is still here to lead the church like he did in the first Exodus same angel of the Lord where is he he's right prison here if God would open your eyes you'd see him tonight sure absolutely Isaiah 60 verse 1 we know this so well I love this so personal for me arise shine for thy light has come not a light my light has come yes sir and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee personal not upon the age not upon the church but upon you personal for behold the darkness shall cover the earth gross darkness the people oh my goodness if we ever had that it's here right now I don't have to underline it for you but the Lord shall rise upon thee who's that light it's the Lord shall rise upon the east glory shall be seen upon the his glory Wow think about Mount Transfiguration think about it like me so bright they couldn't stand it they got all religions one of the book Tabernacles and start denominations and things but the fact is God said hear ye him oh and Jesus said if you speak if you say not if you pray to me if you say so who's speaking it's the same one on Mount Transfiguration say well I've been what the glory of the Lord is risen upon me oh I know we can't get it no can't get brother Brent says the law that controls us or we all all create private worlds and go live on it dodge all our trials just hear about a sickness and speaker gone but God controls it by a law God throws the switch when when the symphony changes oh but you can already feel a change in cancer oh brother what a time to be alive [Applause] and have not I Cynthia and I gotta hurry up here he says but it's time for the evening lights to be shining that's you now now he's gonna bring it he's gonna say it I'm not cooking this up friends that's why I like putting it up here because I stack up the evidence on you you said oh it's brother a B saying this or that no no uh-uh it's right the car coming right straight out of Scripture coming right straight out of message at you and you've got to do something with it now it's on your hands okay Wow it's time for the evening lights Laurel to be shining he says as the song says shall be light in the evening time it's time for those evening lights to shine this is the time now what's to keep them from shining since you go out any day any day you want to just move back all the clouds in the sun is shining anyhow since the sun shining all the time just move the clouds is the same God that healed the same God filled with the Holy Ghost the same God made every promise is he says the Esso end of God is shining at all times just move the clouds of doubt out of the way he is the same yesterday today forever there it is the light of the world the God's light reflected off you I'm probably going to get to that evening star so don't want to jump right there to it now just in a minute what what else have thus saith the Lord the Bible says you have thus saith the Lord but you know it's just as important I believe to keep still when you don't have it the Bible tells us in Romans 8 as those them that are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons sometimes you quoted the other way around and we say those that are led those the sons of God are led by the Spirit God now that's true but the identification of a son of God is he's led by the spirt which means he doesn't just go blast this and blast that he's sensitive to the leading of the Holy Ghost right in the pergamene church a church age book we know this quote well just want to put it up there again for your reminder he said those in the bride do only his will no one make them do I can make them do otherwise they have none say the Lord or they keep still that's hard isn't it the keeping still part they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word they didn't he did not complete all his work while he was in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time yes sir here's a tough one and I just mentioned it earlier but conducting ourselves with joy Isaiah 60:1 you know I love this part to remember the second part of that was fulfilled in our day Jesus stopped halfway through the verse but here at well let's take from verse 3 he says to appoint under them that mourn in Zion to give unto them beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness now there's a spirit of heaviness and it tries to get on you just about everyday but you just exchange it say no no I have a garment of praise that's what he says about me yes sir I have a garment of praise that they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified amen first Peter 1:7 Bible says the trial of your faith here we quote it now being much more precious than of gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen he loved in whom though now you see him not ye believing what rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory oh brother I believe that's as much a part of the bride and end time as anything else as any other attribute as anything else we can say is that joy unspeakable and full of glory just something that warms your heart something that moves you and stirs you remember Billy call the revival that wind coming on the lake doesn't add one drop of water to the lake it just stirs up what the lake already has and what does it do wash all the trash to the sides oh we need that wooden to blow don't you don't you think so yes sir blow on me Lord here's that big one from the smyrnaean church agent this thing you know I've had to ask the Lord for giving us so many times does he love us yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself who gave you this truth who gave you an ear to hear it now that proves the love of God right there gave us of his birth placing us as sons he's in how shall I prove my love to him he says by believing what he said and conducting myself with joy we're amidst the trials not after the trials amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass that's hard I'll just be plain honestly that's hard because I feel miserable and I want to feel miserable and I want everybody else to feel sorry for me you know but that's not how a son of God or daughter God conduct themselves she's a guy who's praising God the loudest he's probably going through the biggest trial amen praise the Lord with joy help me Lord true worship that was mentioned at the beginning here I believe in true worship and that's not just in truth but in spirit and truth yes sir John 4:23 but the hour cometh he says and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and truth and the father seeketh such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and truth quite often we get so full of truth we've become social away down by we can't lift our arms anymore truth has been restored but truth is a person not a whole bunch of rules if Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life so it's that what is it it's the manifested word that's what Jesus was the Word made flesh oh brother that brings that that brings the rejoin you can't you can't sit still when that happens in here you can so without the spirit we are bound to miss the moment of inspiration night those ten virgins right they were virgins they were following the word but they missed the corner they missed the junction why cuz they didn't have a spirit a whole lot of truth no spirit brother balint like and he said if we had a whole bunch of cars over here now let's say their raptures and/or heavens in Auckland we have perfect car sitting out here in the parking lot a whole row of them sit without gasoline we're not going to get there so as much as we're right fundamentally right scripturally right all these things we have all the perfect conditions they can run just fine not a drop of gasoline that's the Holy Ghost so Holy Ghost is going to get you there in that car which is the Word of God which is the fundamental doctrines and the truth is coming out of here so you don't want to hit a wrong note get in that place where you're not reflecting who he is and that's my prayer tonight you know I want to be so in the spirit and you know what it takes takes dying yeah you say well I died when I got born again no no Paul said I die every day so he might live you don't get born again every day but you have to die through this old nature you say Lord you do the leading in my life you do the inspiration in my life you bring me to that place where I'm reflecting the right image the right quality that you want in this hour not another day but right for this day let me reflect reflect what you have right here now yeah let me skip over that and some yeah let's leave that alone I'm gonna take let's just move on to completely surrendered peace of trumpets and want skip I'm not cheating you but I think we've made the point already a complete surrender this is beautiful and spiritual adoption remember that time talked about the quarry said you didn't choose yourself the Angels chose you they picked you out of that quarry and the reason they picked you out because you had a quality you had something in you and you know what it is he said you never know there I just read it the angel of God one night working the quarry called you out and you submitted yourself to me and I cut you in my fashion because I made you the way that I wanted you to be I done the sawing you just stood still it just takes us a render friends we not gonna add one cubit to our stature here it takes God's shape and God's moving just say Lord be it unto me according to thy word just like Mary how many how is she going to bring forth the Son of God without even knowing a man the son of God didn't mind you know any son what did what did the angel tell her the Holy Ghost will overshadow you how will these things be the whole egos gonna overshadow you and say well how can I take a rapture I can't change this body I can't do anything about my lifestyle I can't change my desire the Holy Ghost will overshadow you the answer is always the same friends and that same Holy Ghost is right here if you have a willing heart and I'd say Lord I want to stand still I'll stand still and be cut you cut me you shaped my life you make me in the image you want me to be here believe from the heart how do we do this since if you can just empty out your own intellectual thoughts this isn't give God the right away he can declare look at this his character through the what the work of your yielding it's work empty out get the world get your doubts out of the way so well that means I have to kind of clean up my life and then come to the Lord no sir uh-uh there's somebody here gonna turn on the light you can't sweep the darkness out of the room you can try all you like take somebody to turn the light on and that's what God does he turns the light on all the darkness just scatters it just moves out of the way just yield yourself to him he does the sawing he does the building he does the working he knows what it do here and I know we were kind of ooh just the scary thing that's watch you're kind of running out of time but I want to just underline these few things for you before we go now we ought to conduct ourselves like sons of the King daughters of the king especially the worse it gets the more the closer the brighter in a rail 56 is men and woman we are aliens here on this earth aliens with pilgrims and strangers our garden our crisis on the other side and we are sons and daughters of the king we ought to be conducting ourselves not in the gambling smoking drinking picture shows television programs scandal lies carrying on we should conduct ourselves as sons and daughters of God walking with our heads up living in the light of the King yes sir it's yours he says if you want it how about it it's yours if you believe that you have to have it don't just slop around just live a second grade Christian life don't have to if you say well I want it that's all it takes tonight just I want it and he does the work he does the sawing he does the shaping amen it's yours tonight not tomorrow the biggest lie the devil can tell you is put it off you'll get another chance grab the opportunity while you head we might not have another service what if he comes tonight then this is our last chance why would you miss it what would you make make you linger and say well I'll just put it off it's not gonna get better you're you're just gonna have more scars that's all more regrets God sends your light and he has sent our light and that's why we can't help but believe this message because when it came it just illuminated this word mayor made all the Scriptures jump out at you all of a sudden you were baptized into it by a Holy Ghost baptism and now it's all yours everything that Arkady's brother Bennett talks about it'll land the promised land full of blessings full of healing full of virtue full of all the overcoming power you need it's all there for this season he has a seed he has a flower he has a picture he has a note for this time Lord shaped me to that Lord get my testimony in line with what you're doing oh I just struck me again on the weekend you know the dumb animals could hear it in Noah's day it doesn't take a smart guy doesn't take a clever guy it doesn't even take a brain because how can animals without an understanding come to the ark Noah didn't go out and drag him in he didn't go preaching the bush somewhere and there the animals came God brought them how surprised Noah must have been here they're coming we've been building all these making all these preparations here they come they could those animals could hear the voice of God what about it what about me what about you can you hear that peace sake come up higher we're getting out of here the countdown is on yes sir oh I believe in the whole heart you must feel it like the veil is getting pretty thin isn't it between here and there it's just it's all over you you touch the word now and it's electricity it's just amazing the same things you read 10 years ago all of a sudden they're jumping out at you because this is the time this is the translation hour it's on us amen yes say your good-byes if you want to we're leaving mm-hmm message influence 63 says if I see a man walking fine looking young man a few years watch his hair turned green slip out his shoulders threw down beautiful young girl standing with a sainted godly face on harassed and praising God and come back in a few years and find her stoop-shouldered packing two or three children well my it shows that in that body there's death no matter how well it is how lovely it looks it's still got death in it is now watch i watch which away that spirit in there leans if it's always representing the light speaking of the light talking of the light it'll go with the light it's but if it's always on the other side of the world the things of the world influenced by the world there's nothing but it to turn into darkness when it dies into outer darkness this is so you see since what we are we must remember that we are only what we are by the grace of God none of us can brag about it we can only bow in adoration and humility before God and give praise to him for his goodness what you are today is only by God's grace and here we are this is the Bible calls it evens 110 calls it the fullness of time in King James in the amplified that's not the amplifier that's the King James I got that's the mistake in the EM amplified I've got the reference there to remind me it causes the climax of the ages the climax this is what it's all been about really so it wasn't what's the Calvary the climax to the ages Calvary was for now Pentecost was for now when death will be abolished death will be conquered and they'll walk home straight because it shows you the blood of the power the power of the blood of Calvary that life who was in the blood the same spirit raised jesus from DES now in us quickening our mortal bodies so here we are this is the climax this is it brothers no wonder we can feel it all things is going to gather all things in Christ both which are in heaven those are those those already gone on coming back to the resurrection and on the earth that's us it'll be translated in the moment in the twinkling of an eye even in him see the discrepancy he says so we find the same old solar discrepancy and remember that sin was never forgiven that's causing adding a little thought to God's Word so now brother if it was never forgiven then what about now says when the real seed of all the ages are coming together all the ages here it is rather bran says the six thousand years I sometimes had the idea was just the last two thousand you know uh-huh six thousand years you're gonna see Adam one of these things you're that knock on your door sometimes wonder if they'll knock oh they'll just come here and give you a big fright wouldn't they but you'll know who it is it's not like they have to introduce themselves can you imagine do you know how close it is sometimes a little while ago is reading revelations nineteen seventeen and nineteen there were they heavenly oh it's coming down to Armageddon and I read it and I thought man I'm gonna be there I'm gonna see this and it's like you think about a birthday or Christmas or something coming up it's pretty exciting said oh yeah we got to make these plans it became that real to me I thought you know I can't tell you what excitement is it's just way beyond that because that's what's lying ahead for you oh I've got to go to school to write exams and learn math brother your next stop is to have any supper that that's where we're going Oh doesn't it just make you feel a little better or a whole lot maybe for like me our lives our lives these lives you're living right now our testimony so the tie posts for this age do you realize that you're gonna read that absolute message again I'm gonna give you a little quote from absolute and I'll hold on to your chair okay don't want you're going anywhere listen to this just really put a spiritual thinking cap on now it says in the portion of his word that's allotted for this day that's the rapture Elijah then the days of the voice of the seventh angel all those scriptures his Holy Spirit is here to manifest that portion of word now watch it says just like it was back there at his birth Isaiah 9:6 all down through the scriptures everything was spoken of him it was fulfilled right all those things that spoke about Jesus when he came it happened there he was his over in the Book of Luke we see see it there it was the a he and he was the end he was the end of the prophecy - of him they could argue they could debate oh and Messiah comes he's gonna come this way he's gonna come that way he's gonna do this he's gonna do that but when he stepped on the scene and did it all that was the end of the argument he was the interpretation of the word this is what God meant when he said those things right you know watch this he fulfilled that the history the songs everything in the Old Testament that spoke of him was fulfilled right there that become the ultimate what not the words in the book the words in flesh the same words manifested became the absolute the ultimate sunderson the Bible is my ultimate you don't know what you're talking about the Bible made flesh is the ultimate the absolute I'm gonna now watch as I say - hold onto your chair here we go and I'm sure you know where I'm going because that became the typos of the Word of God for that age mmm-hmm that's Jesus wonderful praise the Lord how about it and the real born-again people of God next paragraph he says of this age that's filled with the Holy Ghost is the type oast of this scripture that's got to be fulfilled in these last days they they are the ultimate right in the absolute message you can't argue with that so what does it become not you the word manifested in years becomes the ultimate for this age oh your dreary little life story uh-huh the things you've faced the times you failed you say what about the failures what about Jacob uh-huh but when God thought about that age he thought about Jacob but not Esau there you are brother what God spoke concerning you takes on flesh in you becomes your daily walk it is God's ultimate because it's his word and the word is Christ - ty Post there's no way to get away from it something that holds you something that holds you why don't you go with the rest of them but Jesus asked the Apostles the disciples that day oh I've said things you don't understand it's a cloud it's a rocket you know don't understand can't figure it out there's no scientific proof for this they you know with a bridge that the incident never happened all that stuff why you still here because wait where you gonna go these are the words of eternal life this is God in you manifesting himself can you see the supernatural power God you know I spoke to my sister she lives on the east side of Canada it's been a far away's to people can get in Canada I'm right in the West she's right in the east we're four hours apart and time zones that gives you an idea and she there's no church out there so just she's living with her husband you know going to work every day coming back and you know she says she thought she asked me you know what what manifestation of God is there her life like she's just living in ordering life I asked her you still believe the message she's yeah of course I said okay there it is there it is this is the falling away we're in the falling away what's keeping you can you read that something that holds you what is that the ultimate the absolute for this age because you don't keep yourself if he doesn't keep you you're gone like everybody else so isn't that a proof that isn't that a confirmation to you tonight that he loves you sure it is because he keeps your heart when everybody else is turning away he say where can I go there's nowhere to go what are you gonna join some other church gonna go what what what is out there praise the Lord I gotta wrap up here Oh seed of discrepancy this is too beautiful get back in the seat of discrepancy now says this he was the Word made manifest we saw that he was God's interpretation of the word look at that he says it out straight out he says because he said search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me right there you are he was the interpretation of the word and every born-again son a daughter of God not just him every born-again son and daughter of God of this age is the interpretation of the word oh my when God said those things when he showed the vision to John on the Isle of Patmos and he wrote it down there and he saw those people rejoicing and singing a new song what was he seeing you you are the Ripon epistles rid of all men just what Paul said in the beginning you know God is doing the writing here not me you might read this letter to the Corinthians but there's another letter being written oh yeah it's the imprint of God on the hearts of people that's what's being written this is your our that you were born for this no other time not no it's time not Jesus time right now you were born for a body change you were born to believe the message you were born to hear that Eagle scream you were born to come out of her not be partakers of her place further Donnie says the word becomes alive in our own flesh that shows the presence of God whoa not the feeling not an anointing but the word becoming flesh in you shows the presence of God now you can see when you get sick then you don't have to run to the doctor the first thing you say by stripes I'm healed Lord I commit this to you and if you lead you to the doctor and go to the doctor but the truth of it is there's no healing but from the doctor life is the healer all healing comes from God all healing is divine healing doctor gonna only kill that rat that invaded but who's gonna fix the hole he can't do it he said brother Brown said if we could do that we could make a man right here if we had that kind of a material but we can't make a man things that are to be in one winding down here things that are to be only one form of eternal life was God there to be a son of God you had to be in him always the gene of your life spiritual life tonight it was in God the Father before there was even a molecule see and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a son of God now you're expressed he says after his word has come in you to what to light up this age oh brother shake yourself morning stars what are you here for to light up this age to light up your household a lot of your workplace light up your neighborhood light up your church oh we're not just pick taters we're not on lookers we're here to shine we're here to rise up and say this is my hour I'm stepping on the scene I'm gonna speak the truth I'm gonna love the truth I'm gonna believe the truth oh brother it just serves something in my heart you could join many things today I don't know if anything's worth joining oh brother that everyone wants to you to join this Rewards program that rewards you want to look at this rewards program for a minute and they say the more you spend the more rewards you get right oh brother yeah oh there's a lot there's a lot of rewards limits that's another service we have to get we get to the end here beginning and ending the gentle disposition we're here only to manifest his work everything else remember it's one place where the band said you you came to earth for only one thing to make a decision it's as simple as that right if you're young or old tonight you want to say well I realize that and I want to make my decision I want my way with a Lourdes biased view I want to there's an attraction for me from heaven I don't understand it all their understanding is never required it's just reacting on a little tug in your heart the fade is little tug on your heart you say Lord me I'm coming I want to be part of that I want to be part of those Bible people I want to be part of that of the Lord Jesus Christ I want to be part of that family when you come I want to go with you if you come tonight I want to go with you that's all it takes like a little child remember jesus said unless you come like one of these you don't even see the kingdom praise God it doesn't take intellectual Giants understanding all laying it all out we saw those they were dressed up in Pharisee ropes he said some of these glorious days now got there now some of these glorious days you'll find out that this bunch of power that changes harlots to ladies and drunkards to gentlemen that presence is the very power that will lift them out of this earth and take them home in the rapture to glory isn't that something that little tuck rather vanishes that thing that made you certain of the gospel there it is oh it's not just the power it's somebody somebody it's coming to you and he's taking you with him when he leaves the earth says what is it since I've walked out and looked at that great that great morning star she begins to move yonder what does the morning star say the morning star is only reflecting the supreme light of the Sun coming remember that it's just the planet out there we call the morning star reflecting the Sun this is that right the morning star the reason it's so bright you know why it is the Sun so much closer to it it's suppressing on in the morning star hails the coming of the son it's alright you morning stars it's time to go to hailing is coming not just the prophets message he your life that message becomes a life in you and now you become the life you become the voice because it's a voice speaking overriding your reasoning and your understanding and your feelings and your on your nonsense it's overcoming all of that and shining outshine the morning stars rise early says it says the Sun will soon be here which is when we look and see that morning star just a glistening in the skies and means that the Sun will shine pretty soon and when we see the morning stars of God rising and shining to the glory of a resurrection of Jesus Christ shows that that supreme one is pressing on Lord through the shining do the reflecting in this life you know that Hubble Space Telescope the Santa Paula doe had a little flaw in the mirror that flaw I think was one millionth of a human hair that was the flaw and it would give a blurry image and had to go up there and sort that out before to give a proper this is beyond human ability this is beyond our dedication and promises we can make this takes Almighty God in the power of God but you are candidates for other balanced State for the supernatural you are here tonight for that exact same thing to reflect off your do some polishing in my life Lord that's all that that's normally a signal we've been too long but I'm glad that the musicians can come I've got my last little thing here I gotta put scripture up for you and that's all said when we see the morning stars of God rising shining to the glory of the resurrection of Jesus Christ shows it that supreme us pressing on the lights are gathering but the morning star haulers hold on it isn't long till daylight hold on it's not long till daylight just keep holding on since sister Murphy and them used to sing just keep holding on daylight soon coming hold on until day the morning stars are shining to the world now lighting up the world just before the great darkness and the great Thunderbolt from heaven the coming of the Lord this is where we are this is the exact moment this is a time in that symphony and if you feel the smallest tug that means you're part of it so I said devil won't give you that tug devil says put it off put it off put it off don't wait second Timothy 4:6 Paul finished his course he was ready to go that's where the church is just about now oh I know this one or two still coming in and it's really one or two you know in the out-of-the-way places of the world he said the second Timothy four six four I'm now ready to be offered she's at the time of my departure is at hand I have fought a good fight I finished my course I've kept the faith this is henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day not to me only but unto all them that love his appearing all them also that love his appearing if you love his appearing in other words what he's doing right now how he has appeared to you and there's an attraction there a great magnet just drawing you a pool from heaven a pool place from for life you say Lord I feel that pull I feel that little tug in my heart the Lord letting me shine forth maybe that part and you know there's a recognition this is your time kids you're not gonna have time to grow up teenagers you might not have time to get that marriage partner and that wife and that job you might not have it right this is the end there's gonna be kids in the rapture it's gonna be teenagers in the rapture this is where we're at the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things will be added to you don't worry you're not gonna lose out on nothing remember brother Brennan said when Jesus comes you'll only take one thing away from you and that's your sin that's what he takes away amen so here we are I'd like us to sing that actually song purify my heart you know it I'd love to sing that song I felt to sing another one here but let's first see that one let's stand together brother and sister this is your time you were born for this
