believe we're gonna have church today hallelujah amen let's go to the scripture we're gonna go to psalms chapter 40. amen great to have all the visitors here today trust you feel welcome and at home and the presence of the lord i mean we're going to go to psalms 40 and 1 so i don't have a slide show today amen this is here psalms 14 1 says to the chief musician islam of david i waited patiently for the lord he inclined unto me and heard my cry he brought me up also out of a horrible pit out of the mirey clay and set my feet upon a rock and establish my goings amen and he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our god many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the lord blessed is that man that maketh the lord his trust and respecteth not the proud nor such as turn aside to lies many o lord my god are thy wonderful works which thou hast done and thy thoughts which are to us would they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee if i would declare and speak of them they are more than can be numbered amen you just go to think about what the lord has done for you and hallelujah you'll end up a real happy person amen we're going to go to psalms 23 verses 5 and 6 as well just um i'm going to kind of pick up where we left off on wednesday i want to speak about the effects of those who sit at his table because there's an effect there's a real effect hallelujah it's not just an intellectual learning and absorbing information but there's a reality that comes into a person's life and so so david would say here thou prepare us a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anoint us my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i'll dwell in the house of the lord forever hallelujah amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer let's all invite him to where we are today gracious eternal father how great you are lord you are lord you're so supreme we praise your mighty name we're so thankful we can bow our heads in our hearts lord and your presence and give you thanks for the mighty salvation the mighty works you've done in our lives and we just want to ask that you take the service under your divine control lord i just pray as you are a personal god i just asked my evan here invite you to where they are at lord may you come to every seat to every pure and may have your way in every life may you just come and meet our needs lord answer our questions change us lord mold us and shape us lord refill us with your spirit dear god lord jesus lord those who may be wary and well doing lord may strengthen and encourage lord renew our strength o lord father may raise up on eagle's wings for your glory we just want to submit our lives into your hands may take control of the service and we just thank you we can be in your presence once again we ask lord for those who could not be here today lord we're the second body or lord they're traveling somewhere lord i pray you just touch their lives and be their portion today as well grant it for your glory lord in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats so as i was saying a lot to continue on from from from wednesday and the effects of uh sitting at his table now brother braham says in the sermon the mighty god unveiled before us in 1964 he says since the holy ghost has come in this last days is prophesied and the veil has been rent too many people try to hang on to their traditions of the fathers and that's why they can't see this extreme joy and peace and the things that the church has today yet it's been made yet it's in plain view to those who believe so there's an actual effect that the word should have in our lives you know it should produce we know the life of jesus christ and us you know it should you know there's a transforming power in the word that'll change us from glory to glory but you know but there should be an effect i believe of someone who feeds at the table of the lord there should be an effect in our lives there should be a an influence that you know changes us and molds us and you know i just want to say this morning you know we're here to sit at the table of the lord we're not here to have religion this is not about religion if you want religion you've come to the wrong church i mean but here's we are here to have a real relationship with jesus christ that we would know him in the power of of his resurrection and david you know i love i love david incredible kind of man very you could say unusual kind of man even for his day where he would have such a longing for god no matter how much god had done in his life how much god had lived in his life he always wanted more and i believe that is just really a representation of who we are as people you know we've seen god do so much i mean he's done incredible things in our lives he's opened his word made his covenant so real to us and transformed us and renewed us and saved us but yet we want more of him amen and we need more of him in this day you know this is a day of formality it's a day of great emotionalism you know but there's a reality in the word of god that goes beyond emotion goes beyond formality goes beyond tradition you know that will actually you know get a hold of our lives and change us now what i love about being called to the table of the lord is it does not matter the state we started david would come to a spot in his life when he was established as king over israel and he then he remembered the covenant he made with his friend jonathan and he began to inquire through the kingdom are there any of jonathan's children alive and and and it was heard you know and it was reported back to him yes there's a mephibosheth who who is who is far away somewhere in the kingdom and david says call him call him here because he wanted him to sit at his table and yeah mephibosheth we know was was jonathan's son he was the house of saul which was the enemies of david and you know so no doubt mephibosheth he did come with great fear and trembling thinking that david was going to kill him because you know mephibosheth was the rightful heir to the throne but david wasn't interested in killing mephibosheth he wanted mephibosheth at david's table and the scripture tells us we were once the enemies of god you know we were we were contrary to his ways our nature was contrary to his nature but he didn't want us to stay in that state he wanted us to sit at his table to dine at his guests i mean to partake of his goodness hallelujah so mephibosheth is called now this mephibosheth we know the scripture tells us in in second samuel four and four and jonathan saul's son had a son that was lame of his feet he was five years old when the tidings came of saul and jonathan out of jezreel and his nurse took him up and fled and it came to pass as she made haste to flee then he fell and became lame and his name was mephibosheth so here is a man that has been affected by something from his childhood it was not something he did he did not plan to you know become lame it was what was going on in his parents life that actually caused him to become a and many things can happen in our lives have i got to have i got everyone's attention just now you know because we can be living under the influence of something that's not our fault not even our plans our you know it can be our family the church something going on and can cause us to be crippled in a certain way that hinders our walk but i'm so thankful that god doesn't want us to live under the influence of our past he wants us to live under the influence of our future now what is our future well we're going to the streets of gold we're going to be dancing on the streets of gold through eternity hallelujah when the devil is no more we still shall be hallelujah i trust god's made that real to you amen that you've got a heaven to go to and a hell you're not going to amen you're not even called to go to the great white throne judgment amen this message has been sent hardly that a people will not go and stand before the great white throne judgment but they will go hallelujah up until eternity and they will actually sit with christ and judge the world i'm sorry if i'm talking too fast this is how it is today hallelujah just replay the video on half speed maybe you know but mephibosheth was was afraid but david wasn't interested in killing him he wasn't looking for revenge you know our god is not angry at us you know the reason he corrects us is to keep us on the road he doesn't set us up to fail he sets us up to be victorious hallelujah so he's not angry you know many people are afraid that god's just going to get sick of them and throw them away who's ever had that feeling oh yeah many times think lord you should have thrown me in the bin someplace and just that's it yeah i've yeah i've had enough with you you're done now god's not that way he can't change his mind about his his children hallelujah you can't change his mind about his word hallelujah so here comes mephibosheth now he's he's he's under fear and trembling and he comes in and this is in second samuel nine and six and then when mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of saul was come unto david he fell on his face ended reverence and david said mephibosheth he answered behold thy servant and david said unto him fear not how how many times does an angel or someone come you know god comes to a people says fear not amen we don't need to be afraid fear not for i will surely show thee kindness for jonathan thy father's sake and will restore thee all the land of saul thy father and thou shall eat bread at my table continually and bowed him and he bowed himself down said what is thy servant that thou should just look upon such a dead dog such as i am so this is what mephibosheth thought himself as i'm just a dead dog but but you know the people at the king's table are honored people harley and it's the king's invitation that makes them worthy to sit at the table it's not their worthiness not their prestige or their honor or what they know who they are no it's it's it's the king's commandment i've got a wedding supper feast i'm going to call the people it doesn't matter how they're physical maybe crippled or whatever more forget all those things you know we we pander so much to complexes and pains and hurts and bad memories and trouble and forget that thing i mean because there'll come a time where they won't even be a memory anymore oh there god doesn't worry about our physical state he's he's worried about our spiritual state what's the condition of our soul today amen is it being washed in the blood of the lamb do you really know him the power of his resurrection that's what he's interested in i mean because god is looking for his seed he's looking for his children and he can't lose one of them hallelujah amen so here he was mephibosheth was called and so so mephibosheth dwelt in jerusalem for he didn't eat continually at the king's table and was lame on both his feet now i want to ask you a question when you see people sitting around a table do you see their feet if there's a you know a tablecloth there can you see their physical condition they all sitting they all look the same so you couldn't see you couldn't see mephibosheth's lameness in his feet because he was sitting at the table of the lord he looked like every well-body person there i mean and we're called to sit at the lord's table i mean he actually covers he doesn't just hide our infirmities or our physical failings but he changes them by the power of his blood you know our body's gonna be changed one day hallelujah so we can't if we're called then the lord covers actually these things that we hold so much against ourselves hallelujah now this is just a physical ailment how much more a spiritual ailment that's not just covered but taken away by the blood of jesus christ i mean so mephibosheth was called and he looked like all the same as you're all the same as all the other guests hallelujah remember he was called because of who he was he was the son of jonathan that's why he was called you know we are the children of the most high god you know this you know there's such a wrestle there's such a wrestle today about identity what's our identity even this country is going through a great identity change you know for good awful bad you know but you know there's great a big challenge what's your identity and i've come to the realization my identity is in the word of god amen this message is my identity this message called me it said brother brown said the bridegroom call will come right through this he says i'm i may not do it but this message will introduce jesus christ to the world and that's what happened to me i didn't meet a doctrine i didn't meet a church i met the lord jesus christ himself highly transformed my life so what he said would happen happened to me i mean to my identities in christ it's not in anything else hallelujah i may speak like a kiwi act like a kiwi you know look like a kiwi but i'm not a kiwi i'm a christian hallelujah isn't that right our identity is in christ amen so mephibosheth's identity was to be at the king's table that's where he was ordained to be that's where he should have been hallelujah and that's where he ended up amen hallelujah and this is it's the same thing with us who's been called to sit at his table now so there's not just the effect of covering any physical failures hallelujah but there's an anointing that comes because he said you know you sit he sets a table before me in the prince of my enemies then he anointeth my head and my cup runneth over so there's an effect of being at this table now there's a vast difference between intellectually learning the word that actually being under being under the inspiration of the word and feeding on it spiritually they can look the same you can read the same bible hear the same message but it's got to be inspired to you that the same inspiration that was spoken in or the same inspiration that paul would have it written down on hello as or whoever the writers are that same inspiration is going to come upon us i mean that it's the author that wrote it or spoke it now receives it in us hallelujah amen song of solomon two and four he brought me to his banqueting house and his banner of me was love who's in this love feast today hallelujah you know if you're looking on thinking what are these people happy about just partake of this food just open your heart let them come in and you'll you'll see what we're excited about hallelujah now we're just gonna go back to first peter five and seven again and said you know from wednesday casting all your care upon him for a caret for you now i'm going to go you know i want to emphasize that he cares for you part and then he say here in first peter 5 and 8 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resisted fast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world so basically the things you go through everyone goes through right you're not a special case hallelujah amen but the god of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus that after ye have suffered a while make you perfect establish amen strengthen and settle you now this word establish it means to sit fast i mean to turn resolutely in a certain direction that's what it means to be a step to you know establish you he wants to so so he wants to set you in a certain direction i we're marching to zion beautiful beautiful zion is that is that the direction we should be hey i can't sing to save myself i'm going to sing anyway don't let noah oh what do people think about me well i'm just singing to the lord i got here to make a joyful noise [Music] i think you love me enough to put up with it so you know but you know but that's that that should be our direction we're steadfast we've been established well we tossed to and throw this opinion this blog this website this instagram post the social media thing no i'm steadfast i've got a destination that i'm going towards hallelujah amen so to strengthen and to settle us to him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen amen so this this word for he careth for you it means to be of interest to that is to concern so he he has an interest in us he's concerned about us now that concern goes far deeper than just worry about how we are even though that's part of it you know the lord wants us to be happy do you know that we he he wants us to be happy christians you know to be a message believe is not a long hair long skirt long frown let's be joy unspeakable full of glory right he wants us to be happy brother braham says this he says um from uh it's not so from the beginning he says now find them on the mission field starve to death almost i've seen them with no shoes on their feet living off about 30 cents a week preaching the gospel brother just as happy as you are coming in a limousine they are happy for they found something that means more than creed or no or denomination or church affiliation they found what it takes to bring joy and a christian should be happy we were prayed for that our joys might be full i mean there's something about that that's real hallelujah so you know so jesus would say as the father hath loved me so i have loved you continue in my love if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide and abide in his love these things have i spoken unto you that joy that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full he says now if you've lost that joy if we have lost those things we can't find them among our kindreds we can't find them then there's one thing to do is to go back where we left them at the church should go back to the beginning where they left and that's exactly what mary and joseph did they left jesus at the feast of pentecost that's where mary and joseph left jesus so we need to if you if you've lost your joy go back and get it wherever you've left him go back to wherever you found him now to me when he speak about the feast of pentecost to me this is speaking when the holy ghost first came so he's saying go back to where he first met you i mean go back through your testimony to where he first met you and build from there again that doesn't mean you tear down everything else he did for you but go back to where you met your first love and you fell in love with him and you'll get your joy back i mean then you'll get your peace back amen because the same god that called you can't lose you he's gonna keep you hallelujah amen so that's where he's saying go back where you first met him where he touched your life and put a desire in your heart to serve him do you know we can walk above criticism do you know we can walk above fearing what other people think of us i mean if our focus is on the right thing we can actually walk above what other people think or misunderstandings what other people think we can walk above criticism we can walk above you know what everyone else is doing and we can worship god out of a pure heart hallelujah you know david as i said was an incredible man unusual for his day but an incredible you know incredible man he had a longing to see god live above all things he had it all he was king over the whole nation i mean but but he wanted more those things didn't really satisfy him as much as god living in his life and he would come to a place where he desired that the ark would be returned to his city now here he comes to a spot where the ark is returning and you know he just got a little bit excited remember when he would write psalms 23 he sets a table before me in the prince of my enemies and then he anointed my head but with joy my cup runneth over you know he experienced that it wasn't something that he just wrote down that sounded good i mean but he really experienced that so he knew what it was like to be anointed by god and his cup to run over i mean the thing is when cups run over people criticize people look at that in a sideways way and say well you're just too happy you're just too fanatical you're just going off the deep end i tell you what depends where the swimming waters is at i mean i like to do a cannonball into a deep end hallelujah that's a good place to be i mean the shallow end you can jump in and break your neck i don't want to break my neck i want to swim in the deepness of god not just the shallow bits but the deepness of god others so david would see the ark coming back and he just got a little bit excited and then he began to dance and it wasn't necessary choreographed but he didn't care so much because he wasn't worshiping to entertain the people around him he was worshiping his god because the ark was coming down into the city into his own city not to someone else's city but into his city he began to dance and rejoice and he wasn't caring what it looked like he didn't say hold on is this okay he didn't care he was what his cup was running over hallelujah and he was rejoicing but there was someone there that didn't really enjoy it there was a king's daughter who looked out of the palace window she wasn't part of the worship she was just a spectator don't be a spectator don't be a spectator sure you can get the same t-shirt you know a lot of people bought team new zealand t-shirts but they're just spectators on the side and they wrote blogs and things how they should do what they should have done all about the america's cup they weren't on the water they were just spectators hallelujah i don't want to be a spectator in this one that was just for an old mug hallelujah this is for a crown of life we're talking about now i mean so i don't just want to be a spectator while they should do this and this is how it should be here and this and that no no get on board hallelujah so there's the king's daughter which was the daughter of saul and she looked out the window and she just had a critical spirit on her many times we think discernment is criticism or criticism is discernment no it's not because if it is discernment god will give you the answer how to fix it hallelujah it's easy to point out wrong here i am you know if you want you know if you came here for saying to criticize i think i've got given you enough material for for a few months you know but you know but if you've come to see god then you'll get your reward hallelujah i mean so she she you know she felt embarrassed because what her husband was doing i mean but she was a king's daughter show she was sitting in a place of privilege but she did not understand that place what that place meant i mean if she really knew what that place meant she would be dancing too because the ark wasn't just coming into david city it was her city here was that ark that was you know out with the philistines different places now it had been returned hallelujah and davis dancing she got offended by it but then did this stop david from dancing there should be nothing that stops our dance there should be nothing that stops our walk sure there'll be things that try and stop it to him that overcometh hallelujah will i grant to sit in my throne as i sat there to my father's throne so criticisms are something we've got to overcome how the coldness that comes into the church we've got to overcome it you know we had um i think it was brother andrew glover here whenever that was i was sitting down the back i found a coldness coming to the church during that service i refused to be subjected to it i started praising god and drawing and i and then i had a glorious time hallelujah that was true sitting back there so you know we shouldn't just say you know we're not called just to be thermos temperature gauges we're called to be thermostats if it gets cold turn up the heat it can't get too hot either by the way so don't turn it down you know but we should just be reactive to the atmosphere around us we should be reactive to what's in us the revelation that's in us that's how we should be reacting just like david he wasn't dancing because everyone else was happy there's a revelation coming forth hallelujah was the mercy seat coming into a city hallelujah he was the prince of god coming into a city and he was rejoicing amen and i will restore brother brahm says i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them by the grace of god wouldn't swap it for nothing in the world oh sure they call me this that or the other that don't make any difference what they call me god calls me his son amen that's the main thing amen that's the main thing i see that little old girl that time david's wife that hid behind her fan fanning like that and she thought david her sweet sweetheart was the cutest thing but when the ark come in and david saw it and a revival was in session little old david went down there and danced around the ark as hard as he could go why she said you embarrass me my well i'll have the general counsel to put you out why you embarrass me see it's easy really if you want to see if you're looking at a future spouse somewhere see how they react in the presence of god right because sure she thought david was wonderful but when he got anointed really hurt her true feelings came out i mean so so if you're looking for a future spouse look how they are in the presence of god not just talking about the word and being religious but what happens when they get under the influence of the holy ghost and then you'll see their true selves come out hallelujah why oh see i'll put you out the next general counsel why you embarrass me he said if you don't like that watch this and down he went and around and around and around and around on the arc he went rejoicing happy shouting praising god and rejoicing hallelujah if you don't like that then watch this hallelujah and that should be and then god looked down from heaven and said david you're a man after my own heart hallelujah so don't make any difference what the world says it's what god says amen hallelujah that's how we should be we can live he lived above criticism under the blood of balls and goats how much more you know david he had such a longing in his heart but it couldn't be fully expressed under the blood of bulls and goats hallelujah because god could just be with him but not actually in them but now under the blood of jesus christ the longing he had can be satisfied in you and i brother brown speaks about it and spoken word is the original seed he said he had a longing but he wasn't the right moisture to bring it to life amen but here could you imagine what david would be like in this day could you imagine how he would have been hallelujah he would tear this place up hallelujah he'd be rejoicing why are you so happy david can't you see what you've got can't you see what you have right now holy can't you see that god dwells in you and you're the temple of the living god more than under a tent more than a temple of stone but in flesh can't you see what you have you're about to go on a rapture how are you about to be translated from this world to the next world can't you see what you've got you've got overcoming power to overcome this first birth that you're born with this carnal nature hallelujah can't you see what you have right now can't you see what you have you have power to overcome this world i mean overcome every demon of hell all torment all of your past your pain whatever it may be this is what you have and this is why david would have been rejoicing can't you see what you have right now hallelujah we have power to overcome all temptation all trials all hardship all trouble all sin all the problem with the flesh whatever it may be we have power right now by the blood of jesus christ by the baptism of the holy ghost we have power to overcome all things harley that's why he would have been dancing hallelujah amen you know they long to live in this day the scripture says the prophets of old day long to live in this day and god said to them no it's not for you you can be there but these people are going to be here hallelujah and here we are you know so amazing all of the hardship and the trouble and the burdens of the saints down through the ages and we just reap the benefits of it hallelujah isn't it incredible hallelujah praise the lord and if they could overcome in their day great obstacles great trouble we can as well and we will hallelujah amen david would come to a spot where he you know took bathsheba and did those things and he you know two years later the prophet came and exposed that sin in his life and he would say restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit so the joy it wasn't the joy of david's salvation that he wanted restoring but the joy of god's salvation you know that the word if we're not careful can become common it can just become like a like information i've heard that before i've heard that quote before i've heard that scripture before i've sung that yeah we've sung that song before we've done it in that way before but that you know it can just become the joy leaves but we can keep that joy hallelujah we may sing the same song every week it can just mean more to you every time that same quote can mean a lot more to you every time that same scripture can mean a lot more why because there's a joy in the word holy there should be a joy in being a christian this is not a walk of drudgery sure there's trouble there's hardship you know sure there's all those things but there should be such a joy on the inside of the inside i'm going in a rapture hallelujah this is all going to be okay hallelujah we should have joy unspeakable and full of glory amen hallelujah amen you know we have something that overcomes remember the lord has already overcome all our troubles we're going through right now he or the god in you has already overcome all things amen you know you know what i love about god i'll just go back to here our god has got everywhere when when when syria would come and attack um attack israel and this was under king ahab's that kind of blew my mind in itself um they fought a battle in the valley and israel won in the valley and syria said well because they're because their god is god in the valley will replace all of our soldiers and we'll fight them in the mountains and they and the israelites one in the mountains as well so here's victorious in the valley and he's victorious in the mountains you know he was god in a whale's belly he heard the prayers of jonah hallelujah so so he was god under the ocean with jonah amen and he was god on top of the ocean walking on the water he was a god in the storm on the ocean with the disciples and with paul he was god in the furnace with the three hebrew children i'm just laying out different places where he's god amen he was god an alliance then with daniel he was god in prison with paul and silas hallelujah he was god on death row with peter peter was on death row the next morning he was going to be executed he was god with peter on death right hallelujah he was he was god in the stalemate between israel and the philistines with david and goliath there could be a stalemate in our lives he's god in that stalemate that stalemate's got to come to an end holy we're going to keep pushing the battle i mean don't just give up because the first day there's no answer amen keep pressing on he was god in the desert he was god in egypt he was god on mount carmel hallelujah hallelujah he's even got it 32 000 feet yes that's right amen my new brother-in-law i can't get any more um you know jimmy he had a supernatural experience flying from chile to new zealand at 32 000 feet in a plane was a different person from the person that bought the plane to the person that got off the plane god changed his life at 32 000 feet he's got in the house hallelujah amen he's got everywhere so whatever situation you find yourself in he's god he's god hallelujah amen hallelujah so we don't need to worry about anything amen amen he is god everywhere now we have something as i said we have a power by the holy ghost to overcome all things some people say well i just can't go back to my first love they may not say it like this but their actions prove it but there is never anything that cannot be redeemed david came to a spot he came to a lot of places good times bad times he was a man after god's own heart just because god had made a covenant with david that he would be king did not mean his walk would be easy remember faith does not make things easy but it makes it possible hallelujah so david was anointed to become king i saw a picture i think of facebook or somewhere there's a diagram of this is how people's people think their walk should be just going like this you know but god's view it's up and down and there's you know trouble and all these things but you're going up as long as your trajectory is up that's the main thing so david was was um there and you know he was about to be part of that battle with the philistines that would uh ultimately kill saul and jonathan but then he managed to get out of that battle and um he would come back he would be coming back to ziglag where all of his family was and i've never ever come back or begin to journey back home and see my house on fire and smoke coming up and maybe you know well i remember when i was young it was it was uh because i was at primary school and we actually saw this all the smoke come up from there where my house was this is in gisborne but it was actually the um petrol station on fire but it was pretty much you know pretty close to where our house was so at first you think well is that our house but in the close you get you realize it's not your house but imagine you flip it around the other way you think is that the neighbor's house is it this house no you find out it's your house and it wasn't just his house on fire the whole city was on fire and so they came back to ziglag and they they found out that all their family had been taken captive but none of them were dead and david and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives then david and the people that with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep this is the spot he was in his walk with god he's just about to step on the throne it's always darkest before dawn you know the prince of god brings us new hope you know when the lord comes in you know into a service or you're praying or wherever you may you know god comes near it just just rekindles your hope doesn't know gives you a renewed strength lord you're still with me in this battle holy or so so they wept until they had no more power to weep and david's two wives were taken captive his family was taken captive his uh his men that gathered themselves to david all their family was taken captive and even as men got to such a spot because they had they had lost everything you know you can replace a house you can replace cattle you can replace you can replace physical things but you can't replace family you can't just go get another one so here they were their most prized possessions their family had been taken captive and they even planned they're going to stone david this one that they knew was coming into power as king they got they got so discouraged at their state at what their five senses declared i mean that they decided well we're just gonna stone him but david because he had sat at the table of the lord he knew where his source of strength was his source of strength wasn't his mighty men his source of strength was in his family and his source of strength was a covenant god had made with him god promised david you're going to be king it wasn't david making the promise with god that he was going to be king god told david you're going to be king david i've anointed you for this purpose that's why my spirit's upon you i mean your your life is going to fulfill this prophecy of you becoming king we've been anointed too you know i don't know if you realize that but we're under an anointing actually the whole world is anointed amen this world has become drunk i mean from the cup of wine in the hand the whole world has become drunk via social media religion politics wherever people are steeping staggering along under the influence of a spirit intoxicated but then also the bride of christ is under the influence i mean we're under the anointing of the mighty angel himself that we are drunk by the stimulation of revelation of the word hallelujah i mean so here he was he knew what his source of strength was he says but david encouraged himself and the lord has god i mean that's why our opening scripture was you know basically if we could just think of all the mighty works god has done they're too many to tell we can't number them all there's just so many things what god has done in our lives he's called us he's justified us he sanctified us he's glorified us he washes of our sins took our first nature away gave us a new birth filled us with a spirit hallelujah established our goals in his word made us new creatures in him has he not done these things he he's healed us when we're sick amen when we're troubled he gave us peace we were a burden with care and worry he came and took those cares and worries he showed us the way through every situation i know that's very generic terminology but i trust when i say those things you can look back and say lord you've done so much i was once stooping in darkness and you gave me light once i had no peace now all i have is peace for my soul hallelujah so he began to encourage himself when the lord has god if you ever want an answer from god start to encourage yourself in the lord i mean start to encourage hallelujah you may just have one testimony just encourage yourself in that testimony holy lord you called me out here i am i'm called out you called me i didn't call myself you called me hallelujah you found me lord amen and then david said to abethar the priest a himalayas son i pray thee bring me heather the ephod and abbathar brought hither the ephot to david and david inquired of the lord saying shall i pursue after this troop shall i overtake them and he answered him pursue for thou shall surely overtake them and without fail recover all i just want you to think what it would have been like there he's standing in a ruined city so his five senses have have declared to him his family's gone his property's burned up he's lost everything and that's and his men are angry at him but then when god drops that revelation into his heart because he wants to know am i gonna can i get this back lord can i get my family back can i get my joy back can i get my piece back can i get my first love back can i get my long sufferingness back how can i get those things back and god says you shall overtake them and without fail recover all i mean so when god dropped that revelation in his heart hallelujah his five senses still declared he had nothing right his eyes didn't see his family he couldn't hear their voices he couldn't feel them he couldn't see them he couldn't touch them amen but the revelation dropped in his heart they were his amen and when that revelation dropped in his heart that was good as in his possession already oh that's the power of revelation it declares what the five senses cannot declare hallelujah amen so it changed his whole life what a feeling that would have been amen we're going to recover all boys why because god said so it's not because i'm saying so god told us we're going to get him hallelujah i believe it amen so he went and he recovered all you'll recover all david hallelujah remember as i said it wasn't david that promised that his men would recover all right it was god god promised him yeah i mean it wasn't a man that said you got an eternal body waiting for you in the heavens wasn't a man god told you i trust god has told you you've got a theophany waiting holy in the heavens why did you jump to that well it's quite simple this message has come to show us we have an eternal body in the heavens and to me that changes the whole perspective you can burn it you can shoot it you can rob it you can whatever you want to do to this guy it don't matter i've got a body waiting for me in the heavens god has already promised me i've got a i've got a change of clothes i can put on hallelujah amen isn't that wonderful isn't it wonderful that we're not hoping we're going to make it i trust it has anchored into your heart i yeah it's not oh i hope i'm going to take a rapture no no you have to take one you're booked in oh this is what this message has said it's actually said you are going in a rapture this message is the shout of first thessalonians 4. hallelujah amen i'm on my way to heaven shouting victory see our god is a god of stability he wants you to know that you are his child he doesn't want you to guess at it think about it because if you're guessing then you'll put your own own human well lord i do this so therefore i have to be your child no he's got a drop of revelation in your heart and then your life will be according to that revelation you'll live it out amen so it wasn't when peter said on the day of pentecost i probably if i repeat myself well here i am you know when peter stood up on the day of pentecost it wasn't peter preaching was it it was god preaching he just happened to be using peter's vocal cords and so when peter stood up and he promised he said if they would repent and be baptized everyone in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and they shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and all that are far off has been is the lord our god shall call amen it wasn't peter saying that's the way it was god speaking through him saying that's the way hallelujah so it wasn't peter that promised it god promised it we've really got to take stock who's promised these things god promised it and god cannot fail he cannot lie i mean it's impossible for god to give a promise and take back the promise if god's promised a certain thing it's got to happen hallelujah so we can encourage ourselves in the lord today lord if you promised it oh then you'll fulfill it in your season you will fulfill your word amen that we don't need to worry about it lord if you've promised it it's going to come to pass hebrews 6 and 17 wherein god willing more abundantly to show unto the ears of promise the um the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable which is unchangeable things in which it was it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us he can't lie god can't lie so if he promised it he'll fulfill it hallelujah and if god gave the promise he has to fulfill the promise it's not us that has to fulfill it god has to fulfill it amen i put a lot of pressure on god because god's the one who gave the promise lord when are you going to fulfill your promise amen is that all right that's how we should be lord that says in your word certain things i have need of lord you said this is mine lord when will you bring it to pass in my life hallelujah now there's power in testimony there is power and confession we must confess the word of god we must never confess the negative we must confess the positive brother abraham even prayed said lord when he was renewing his consecration to the lord lord i've been too negative i want to be positive i see he says he says in one place i surrender my negative thinking to you we should always think positive we should never ever think negative all negative things come from the devil he's the one who tells you you'll never make it here he's the one that tells you your children aren't coming he's the one who tells you you can't have revival that's negative oh your brother and sister like this that's negative we should always think positive hallelujah amen to this power and testimony amen because when we begin to testify about his word then god can anoint that and it can come to pass amen when we say amen to the word what happens god can actually take it and make it live hallelujah amen because he just wants someone to agree with his word when you really agree with his word he'll bring it to pass in your life amen brother brown would speak about a man called john ryan and this is just one of the counts of it from the super sense old john ryan so well what i should say first is in revelations 12 11 and they overcame him which is the beast and you know all the powers of hell the serpent the dragon and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death so part of that testimony is what god has done but we should be testifying of what the word says about us right amen so old john ryan he says he says there was a blind beggar in fort wayne uh there were we went that day and he was prayed for in the meeting that was the night before the piano played the great physician now is near without anybody by it and when he was blind he was catholic by face uh faith sorry he stopped in the line i looked at him and i said your name is is john ryan yes you're a beggar on the corner you've been blind for years yes that's right you're a catholic by faith that's right i said thus saith the lord you receive your healing say thank you sir i said thank the lord he said but i can't see i said that has nothing to do with it you're healed he went down along they helped him off the platform the natural man could not see nothing they couldn't see no results from that at all why he said he's just as blind as he ever was so two of his friends brought him back and put him in the prayer line again and run him through again howard let him pass through when he come back again he said mister you told me i was healed i said you told me you believed me he said i do believe you i have no reasons not to believe you said you've told me all things in my life he said i don't know what to do this is how people are normally trained what do i have to do to obtain the promise he said there was a woman back there testifying and she had a goiter a few minutes later it's gone away i said then if you believe me why are you questioning me i'm telling you the word of god he said what must i do sir now notice this knowing he was a catholic and had to have something physical that he could hold to i said just keep testifying by his stripes i'm healed and give him praise the old man for the next two weeks or three he stood on the corner and sold papers he would holler extra extra praise the lord i'm healed extra extra praise the lord i'm healed when he come back to the meeting the next night i couldn't hardly preach for him he'd raise up and holy one keep quiet praise the lord for healing me praise the lord for healing me as a as a catholic he didn't know how to take hold of faith but he knew if he just kept on saying it and kept on and kept on and kept on until that sixth sense would go to work that's right praise the lord for healing me he was standing on the corner hollering praise the lord for healing me extra praise lord for healing me and he'd walk down the street and as somebody came by how are you john praise the lord for healing me all right and i laughed at him and made fun of him and another little news boy led him over to the barber shop for a shave for two or uh about two or three weeks later from the meeting and the barber put him up in the chair lathered up his face said john i understand some little smart alec he said i understand you yours down to see the divine healer he said yes i went down he said i understand that you got healed just to make fun of him and the old man said yes praise the lord he healed me and his eyes came open out of that barber chair he went and the towel around his neck the barber trying to catch him with the razor in his hand and down the street he went why god's word had went to work i mean so it took a while for it to go from here down to here but eventually we're from here down to here and that he was healed holy because remember it wasn't brother brown said that you're healed he said thus saith the lord you're healed so as god said you're healed it means if god says a certain thing now we have to respond and receive it even with the same faith that was spoken to our sin amen hallelujah so sometimes you can see way out of grass powers anything going to happen in my life but you just got to confess it like it is and then let god go to work just like john ryan did now i'm not calling you a bunch of catholics but people are conditioned a certain way what do they have to do to obtain the promise amen we just got to anchor it let it anchor down from here down to here because when he was in the barber chair that was just subconsciously yeah i'm healed praise the lord i'm healed and anchored down in his heart hallelujah but why is that because he overcame the blindness by the word of his testimony amen that because he was confessing what the word had already done for him amy because by his stripes we were healed amen hallelujah now god he cares for us he's a real father he really cares how we're going to end up amen it would say in jeremiah 29 11 for i know the thoughts that i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace are not of evil to give you an expected end now these thoughts cannot change like we think about people i could you could think about me a certain way and i do something in your presence or you hear something about me do you think about me differently right but god's thoughts cannot change if he's to if he's thought about you a certain way that's how you're going to be so if he thought about you before the foundation of the world as one of his attributes that be expressed to the earth to be his bride he can't change his mind he can't change his mind remember david decided that jo he he made a covenant with jonathan that we're going to look after each other's family whatever whatever happened so so the thought that david had towards mephibosheth was you're going to sit at my table i can't change my thought about you doesn't matter your crippled places whatever my thought towards you are you sitting at my table to eat at my table continually says the same thing with you and i he cannot change his thoughts towards us hallelujah it's not based on our performance it's based on us receiving his word believing him because we are his seed that's what it's really based on hallelujah i could never become it well he said you will right and then faith comes in and it produces what he says you are amen now abraham he lived a life that patented every believer's walk he's a pattern for our life his walk abraham came to a spot where it was absolutely impossible for him to have isaac this may be very elementary but you know he was 75 years old about when god called him he'd been living with sarah married to her for many many years before this they had already gone past the age of having children and so god it had to be only god that could produce the promise it was literally impossible sarah couldn't have a baby so so they tried to do it with their own human understanding well if you can't have the baby through me just have it through hagar and then it'll be my son that wasn't how god he he never intended it that way it was god it was abraham and sarah were part of the promise so it had to be a supernatural intervention by god for the promise to be fulfilled now if this is the pattern you know if his life is the pattern of every believer's walk then this is how it has to be in our lives right it's not our human ability that will bring the promise to path pass it's god intervening because of the covenant he made with you remember the covenant abraham made with god made with abraham was not conditional he says i've made you father of nations that's who you are he had no children at the time he was you know he couldn't have physical children yeah i mean you know he physically couldn't have children with sarah but god made a promise remember you know i i really hope it anchors in our heart god if you've made a covenant with me you're going to fulfill that you're going to fulfill that promise so god had to give abraham an experience in order to fulfill the promise of isaac coming now genesis 17 the lord reveals himself to abraham that that does become abraham and it says when abraham was 1909 the lord appeared unto abraham and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect and i'll make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly now when he says that i am the almighty god if you take it down into the hebrew it actually says i am el shaddai hallelujah and el shaddai has has a few meanings but one of the meanings is actually means the strength giver the life giver kind of like a you know a mother breast feeds her baby so he's actually saying i am basically the breasted god feed off me i'll give you strength for you to fulfill the promise and this is the way that every believer has to be as we actually nurse off the promise of god that we receive strength in order for it to be fulfilled that's why i say david knew where his source of strength was he encouraged himself from the lord because that el shaddai that revealed himself to abraham was the same god that met david right so he knew where his source of strength was that's why we've got to be real careful you know where do we get our strength from you know it's been proven medically that social media produces depression there shouldn't be a shock it's been years it's been it's been tested and proved and shown that depression is linked to social media use so the more we feed off those things it can make us happy at the time because it actually triggers dopamine in our brain which isn't a chemical that's released because of addiction and we can be enjoying it at the time but it actually produced depression that's why it's so addictive and so popular is because that's how it is it's like taking drugs whatever more there's an addiction side but it produces depression so i'm going to say those things can't be our source of strength if you want to be weak then fill yourself up but my source of strength is the lord and me saying it's linked to depression that's not me trying to say get off but i'm just saying that's been proven medically yeah who's read those studies right so if you use those things just be careful how you use it right but if you find yourself getting depressed and moody where you've been you're you're you've been feeding off the wrong thing too much right they're tools in the hands of people but don't let it use you this world we're here to see we're not here oh yeah i always get things mixed up the wrong way but you know use the world for yourself don't let the world use you if that makes sense right so so don't become just another hamster in the wheel but use it when you need to use it is that okay so we don't want to become a slave to the system i mean we love prisoners of jesus christ and so so abraham was was there and god revealed himself in this way i'm i'll shady i so basically nurse off me and the promise will be fulfilled you know this is the same way we must be amen we're called to nurse off god hallelujah that the promise will be fulfilled brother brahm says now watch here the first thing you know i see when he's 99 god appears to him in a kind of a uh to confirm this thing the 17th chapter of genesis he appeared in the name of el shaddai which el shaddai in hebrew means the breast or the breasted one like the mother where a baby you take a little baby and said now abra um abraham i'm el shaddai the almighty god now you're yet old and your strength all gone sarah's womb is dead she's 90 like little grandma like now a great great grandma 90 years old she's awful old the people's laughing at you making fun of you but i'm the breasted one like a mother to a sickly fret baby now when the little baby's all weak and run down his strength gone the mother pulls it to her bosom and the child nurses his strength from the mother the mother's strength becomes a child's strength as he draws it from her yeah hello so so god's strength becomes our strength as we nurse off the promise and he's your powerful god there's no limit to his power or his ability hallelujah and he said now abraham you're old you're past the age sarah's past the age but i have to bless her through you so you just lean upon my bosom and keep nursing amen hallelujah i'll give you your strength draw it out of me now watch the breasted one not one but two he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes were healed i mean just you turn your head if you need healing amen i'm the breasted god that's what it means in so many words abraham i am the breasted god now if i have to i mean i'll give you eternal life by nursing from here i'm going to do some divine healing in your body if you'll nurse from here amen he's the same el shaddai tonight he changes not and his covenant people has the same privilege to draw from the same resource that father abraham had to draw because god swore by the same covenant that he'd give us the promise holy oh my that's where my hope is built on nothing less but jesus blood and righteousness when all around my soul gives way he's all my hope and stay on christ the solid rock i stand all other grounds is sinking sand there you are el shaddai the bosom the breasted god if you need salvation for your weak soul draw from this side if you need healing from your body draw from this side for my covenant was with christ my son and in there he was wounded for your transgressions and by his stripes you are healed i'm the almighty just lean up on here and go to drawing from them promises hallelujah that's what we need to do draw from his promises amen because we cannot get strength from anything else in this hour but from the promises of the word you've got to realize though the promise is for you not for your neighbor only but it's for you amen amen hallelujah now we won't be too much longer now there's a strength that's coming to the church today hallelujah when when john was anointed to write the uh book of revelation and and and he was uh scribing down the the word to the church of philadelphia he would say in the um he says and and to the church and to the angel of the church in philadelphia right these things sayeth he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of david he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth now this this is what he openeth now we know jesus is the door and so what is speaking of now is is actually because the ages lap over one another as that at the end of the philadelphian agent going into the ladies and age there would be a door open of revelation that will give strength to the church now remember because this is we're going to we're going to draw strength from el shaddai brother evan says now then we can see that jesus is the door he's the door of the sheep and notice that it speaks now of the door opening and what is that but a revelation of him and that revelation is going to is opening up to bring us strength to illuminate the word and to glorify his name it was in the midst of the last two ages that the revelation of the deity of jesus christ blossomed out before us yes we knew he was god how else could he be our savior but to know that he is he was the only god or god alone that he was alpha and the omega and this jesus was both lord and christ making him the lord jesus christ the father the son and the holy ghost all one person that had been lost since the first church ages but now we're seeing it again the revelation of who he was had come back indeed godhead is not a three-person god with one personality for it takes personality to make a person if there is one personality but there is one person but they who believe in three persons have a three god godhead are guilty of breaking the first commandment but the revelation that god hit his back but the revelation that god um is back now the true church can be built in strength again after all this time she finally knows who her lord is once again we are baptizing in the name of the lord jesus christ i mean just as they did at pentecost so he's saying now because this door opened and the revelation of who god is now has come back into the church and the word has come open its fullness now i mean now the church can be built in strength again now all the strength we have need of has been released in this age and even even as the apostle paul i mean i mean i mean sorry john he would he would come to a spot in revelations 10 where he heard the voice of the seven thunders but then he was told to seal them up and write them not but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel those things should be made known hallelujah so there's a part of god's word that had strength in it that would be released in this hour amen and here we are standing in this day where i say that the whole scriptures come open it's no longer symbol it's no longer sealed that we don't know it's no longer man's opinion but god has opened the word to us that we know exactly what's in the scripture for us and what does that do it gives us strength to overcome holy just like moses preaching there caleb and joshua they received that word that gave them strength you take caleb naturally he was 84 years old when he got his inheritance but he said i'm as strong now as i was then amen give me my mountain holly why because he received a strength from the word that caused him to receive the promise for his day hallelujah and here we are in this hour maybe i'll pick this up another time we have a strength in this word you need vitamins you need spiritual strength it is in this word of god it is in the message you need strength to overcome it's in the lord there is a power i believe in this room this morning amy which is our lord jesus christ and if you have need of anything to over you know you need power to overcome it's in that many times all we need is a fire to be lit hallelujah just like i said on wednesday there's a brother being ordained and brother brahm said well um i don't know for some praying for them or someone else but he said lord they prayed lord wrap them up and burlap sacks pour a whole bunch of kerosene on them light them a flame and send them out hallelujah and that's and that's what we really need we need a fire to be lit not an argument to be polished not a retention of knowledge but a fire to be lit and if that fire's lit oh my watch out devil hallelujah amen but he cares for you what's the effect of sitting at his table you begin to rejoice you begin to praise god you begin to thank him for his goodness though your five senses do not declare the promise yet the revelation drops in your heart like david's it's all going to be restored hallelujah it gives you power to overcome remember god made the promise man didn't give you the promise god gave you the promise so we should thank him for giving us the promise shouldn't we the covenant of his word remember jesus died on calvary did everything god was he'd give to you the apostle paul breaks it all down the book of ephesians all the inheritance of the saints in light that's you right that's the purpose he died that god will come and dwell in you and manifest his word through your life hallelujah so we should thank god it wasn't conditional it's unconditional i have just like abraham was told you're father of many nations and abraham believed god has come to him for righteousness and it was manifested so there's something god actually puts faith in us to receive his word i mean so even to be a believer we say thank you lord for making me a believer if you don't have a but but i'll say this if you don't have a faith in your heart you say lord put that faith in my heart reveal yourself to me restore the joy i may have had years ago restore it to me now lord make it a living reality make your word a living reality reality to me lord amen let's um let's just finish that can we have the musicians please this morning amen you need joy you can get it
