a son and he had all these men against him wanting to Stone him his own men that believed in him but see it got to a moment that said you know what something within me is going to praise the Lord no

heads gracious heavenly father it's a Wednesday night Lord I'm so nervous father I'm always nervous when I stand here because Lord I'm talking to your people your your Saints father your bride Lord and and it is you that needs to do the speaking not me father and I pray Lord that you've seen there's been hands raised up this evening lord they're coming with a need and they need you to step forth out of the book lord and become the present God lord the I am and their situation father I don't know everyone's situation but I do also know there is a need in the camp tonight father and you've laid this on my heart father and I pray that you would just speak these words and encourage your Saints may it be for your glory and your honor we welcome you in you say everything we do we do in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we two or three Gather in your name We Gather in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we ask that you'll just welcome in here and Minister unto your people Lord the people that

you Lord and you can go in and S with them Lord and Minister unto them as well pray your blessing over this word and if there's any Spirit that's contrary to your Holy Spirit may that be Cast Away now in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen amen Saints you can have your seats um I was going to preach about the Three Little Pigs tonight and uh the Lord said no so we're going to preach about Psalm 37 Psalm 37 the title of it is trust in the Lord so see no matter what happens and I don't know how this will go brother Ben but I know the Lord's laid it on my heart but the Lord does doesn't want us to look at circumstance you understand faith is the thing he's looking for he said when I shall return home when I come back shall I find faith not just Believers not just righteous people but will I find a form of faith that would touch me so remember if we look at every believer in the in the in the scriptures they they come to God with a certain amount of faith and they believe that God can do it but see there's a need but because when the need came to the believer like the woman at the well or like the woman with the blood issue there was a need in her life there was a condition she was sitting with and she couldn't get rid of it but she knew that she had to get to Jesus but the there had to be a need now you can't be a Overcomer if there's nothing to overcome you can't have a testimony if there's no test so let me tell you we're going to get pred and we're going to get tested do you understand what I mean this is not a flowery bed of ease this is life and death but see God is the lover of your soul he doesn't care about your conditions right now because he has a greater plan for you and everything worketh together for the good but sometimes we so stuck in the trial we're so stuck in that that little scene that's we playing out in that little bit of vision that he's giving us now that carnal realm that we kind of forget what type of God we are serving we forget the mighty powerful God that we are serving and so when I was sitting at home and and shantala and I we had a couple of discussions just briefly today and I really wanted to talk about the Three Little Pigs but this Psalm pressed upon my heart and I quickly put it down and I thought you know what it's a pray meeting I'm just going to deliver some mail so I want you to read with me cuz I don't read always the best so you don't lose me I've put it on nice and bold and everything that I want to clate I've put on there so if you see me miss a line or two forgive me read the psalm if you want to open up in your Bibles as well so David comes to a point where he knows he needs to trust in the Lord he knows there's no other way now so we're not talking circumstance when he wrote The Psalm or anything he knows he needs to trust in the Lord and he starts off with that he says fret not thyselves because of evildoers so of course he had a lot of Mischief in the camp a lot of things going on around him neither be envious against the workers of iniquity so no matter how the people are prospering now you children you can keep in the summon as well because you see some kids at school and they look like they're just rolling money and they're so cool and awesome and powerful and and these type of units in school that you're thinking man this guy is the naughtiest kid in class but everybody likes him those type of things that's evildoers it's workers of iniquity they they they don't believe in God they don't care they so in this world man Even If You Preach to them they'll laugh in your face so don't take this now as just for mommy and daddy make this yours put it in your situation put you in this feet he says for soon they shall be cut down like grass now I don't say we get the attitude as a Christian to go if they don't believe what we do there's no Grace for them you know we we're the heart of Christ we want everyone to be there we really want and we want to minister to them and and say there's a God That Forgives sins and that heals and and that can put your family together because you know why these kids act out because their parents act out against each other you know why they're so miserable in class because their parents are miserable so there's a lot of things going on that you might not see that don't mean they're happy and they've got it all together so David's looking at this and they say and they whiter as the green herb he says but trust in the Lord and do good and thou shalt dwell in the land and verily Thou shalt be fed he says so there is certain rewards for serving God the feeding is always not always natural food have you seen the time Jonathan when you don't read your Bible all of a sudden Things become a bit harder the time when you're not worshiping God or sitting in praying and and you know having communion with God then then things around you gets a bit more harder he Josh and you feeling my diet my strength is gone from me I'm a bit weaker today you know people irritate me faster things annoy me faster because it says trust in the Lord and and do good good so that's that's something for us and David sees this it's a prayer meeting so go on then he turns it he says while you're doing it delight yourself in the Lord you know Jo sitting in his in his room and he's playing guitar and he had a rough day at school and he changes that very scenario and he starts praying and he just starts worshiping the Lord in his room and all of a sudden everything you're going through it just goes away from you because see you you choose to take to dwell in the carnal Mor and you choose to go just that little bit higher brother B preached it so wonderful that Eagle Vision you you just see it a little bit different but it takes a lot to pick up the guitar when you're angry takes a lot to pick up the guitar when you're frustrated at your dad or something you know or your brother or it takes a lot to get yourself out of that situation to get up there but you need to do it you know God is great and he's all powerful but he doesn't want robots he wants people with a testimony with some grit in them that when everything goes wrong to say you know what hold on I'll Delight myself in the Lord I'll turn my focus from this trial and I'll make it a testimony but it has to start with you it's a real battle and this is where the battle starts he says also shall it give you the desires of your heart so see God will not withheld anything from you he knows what's in here pure and not so P spiritual and very carnal I like a for Raptor that would be great I don't think it will add to my faith if God gives me one but it would be nice you know so he's not talking about those desires of the heart the desires of a heart of a Believer is to see him become the present God the desires of a heart of a Believer sister Vanessa is to see your children all come in you know the desires of your heart is different than these things it's not material things they will all burn but it's Eternal things I want to see my friends there you know so when you start turning this the psalm and you start looking at David he wasn't looking at carnal things he was looking at the things that's really in his heart and then he goes on he says commit thy way unto the Lord trusteth in him and he shall bring it to pass so yes I believe Lord now I'm going to walk it I'm going to testify to it I'm going to commit it into your hands now you don't pick it up and touch it again you've committed it because doubt with brother brandham said the moment the sister started doubting or the brother started doubting he said you lost it right there you had your healing but then you lost it right there because doubt came in we don't doubt we made Believers the devil wants you to doubt but your made Believers we just believe how don't know when don't know but it's coming amen so don't you worry about the logistics God knows how to run his business he says and it shall bring forth righteousness as the light have you ever been in a situation where everybody looks at your situation and go oh boy you're going this there's something wrong oh job you're losing everything again and you're thinking about oh how am I going to make this but see God knew Job was a righteous man he knew what was job was going to stand for and so when he put him in that trial he knew the only thing it's going to bring out is his righteousness he will shine like a light even if his friends has told him that he's a secret sinner they know that at the end of that trial he was still a righteous man so God knows how to put you in a trial to bring forth what is what he's put inside of you this is the important part of it rest in the Lord hallelujah but rest is get your hands off that trial rest is when you say God I can't do it I remember when my my dad and my mom you know when they were here and we tried to get all mingled in there and try to you know bring them to the Lord and do everything humanly possible which you do because you you just love the Lord the moment I took my hands off it the moment I rested God came on the scene sometimes he'll take you to that very point and then you'll come on the scene it's not fun sister margi it's not fun but he'll come on the scene you see what I mean I mean he's a personal God every one of your trials is not like my trial and it and it's all right because God has something different to show in your life don't don't think them don't think them anything but God's showing something it's in you you might even not know it's there right now he says and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of who prosper in his way because the man who bringeth Wicked devices to pass cease from anger and forsake wrath how many of us has been in a trial we get angry not always at God but you just get so angry brother Ben he did it once when he was talking to me goes I get so angry but I can understand because our flesh is still it's still flesh and brother Isaac's sermon was so beautiful it's the same same um chemicals coming to your brain it's just how you act to it so we don't get angry he says don't get angry don't don't don't forsake wrath don't get angry don't you get worked up I've got this he says for yet a little while and the wicked shall not be there yay thou shall um diligently consider his place and it shall not be he says but the meek shall inherit oh wait sorry sorry you should have corrected me there yeah for the evildoers shall be cut off and those wait upon the Lord they shall inherit the Earth so hold on guys so I don't get my Ford Ranger I I don't get those nice things here on Earth but wait there's something greater that the Lord has for me that city that is built it's going to come up one day like that pyramid remember when we did the whole pyramid thing man I can just imagine you're standing in front of the city of God and and it is your place it's just your home I don't know how big it's going to be it's going to be massive okay that's my place my dwelling place is not here this is my training ground this is not the place I want to end up guess what I've seen every phone out there boring I've seen most movies boring they all have the same line they all look the same all the actors are the same they all do the same thing you expect the end it's all the same over and over and you can watch Friends the whole series of friends it's still as lame as the whole Beverly Hills 90210 that we watch it's all the same jargon it's nothing new they just they put it in a washing machine and they tumble it a couple of times and it's the same story line he falls in love she falls in love breaks up or does cut back together one dies one lives blah blah life but in the end of the day once you've seen all the movies guess what you get to it's lame it's all the same It's Entertainment so I want to ask you something it was going to be in my other sermon but I want to ask you you guys that love music who loves God gospel songs raise your hand raise that up man come on I want to see gospel songs love it okay now this is a tough one who loves listening to gospel songs the whole day whole day wow okay who loves reading their Bible who loves reading their Bible the whole day I want to I want to just bring something in here cuz I saw Josh looking think at be funny see the word of God is your strength it's the sword I I want to drop this in the word of God is me as a Christian when I used to be a non-Christian I majored on music and music caters to a to a a feeling to a emotion if you play me Brian Adams song right now you will take me back to 1998 if you play me any other song before 98 Say songs of 2000 I can name you a whole list that I listened to from RM to Midnight Oil all the songs that you think they sing and by the way Ed and I spoke to about they still listening to our songs brother that we listened to When We Were Young it's still the same jargon it's still the same thing wrapped up in a new piece of paper and everybody listens to it it's the same but see it's so powerful that it can transfer you Seline Dion sang a song one day okay and every time I listened to this song when I was in the world no matter how many years after it takes me straight back to my first girlfriend that I had why I walk in a shopping center I am saved redeemed Love Gospel songs okay don't get me wrong I don't listen to worldly music anymore praise the Lord tast change but I walk in the mall and Seline Dion singing a song and all of a sudden I go boom right back there how powerful is music now I want to tell you you that gospel music is the same because why does gospel music it's not my notes but we're going to go on with this thing why is gospel music have to have a genre why have you ever thought about it why does there have to be rock and roll and hip hop and rap and all these nonsense in gospel music they want to get you to get to the tune and not the word cuz the tune keeps you busy it's like whistling when you go through a graveyard keeps you busy it ain't say saing your soul it keeps you maybe in the presence of a God but not the real God let me tell you that the songs cannot give you overcoming power it's to worship God it's to get you into a a a a state of worship or praise but it ain't going to save you because the the the word is the thing that unlocks everything in you Revelation comes by the word of God he says the word of God is sharper than any two8 sort cutting getting the marrow and the bone they cut so deeply get everything in it it's the word of God so if you're majoring on music every day what are you actually eating are are we having some nutrients or are you chewing McDonald's because it's a meal it makes you happy but it ain't the word of God how many of you listen more brother brandom tapes than they listen to music how many of you listen to the audio Bible who have you reads the Bible more than then you listen to music so I'm I'm trying to just say something you you be we we get skinny and we struggle but because we major on music and not the word of God don't do it cuz you'll find yourself in a trial you'll find you in a place where where David needed the word of God in his trial he needed to bring forth the promises of God they said I will not leave my Holy One to see corruption when he uttered those words when he said my God my God my bones stare at me when Jesus was crucified and he was prophesying the which realm was he dwelling in a musical realm he was in the word of God and he was lost in in God's presence and and the anointing of God was on him it's a different realm we work in music will not get you there you can't listen so if you so what what if we listen on music the whole time and it's not a grip sorry I listen to music as well don't get me wrong I'm not fighting with you but if the music musos come and they play the whole Sunday and we only sing songs is that church so why are we majoring on it sorry that was side note 104 because remember a make believer can listen to Christian music a unbeliever can also listen to that music but a True Believer wants the word of God for his season he wants to know now he says teaching will establish the bride and tell her where she is in her position things that brother Ben spoke about on Sunday where the the horse riders come forth and Revelation happens and God moving in this time and the ladyo seean church Ag and tell us where we at those things get you to overcome because if you don't know where you're going music will get you somewhere else it ain't going to help you overcome it's not going to give you the the strength and the meat when when the tempter is coming and he's shaking your house and he's trying to break you CU remember he hates you he's your enemy and he's shaking you and he's shaking you and you only listen to music your legs will break you will have no strength no nothing in you because you're feeling wrong still listen to music don't get me wrong but let's get into the the the the substenance of the word you'll find you'll be much stronger you'll be ready to fight you'll roll like Ben when he really starts preaching he rolls these sleeps up I'm going man the devil's going to get a pck you know the moment he does this I'm like oh boy here we go because that's when he's starting to get into the word watch it he gets into that word and he starts preaching life but the meek shall inherit the earth and should Delight thems in abundance of Peace what does God want for you he wants peace the wicked plots against the just and they nashes upon the teeth have you ever seen a bully at school you never ever offended the guy you just walked past him I walked into a shop a golf shop the one day won't mention the name and I was just me we were going to play soccer golf with the with shantell and them and and there's my wife she's witness I walk into the golf shop to to pay the round and the guy looks at me as if he wants to kill me and I went like hey I haven't said a word but he looked angry at me his face his whole countenance changed and it was the most evil look a Shantel she's a witness I walked and she goes what did you say like nothing he goes man that guy's face I said I saw it do you not think there's spiritual warfare and then you that's at school there's more of it have you ever thought about it some random girl just calls you names and you're like what did I do it's what's in you that Spirit don't like what's in you but don't worry as far as I know when Legion and we spoke about in the car before Legion got cast out he looked at Jesus he says Jesus of Nazareth have you come to torment us before our time so you're the devil's Tormentor remember that you don't have to agree with him the wicked plot of against you the Lord shall laugh at him look at what David says he says when everything looks D Straits and all the kids are really naughty and bad with you and pushing you down and all those things he says God laughs at him don't worry he laughs at him he says he seeth the day that is coming cuz I spoke to my dad about this earlier in this week and I said the the heart of Christ don't want anybody to to go to hell I I don't want to see anybody I don't want to feel good when somebody goes to hell I really want to feel good that they all go to heaven isn't that our heart but some people just cannot accept God and it is what it is don't reject them don't push them don't don't just it is what it is don't major on the minors that's between them and God you just be as salty as you can be as long as you can don't change your attitude when you get to school and you're always a nice Christian girl get to school and change that don't do that you hold your Tes trust me because there's someone at school that's looking for Jesus and they'll only find it if you really represent what you believe in do you believe that I believe it I was sitting in a office one day and they were playing I'm just going to go a little bit down and they were doing a Bible quiz and I never said I was a Christian and they said what is the shortest verse in the Bible and that I was sitting here and the table is about from Josh from me and they all stopped with one Accord and they looked at me I never said I was a Christian I just conducted myself like a Son of God never preached at them one word and they asked me so what is the shortest verse we all know it's Jesus we a little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many Wicked if your dad's not the richest and he doesn't drive that Ford Ranger don't worry boys it's fine little that a righteous man ha that's much in God's side okay you barely make it to church boys you made it to church you don't have the most fanciest suits don't worry you may head it to church you're already in a far greater better place than you were when we were in the world with all the luxuries don't worry about money it's not what we're here for for the arms of the wicked shall be broken and the Lord uphold of the righteous the Lord know all the days of the upright and The Inheritance shall be forever see he's not talking about Earthly stuff here he knows where he's going David he says they shall not be asane for the evil time and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied when people don't even know the word of God this ladyo seean church at you tell them about God days of maros are gone I haven't seen you raise the dead raise the dead brother Ben I'll come to your church when you raise the dead they want to see the great Miracles but they can't have faith to believe for themselves God don't don't cat for those people he doesn't do it that way you cannot tempt the Lord he says but the wicked Shall Perish and the enemies of the Lord shall be as fat lambs and they shall consume like smoke and consume them away the wicked borrow and payeth not again but the righteous Seth mercy and giveth how many has given all that you had knowing that you don't have anymore brother Ben sometimes you give where you know you can't give and you're like oh Lord I don't know how am I going to make this month but I'll give anyways what does God do he gives it back and he restores it to you don't you worry how he makes his MTH he's a really really good how do you call it mathematical that mathematician because I don't want to go mathematician mathematician for a such is blessed and shall inherit the earth and they that shall be cursed shall be cut off now here's my here's my thought so it says here the Delights of God in a man he says the steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord and He Delight of in his way so if you do get anything from the service I want you to realize we in a pre meeting God knows your footsteps are ordered he's walked them with you before you're just trapped in time he's in eternity he he knows what you're going to do at this very situation he knows what you're going to do he knows that even if you most the most hurt inside of you where where you you're so vexed and so tormented by by your mind he knows who you're going to stand for he knows where you're going to put your trust don't you think he didn't do it for a reason do you think that when something comes your way God don't know you're going to stand for me when all the chips are down and you got the zig lagac moment you look at men that used to love you and they want to throw rocks at you cuz they hate you cuz they lost everything don't you think David was also in this situation and can testify that he knows that God got him through it he got everything back everything was restored he says though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand I was so lost in the world he is my testimony I was so lost in this world but I was always in his hand I was standing on a water tower the one day we were busy loading a tower on top of a platform 6 M up in the air and underneath us was all the cuts of the pipe so we dig a hole put the big pipe in a pipe like this and you need just cut the pipes and all the Rings and stuff and it's all just lying on the ground big pieces of it and as we we had a pulley on the top and then what happened is the the water big 10,000 L drum is here at the bottom and we're all standing 6 M up on the platform now remember as last as could be I didn't even know God then I wasn't looking for him but he had me in his hand cuz he had a purpose for me and devil wants to to enough your purpose out before God can show you it don't you worry God's got you in his hand don't worry he's got you in his hand so no matter where you find yourself now right now believer unbeliever total misbeliever whatever don't worry God's got you in his hand because he's got your heart and your best interest is is is his everything so I'm standing there and this thing comes up and and as the platforms like this this water tank and the pulley is here comes up and it hits the corner of the whole structure and it starts pulling the the corn the structure over and the guy in the youth is driving and we shouting but he's not hearing and I and I make a judgment call and I'm standing right on the corner there's no space for me and I I grab the tank and I see the water where the water pipe is going to connect and I grab that fitting and I push it and as I push it because the tension's on the Rope it shoots and it pushes me backwards and there was a man standing right next to me and as it pushes me it pushes me off my balance and I'm going over but I didn't go over I'm beyond the point of falling the guy next to me went oh cuz I'm going and here I stand Z straight back and and he looks at me he goes oh buy why why you you you fell I say you fell see yeah I didn't fall I'm standing but what kept me cuz if I fell down there all those pipes and stuff would have cut me to Pieces it was real Satan wanted to have my life that day but he couldn't because God had me in his hand he says because he had a reason for me he says I've been a young man and now I'm old now I've never seen the righteous for forsaken or seeking bread so God knows that he's going to use my life to testify you young people that no matter how dark a situation is don't you worry God will not forsake his righteous never I've never since I've been in this message never once has God failed me four months four months months I've got witnesses here of not one single sin coming into my bank account where where all our work just stopped and dried out not a single sin and you sit there as a as a dad looking at your children you're sitting there as a father for your for your wife as a husband you know and a father and you're thinking man how did I get this wrong but you know what you do in those times you open this word up say Lord you put me in this place you got the answers you've put me in this place and it's a hard place and it's a place with you could see it's affecting me it's affecting my parents in South Africa it's affects everyone why have you brought me here Lord you know how many times have brother Isaac stood here in front and said man the devil just hates me he just wants to kill me that that just just makes it every time but you know what's the nice thing about brother Isaac he's tenacious he's like L Jack Russell he go bring it on and I look at that man I go man if it works for Isaac it works for me and guess what that testimony was at a time where I needed it to work for me I will not see the righteous forsaken God don't run his business like that there's nothing new and there's nothing that surprises our God he's powerful he's Almighty Hallelujah I'll finish with this because it's just a pre meeting he says but the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord and he gives him strength in the time of trouble and the Lord shall help them and deliver them and he shall deliver them from the wicked and he shall save them because they trust in him who made this promise who told you your children are coming who said that you are healed who said the situation you're right in now is hopeless who says I will help you who says don't worry about it then don't worry about it you know what
