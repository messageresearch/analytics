standing this turning the Bible to good brothers I'll push the button there we go amen tonight we're going to speak on tuned to Psalm 91 Thank You musicians dwelling in God's atmosphere where perfect faith is as the subject for tonight dwelling and God's atmosphere where perfect faith is hallelujah my this is such an exciting thought for me and you know I'm so dependent on the Lord to bring it out because it's not an intellectually a thought it's very difficult for to convey such an awesome thought and so we're just depending on the Lord tonight amen some ninety one verse one he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty let me read that again he or she that dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty oh my lord bless the reading of your word Jesus name you may be seated you think about the shadow of Peter a man that was redeemed by the blood and the virtue that was placed in that shadow amen what happened when the shadow of Peter touched people something touched in their faith and they was healed and all manner of sicknesses and diseases left the people because the shadow of a redeemed man crossed it how much more I ask you this question how much more the shadow of the Most High the shadow of God to dwell in the secret place of the Most High shall abide to unite to marry to come into a place of constancy under the shadow of your money to be there to stay there to remain there to abide there amen under that shadow of the Almighty something takes place and we see with Peter how somebody would just be touched by the shadow of Peter could have such an effect on their lives how much more and we're going to see how much more the effect of remaining under the shadow of the Almighty staying under his wing staying close to him remaining in an atmosphere remaining in that secret place now you know the traditional sort of a secret place is your closet and hey if you want to have a closet and you make it a little prayer box that's awesome praise the Lord and that's and God might call you to do that and want you to do that that's absolutely wonderful there is nothing wrong brother branham said you can never pray too much so don't ever feel discouraged and don't take me wrong but you see the secret place is not just a geographical point in your room or somewhere in your house or somewhere in the bush some prayer cave that you may have but your secret place is actually it's your supernatural holiest of Holies relationship with God and now that's your entering in to the holiest of Holies with God into that Shekinah glory presence now I would like to and I'm sure you've heard it before but I just you know it's been said on Sunday you know you can bring to remembrance these things because it's expedience to hear these things again and so you see that secret place you we don't actually need to be on our knees in an awesome time of God to be in the secret place as much as that is so good and sometimes it takes that to get there and because we in 4 find ourselves under some trial or in some frustration that brings us into a carnal Staton and it that can be that can there can be a prolonged period of time and for some people you're probably in that state right now and for some people unfortunately have always been in that state and they may have walked in this message for many years and they've never entered into the holiest of Holies unfortunately their success what the case is for some people and then there's also people that have been into the holiest of Holies and have experiences with God and they are sealed and they've been baptized with the Holy Ghost and and they're walking and then for years they've left their first love and they've walked out of that place because of circumstances and things that's happened in their lives and ideologies that they may have followed or pollutions that they've allowed into their life that's taken them from that place that place of pure satisfaction that place where nothing can move you that place where perfect faith is Hebrews 10 16 to 20 this is still part of the opening scriptures so it says here verse is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more now where remission of these as there is no more offering for sin having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a new and living way which he has consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and so you see it's not the Old Testament anymore where the high priests could go in once a year and by the blood of bulls and goats and sprinkle seven times and do all the ritual approach to God through the sacrificial system that was pointing to what we have but a beautiful time I love this actually I just love it so much and may I just share this with you a beautiful example as when you know on the day of resurrection when Jesus raised from the dead and the disciples they were so sad and merry and the other mirror I think it was went down into the term and they and they went down there and I'm probably not going to get this whole story and all in order or anything but they basically now they went down into this place and they went into the tomb and they looked around and they didn't see and see anything and then what they saw on the bed was a packet of like where his clothes was like some sort of clothing there and then there was an angel on the head of the bed and it and it shows that was showing something there there was this showing here is what it was there was two angels on the end and there was meant to be the Shekinah in the middle but you see now it had changed from being a symbol and an arc of a covenant and and angels on two ends protecting or guarding the way to the Ark of the Covenant or however people see that and something said turn around Mary I think it was the angel turn around and she saw him she saw the new and living way she saw the Lord Himself she came into connection with the new and living way she came into a personal contact with him amen and so I love that to show from the old to the new and so now Saints we have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus so you see that blood is powerful enough for you MERS if you have made mistakes today if you have made big mistakes in your life and you feel condemned by those things you don't have to remain in the state you don't have to remain out of the holiest of Holies you can have boldness by the blood now not boldness without the blood you need to recognize that it is the blood it is the atonement it is that that blood was spilled and your faith in the blood
