you are [Music] amen hallelujah I mean thank you musicians I mean good evening everyone I mean praise the Lord everyone's had a good first part of the week I mean if you got your Bibles handy let's go to 2nd Peter chapter 3 like - I was meaning to get to this about a month ago finally we're here I mean I'd like to we're gonna read from first Peter 3 from verse 1 down to down to verse 16 they were to go to Zechariah chapter 4 this is the second epistle beloved I now write unto you on both which I stir up your pure Minds by way of remembrance there you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts and saying where is the promise of us coming for since the father's fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation for this they willingly ignorant of that by the Word of God the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years in a thousand years as one day the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us-ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also in the works that are therein shall be burned up seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation in godliness looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God we are in the heaven shall be on fire oh we're in the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth ruined dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him and peace without spot and blameless and account that the long-suffering of our Lord of salvation even as our beloved brother Paul also according to his wisdom giveth unto him hath written unto you and also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction amen and let's go to the book of Zechariah chapter 4 Sakurai for and verse 6 down to and we're gonna read down to verse 10 so CSU Zechariah 4 and verse 6 CC then he answered and spake unto me again saying this is the word of the lord unto jerusalem it-- nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art thou a great mountain before the before zerubabbel thou shall become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of Hosts has sent me unto you for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hands of Zerubbabel with those 7 they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth I mean let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer oh sweet Jesus take my life father take all its failings all that's right Lord take all of us Lord Jesus father may we just be vessels in your hand father of honor Lord that you can be glorified father we just want to commit this evening into your hands Lord I pray that you'll guide us in your word father may you take your word Lord and anoint it to every heart father we we are not here just to go through a motion of a service but will come to meet with you father Lord that you would speak to our hearts Lord you'd change us from glory to glory so father we just want to commit the service into your hands Lord be at those who couldn't be here tonight father fray you'd be their portion Lord and father help us to be attentive Lord and father may you just ooh Lord we want to touch the hem of your garment tonight so father may you grab the field glory we thank you in Jesus Christ's name Amen I mean God bless you all you may have your seats this evening so I want to take a thought from where we're we're they asked at second Peter 3 & 4 season saying where is the promise of us coming now the coming of the Lord involves a union between God and man and we are living in a time as we read in Zechariah 4 where where Zach Araya is preaching we know he's he's a prophet to the to Israel as they're restoring the temple they're restoring Jerusalem and we know we know that zerubabbel was a was a prince among the people but it was also a prophetic word speaking of of zerubu being a type of Christ where Christ would build his church through seven Church ages and so he would take us as as Peter would say we are living stones we're lively stones built into the house of God where God would take us molds and shape us by his word and in places into the body and we are thankful that because I believe we are living where the last stones are being added to the building you know there's there's been seven ages this you know I've been every age you know God has sent a message to the aged and the people that have received that word was sealed into the kingdom under the messenger and then finally went down to this last age where the last few stones are being added and and it's really the greatest time to be alive where God and man are becoming one and this is the biggest sign thus biggest side to the earth in this present time as as God and his bride being United that is the sign to the earth wind because the because we are living in a harvest season where the grain is gathered to the garner amen we know the tears have been bound and they're they are being bound by a false anti Antichrist spirit but we know also that the wheat the the grain that God is looking for has been gathered into the gunner which is Christ and so the biggest sign you know we you know we look at you know we you know we look at Israel we know that's God's time peace brother Brown was told in a vision to Washington Russia watch the king of the north and you know we can watch Russia we can watch what America is doing we can watch you know what the Vatican is doing and what Israel is doing but all of that has its place but God is waiting for the last name on the book I mean to be dipped in blood brother Brown shares amen and then the planners wound up among the Gentiles so that's what God is his focus is upon you I mean God is very mindful of you as focuses upon you you are his timepiece at this time right because once once the pride has taken up into glory then he turns his attention fully to the Jews we know they're gathering there now you know the 144,000 probably are all there already they're there they're there waiting you know their felt felt a pull and they're reaping our return to their homeland and they're there but you know we have to get out of the way before he can go and and reveal himself to them amen so now the promise of us coming you know God is not slack but God is working in the lives of men and woman boys and girls around the earth amen that he would find those last ones that we can go home hallelujah so now God said that he will zerubabbel will lay the foundation of this of the of this house but also bring forth the headstone now the headstone we know as Christ right it's not a piece of masonry the headstone as a person right and then we see when this headstone comes to the body that the body cries out grace grace unto it because it's manifold its manifold grace in this age right there's greater grace than there's ever been in the in the history of the world because God because when the enemy comes in like a flood God raises up a standard so it raises up as grace he raises up as power and the people that they can overcome the works of the enemy hallelujah and that's why it's yo God's grace became amazing course because it's matter it's manifold greater grace than ever been that's right I mean cuz God's moved upon our hearts that that we love him more than anything else this world and all its shiny things the devil you know waves those shiny things in front of the bride's eyes but the bride her heart's upon her Lord the heart is upon the one hater who had is upon her Redeemer you know we're not too worried about this world hey you can have it all you can have it all you can play with that yes like a kitten some toys you can play with that one I've got heaven I've got our Lord oh I'll stay with him but scoffers will say well we are you know we we were promised coffers in these last days and they're here right so the promise of us coming now as men of in God and man becoming one now brother branham speaks well he he preaches a sermon which we call the statue of the perfect man but he doesn't call it the statue of the perfect man he says this morning we want to speak on the subject or teach rather if we can building the living Tabernacle building the living tabernacle of the Living God's dwelling place the perfect man that's what he calls it I like that title and she talks about building the living tabernacle of living God's dwelling place hallelujah you happen to be that dwelling place I mean so God has God has sent his word upon the earth to molds and shape us and to into his very image now we're going to do a quick study and to because in the scripture there's a statue of the perfect man there's also the statue of the anti perfect man so we're gonna read both these let's go to 2nd Peter 1 now this is all familiar to most of us then we're going to go into and now that another part of the scripture but so second Peter in verse 1 Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that are obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God Anabelle and end of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us called us to glory and virtue amen whereby a given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust I mean so so he's addressing this to you this is this is to you okay and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and you temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity charity is divine love for if these things be in you and abound you they make you they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling election sure for if you do these things you shall never fail Amen now God puts these virtues in his bride it takes the manifestation of the word to bring these virtues into his bride right this is not this is not you yourself physically adding these things right God gives faith God faith is revelation right it's revealed God sovereignly reveals himself to you that gives you faith where it goes beyond a human faith - I believe it can be done - a revealed faith that you know it can be done right David David's there I mean we'll run let's let's go back a step Israel's on one side the valley Philistines are on the other side Goliath comes out Max's boast brother Brahim sees and fakes faith as works expressed he says the Israelite army knew it could be done right they knew that Goliath could be defeated in their mind they knew it could be done but David knew it could be done in his heart it was revealed to him that he would kill the giant right sores so the Israelite army it was human faith they knew it could be done but to David it was revealed that's why he went down there and he defeated his enemy because he knew it could be done so there's the kind of faith I'm talking about what God reveals himself to you makes himself real to you right and then so all these virtues are built into you by the manifestation of his word case this is God building you into this image where once we were not made in this image but he builds us up right and the capstone is charity divine love which is Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost world's puts all these virtues into you amen now I don't want to dwell too much on that but that's the statue of the perfect man I mean we have faith right and then we have virtue with your strength Jesus when the woman touched his garments and I perceive virtue has come out of me right and knowledge knowledge of his word that's why we need Holy Ghost knowledge of the scripture when the enemy comes against you then God brings his word forth into your mind they even combat him right and temperance temperance temperance is if the enemy comes against you don't fly off the handle yeah amen you can stand there in a godly way Luo Yin patience I mean faith worketh patience right now I mean patience knowing God will fulfill his word in a season amen and patience godliness to be like God right and in brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity we're living in a day where all these virtues are in the people and I'll say we're not looking for it to come it's already here there's so much you know we're we're so much right at the end you know our next destination is a rapture you know we are living in a resurrection season we're know looking afar off when shall these things be Lord we're actually pretty much look in the rearview mirror it's already happened so now we are actually coming under this message of the hour god quicken air to your soul he puts these virtues in your life I mean like Moses before he met the Lord on on your you're at the burning bush rather he was he was in fearest he was raised in Pharaoh's house he was the Pharaoh was God in Egypt what kind of way do you think he carried himself around how are you today you know he wasn't like that he was Pharaoh he was the next Pharaoh it was a god it's more than the people you know and and the and the royalty led the army into battle so what do you how do you think he would have been before he led his people into battle he would have been to make a little fellow he's I know we're gonna go slaughter these people he would have jumped on the chariot follow me boys I'll show you how it's done but after he met the Lord in the burning bush he wrote about himself it was God writing about him he became the meekest man in all the because that word that law became a revelation to them and then it produced the character of Christ in his life right the scribes and Pharisees they didn't it was a revelation the law wasn't a revelation him they learnt it and they became proud and arrogant people I mean so when the word becomes a revelation it produces a character hallelujah I'm glad God's quickening us word to us producing his character in our lives amen of course you got to give yourself to him that he molds and shakes you sure but when the word when it when it becomes a revelation of producers character Alleluia so now the capstone that we have received is charity divine love the bride has already received her capstone hallelujah amen so now that is the statue in a very small nutshell of a perfect man now we're going to look at the statue of the eye called the anti perfect man let's go to proverbs 6 proverbs 6 and 16 I'm gonna read down to verse 19 sees here these six things that the Lord hates yes seven are an abomination unto Him a proud look a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood a heart that devises wicked imaginations feet that be swift and running to mischief a false witness that speaketh lies and he that soweth discord among brethren so brotherly kindness discord among brethren is the two opposite but now we need to see what's the capstone of this anti perfect man let's go to proverbs 26 i'll go from verse 24 it says he that hateth dissemble earth with his lips and lathe up deceit within him when he speaketh fear believe him not there are seven abominations in his heart we just read about seven abominations in his heart whose hatred this is the capstone is covered by deceit his wickedness shall be showed before the whole congregation amen that's the capstone of the anti perfect man so one's got divine love one has hatred they meant one has hatred covered by deceit that's the two these two are upon the earth right now amen the Easter upon the earth now what has this got to do with the promise of us coming and God becoming one with the people well we're in a harvest season now a harvest season is very important in the scripture and we happen to be the harvest right gods are looking for barley natural barley natural wheat he's looking for people he's looking for his children he's going together as children to himself now when God when God has a harvest he has a way that the harvest is is is harvested and the first part of the harvest is cut down and waived by the priest before the Lord where as a wave sheaf which is the first fruit to the harvest which the priest waves there's in Leviticus 23:10 to 12 and it's waved before it's it's waved on the day after the Sabbath by the priest and Azrael thanking thanking God saying thank you the rest of the field will become like this one I mean because if you look at a wheat field like any plant different plants grow at different rates right so it takes a while but eventually the whole field becomes golden the whole field at first there's some part golden some are still green some are still growing depending on what part of the field they're in but eventually they all become to the same maturity and then the harvest comes but before the harvest comes the first fruit of the field is cut down and it's waived by the priest before the Lord saying thank you Lord that the rest of the of the ones in the field will be exactly manifested like this one now God is looking for a people who are exactly like him yes right when a when you know like Mary's like right humans marry humans men marry woman right we don't marry at a different species right we marry like that's the law of marriage you know and so now if God is if God is if God is going to marry someone he's going to marry the feminist part of himself right he's not going to marry anything else he's gonna marry mrs. Jesus Christ that's that's how he's marrying that's who he's United with already and if he's going to harvest now Jesus spake of himself he said unless a corner of wheat falls to the ground at a buys you know abides alone but if it does a force to the ground then it brings forth much fruit so he was the first fruit to the resurrection right he was the firstfruits of the resurrection and so what happened was he was cut down and then he was waived the life was waived over the people that the people that have been listening to the spoken word for three and a half years of his ministry his disciples were gathered to him and they were listening to spoken-word right and it begin to impact their life and grip them Peter said to whom shall we go thou alone has the words of eternal life they were gripped by a spoken word spoken by the Messiah right and then so they were gathered and then so what they were observing was eternal life on display God was in flesh and God gathered them his disciples because he wanted to open a world to them an unseen world he wanted them to see there is a real heaven there are angels there's also devils and there's hell he want to open the whole world this is what sickness really is this is what the enemy does in the religious realm and the physical realm sickness you know your sickness is the physical robbed you want to show what all these things are and they want to show now I have dominion over the devil I've dominion over the religious realm I have dominion over the flesh I've dominion over the grave I'm gonna show you that I have two men you know of everything he's wanting him to see this because he does not want to God does not want to just be next to us he wants to live that same life through us right that's where he gathered the disciples because he was gonna go in them and live the same life hallelujah so now he was cut down that life was waved over people of their Pentecost hallelujah and God used that as a memorial when the Old Testament was a memorial because Israel was thanking God that is rest in the field who'll come exactly forth like the first one right now you are planted in the field the field is the world Jesus said in the parable so God when Jesus was cut down and he was waved over the people God was saying there's more in the field like this one and they will come forth exactly in the same way with the same life I'm in the same size the same wonders the same manifestation of the word will now be in a mere multi-member body Alleluia Jesus Jesus gathered them now I thank God we don't just talk about I thank God this message is not theory I thank God that it's not an idea I thank God that Jesus is not just an idea he's a living being I thank God he's not just a God of history I thank God he's not just a God of the future I thank God you know how brother brems rallying cry was Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and the reason he dramatized the scripture so much as you want to make it alive not just he's so much of an envision they want you to he wanted it to become alive a present day this is where you are you know hallelujah and so I thank God that Jesus the Spirit of Truth and he took me on Sunday he's a person and he's present Alleluia and he's present cause he knows that you're in the field he wanted you to come for Amen like Jesus did like he did I'm in Genesis 1 and 1 darkness you know darkness covered the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon Oh Genesis 1 and 2 amen darkness covered the world then the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters here the purpose of doing it because they were seen under that waters their seed in the earth already but he had to separate light and darkness the spoke at y'all God Himself brooded over the earth because he wanted to bring forth seats hallelujah that were there and that's why he brooded over you Amen he brooded over he did you I mean we're not here haphazardly God's wanting you to recognize there's a life that I want to manifest in you holy it's more than your natural life it's supernatural life Amen she brooded over you ship red light from darkness that a life would come forth Amen Alleluia the brother Bram says that you're the first day the first light to ever strike the world was was God's supernatural light and he said that was a very incredible Sun rising but it was nothing compared to the resurrection the Sunday morning when Jesus rose it was not just the issue and issue in rising as the eson the Son of God rising hallelujah that he would come forth to bring forth more seats you think about when when when someone plants a a garden or whatever there you go there comes a time and week we are hopefully going to go into spring right we're here this time so now our part of the earth comes a bit closer to the Sun the soil temperature rises the conditions rise that life can come forth in a greater way springtime amen the Sun comes closer well apart the earth comes closer to the Sun the soil temperature rises spring rains come it gets warmer that life will come forth hallelujah that's nothing compared to the east are we in rising that's why there's an atmosphere in this place lujah this is not a freezer this is not a chiller this is a place this is a greenhouse only that life can come for is all about atmosphere life can come forth early that's why the sun's rising I'll say the Sun is here no he says it's not the issue in anymore CSO nday the Sunday at a corner of week God's first one up from the dead is to be waved over the congregation that we are his seed and that's the first of the seed of those that slipped waved upon the first day of the week on Sunday he raised up waved goodbye and ascended on high in the presence of the people notice it was the first corner of God's wheat that had been raised from the dead God's first corn of wheat by God's quickening power God had quickened his life raised him up from the dead and he was the first fruits of those that slept the first fruit he was that sheath and that's why they had to waive that sheath was it was the first one that come to maturity and it was waived as a memorial of Thanksgiving to God believing that the rest of them would come it was a sign it was a sign and today because he was the first son of God to come to full maturity to be in God he was plucked up from the earth and waved over the people he says what a glorious lesson by the quickening power the first one although he had been tight too many times as we'll see later that he was typed but this was really the first fruit of them that slept he was then waved over the promised seed that had that had promise of life he was waved in the day of Pentecost when there came for the south from heaven like a way like a waving mighty rushing wind and was waved over the people the Pentecostal people that was up at Pentecost waiting for the blessing to come and to be waved again we realized in the last day according to Luke 1730 in the Esso in day again and the day that the eson of man will be revealed or waved again over the people now who was the Son of Man in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God in the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and if the teaching I mean sorry I know for all the teaching that we have and the confirmation of the Word of God by the Word of God by signs by wonders we see today that in the Book of Luke here that we just quoted from Luke the seventeenth chapter thirty at first and Malachi for the different scriptures that we are acquainted with that that word again is waved over the people that the dead traditions of manners did and the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Ghost right among us and giving us life he's saying this is waved over the people this ministry he said this ministry is being waved over the people God again like on the day of Pentecost is being waved over the people amen hey so so what's happening is there's a display of life of eternal life Alleluia and now a lot of people saw the display of eternal life it didn't mean a lot to them just like I say if you if you plant seed and then it comes through the spring time say you've planted wheat in the field now that sunrise you want it to quicken the wheat it doesn't quicken it doesn't bring to life the dirt or the rocks or or whatever more it may bring forth some weeds but those get plugged out eventually right but you know it's not the Sun isn't there to bring the rocks to life there's no life in the rock there's no life in the dirt itself it's the seats that are laying there under that dirt they come to life hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and I phrased this this word our Lord Jesus he is the word when I say this word I mean our Lord Jesus right he's been waived he's come out of history I'm not just talking about 1965 this message still lives he is still alive he's been waived hallelujah and a lot of people looked at see that's fanaticism that's false that's whatever but something in the believer says that's for me holy sang-soo's I'm going to come forth of that image hallelujah and God's making a promise they're gonna come forth like this one probably I'll just wave this for a while Lena come forth like this one following this seeds in the field thinking to manifest this the life that's in the word is going to be manifested in them because they're the same seed as as this is hallelujah brother brahim sees that was from the rising of the Sun you should go listen to her if you want to hear a message he doesn't say is it the rising of the Sun question mark he says it is the rising of the Sun the Sun has risen and we can say that because we've beneficiaries of that Sun raising I mean we've felt the impact of the Sun race hallelujah have you been quick Andy be made alive has it changed you what's happening cuz the sun's risen and it's shining it all depends where you are if you're somewhere else where it's dark you'd say it's not shining here he say just move location Olu you'll feel some sun rays now Jesus manifested eternal life and so the bride will manifest the same word life as he did romance says now and as we being the groom and he saw as he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoken of the bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride the same life that was in him is in her because they are one I mean because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life was life power was power she is him as a man a woman a one and the woman taken from her side she has taken a spirit the feminist spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and dynamics the wife the spirit of him in the flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and dynamics hallelujah now what do you mean by mechanics and dynamics it's just not mechanics of a framework we're going to talk about like two Cadillacs that come off the assembly line they can be perfect but if one doesn't have the spark plug it's not moving the only way you can prove that that car works is if you turn on the ignition and that's the only way you can prove the gasoline and the tank is gasoline right you can say oh it's the best octane look we have all the scientific reports and whatever more well then you say prove it there's only one way the key in the ignition and if the and if the ignition doesn't go there's something wrong you can't prove it's gasoline right but I thank God his word is gasoline right his word this message his word is gasoline right but you got to have the spark of the Holy Ghost in you I need to make you go down the road I mean to prove that is gasoline hallelujah but I thank God now that we just don't have mechanics we have the dynamics even the dynamics of the word the Holy Ghost coming into the word my kid live that's what we have that's the proof of the pudding that it's a Cadillac hallelujah that's the purpose of putting this thing back she goes as I said before I thank God is not just theory right it's a living reality he is a living reality in his bride I mean when we talk about Jesus we're not talking about someone that we don't know right we don't talk about someone that's just an idea amen we talk about someone with me he's changed our life story book Hey Alleluia we have the mechanics the bride will have both mechanics and dynamics amen because she is flesh flesh life is life power of his power she is him so everything he did she will do right the life he lives she will live hallelujah amen now the mechanics now he says until that church becomes both dynamics and mechanics and the Spirit of God that moved him to do the things he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the brave Amen for he said in John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also I'll give him a charge of my dynamics and his mechanics that the world will not be able to withstand it and I'll raise them up again at the last day that's the Easter message the dynamics and the mechanics together the mechanics without the dynamics is no good neither is the dynamics without the mechanics you can scream and shout and jump up and down all you want to and deny this word it won't do any good you're just cranking around Pistons you've got a spark there to fire but no gasoline to fire it by it'll only work as they come together amen so no one will will sit still and the other one will go up there's the only thing there is yet yet we they both might look alike they both claim to be churches both paying to be a bride but one has mechanics and dynamics it'll it brings the past of what he said is the truth hallelujah hallelujah I trust if something and you saying that sounds like me Amen I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad I can say I've got the mechanics and dynamics home that's not big you know if I was King uh you know if I was the prisoner United States I'd say I'm the president you know and you'd say and no one say you're being proud of just be I wouldn't be I've got elected here I am I find myself in this office a man the public has put me in now if God has elected me before the foundation of the world to be his bride if he said cheese he is gonna be part of her amen well I'll just say this is who I am this is who I am I can't help but he's made me this hallelujah and if you really have a bride you want to be proud about it you just be all how did I get into this place well Leah by His grace grace grace was chatting Polly see the headstone come down upon your life you cry grace grace hallelujah God's grace amen now it won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until the dynamics come when the dynamics come that fire is made to connect with that octane and the gasoline and when that explodes it causes the combustion and that combustion moves every motion every move for here's the same yesterday today and forever that's the resurrection that's the real power of God mechanics with dynamics I mean notice it's a spirit that quickeneth it's the spark that fires it's not the gas it fires it's the spark that fires the gas see I mean you can do nothing without me but with me you can do all things as he is the word it's the father living father sent me so send are you as the father has fired me and pushed me into everything I do only that which is pleasing to God now as he sent me so send I you with the same mechanics and it takes the same dynamics to operate it and these signs shall follow them that claim to have the mechanics by the the dynamics will take its place for Paul said the gospel came to us not inward only through gasoline-only but through spark also it'll make it move there you are it came to us in that manner hallelujah now there has been a uniting going on amen we as I said we're not looking for it to come it's already happened the Bride of Christ has become one holy or where he has come and he comes and dwells in you where you become the living tabernacle of living God's dwelling place hallelujah that's a good description of uh of the bride amen you are the living Tabernacle living God's dwelling place now he says in Christ a mystery God revealed he says that we have the devil's answer we have the devil's eyes of the devil asks a lot of questions is this really real does it really work who says this is true I said we have the answer it says we have the devil's answer Christ is risen among us the bride has the devil's answer me holy and we can say we had the life of God I mean that is the devil's answer I mean we're and that actually makes some shut up holy because we have a living God on display amen now he sees here in Christ his mystery god now now I see mister brother Chris brother I'll share it with you and his church stands alone she has not hooked with nothing but he was identified by God being the body that God dwelt in and the church was identified by his body doing the same thing she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for these last days I'm talking about you and she and she alone stands by it now he says that's why the devil's howling these great organizations to set up something to close her up they'll never do it she'll be taken up not closed up I mean she is now risen and by the power of the vindicated word promise to her amen how a bride holds that promise he told me he would return after me I believe in our yes sir to meet her headship her Redeemer her husband her king who lured her love of her Savior and the provided meeting place which is the meeting in the air I mean so the devil won't close her up she'll be taken up hallelujah that's why I say let's just keep pounding this through they keep living a life for God the devil can't close us up you think you think the Apostle Paul was closed up hallelujah he was beaten he was shipwrecked here's whatever he ended up in prison amen they didn't close him up hallelujah he went preaching all the same it's like they you know you know you're the Apostle John God needed him on the Isle of Patmos to receive through a revelation you know sometimes the devil thinks well I've got them in a corner and God saying I need them in that corner hallelujah because I'm going to show myself to them you know the devil has your the devil is just a tool in the hands of God to get you where you need to be that's all he is is a tool he said weighs on my case hallelujah God's working I didn't call the devil God now you understand what I mean right but the devil is just a tool in the hands of God we do not need to fear Him all things work together for good for those that love him and are called according to his purpose amen and we know we were called according to his purpose because a wave sheaf has been waived he has been waived and something that you see as oh I can identify with that one I can identify with this message I identify with this Living Word so the menu says that's me Harley just like the eagle and the chicken coop you know the chickens there's something because chickens are prey they get scared when a predator comes around but an eagle is not a prey item it's a predator sees the chicken and the barnyard doing this trying to be a chicken you know a believer is a very poor unbeliever you know you know an unbeliever can pretend to be a believer it doesn't really work but you can take it the other way around you know we never really fit in the world hallelujah we really never had a place where I felt out of place I trust you dude why because you never really wouldn't we're a good unbeliever or even a good make believer because you're a believer and believers believe that's what they do it's like the eagle and the chicken coop he wasn't a very good chicken he tried he scratched had these bugs oh I'm sick of these bugs but it's all he knew was bugs and worms and Mama hens having a Jubilee in the little whatever little chickens but something mmm says something's not right here wasn't that a wonderful feast we head and something and the eagle chickens yeah yeah yeah yeah but in this house I no no no you know oh that was a glorious time yeah yeah no no no really yeah but you want to say I mean yeah you do where you say yeah because you want to fit him but in your house like no not really it's not my satisfying portion and there it was picking around and the mama knew she laid two eggs he comes the dynamics the mechanics is on the ground right he comes the dynamics looking for the mechanics she saw God found you God was hunting you doesn't matter if you're raised in church God was hunting you and your season he found you although he was soaring soaring maybe that ego was sinking where I might just go and get a get a takeaway meal something but then he bit in right well brother ben says mama mama look down and so that's not a chicken that's part of me that's part of me Oh hallelujah I've been looking for this one I knew it was there somewhere and here it is and then all the chickens they see maybe the shadow of the Eagle comes over there they panic they flee to the coop but then there's this little baby eagle and the and the Mama Eagle shadow goes over it looks up it's not scared mmm it looks familiar I don't know how um what am I not scared of that get the devil fleece from this word but the believer sees there's something about this thing yeah yeah something about this Living God I'll Lou you that that that that meets some kind of desire in them and then the baby will looks up it's not scared because remember it's a predator - right it's part of mama holy it's not a prey item yeah and maybe they're under the coop saying you know all panicking oh I get it yo get in you're gonna hit eatin but the moment yeah but the babysit you get away from this word at all it's funny oh oh it'll kill you I'll bring it in today's yeah here we are yeah but then the baby just says no that's and the mama looks down screams now if a you know if a predator screams at a prey item that proud and gets scared but the eagle baby wasn't a prey item and something resonated in it's all set soul that sounds like it fits me hallelujah and there's this word just like Jesus preached many people it resonated to a furor gripped a few to whom shall we go thou learn of the words of eternal life the scribes and Pharisees said this is Beelzebub there's two very different opinions they heard the same word because one was chicken one was eagle hallelujah I mean so there's the baby and she hears the scream and then and then now when it's like how do I get up there hallelujah there's something when he comes your way and you're oh Lord how do I get there I got this burden of sin I can't fly up there and he says I'm taking care of that just give it to me Oh Cassie you see my forgetfulness and then the mother says just flap your wings gets up to the fencepost Howley it's off the ground but it's not quite off the ground keep keep flexing those faith muscles there's something in the bride that must be in the heavenlies with our Lord you you can't stop it there's a death call us to the beach and there's more than a nice scripture that's a reality there's a big callings of God I must be in heaven with you I must walk streets of gold I must put the crown on your head at your feet follow us all God I want to worship you there I want to see you hallelujah is just like I said on Sunday you didn't choose him he chose you he chose you and then his mom and there's the baby yeah mama says flap your wings again gets to the top of the coop hallelujah it's not far enough yet then finally how do I get up there flap your wings I'll catch you hallelujah salsa jumps off Riggins flapping she comes down hallelujah off they go oh yeah glory what is that now that's the dynamics the mechanics is on the ground we are the mechanics you know it's more than cheers and pulpit and music in church order it's more than bits that's mechanics but that's not really the mechanics the mechanics is the people the mechanics is of people given to him that's the mechanics right so we're the mechanics and then now the dynamics comes down gets a hold of us holy there were no longer earthbound which is anymore but we're serving in the heavenlies with him oh yeah we friends we have the devil's answer Jesus Christ is risen and he's among us not just with you but in you until the end of the world Amen Alleluia and off she goes say well I'll close with this we are being made in His image and that's why there is power in this word there's power as I said about the disciples they heard the spoken word for for three and a half years and then finally 120 seats are in the upper roof they need the Sun race to come and quicken them make them alive hallelujah in the wave sheaf will wave that life came into them now very different kind of people amen it's the same thing now with this word Jesus is being waved right he's being waved and we just have to land the Prince of the Sun right to ripen brother Brad said the ship has pulled away now the grain is exposed to the once more time the ship protected the the wheat but now the wheat I mean the shuts pulled away then now the wheat is laying in the presence of the Sun I'll show you that in Scripture let's go to let's go to the book of Mark you know what brother Brown preached was scriptural let's go to mark 4 and 26 yeah brother bear him speaks about thee is this Lutheran you know this there's the restoration I will restore Luther came out it was the blade you know you know the wheat plant growing again Luther was the was the blade then Wesley was the tassel Pentecost this is a shook than this the bride right that's the full restoration so what went down in the ground is now a multiply is now a manifested again olia that's why there's no more ages after this age right the wheat is here again grain is here again right so what Jesus was you know where Jesus people the brightest Jesus people hallelujah with Jesus people cuz we're made in His image amen what does this missus produced Jesus people amen oh yeah hey Cece I thought so so we just finished with his mock for 26 and he said so is the kingdom of God as if a man should cast seed into the ground and should sleep and rise night and day and the seat should spring and grow up he knoweth not how for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear after that the full ear of corn but when the fruit is brought forth that's the seed again right immediately put it forth in the sickle because the harvest has come it's the four stages right there and we're living in the time of the harvest and this word is gathering us into the gap into the garden to the bone Allu yeah I think we have the musicians please hallelujah it's a listen to it is the rising of the Sun amen he says what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is a people who've been quicker from death to life amen I'm a new creation I'm a brand-new man oh oh yeah fly little Eagles you see I've never seen well I I have seen Eagles I've seen the first one I saw was a Papua New Guinea it wasn't walking along the ground it was way up in the heavenly it's just it was like this didn't even move its wings just shooting by and then and then up in Canada there all the Eagles around on the waiter was it Vancouver Island they just saw an you don't see them commuting by foot walking around on the earth you know for a long distance this soaring Amen we're not we're not earthbound people we're a heaven bound people blood washed blood Reedy Amen yeah let's sing this there's really been a change in me I mean you think that baby eagle out of the barnyard you know there's really been a change I'm glad I'm not identified see something in you just identifies with him I trust Oh born-again is really being a change in me born-again just like Jesus a [Music] born-again no because of Calvary I'm glad so glad that I've been born again [Applause] I'm a new creation man [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] I'm a crazy man Oh oh just my feeling [Music]
