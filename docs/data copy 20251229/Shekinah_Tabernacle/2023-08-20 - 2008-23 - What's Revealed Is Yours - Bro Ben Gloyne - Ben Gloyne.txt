to be a Christian hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen I probably ask you that every Sunday but hey we should be happy we're Christians you know we have eternal life that's a big deal you know amen praise the Lord God bless you all let's go to the book of Deuteronomy welcome everyone praise the Lord great to have everyone here amen trust you all feel at home and relaxed in the presence of God Amen amen amen Deuteronomy 29 oh we have to see I can drive it all right amen praise praise the Lord amen we um amen it's good to be here today amen so we're just going to read here Jerome 29 the first four verses then the last verse of this chapter these are the words of the Covenant which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of MOA beside the Covenant which he made with them in horeham and Moses called unto all Israel and said unto them ye have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt under pharaoh and unto all his servants and unto all his land the great Temptations which thine eyes have seen the signs and those great Miracles yet the Lord hath not given you a heart to perceive eyes to see and ears to hear unto this day so they saw it but they didn't see it but now they see it all right and then in Deuteronomy so the last part of this I thought was interesting this in the same um I know chapters and verses are put in later but I thought this is interesting this is in the same chapter here the secret things belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which were revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the work words of this law amen so if it's been revealed to you it's yours and your children's not just yours but your children's amen so let's just bow heads in a word of prayer amen we've got uh Asha we're a member in prayer this morning and also Sister Barbara is not well with the bad cold if he ever need you to raise it before the Lord this morning amen Our God's a miracle working God Amen thank you Lord Jesus Lord You're all together wonderful to us Lord Lord you are the light of the world we're so thankful we're not walking in darkness Lord but walking in your light and Lord it wasn't even our choice Lord to to walk in your light you called us in Lord we gave our lives to you Lord when you gave us the invitation I pray father that anyone here Lord or maybe streaming who doesn't know you in the power of your Resurrection Lord may this be their day father May touch each heart o God save every lost one heal Wounded Spirits Lord Jesus Lord Heal sick bodies father Lord we have sister Maggie here Lord touch your body Lord I pray father thank you Lord for your healing hand Lord Jesus you're mindful of every situation Lord God we want to pray for Sister Barbara as well with a bad cold father I pray you just turn that loose room now in the name of Jesus Christ restore her health for your glory Lord and father when I lift ashra into your presence as well Lord I just pray father you touch him dear God we know the doctors are trying to find out what it may be but we know that the any sickness cannot hide from you oh God you already know what it is Lord so I I pray father your healing hand will be upon him now mate just leave it his body For Your Glory Glory thank you Father and also we want to pray Lord as we've read your word may you anoint speaker and hear hero one more time lord may you move it Lord move in our midst one more time oh God we need you more than anything else in this day so come Among Us Lord For Your Glory for your welcome Lord in every heart and every life Lord we invite you to where we're at this morning oh God for your glory Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may have your seats this morning hallelujah amen so the secret things belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which I revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law amen so if it's been revealed it belongs to you amen it's yours it's your personal property and if it's revealed to you amen the devil can't take it away doesn't matter how much he may fight you the the Mind battles the troubles may be gone in your life but it's been revealed to it's yours amen I'm so thankful it's not just yours to enjoy but it's our children's as well Amen to the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a reality in your in your life it belongs to them doesn't matter what they're doing where they may be going it's theirs amen because it's yours it means if it's yours it's theirs hallelujah amen if I get happy today well I'm just going to be happy today amen because I mean because the secret things belong to our God but when they're revealed they belong to us amen they belong to that which uh which they're revealed or to who they're revealed to now we understand that the that the New Testament Church is built upon the rock of Revelation the rock of who Jesus Christ is which is his word we know here in Matthew chapter 16 I'm not going to read it all but you know Jesus I'm just going to paraphrase it but it's up there if you want to read it that there they had a conversation Jesus and his disciples were talking about who do men say that I am and they thought he was a prophet or you know one of the prophets the Old Testament but then he asked who do you say that I am and this is always the question that God asks every generation who do you say this is when God manifests himself who do you say it is is it just a Ministry is it just a prophet is it just a church or is it the word himself amen manifested and then that's why Peter would say thou art the Christ the son of the Living God and then and then Peter would be told by the Lord you're blessed because man hasn't revealed this to you you didn't work this thing out you didn't say one plus one is two and this is what the answer is no but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you so now the secret things belong to God because because the Christ was revealed to Peter then the the Messiah was his Hallelujah that means if the Messiah the United Way is being revealed to you everything within him is yours amen every Redemptive blessing every Supernatural work anything he can do now you think about what God can do God can do anything God said let there be sun moon and stars and we're now standing on this planet Earth with life in our bodies Hallelujah he did all the details amen but you know he can do anything he's the Creator amen if he's been revealed to you he can do anything in your life amen there's nothing that can limit Our God and he wants to put faith in your life to manifest his promises remember he wants to fulfill his word more than you want it fulfilled Hallelujah so God wants to prove his word and he is proving his word and will prove his word amen but you see now Revelation gives us prevailing power over the gates of hell now we know the Gates of Hell or a gate or a door stops you accessing something so for example if Jenny locked her doors and lunch was there those doors will stop us getting fed but if we were really persistent enough we'd busting those doors because there's food behind those doors and we want to get fed right amens is the same I'm not saying Jenny's doors of the gates of hell but I'm using as an illustration right the devil will try and stop you possessing every Redemptive blessing of God Amen but it's our privilege to bust his doors down and get the promise amen because if it's been revealed to you that the promise is yours it belongs to you you will bust through every door in prayer you will not just be satisfied with whatever will be will be but you'll you'll lay claim on every promise amen because God has made us rugged Christians I mean we're not wishy-washy jellyfish kind of people nowhere amen when he say the promise we say it's mine amen and I didn't earn it I don't deserve it but it's been given unto me so it's been given to me I'm going to possess it I'm going to enjoy it I'm going to occupy it I'm going to kick out every squatter all unbelief mind battles they're gonna go this is what God has made us yeah we've got to see how we're built amen and we haven't built ourselves we're not our own we're not our own workmanship we're God's workmanship Hallelujah so we've got to really look at how God has given us all promises amen we're not under the blood of bulls and goats of just a covering of sin and there's no ability for sin nature to be changed and God can never dwell on the people under the blood of bulls and goats we're not under that Covenant that's being done away with the blood of bulls and ghosts under the blood of Jesus Christ amen where the Creator himself comes and dwells in you and I and he speaks his word through mortal lips and it comes to pass Hallelujah this prevailing power brother Graham says if I can find it there's nothing more powerful then there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word so the powers of Hell could not Prevail against Revelation amen it is impossible for the powers of Hell to Prevail against Revelation now the powers of hell can Prevail against a mental workup it can Prevail against emotion but it cannot Prevail against Revelation because Revelation there is emotion comes with it it was happy when they when it was revealed to them the essential washed away with Calvary was more than the story it was a reality it was for you that made you emotional didn't it it made you happy amen amen when you realize that you pass from Death to life I'm sure you felt a bit happy when that anchored into your soul it wasn't just well that's neat Lord and walk on no you're happy about it amen you know where you're going nothing can stop you getting there I mean because you're sealed to the day of your Redemption Hallelujah so there's prevailing power in Revelation amen it helps us live above the muck and mire of the world Amen now we know faith is a revelation we understand that don't we we don't need to go through those things too much but faith is a revelation it's got to be revealed to you amens that's why we're a very blessed people to believe God's word the full Council of his word in this day you're blessed you're a very blessed person has been revealed to you if this if it's revealed to you this is not man's writings it's not just a translation not just nice ideas it's not just tradition but it is God in print form if that's been revealed to you're a blessed person Hallelujah amen but you see now in order for any promises being revealed to you to come to pass you've got to confess it you got to confess that it is true see God is looking for people just to agree with them basically that's really what it boils down with see the devil wants the world to agree with him God wants people to agree with him right how do you agree with God you say yes his word is true his word is true my thoughts are false compared to his word right my ideas are false compared to his word anything that's compared to us with this country is Wrong God is always right amen so that's what that that's all he's looking for just agree just say yes Lord hallelujah amen Hallelujah and what does that really do it brings a faith into our lives it brings the power of the word into our lives if we just agree see it's not a it's it's not about our condition see when Moses was Moses hands were lifted up when Joshua and the children of Israel were fighting the the outcome of the battle wasn't based on how skilled Joshua was with a sword it wasn't based on their equipment their formations anything that they could do in the battle the victory wasn't based on them the victors if Moses hands are up if Moses hands are up there winning of his hands went down there losing so they could have been outnumbering the enemy ten to one but if his hands went down they started losing right so it wasn't the victory wasn't based on them the Victor is based on hands raised right now our lord Jesus hands a race between him and Earth at down Calvary amen until the victory of Victories Was Won amen if we just keep looking to his hands raised we'll win in every battle I mean we may be fighting a mind battle trouble sickness complexes pains whatever more but if you keep your eyes his hands are raised I mean because why he is our intermediator amen he's our intercessor until we get raptured out of this world Hallelujah then he'll turn to the Jews and you know there's Grace for those we understand that but you see you keep looking to him in the battle you'll win the battle Hallelujah amen you see now there's nothing see he can't do nothing until he first we confess that he's done it not even he will or he can but he has he has done it amen that day on Calvary he conquered all sickness he conquered death he conquered all troubles anything that the devil can be named whatever label it is whatever weapon it is he conquered it there's nothing that is not conquered he has conquered amen now if he has conquered all things amen he has done that then now we confess that by his stripes I'm healed amen that the baptism the Holy Ghost was for me joy is for me overcoming power is is in me Hallelujah not a one day but an hour I mean remember we're not looking forward we're actually looking back rejoicing what has already happened and living in its benefits so you see you see Abel Abel when he offered the lamb he was looking forward by Revelation that that this lamb was just a symbol of the Lamb of God the seed of the woman that would come and crash the head of the seed of the serpent right he was looking forward he died in faith looking forward amen but we're not looking forward for the lamb to come we're looking back and seeing what he's done and now walking in that Victory I mean we're really walking in the victory we're walking in the shadow of the Cross all the way into the rapture Hallelujah that's what we're doing amen hallelujah amen so you got to believe he's already done it amen amen so we get down to the altar see you could get here down here at the altar and pray all night wouldn't do you a bit of good until you believe that he forgives you then you stand up you got to believe that he forgives you see it's a you know that's the most important thing then as much Faith as you have that's where see you lived once way down here in the muck of sin now you young converts now you believe you're saved don't you then you raise up here you raise a little higher what does it your faith because you believe you're a Christian now you live you'll live above that thing now but many times we say but there's all these other things that we need to overcome we get discouraged no if you're being raised up just a just a a millimeter off the ground because of Faith you're still off the ground you're not where you started you're about higher so keep climbing in faith taking God at his word and you'll find you're maybe a centimeter maybe a hundred mil I don't know but you'll be being lifted up above the things of the world all the time Hallelujah see your faith because now so you'll live above that thing now now if you just want to raise a little higher just have more faith because it's unlimited just keep on now we gotta look at now I was thinking about this today well yesterday everything we do in life is really Quantified by a speed by Distance by a weight by design by material you know everything's kind of what can it do what's it you know you see specs of a car or a plane or a gadget whatever Faith really to me hasn't really been Quantified because faith is unlimited you know sure it's been described look at this this is amazing who through face subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtain promises stop the mouths of lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax Valley in and fight turn to flight the armies of the aliens women receive their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourging J more ever of bonds and imprisonment you keep reading down but you see Paul is trying to quantify What Faith Can Do here but to me this is really just the surface of What Faith Can Do and because faith is Unlimited in its power faith is Unlimited in its potential we don't we don't serve a limited God today we serve an unlimited God we serve the almighty God Amen to have you see through faith or through Revelation they obtain promises they stop the mouths of lions they did incredible exploits but then if you keep reading down through Hebrews it says but us without us without them are not made perfect I mean so so the body's not complete without us coming to our position now if they could do these incredible things under the blood of bulls and goats how much more The People Under the blood of Jesus Christ where Moses under Revelation could Yeah Yeah by faith under the blood of bulls and goats could could raise up his staff and there would be oh what have I done here fleas and frogs and Red Sea opening and all these incredible things that was under the blood of blood of bulls and goats how much more now under the people under the blood of Jesus Christ what could be done this morning what could be done this morning not just at Camp what about right now because the same God at camp or the same God you see in special meetings somewhere else is the same God every day not just here in these four walls every day is the same every day he's Unlimited in his power every day he's Unlimited in his potential and his ability amen he is not limited in any way in himself amen but now we've got to let Faith lead us to all things amen not to be hindered by anything now it's going to drop this in there I'm going to come back to that thought of being unlimited now Isaiah asks a question who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed so he's actually really asking a question and a question and really the answer is the arm of the Lord is revealed to those who believe the report amen so the so the strength of God see in other words if you have believed our report then the arm of the Lord has been revealed now the arm of the Lord is the strength of the Lord there's no weak Parts in God he's all strong from his little toenail to the to his eyebrows and above every part of him is strong I mean there's no weak part in God the arm of the Lord is strong now there's no weak Parts in the body of Christ we may think we're weak or we're not really a strong Christian but brother Brown tells us the weakest of Christians when they get down on their knees to pray the kingdom of Health shakes amen you may think that your prayer doesn't even go through the floor or past the ceiling whatever more but God hears your prayer you may feel nothing when you pray but God hears your prayer amen and God begins to act on your behalf and you may be praying you may say amen and you and then of course the people comes and says well there's no point in praying that but he's got to rebuild hell you know it's Rubble everywhere there's Devils pinned under beams and struggling under eye beams and there's been a Catholic there's been a critical structural failure in hell because of your prayer Hallelujah and the devil says oh there's nothing happening with that and he's going to get his imps out of these rocks and Rubble in this you know this there's there's ambulances there not there's any healing but just an illustration that you know there's disaster teams and press conferences going on to explain why this all happened and he tells you nothing happened no something happened remember Prayer Changes Things Prayer Changes Things amen remember someone who just met the Lord a second ago has more Authority with God than the archangels that never fell amen so how much more you and I see there under the blood of Jesus Christ we're under the blood of Jesus Christ so we have a right to go before God this morning hallelujah amen remember God wants us in his presence he loves it when we're in his presence amen he enjoys it when we step into his presence that's what he Longs for he enjoys spending time with you we may think we're not worthy but he says look I've made you more than Worthy Hallelujah I mean so so so if if we have believed his report now how can you believe his report unless it's been revealed has it been revealed to you his word is true in any circumstance at any time doesn't matter what mind battle is going on in your mind right now that thing's a lie that thing's the devil don't listen to it God's word is true amen so we don't need to put up with the devil's nonsense no the arm of the Lord has been revealed why do you believe we're not going to have a mic be passing around but but just think about it well why do I believe well we say well one day something happened to me and uh I believe this it can be a great thing could have been a very simple thing it doesn't matter the size of it but something in you says I'm a Christian so again he says you want to serve God who did that you didn't do that God did that what was that that was the arm of the Lord being revealed to you Amen to now if the arm of the Lord is revealed to you all power in Heaven and Earth has been revealed to you amen just let Faith have his perfect work in your life Hallelujah who's happy today amen our God is more than able to do anything I don't care what it is God can do anything Hallelujah Hallelujah hey man if you think I'm a fanatic I'm real happy this way amen hey there's people cheering and shouting in soccer stadiums and all these different kind of things paint themselves all different colors turn up early mortgage their houses do all kind of crazy things just for 90 just to watch 90 minutes of football live and it's gonna pass away and it's going to be forgotten but what we believe is eternal oh Luis I think we've got something to be excited about Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord Jesus amen now we have something that is Unlimited in its power the word of God brother man speaks about it a few times in an absolute he says I was hearing a man speak or talk not long ago now I'm talking about remember the hidden things belong with the God but those things are revealed belong unto us amen amen amen and he used the word absolute I thought that's a very fine word I hear you so many times absolutely I looked up in the dictionary Webster according to Webster it's perfect in itself so it's perfect it doesn't need adding two does need apologetics it's perfect in itself it's Unlimited in its power primarily and ultimate and an ultimate is the amen that's all an absolute is the Unlimited in power the word absolute is perfect in itself it's all of it that settles it I thought that's a glorious thing that's a wonderful word now a word is a thought expressed first it must be thought and then it becomes a word then it is spoken then it's received amen so a word that's perfect in itself Unlimited in power has all potentials what was thought and was spoken and remember God is his word so God wants to transmit himself down into human beings hello that's why he uses his word amen it's speaking himself down into you and I and then it comes into us and then we speak it back to him and then he calls it to come to pass Hallelujah if you believe you're a Believer today amen God gives you power to be a believer amen if God believe if you confess you're an overcomer God will give you the power to be an overcomer amen why because God works according to our confession that's why never have a negative of confession never confess what you see what you feel what you hear what you imagine confess what the word says hey if those things agree with the word confess them but if it's contrary get rid of it amen just take God in his word amen hallelujah so it's Unlimited in its power now if something is an absolute or unlimited its power then it can it goes beyond all barriers it goes beyond all barriers now this was the first plane that uh X1 Bell I think it's called This is the first plane ever to to break through the sound barrier and I thought it was interesting it broke through the sound barrier in 1947 October 1947. I thought isn't that interesting God raised up a prophet in the land amen that God allowed to break through every barrier of tradition every barrier of denomination every barrier of culture every every barrier of human understanding he broke through that sound barrier Amy the shower bride was going to break through every sound barrier amen breakthrough every barrier of the devil every barrier of trouble and insecurity or Evermore and walk with God hallelujah you say well that doesn't look like much of a plane but it was designed to do what it did Hallelujah and you may look at yourself and say I'm not much of a design but hey well yeah I'm not much of a Believer but you're designed to do what you'll do amen and God has designed you to break through the sound barrier amen of every tradition trouble Whatever It Is God has designed you to break through that barrier Hallelujah now so it's so important brother Brown says here and going beyond the camp amen now you know I was told some time ago they had a Jet Plane I believe it's the one we just had makes him noises we hear about here that shakes the windows it's when the plane has got so fast that it crosses its own sound called sound barrier and when it goes beyond its own sound barrier it's almost unlimited to what it'll do remember the word is Unlimited in its power but it's got to be manifested in human beings amen and I think in there that we get a lesson that when we go beyond our own sound barrier into the word of God then it's unlimited what God can do with a man that's ready to go beyond the camp the camp of man now we see that going beyond the camp going Beyond this so if we can go beyond our own sound barrier ow our own sound barrier now we have a sound barrier to go through amen see now see now remember when a plane goes to the sound barrier the most resistance is when it's about to break that barrier because it's just pushing against it it's just there's the most resistance when the Breakthrough is about to come amen and that's when the devil begins to pour on feelings and thoughts and troubles and cold feelings whatever it is just when someone's about to break through the sound barrier I think brother Brown's own sister said to him you know I feel like I'm going to get the Holy Ghost and a feeling comes over me all these things and you know and and he tells her that's because you're just about to break through I mean why because the most trouble is happening just before the sound barrier is broken through amen so there's the most resistance there so so we need to break the our our own sound barrier of reasoning is it really true can it really happen that's not your thoughts that's the devil's story well he did it for them but he won't do it for you you gotta you gotta get rid of that reasoning oh well I've seen other people say they've got it but they didn't have it so what's these are trying to get it that's reason get rid of the reasoning amen we've got to break through the barrier of our five senses you know I don't see Victory I don't feel Victory I don't hear Victory I don't think Victory I don't imagine Victory whatever break through those five senses I mean that's where why you're about to break through the sound barrier aiming to where all things are possible amen the devil telling you not to agree with the word that's a sound barrier so you've got to turn down this lie and accept the word of God you accept the word of God you can break through the sound barrier hallelujah amen telling you not to say Amen with the word see the devil loves to sit with you in church he doesn't encourage you he doesn't say say Amen enjoy yourself just relax just enjoy the atmosphere just just you know absorb it he doesn't tell you that he tells you tomorrow this is happening and this is happening now and what about this and you left this on the stove and what about this in your laundry and all these things going on because he doesn't want you to agree with the word and he'll say don't say Amen what will that person think of you what will this person do what will they say about you after church if you really break through the sound barrier and meet the Eternal God really we're going to come to a point say who cares about that kind of thing you know brother Brown says yeah that the church needs to get out of order long enough for someone to get safe Hallelujah so I think we should really just break through a few barriers I mean you say well yo we need healing we need healing in our bodies we have sick we have needs Among Us let's break through a barrier amen that God can bring a resurrection God can bring amen the supernatural in our midst amen see and also we're going to break through the barrier of wanting our own will above Gods that's a big barrier especially when it can be so spiritual looking you know because people say well I want to break through the barrier but I don't want to speak in tongues I don't want to dance I don't want to shout you may never do any of those things but you've got to be willing to do it amen oh Lord I want this promise to be answered this way we're going to be committed all to God whatever he wants however he wants it done praise God I want what you want for me dear Lord we'll sing that one day amen but but that's a barrier see we should come to God not with our minds made up of how things will happen but we should just take God at his word and say Lord you'll do it however I don't know you're he's the details guy I'm not a details guy you know I'm not a details guy but he's the he takes care of the details Hallelujah amen so we're going to come to a place that God is always right no matter what the outcome you'll break through see job said though he slam me yet I'll trust him what did he broke through a barrier he broke through the sound barrier and said I now I know my redeemer liveth amen so he broke through the barrier of the troubles going on the trials all these things he says well whatever the outcome Lord yeah I'm going to trust God anyway and he said and then he broke through that sound barrier into a place where he saw the resurrection and his place in it not just the resurrection but his place in it because he says I I know my redeemer loveth and I'll stand with him on the Earth Hallelujah Hallelujah amen Hallelujah see never let the devil diminish your faith where are people of great faith God's given you great faith you say well I don't have a lot of faith but if you have the faith of a mustard seed it doesn't you don't have to you know we don't have a gauge on how much faith we have don't worry about the tank just love the Lord he'll give you the faithful when you need it amen you'll find many times you come in life things will just happen you don't even realize how you'd react in that circumstance amen I remember when Christine and I were down in Christchurch there's that first first earthquake and we're awake and you know we got down by our front door I'm just paraphrasing very shortly but the you know the Earth wasn't just rolling it was shaking this way and this way very violently and we started praying and just God came down and we had a wonderful time in his presence while the world is shaking now if if I thought about what would I how would I handle an earthquake before that ever happened I probably would never thought that would have happened but God comes on the scene when you need him see we don't need to work out how God will do things when we get there we just trust God and he'll do it when we get there however he wants to do it that's fine I like what he does he's a god of surprises you know he's a god of his word but he loves to surprise us Amen Hallelujah by how he does things amen hallelujah cease he bit our faithful unto death he does not say be faithful and um until death but unto death you may not you may have to seal your do I have it up there still your testimony with your blood thousands yeah Millions have died during all the ages they died in the faith like antipasto faithful murder they held out but me they held they held not their lives there unto death often we think it'd be almost impossible to be a martyr who thinks that yeah yeah but dare to recall that the faith we daily use to Triumph in Christ Jesus is the same faith that upholds the polycarps and all Martyrs the Supreme faith will give Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour amen and this is the Supreme hour of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen so if this is the Supreme hour then Supreme faith will give Supreme Grace what do we need to worry about I may remember God will step on the scene God is faithful God is true he's never LED his children into a no exit place a point of no return where he is not there to help him amen he was in the fire when the three Hebrew children were in the fire amen he was there in the Lion's Den with Daniel Amen he was with the children of Israel in the wilderness through the Red Sea River God's people are because remember he's our Shepherd he goes before us Shepherds lead they don't drive so he steps into the trouble before you ever get there Hallelujah so he never leads us to a place that he is not with us in that place Hallelujah so what does that Supreme Grace for the Supreme now hallelujah our God's always on time you say well what about four days late no yeah it's amazing I you know we watched the Cloverdale play yesterday uh yeah was it yesterday whenever it was Friday and it was about Mary and Martha and Lazarus and the you know Lazarus dying and being raised from the dead but it's interesting I never put them together before but in one of the Gospel accounts Mary is the one who who anoints Jesus's feet in Simon's house so there she is she had to break through a lot of barriers Hallelujah she had to break through a lot of barriers she had to break through Simon's barrier what he will think he was a Pharisee and a lot of Pharisees there they're real judgmental kind of a people they like things to be done their way and it's their way or the highway or the byway I don't know but it's not you know so you know she wasn't invited she had to break through the barrier of that I think do I I don't think I have a picture for this anyway we'll just leave that up there so so she had to break through the barrier of not being invited she had to break through the barrier of not being welcome she had to break through the barrier of what people would say but I remember in that play there was like a lion where where where Mary's on the outside looks and sees Jesus and and and and and she's so gripped by the fact he's in the corner with unwashed feet it says they haven't washed his feet haven't made him welcome but it's Jesus and it was so griptor saying but but there is there now I can have an opportunity so because she knew he was on the other side of the barrier amen she was more than willing to go through every barrier to get to Jesus amen so so she broke through that sound barrier of what people say what people will do how people will react and say I must wash his feet amen so she ducked and it's so amazing Where She Went yo she took her money all of her money she took her best my Lord she took her best got the best ointment somehow got past the footwash flanking all those people and got to his feet and then that's when she started to cry and weep and she didn't care what she was doing and how it would affect everyone else she just had to wash his feet but she broke through the barrier and did him a service and I pray every time we have church I pray every time we pray or read our Bible we don't leave Jesus with unwashed feet in the corner amen but we lay down at his feet and washed his feet with worship and with praise and her praise filled the whole house and no one else was rejoicing but she didn't care because she got what she needed I mean she broke through the barrier Hallelujah but you see she broke through that barrier because she but she didn't realize that she would need a resurrection in her house after that Hallelujah so she broke through that barrier and it wasn't just her sins were forgiven her but then she would need her brother to be raised from the dead Hallelujah so you'll never never underestimate that every time you break through amen and get a hold of the master amen when you feel his presence come around you and you don't care you know brother Brown says she got all crying and shouting and weeping and he said you remember that time when you got into his presence the first time Holly you in a dried icon of a moment sitting on a Pew somewhere like a frog on a lily pad I mean none of you are shouting and rejoicing you got next to yourself hey because you realize you're in the presence of almighty God Amen if we could just realize that we are in the presence of almighty God this morning amen we're not here to we're not here to worship a building we're ahead of worship just a man we're not here just to have religion we're here to Worship the Lord of glory amen who made all things the creator of heavens and earth I am in The God Who redeemed us on Calvary that's the one we've come to worship amen so we realize but remember the secret things belong to God but those which I revealed belong unto us and to our children right so it was revealed to her that man is Messiah that man who's not welcome in that place is Messiah he's the Lord Of Glory he's God made flesh and because it was revealed to her I mean she could get every Redemptive blessing she had need of out of him Hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and I amen we don't need a physical body to touch amen but our faith can touch the hymn of His Garment amen we can wash his feet with tears of Thanksgiving and praise I mean anoint him to make him welcome amen and what happened then God will talk to you Hallelujah you know brother Ramsey is the one place that the reason that God is here is to release our desires to us so whatever we have need of he wants to release that desire to you and I I mean it takes Faith to touch His Garment but what does he want to do see me he wants to give us what we need more than we want to receive it we just got to open the door of our hearts and say yes Lord I accept it Lord Jesus thank you my God Hallelujah so she broke through the sound barrier and she brought a resurrection to her house because not long after that Lazarus got sick and died but then the resurrection and the life came into a house and raised him from the dead amen hallelujah amen I think that's powerful amen I think that is powerful and we've got to realize that God has not come to give us a spirit of fear but he's come to give us love see I have not come to bring fear and failure this was the angel when when Jesus came his angel came and spoke to John in Revelations 1 the Patmos vision and you know John fell down as a dead man he's saying don't fear John and John represents the bride of Christ one man is a symbol in the book he says Don't Fear John Don't Fear Little Flock all I am is you are here too all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst I believe he's present not just here but he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you amen as I stand in your midst I have not come to bring fear and failure see we've got to realize the devil has come to steal kill and destroy that's what he's come to do the devil has not come to give us overcoming power joy and speakable full of Glory right he's come to destroy God has not come to destroy he's the opposite of the devil amen he's not to bring he has not come to give you fear and failure I mean but love courage and ability amen love amen what is that the love of God she hadn't brought in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us courage to take God in his word amen not to compromise on the word what God has said is true amen what God has said is true amen that's how it takes courage that's why Joshua said be strong and very courageous to do all that is in the word see he had to be commanded you must be strong and be courageous Joshua I am with you to take over this whole campaign Joshua I'm not just here to take over the fall of Jericho and release Rahab out of her captivity I've come your people will possess the entire Promised Land Hallelujah so we the Lord the angel of God is here that we would possess every promise every promise doesn't matter the obstacle doesn't you know I was thinking when um brother our mum was talking about footsteps of possession I was just thinking in my mind you know Joshua she's standing he's walking and then he comes to the wall of Jericho and he puts his foot on the wall of Jericho this is my wall it's coming down holy why because footsteps are possession so it doesn't matter the obstacle the devil puts in your way a fear of failure you know testimony well they're not testimonies but oh this person failed here this person did this this person did this all those things he said no I'm going to stand on that that thing's not going to stop me well my daddy my mummy my brother my sister all these excuses no but I'm going to stand here I'm going to stand on that excuse that scarecrow I'm going to possess it and I'm going to walk on Hallelujah amen says come to give us love courage and ability and that ability is for the word of God to be fulfilled in our lives and remember he's the one who gives these things I have come to give you these things not you would do it see this is not even a human courage or or a human boldness no this is a the courage of God to stand on his word as the ability of God himself to fulfill the word in our lives Hallelujah all power is given unto me and it is yours to use you speak the word and I'll perform it that is my Covenant and it can never fail Hallelujah I like that don't you amen hallelujah now if it's revealed it's yours it takes the anointing of God to reveal it so I'm just kind of maybe we're changing gear a bit BC Caleb had a different spirit with him he didn't have the spirit of a church with him he didn't have a religious spirit with them he didn't have a family spirit with him he didn't have a family strain driving his life no he had a different Spirit it was a spirit of God was upon Him amen and that's why he would just enjoy imagine that for 40 years imagining a promise he walked there he saw it it was revealed to him see the hidden things belong to God but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children so it was revealed to Caleb no doubt it would have been you know who's ever played as a kid before the devices driving along my car your car or my house your house or you know so maybe with um Joshua would have been okay my Mountain your Mountain you know because they would have been because it's theirs they've never seen the promised land before they've only heard stories of it from Abraham Isaac and Jacob and now they're gone out of Egypt now they're going to see the promises it's not just I've heard of it now they're going to see it as the same thing you hear of God moving then you see God moving that's two very different things and but when you see a movie you realize actually that is mine amen the baptism the Holy Ghost is mine God moving in my life is mine amen so Joshua was very Caleb was very excited about it so they would have been going that's my acidic no that's my city may they sort of different because because just like my car your car you don't stay with the first car you see you know you don't okay come on you've got an eight-hour trip to Auckland you know just pull out of the driver oh that's my car that's your car you always want better right and if a lesser one comes away you just let it go you just ignore that one you know so so Joshua would have been Caleb and Josh were doing the same thing they would have seen a city they liked mine next one's mine but then when he saw his Mountain it wasn't him saying it's mine God was saying that's yours it was revealed to him see and because it was revealed to him it belonged to him though all the enemies were there the Giants and all that stuff was there God said it says so because it was revealed it belonged to him and to his children amen so he now spent 40 years in the desert not complaining not being better not questioning God why he would just have well I guess his family altar would probably be in the same we're going in children we're going to possess the land let me tell you about it again let me tell you about it again may have been different angles different ways he approached it but it would have been the same thing and your house is going to be here son and daughter you're going to live here I'm going to live here and this is how it's going to be and there would have been such an atmosphere of Faith coming to the tent workers are talking about a promise God had given it wasn't Caleb had given it it was actually God had given him the promise and when we think about all the Divine Promises of God that God has given see this is not us saying that's mine that's mine that's mine out of our human ability this is God saying this this is yours this is yours eternal life is you're the Holy Ghost is yours Miracles are yours healing's yours Deliverance is yours peace is yours Joy is yours faith is yours love is yours it's God's saying it's yours Hallelujah so Caleb would have been saying now now children maybe it's year 39 day 364. I don't know yeah but there would have been such a faith in the tent yeah yeah I don't believe they would have gotten sick of that story because it was real and it caused their faith to rise too remember they hadn't seen the land their father had seen the land but because he was under a different anointing and they agreed with what he was saying that anointing Came Upon them Hallelujah and they broke through the sound barrier of a cycle of a slave mentality remember it was a slave mentality that kept them in the wilderness it was a slave mentality that made those 10 spies say we can't take it right but Joshua and Caleb broke through that barrier because while they took God at his word you want to break through a barrier take God in his word it doesn't matter what the barrier is you take God at his word you'll break through that barrier hallelujah amen and they possessed the promised land I'm so glad for that aren't you Hallelujah no see there comes a time when we realize where God is God he's not a historical God he's not someone else's God but he's our God he's my God amen he's a personal God amen and when you realize that what happens is what he begins to reveal himself and everything he is I I'm sorry if I'm just repeating myself a lot but you've got to realize everything that God is if he's revealed himself to you then all there is is yours and your children's Hallelujah amen so shamgar got to a place where it was revealed to him that the land was his it was you think about this man he's the son of Abraham he's a circumcised believer he's living in the promised land yes so what is that he's a born-again Believer he's baptized in the Holy Ghost he's an adopted son of God placed in the body but yet he's living below his privilege the enemy comes in season after season Harvest after harvest and takes his takes his grain away and it's amazing because there's 600 Philistine soldiers come to get one man's Harvest now I know I've said it before I'll say it again the devil had an idea what shamgar was uh the potential in shamgar he had an idea of what he was capable of shamgar had no idea but then there came a point in his life where he saw the Harvest was in he saw the Ragged state of his children his wife and the trouble therein and then he heard the same stomping of the same feet of the same Philistines coming down the road again and something in him said I'm sick of this I'm sick of this I'm sick of this cycle of up and down God blesses and the devil steals it from me and I have a great time in church and the devil takes it away from me I'm sick of this amen he had had enough of it amen and I believe amen we need to get a have enough of it get sick of the devil we have a right to be annoyed at the devil get angry at him see righteous Indonesia be poured out upon Satan amen do you think Esther before the king would have been it's that Wicked Man Heyman you know what is your request well you know my people are you know like real casual kind of conversation no her Oliver anger you see all that pent up my people are under a death sentence but now I have my opportunity to tell my husband to tell the king who has the power to destroy him do you think she would have said oh it's that Wicked Man Heyman no excuse it this man she would not sick of his presence she got sick of him being in the palace sick of the stench of him walking through and his arrogance he walking around he would have got sick of it and we got to get sick of the enemy get sick of his presence think of his boasts sick of his nonsense sick of his lies sick of his mind battle and say God this one's trying to destroy me and he will if he can but Lord you're my husband you're my king you're mainly the queen it's this one and then and then God I mean why because the secret things belong to God but those that's revealed who belong unto us so it was revealed to Esther that the king had the power to to destroy her enemy and give her the authority to write a new law Hallelujah hallelujah we're going to get mad at the Devil we shouldn't just put up with them he puts a foot at the door you know sometimes yeah if anyone's in this um job well God bless you but you know sometimes I feel like people come and try and sell you a new power company and then you think at the door you know and you're nice you talk to them I'll be honest 99 100 of the time I I just want to say goodbye I want to be rude I don't have time it's the time of day where meals are being cooked children are home from school there's all there's all the evening things but you kind of just yes okay not the only last time we changed power companies is because we've got a free vacuum cleaner or something you know what else is in it for me but you know sometimes I just want to goodbye I'm sick of you guys turning up someone else was here last week and I think many times we talk to the dead or allow the devil to come in the same way we put up with those kind of guys too much now if you want a good deal I'm maybe I'm just I need more I need more patient I don't know you know but hey I hear them out they talk through everything I give them the bill and we go through all those things okay but in my heart I'm like I have don't have time for this I don't care what deal you give me could be real good but you see sometimes we put up with the devil like maybe we put up with those kind of people you be polite sorry if that's a bad illustration but you know he comes in a little bit we don't get sick of him just in a little bit we allow them to come in a mild form we entertain them we entertain a mild thought and it's the devil trying to derail our whole thought life off somewhere else we don't stop him in his tracks we allow him to set up shop rearrange Furniture in our life rearrange our habits rearrange our daily schedule and then we say this is wrong well we should have said it's wrong when he put his little toe in the door and the very first very first time see shamgar had enough of it but you realize when he had enough of it and he got his Ox code he did not become a circumcised son of Abraham living in the promised land he already was those things see that Revelation did not make him what he wasn't that Revelation revealed to him what he already was amen and because we are the sons and daughters of God God gives us the Holy Ghost amen we don't become Sons and Daughters when we receive it because we are Sons we receive killed 600 Philistines and there was Liberty there and his house hallelujah what did he do he broke through the sound barrier he broke through the sound barrier of remembering every past Harvest you're no doubt the first on the Philistines came in he was upset he would have been upset every time but you know maybe he would have tried to stop them in some way and he'd probably remember the trauma of having a spear to his throat or you know his children pinned in a corner and you know the soldiers being evil and all that stuff you know there'd be that trauma of every Harvest there'd be a fear when he heard those footsteps it would have been a fear come over right but he had to break through the sound barrier of that fear he had to break through the sound barrier of what had happened in the past the past is the past you can't change the past we can change how it affects you now amen who had to break through those barriers until what he was The Ultimate Warrior it killed 600 men if there were 700 I believe he would have killed seven hundred thousand he would have down them you know but why because he broke through the sound barrier of what he thought his limitations were when he realized God had made a covenant with him if you realize God made a covenant with you you say when did he do that when he was hanging on Calvary between heavens and earth brother Brown says God was making a covenant with the families of the earth so he was making a covenant with you I'll not leave you nor forsake you you'll be the head and not the tail Satan will be under your feet amen you are here of all things you're more than a conqueror through me hey amen Hallelujah see he got sick of it so he went amen you say well but you're a Christian you don't and like like he he had no idea how to fight but you know I'm just going to read well just and any man here who's been circumcised by the spirit of God that's born again any of you people that's sick the devil's a bluff he'll rob you he'll power your cheeks he'll do anything he can but you don't have to stand for it no longer you say I'm not a preacher but you're a Christian do we have Christians here today amen he didn't say how to fight you say I don't know nothing about faith step out anyhow yes sir so take God in his word you say I've never seen it done before take God at his word you know the first ever resurrection of life was the was the widow woman that that Elijah was feeding if I can find it here that was the first account I don't have it on my notes but it was the first account of a resurrection of life it had never been done before no account in the Bible but she but you see the secret things belong to God but those that are revealed to they belong to them and to their children so it was revealed it was revealed to her the god of Elijah is the god of the Resurrection he is the he is the resurrection and the life and that's why she got him and said look my son is dead I remember remember Elijah prophesied she would have the son and then he had and then she had the Sun and then now he's gonna die and he died and then so he she so I keep saying she she had a revelation that the God and Elijah was the god of the Resurrection so the first time that someone has ever raised from the dead was in this account now in Second Kings in second king says the shunamite woman that you know built that little house for Elijah and you know your Elisha and gehazi would come when they're making the travels and stand that little lean to on the side of the house and you know Elisha's lying there one day on the bed or comfortable enjoyed a meal and you know it should be you know he begins to think how she has been so good to them and then and then and then he starts to speak to gehazi and said you know what what do you think this woman needs you know shall go talk to the king for a do something and you know but but um you know he said no but they don't have children yeah and he says they'll say the Lord she's going to have a son so now now here was a son that was prophesied to come came and then the boy grew up was out with his father in the field you know got sunstroke cried out my head my head and you know fell over and they took him into her you know into his mother but he died on her lap and then now she knew that everything that the prophet touched was blessed so she laid him on the prophet's bed but then she said now settle me a meal we're gonna go find him because it revealed to her if God can raise another son from the dead and that same God is in Elisha as he was in Elijah then that same God can raise my son from the dead but you see because it was revealed to her she had to break through the sound barrier of reasoning she had to break through the sound barrier of her own grief she had to break through the sound barrier no doubt her family is saying okay let's just bury him I'm sorry the lord gave him to you but now the law has taken him away blessed be the name of the Lord let's just go burial but she broke through the sound barrier of that because it was revealed to her that the god of the Resurrection is an Elisha and then so as soon and now as soon as the sunlight woman came to where Elisha was you know she cried he said is all well she said all is well her son was dead on the bed there's only one account now of someone being raised from the dead but she knew she could just if she just got to God not the prophet but the God and the prophet amen all would be well Hallelujah so but but Elisha didn't know what was going on you know he just he said it wasn't revealed to him yet and then as soon as she got into his presence she grabbed him by the robe you know basically made him come and raise the boy from the dead but because it was revealed to her you see if we could just realize the same God and Elijah and Elijah's and you and I the Lord Jesus Christ is present right here Hallelujah I'm just trying to find a find a place to close here amen you see these things are revealed and I trust that it's been revealed to you we don't have to back up for the devil but we're going to realize that the weapon we fight with is more than enough see the word of God conquers in every situation yeah every circumstance there's not a place that does not conquer it conquered in a furnace with the three Hebrew children it conquered in a in a whale's belly with Jonah amen because why Jonah took Jonah took God at his word because God answered Solomon's Prayer when he dedicated the temple saying if any man or woman looked towards his Temple and pray you'll hear from heaven so he looked by Faith remember he had looked he had to go beyond the barrier of the whale's belly he had to go beyond the barrier of the fact he fled from the presence of God his own the own condemnation and he had to go beyond the barrier of that many times when that condemnation hold us back go beyond the barrier of it amen he'd go beyond the barrier of that and look by face to the temple now he didn't know where it was but by faith he looked amen and so the word conquered there in the whale's belly amen the word conquered in the Lions then the word conquered with David and Goliath that was revealed to David that he could kill Goliath and so he killed it the rest of the army knew it could be done David it was revealed to it was a totally different thing amen at at conquered in Babylon with Daniel it conquered in the promised land the word conquered in Egypt with Moses amen and the word is conquered down through seven Church ages the word conquered heldith in the grave Hallelujah the word conquered in heaven when when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angels and kicked them out the word conquered but you see now the devil tries to get us think that his weapon actually has is a weapon or is actually a match for you for your weapon see this from greatest battle ever fought see his attack watch listen close and uh this closing has it his attack is what disbelieve God's word that's his attack there can you see the greatest battle was ever fought there's only two forces Satan God and what is Satan's weapon against you is to try and get you to disbelieve your weapon he disarms you now listen real close now listen if he can get you to disbelieve your weapon is equivalent if he gets you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough he has disarmed you we have to believe that our praise touch God we have to believe that his weapon is nothing our weapon conquers we have the greatest super weapon in existence the word of God it's greater than anything man can make greater than anything hell can devise is this word but you see if we think that our weapon's not strong enough see if we think see the devil doesn't actually have any power but deception he's nothing but a bluff that's all he is he has arrows but I mean he has a bow and no arrows he's nothing but a bluff but if we if we believe as Bluff then he's actually disarmed us right but if we Bluff his blood no call us Bluff thank you everyone if we call this Bluff he he's exposed amen so we're going to really put him in his place Hallelujah we are more than conquered I'm just going to read a few of these things man okay again he said I'll pray the father he'll send you another comforter what is the Holy Ghost he'll abide with you forever what is it the word God's artillery and the human being I like that Hallelujah God's artillery and the human being manifesting the resurrection think of it that great conqueror who conquered every sickness conquered every Superstition conquered every giant conquered everything that was to be conquered on Earth died conquered hell conquered death conquered the grave conquer the atmospheres ascended up on high came back in the form of the Holy Ghost and we are more than a conqueror through whom that loved us amen so we are more than you're more than a conqueror this morning not just the Conqueror you're more than a conqueror because the one who conquered all things is in you great is he that's in you that he is in the world greatest he that's in you that in that sickness or in that trouble whatever it is you've got to realize that he has already conquered that thing amen hallelujah amen no let's just I just want to let's just kick the devil a bit amen and ye are completing him this is one of my favorite parts of Colossians it's all good but I love this you ever feel down read this amen and ye are completing him I'm completing the Lord amen my identity who I am I'm completing him amen which is the head of all principality and power Hallelujah remember this is not a chess match between God and Satan this world is not a chess match no God's word is a bulldozer and he will fulfill his word he will bulldoze he bulldoze into Egypt got his children out he bulldozed in the promised land placed the people in the land amen when the Philistines came along and Goliath he bulldozed them down Hallelujah nothing could stop him and nothing will stop him and nothing can stop him amen we have record after testimony after testimony of God's Supernatural hand of Deliverance amen if you think God can't do it go read some testimonies Hallelujah amen amen okay and whom also ye are circumcise with a circumcision made without hands and the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ amen amen not you shall you are now not the future now buried with him and baptism ruin also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who has raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh how they quickened together with him having forgiven you all oh I like that word all that's three letters but it's powerful he doesn't say some he doesn't say most he doesn't say most and then he saved some for later to bring out against you know all all trespasses blotting out the handwriting of ordinances see we've got to realize God has dealt with everything we're going to realize is that with everything see the devil always tries to make us think yes this but not this you should have known better here but what about here you know Abraham laughed in the prince of God at the promise it wasn't just Sarah laughing Abraham laughed but God did not change his mind about him being the father of the faith God did not change his mind about well I guess I'll bring Isaac through someone else no God ordained Abraham and Sarah to bring the promised word of that day that's why in the Old Testament is all failures and trouble and problems in the believer's life and here we are we and we allow the devil to use it as a mallet and beat us on the head with it we're going to realize God has forgiven us all trespasses even last week yeah last week too Hallelujah if you confess it under the blood of Jesus Christ and then you and and then after that you bring it up before God God is looking through his record saying what are they talking about have you had someone talk to you and you just not connecting you just don't understand what they're going on about that's like God and us when the devil tries to remind us of our past and we and we ask for forgiveness all over again God's flicking God's doing searches he's getting his archive team there and you know their books blank what does it say in it pardoned that's all it says in their Book of Life Now pardoned what's a written in my own
