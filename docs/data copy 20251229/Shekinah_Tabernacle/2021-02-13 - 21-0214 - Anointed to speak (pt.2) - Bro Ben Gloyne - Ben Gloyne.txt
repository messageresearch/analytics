bless you trust jeremy pearl peter david i trust you spoiler real rotten today you know what to do amen praise the lord um if you want to just go to the scripture so um these next three sundays uh we're going to be away um so this coming sunday i'm officiating uh jimmy and stephanie's wedding in tauranga then the next sunday i'm gonna be speaking for brother moses up and fielding and then the following sunday after that i'm gonna preach with brother moses at brother alright's family camp so it just seemed to work out that way but yeah praise the lord i'm just thankful we've got plenty of gifts in the body amen it's not a one-man band praise the lord you can agree with me on that one i'm really thankful amen so praise the lord let's go too sorry i'm driving this now i mean we're just going to read a couple of scriptures here that we're going to go uh then then you can have your seat so i have them up on the board if you want to turn in the in the scripture to them that's fine so revelations 3 and 22 says here he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith under the churches and then in second corinthians 4 and 13 we having the same spirit of faith according that is is written i believed and therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak amen so may the lord bless his word this morning you may have your seats amen in his presence so i want to continue on from speaking last sunday to about being anointed to speak and you know this may be very elementary kind of a service but we need to say what the spirit says i mean we need to we need to god is looking for a response you know as as he would come to mary and martha before he rose lazarus he asked the question to to to mary or or to martha he said you know i am the resurrection and the life believeth thou this you know because god always wants to put out a question because he wants to see what our response is you know to see do we really believe what he's saying to us you know and and and she said yeah lord i believe that they are the christ that should come into the world so your god is always looking for a response back to him i mean he sends his word into the earth and then there's always uh you know he's looking for people to respond to that word and it's very important that we hear not only hear what the spirit says to the churches but we speak back what the spirit says to the church amen it's not it's not us changing what the spirit says but to repeat back basically back to god what he said to us amen it's very important you know it's very important that our lives aim in the word of god and i'd actually say it's vital that our lives amen not just with lip service but with it from your heart say amen amen it's essential that our hearts agree with the word and we speak what the spirit says now you know we know it was just a couple of just a couple of verses there but brother braham says it's not the size of the text but what's in the text that matters now we know through seven church ages uh after every address to the seven churches in the book of revelation that this this phrase to him he that hath an heir let him hear what the spirit says into the churches that is that is always given and and so that's showing that god would be speaking through seven church ages that you know that that the same spirit that inspired the prophets or inspired the your apostles to write the word would be speaking through a body down through the ages and so you know i'm so thankful that i'm looking at a people that we've been given an ear to hear what the spirit says amen that we're not just looking at a historical figure of 2000 years ago but that same jesus is alive today now hallelujah so so this um you know we might say you know so even in this even in this ladies and age the spirit is speaking to the church now this is vital that we hear what the spirit says now obviously well you might be looking at me rather blankly saying but i believe the message of the hour of course i'm listening to what the spirit says but we need to respond to that it means it's more than just absorbing something but you've got to respond back to god see god is god is brooding over the earth looking for people to say will you say what i say will you respond back to me yay lord i believe your promises for me amen so you know but you know so this there's two there's basically two powers at every age there's a there's god and there's the devil you can break down the devil to many different facets but it just boils down to two and i'll say that there are everyone is listening to a spirit in this day every single man woman and child upon the earth is listening to a spirit it's either an antichrist spirit which can be very religious or it can be the spirit of god there's only two and what we're being led by shows what the spirit that we're listening to so you say well you know we you know so we live in this ladies and gents lukewarm blind you know say you're rich increased with goods but you're wretched miserable blind naked don't even know it and you may say well but the bride is in a bright age and surely we are in a bright age we've been called up i mean into a bright age just as you know it's a you could say it's an age within an age so the world is still in ladies here but the bride is in a bright age where god has called us out we've heard his voice and we've come out to him and now we're in union with christ you know it's the same as you look at this modern era you know within the 21st century we had different eras there was the era of the airplane spacecraft the uh the nuclear age the internet age now or in this age but it's all within the same span of time just as today we are the bride is in a bright age but the world is still in ladies here now if if we're not careful the spirit of this world will make us blind that we will not see the promise of our age because what you're looking at you know many people are panicking there's going to be covert 20 or cover 21 or different viruses or economic collapse or whatever more and they you know and they and they begin to get worried about what's going to happen you know what's coming i'll say jesus is coming i mean that should be the main goal of our whole life as jesus is coming it doesn't matter about what else is coming upon the earth jesus is coming so we need to prepare for his coming amen hallelujah isn't that right you know people panic and they do all kinds of crazy stuff but jesus is coming what's the main focus of our lives should be the catching away the bride of christ hallelujah amen so it's very important there's such a bunch you know this two hundred thousand thousand demons released in this age that haven't been here before there's many different demon powers upon the earth everyone has a voice and it's speaking it's trying to get your attention it's trying to get your attention because it wants you to follow it but we've heard the voice of god in this day hallelujah now you got to look at this leads you is what's manifesting in your life so spiritually where you're going spiritually is what is actually leading you now samson started as an overcomer he started he was anointed he was actually birthed to the earth to defeat the philistines and free the children of god that was his purpose in life but he deviated from that path and the thing that he was called to overcome overcame him so now there's many spirits in this world there's many different spirits and if we're not careful if we pay heed to it those spirits will overcome us instead of us overcoming them amen as you know as we heard the what you know a real nice song yeah we're called to just walk on the devil that's our job description i mean but if we go beyond our calling to something else we'll end up like samson where instead of him overcoming the spirit of that age it overcame him we are called to be separate from the world right we may be living in this world being a witness to this world but we are not of this world i mean so we shouldn't speak like the world dress like the world act like the world be like the world we're separated people under god hallelujah god does the separating isn't that right amen so the very nation samson was made born to destroy he became a slave to and sadly that can happen to us where where the demon power that we have been ordained or born to overcome will make us formal lukewarm and powerless that's what the antichrist spirit does it doesn't make us necessarily not a believer it'll make us formal lukewarm and powerless i remember the bride of christ is not ordained to be formal lukewarm and powerless she's ordained to be full of the anointing overcoming made in his image conquering every devil that comes against her i mean standing on the neck of the enemy spiritual powers hallelujah overcoming all things that's what we're made to be amen now this you know we'll get through this i see some people are scared don't be scared i may look scary but i'm not scary okay please never get the idea i'm scary i'm really not i don't think i am i may need a reality but i'm really not scary hallelujah thank you amen anyway so the direction that our lives are going should be proved spiritually now i don't know i'm not talking about going through trials now i'm talking about with where are we going it should be proof of the spirit that's leading us now either the scripture tells us now here's a i just okay i'm just going to get this out of my system this is just how i feel now now i've got a remote now which i can i don't have to jump forward and back now brother brown tells a story in the uh in the sermon deceived church by the world that's a very powerful sermon and to me i always take everything he preaches i don't put it on someone else this is my walk with god you know i'm gonna stand i'm gonna stand before him one day and i can't say well this person did this and the world did this and this did this and this did this and this person said this and he'll say that's not an excuse what did you do with my word amen when you're upon the earth so he tells the story he says it reminds me of a little book i read one day in california about 10 years ago i picked it up in an old bookstore i forgot i forget who was the author just a little 10 sec book it had some good sense um a to it through though it seemed jokingly and cunningly but i found something in there that sounded like god to me and one of the little stories started out like this one morning in a great chicken pen there was a certain little rooster that thought he had all the knowledge that that was to be known so he flies up on a box and beat his little bill against the box four or five times threw back his little head and crowed like he never hurt a rooster crow and the others attracted their attention he said ladies and gentlemen this great of this of this chicken pen i would like to speak to you all this morning on some great educational program we have just designed said i have required a um a lot of knowledge in my studying as he pulled out his little glasses over his bill and he said i've decided that we chickens can can better ourselves by more knowledge therefore i can tell you that where if we dig and work in a certain pen or hole you'll find a certain vitamin that'll make us grow better prettier feathers and oh i can tell you how we can and better ourselves in many different ways now i'm not talking against education right now okay so get that out of your mind okay i'm not talking about i'm talking about spiritual your spiritual walk i'm not talking about go study if you want to study whatever but i'm not talking about against that i don't what about your spiritual walk see see i have decided that we can um so i'm going to begin from the beginning i've decided that we chickens can better ourselves by more knowledge therefore i can tell you that where if we dig in and work in a certain pen or whole we'll find a certain vitamin that'll make us uh grow better pretty our feathers and oh i can tell you how we can and better ourselves in many different ways and the little pulitz with their little red combs they just um cackled and said isn't here darling and they certainly admired him oh he's such a brilliant rooster reminds me of some of these seminary preachers such a brilliant man there's no need of us hanging around with the rest of the chickens we ought to go with him well before the little fellow got his speech finished there was another little chicken that didn't have such bright feathers come running in from the rest of the chicken yachts here boys just a minute i have heard the latest bulletin on the radio chickens went up four cents on the pound we're all going to the slaughter tomorrow what's good your knowledge is gonna do brother all the knowledge that we can accumulate what good does it do we're six foot of dirt we're all dying by inches and by minutes our knowledge means nothing we want to know him but they do that and even says in the sermon that that people are afraid of the new birth they will sidestep it in every way they will quote the prophet right they'll tell the scriptures right play the part just right but without a birth it all means nothing this is what this this is what this chicken's saying this chicken had some real sense he says what's the point of all this stuff and getting caught up in all this other stuff where we're all this world's gone to a tribulation right we're going to go in a rapture so what really matters amen i think there should be an urgency in this hour hallelujah there should be a real urgency in this hour amen that we are looking at the coming of the lord right now everything's everything's in place the beast has all his machinery in place to take over this earth it's all here hallelujah china's doing what it's ordained to do russia is doing what it's ordained to do amen and the bride of christ is in her position hallelujah you know the rapture is for the raptured now what does that mean a rapture means a catching away so those who are already caught away in god in his word will be raptured those who are not caught up in this word they're going to stay here where your affections are where your heart is that's where your treasures are so if your treasures are in this terra firma you're gonna stay in this terra firma upon this earth but if your treasures are in heaven that's where you're going hallelujah that may be awful blunt but that's just how it is the rapture is for the raptured god ain't taking no lukewarm believer he's taken those on fire who love him more than anything else hallelujah so i feel how yeah i feel like they're chicken the world's ending are we ready are we ready my heart's desire is that when the rapture goes every seat in this church will be vacant all of us are going that's that's my heart's desire we're all gonna make it we're not gonna leave one hoof behind it doesn't matter if that hoof is wayward somewhere a protocol they're coming back i mean they're gonna meet the lord jesus hallelujah that's my heart desire as we are all going hallelujah and god is present to make us ready hallelujah shouldn't be you know brother ram said people would say to him you scare the people to death talking about the coming of the lord he said it shouldn't scare you today that should be the most exciting thing upon the earth is we're going to be lifted up into glory in a moment a twinkling of an eye we're going to see the one that walked down the you know this way of suffering hallelujah hallelujah we're going to see him face to face amen that kind of thing should just thrill our souls soon and very soon we're going to see the king hallelujah so i just feel like that little rooster right today amen hallelujah scripture tells us that music is a very powerful tool the devil knows that real good he's not surprised at me saying that he knows it real well he was the worship leader in heaven he knows the power of music he knows the influence that it can exert and he uses it today very much you look at you look at every well not every but basically the vast majority of powerful videos on tick tock on instagram any social media has music in it because a spirit rides on music we don't sing for entertainment we sing that god comes down why do we sing at home that god comes down we don't sing to bring the devil into the room he's not welcome we don't sing songs that bring the devil we sing songs that the god would come down because you're you're calling a spirit when you sing you're either you're either calling hell or you're calling heaven who do you want in your play in your life i want heaven i want all that heaven is hallelujah i want nothing of hell i want all of heaven hallelujah and so brother brown identified this this is the message ashamed of him and that's the church we have authority by the resurrection of jesus christ and his promised word hallelujah the things that i do shall you do also more than this will you do for i go unto the father don't be ashamed of him in this generation sinful perplexed the last generation that will ever be on the earth as sinful adulteress full of petrified sores all everything that's been decent has become indecent national politics filth nations are broke up he says way back in the jungles of africa on safari hunters they had to take high-powered radios to hear elvis presley pat boone and them guys with that rock and roll and twist and the natives trying to see them act along jerking their head and acting like that the natives stood and looked at them but you see they're not americans like pat boone and elvis presley and ricky nelson and them guys are they're not judases of that type but see it's a spirit and the spirit is not only in america it has spread itself all over the world to bring them to the battle of armageddon this is happening right now where where the devil's using music to grab people and it's going to take and it's going to take them to one place the battle of armageddon but i could even say this we're all going to be at the battle of armageddon hallelujah because christ is going to come down in revelations 19 with a mighty host holy we're all going to be there you'll be on one side or another side i'd be on the lord's side because i read in the book he wins the battle hallelujah why pick the losing side you say well we don't listen to rock and roll that was the popular music genre of the day now it's gone to v basically every every different genre you want to name it's gone but as a spirit has gone into the world to to get the minds of people the spirits of people to take them to the battle of armageddon so you've got to be real careful what spirit you're listening to he says they act like that whether they whether whatever nation they come from africa india whatever it is that vulgar and stuff has spread all over the earth by just one man starting it and so has the gospel and the power of almighty god has spread around the world and the separation time is now taking place where god is calling a bride and the devil's calling a church let me be part of that bride hallelujah is the devil calling it church absolutely there'll be a time where that mannison sits in the temple of god as crowned hallelujah that's going to take place in in in physical form now with the devil's incarnate and a man and he'll be worshipped amen but at that time the bride is gone i want to be in the gone category hallelujah amen so it's a very powerful tool we want to be careful what we paid here to i heard a i heard a brother um he he preached on i can't uh the title of my wrong be to underlying symptoms he's from he's from south africa real powerful message and he said he talked about food but he went to spiritual things because you know covert a lot of people have underlying health cases when it came they get sick and unfortunately they pass on and but then spiritually we can have underlying symptoms and so he would um he would talk about these things and you know i thought it was real real powerful we've got to be careful what our underlying you know what's the underlying symptoms you know because either either will bring god or bring the devil complexes are different anyway you know different things but you gotta buddy but he said in that in the natural he says if you eat junk food you become junk yeah so we don't want to become junk spiritually we want to be organic free range past your feet hallelujah why he leads us into green pastures but besides still waters hallelujah amen now do i have this here i have this here now samuel would speak to saul and samuel said hath the lord as great delight and burnt offerings and sacrifices as obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fed of rams for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the lord thou hath also rejected thee from being from being king so so god spoke to him and said kill everything this is the story he did not speak back to the people what god told him he spoke something else because he was swayed by the popularity of the people and that's why we need to speak what the spirit says if he spoke what the spirit says this scripture would not be there but you see to be you know rebellious is a sin of witchcraft god is putting rebellion on the same category of witchcraft and we know witchcraft is basically communing with either devils or in the case of the witch of endor the dead so it's actually rebellion is actually listening to another spirit not the voice of god and even even you know and you know through the church ages we know we have it very much now but in the thytaran church age if i have it here no i don't have it here you know there's a complaint saying notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman jezebel which call herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my spirits to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols so there's a spirit antichrist spirit there that come to such a maturity in that age where people were listening to it and they are actually because they are listening because it wasn't god speaking to the church no more it was an antichrist spirit was now speaking through the church and the people were paying heed to that spirit and they began to speak what their spirit was telling them to speak we need to stay with the word we really need to stay with the word you know it's quite evident so god is speaking today he is and he is not speaking something that is outside of his word he cannot do that amen he will be speaking what his word has already declared and it will be the word manifested for the day in which we live now we know christ in every age is messiah you're going to receive that word and that's you receiving the messiah may the word is the messiah many people just attribute him to being 2000 years ago dying on a cross which he did for us but you must receive the word for your day to receive the benefits of calvary the full benefits of calvary because christ manifests himself in every age and the people of that age must receive him in that age you're following me you know what good would it be to do if you're following john the baptist there's christ and john the baptist preaching but then when jesus came along you rejected him saying no i'm a follower of john the baptist no you god moved on it was the same god but a different form doing a different thing right working out his plan of redemption the scribes and pharisees would say to jesus we are moses disciples and because and they could say this because of tradition and culture that's the only reason they could say they were moses disciples they were raised in a certain culture the culture was jehovah god is the god of israel moses was his prophet he gave us the first five books of the bible so we can say we are moses disciples out of tradition but it was not out of revelation because if it was out of revelation then they would have seen the one that spoke through moses was now in flesh and they would have been following jesus but because they could not see him as god and turned him down they were just following a historical god they were not listening or speaking what the spirit was saying to the church at that time they would not receive the word that was made flesh in their day this is in john 1 and 12 as many as received him to him gave you power to become the sons of god even them that believe on his name they did not receive him so they did not receive that power to come into sonship because they rejected the word for their day so it's the same thing in our day if we receive the word remember he's he's spoken to this generation hallelujah and now he's looking for a response for you and i and we should just be from our hearts amen i take this message i take you at your word you know i was thinking you know we need to receive the message in the same inspiration it was given so the same anointing that came upon the prophet to speak the mysteries of god should be the same anointing that comes upon us that we can receive it hallelujah amen jesus himself would say he would say in john 6 he says he says it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak and do they are spirit and they are life i mean to the words that he was speaking there was life coming forth in that word but they could not receive his sayings they could not receive his words they did not receive the life we need to see the life of christ amen we need to speak what the spirit says now it says in revelations 22 and 17 and the spirit and the bride say come why they're saying the same thing they're not saying a different thing hallelujah this may be very simple but i trust it it means something to me amen and him that heareth say come yeah so we've heard so now we're going to speak we've heard him call and now we're calling because the same spirit that made the made the call now is in us and now we make the call amen we should be saying what the spirit says now it says in romans 8 for as many are as led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear this is not the anointing we have received i mean we should not be fearful in this hour we should be rejoicing full of confidence hallelujah we should be so happy in spite of situation remember we don't worship god because of situation we we worship god because of who he is and what he has done that's why we worship him do we not amen that's why we're christians because of who he is holy you know modern christianity is all about well i'm the pursued one he's after me and it's all about me no it's all about him it's all about what he does is the important thing but man has turned christianity it's all about the worshipper and not the worshipped amen but it's all about the worshipped about god himself you understand what i'm saying they actually turn around instead of worshiping god it's all about me and what and and my current state it should all be about him and what he's done in our lives that's the important thing hey he's he's redeemed us he's washed our sins away yeah he tells us in his word him them is called he is justified and we should say amen and that he is also justified he is already glorified something i should say amen holy he's washed all our sins away he's took in our book our first book amen that was held against us now that to his cross washed it away made us new creatures in him we should something i should say amen we're more than conquerors amen hallelujah if he's declared something he's going to fulfill it hallelujah amen it's not up to you and i it's up to him amen so we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but we have received the spirit of adoption where we cry abba father we know who our father is we know who our real father is and that's why i can say look at the family of god we just have family reunions twice a week not not once a year twice a week hallelujah if we have campus yo over a long weekend you know but this is just family reunion time you go you go around the world somewhere someone who knows the same god the same message you do it's a family reunion and you meet them it's like i've known you before somewhere why in the mind of god were you hallelujah we are known amen the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of gods there's got to be something in a set of greece with his spirit that we are his children now to bear witness with it means to testify jointly it means to you know it means to um corroborate with so you're giving the same um evidence you're giving the same testimony because what you're saying what the spirit's saying is the same thing hallelujah that's how we should be there should be a witness it shouldn't be a jarring when you hear the word should be amen even if it takes you you know takes literal height off your back should be amen hallelujah why because it's doing us good now he says we've got to have the token this is from the token message i think it's in 1964 one and when the token comes it testifies of christ he said it would and christ is the word and how can you deny the bible is true part of it and still say you have the token when the token is the testimony of jesus christ pardon me see there is what i wonder oh say i don't believe i believe the days of miracles oh look out there's no token there the token punctuates every word with an amen everything because it's god itself see all right but if the token is not there the covenant was in not effect it was a null same now no matter how much you say how much you'd say i believe every word in the bible say brother braham i can quote you half of that bible and all the bible by heart i believe every bit of it that's good satan does too uh-huh it takes the token hallelujah you know my my phone cannot quote me and this can out and this can quote the message and the bible in multiple languages that i know nothing about but this is not going in a rapture this will be left behind he is not taking message books in a rapture he's not taking your search program in a rapture or your bibles your concordances they're going to stay upon the earth he's taking a people that are living his word is manifested in their lives he's taking parts of himself up into glory hallelujah so it's very important to receive the word for your day now we can see this very um simply when we go to uh the story of of um caleb and joshua when when uh israel is at cadiz barnea so i don't have it on here either yeah i changed my notes it's kind of bit you know you make a slideshow but you change everything and here we are yeah but you know it's amazing when you think about it where where god would tell abraham your seed is going to go to a strange land we all know this very well but we're just going to rehearse some things you know your seat is going to be in a strange land 400 years they're going to be afflicted but but but also that nation whom they shall serve will i judge and afterwards they shall come out with great substance so they're going to be there about yeah 400 years then they're going to come out rich now what happened when israel was in a strange land they reflected 400 years then moses came to bring them out and and the night they were going out the egyptians gave all their gold all their stuff take everything just just be gone so they left with great substance so it was fulfilled exactly as it was prophesied now so if they could just take that and say well if god brought us thus far because what would have been the story around the campfire or maybe in their houses before moses came to egypt children it's nearly 400 years daddy are we gonna ever gonna be out of this bondage yes son how's it gonna happen well our father abraham told us there's gonna be a delivery gonna come he said we'd be down here and we've been down here about 400 years and there's going to be deliverance going to come and god himself is going to judge egypt what happened as egypt got judged hallelujah you look at the accuracy of the scripture it's a very accurate thing amen and you know and so and so you know a deliverer is going to come this nation is going to be judged and we're going to walk out with great substance but we're you know we're slaves we have nothing i don't well how's it going to work i don't know son but we're going to walk out with great substance how are we ever gonna be delivered out of this world power i don't know son but the word says it's gonna happen and what happened the word was fulfilled moses came i mean judgment came upon egypt and then they walked out with great substance so think it would be very important if god took them that far then god was going to take them all the way because that wasn't the whole promise the whole promise was they were going to go into the promised land drive out and destroy all the inhabitants of the land and they were going to dwell in their inheritance that was the promise of the hour but they did not speak what the spirit said the ten spies two of them did twelve spies two against ten you know two against ten only two echoed back what the spirit said only two caleb and joshua they said we've seen the land it's a good land it's amazing you think about this here they come packing grapes a cluster of grapes yay big two men are packing it here's the fruit of the land taste the grape they hadn't tasted a grape maybe the older generation did but you know the young ones what's that those that are born in the wilderness what's that it's a grape i heard about that what's it like taste the fruit of the new land you're gonna go live by this hallelujah as the same thing with you and i the holy ghost comes down this word comes forth well we're tasting the evidence of the new land hallelujah of our eternal home god comes down he says feed on this word feed on this this is what it tastes like this is the experience of it and they're literally chewing on these grapes the evidence of the new land and ten spies say yep it's a good land it's wonderful look we're you know you're eating this grape or maybe two you know it depends how many you can grab maybe but then he says but then they say nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great moreover we saw the children of anak there so they're beginning to speak so initially they are saying what the spirit has said but then because their own reasoning comes in that they are not speaking what the spirit has already spoken so now they are putting in their first first um you know opinions eight here scripture and their opinion is we cannot take the land so they were agreeing with what the spirit said but now they're speaking something different but caleb stilled the people before moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are able to overcome it what was caleb doing he was speaking back to god because the spirit the lord had told them the holy ghost had told them you are going into the land you are going to possess it you're going to be in your position you're in your inheritance and caleb is just echoing back to god what god had told them hallelujah and it's very vital we do the same thing hallelujah amen but we know the rest of the story the other 10 spy said we're not able to go up against it we can't they're stronger than we that wasn't the promise of god see we see the challenge comes is now when we are part of the fulfillment it's easy to say god sent a prophet in this age amen the pillar of fire is here again amen jesus christ is hearing his people amen but then now when it comes to you and i my mind the bride is being called it's easy to talk about a prophet what about what the bride is mean to do in this day and now what about the fulfillment of the scripture the prophet said that as jesus fulfilled the old testament the bride will fulfill the new testament amen i'll say we are more than able to fulfill the promise of god for our lives how we are more than able because he is the one who enables us to do the job hallelujah amen you know jesus jesus we know he was he was the god man he was fully god but he was fully man but he he had to as a man agree with what the scripture said about him he had to come into agreement with the scripture you know i'd say in luke 9 now do i have this on here we'll get there one day here we are jesus is there with the you know peter james and john drop what we call mount transfiguration and moses and elijah appeared to him and they began to preach to him of his decrees and what he should accomplish at jerusalem so here is here is the one here is the lamb of god that will take away the sin of the world and these two have been called they've been given the job to preach to the word what the word says about the word and what he had to accomplish remember all of creation hung on one man the outcome of all creation will it be redeemed back to adam's fallen race or just stay under the power of the devil forever there was not another lamb coming it was the only one amen he was the one in shadow of the passover and different shadows to the old testament here was the fulfillment of this of this and here he is standing there and pete and and and moses and elijah are standing and telling him what he is going to fulfill now i don't believe it just would you know it would not have been just a nice thought many times we take a sermon as just a nice thought but god is trying to put something across to us that will change our lives and so i doubt very much they talked about the weather they talked about the current state of the world but they were talking about the scripture that he had to fulfill and they begin to preach to him you are the lamb of god they'll take away the sin of the world john the baptist told you that amen you are you are to fulfill genesis 3 being the seed of the woman that will crush your bruise ahead of the seed of the serpent you will be wounded for our transgressions quoting isaiah 53 you will you will be wounded for our transgressions the chastisement of our peace will be upon you and by your stripes who will be healed hallelujah because they needed just under the blood of bulls and goats they were forgiven but the sin was just covered they needed a a real blood to come to wipe away the debt completely so they were looking at him to fulfill that for them hallelujah amen you will you will fulfill psalms 22 my god my god why is that forsaken me you will fulfill that but he had to agree with the word concerning himself he had to believe what they were telling him well you say that's easy he's jesus he was still a man amen now he did not have unbelief he did not have that battle but still he had to believe the scripture brother brahm says that he went to he went to the tomb he went to the cross with one scripture promise that he'll come out of the grave i'll not leave my holy i'll not suffer my holy one yeah i'll not leave my his soul in hell nor suffer thy holy one to see corruption that was the one scripture he went to calvary with knowing that he was going to come out of the tomb he had to believe that scripture concerning himself no one else had done it before but he was going to fulfill it hallelujah so he had to agree with the word that was concerning him amen psalms 16 and 9 therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth my flesh shall also rest in hope for thou shalt will not leave my soul in hell neither will thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption that's what he went to calvary worth now we have a word to fulfill we're here to do a job we're not here just to float through life we're here to listen to what the spirit says to the church and then speak it back and manifest it brother ram says in the masterpiece 1964. now for nearly 2000 years god has been making him a masterpiece because he struck adam to get a piece off of him part of him a rib to make a wife for him and now that perfect masterpiece that he struck at calvary he got a piece off of him it's just the new testament that's all he fulfilled the old testament now it's the new testament another piece to be fulfilled the old and newest husband and wife see and it taken uh the old two four to four show the new christ come the masterpiece to fulfill that speak of the old testament now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the new testament another masterpiece in making i'm talking about you by the way i'm not talking about someone else i'm talking about you we're here to fulfill the new testament hey if someone's going to take a rapture here i am i don't know about everyone else but here i am enoch had a walk with god and and god said you want to come a bit higher one day he didn't say what about everyone else it's not recorded he just god just took him and that should be our walk in this world i'm walking with god hallelujah and god's going to take me one day that's my focus though misunderstood maybe he was though rejected maybe he was he just walked with god hallelujah that's how we should be in this hour hallelujah let's just walk with god amen now the apostle paul would speak saying seeing we have we are also encompassed with so greater cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us you know there's so many names written in the lamb's book of life when the last one is dipped in blood we're out what if we found that last one what if that became our life's ambition now i'm not saying i'm not saying forsake having children a job or a career no no do all those things but what if our soul our main ambition in life was i want to find the last one i want to go home shouldn't that be our drive of our life lord jesus hallelujah we want to get out of here the world tries to make it very comfortable to stay but we are not ordained to stay we're ordained to go amen and this should be our focus of our life should be lord prepare me to leave amen hallelujah amen we have received a kingdom that cannot be shaken it says in hebrews 12 see ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven this earth this whole world has been shaken the powers of heaven have been shown everything has been shaken in this day you can see the world we live in you think civilization the highest form of civilization should have no crime right should have no divorce should have no trouble shouldn't need a police force should look after the old and the unborn that should be civilization everyone lives in peace do we have that upon the earth no because it's shaken it's falling apart hallelujah that's because it says everything that can be shaken he says and this word yet once more signified the removing of the of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain wherefore we're receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear now this word receiving part of the definition is to receive something that's transmitted how shall we receive a kingdom because jesus would say the kingdom of god is within you i mean so this kingdom we have received it's been transmitted down into our souls hallelujah because jesus says the words i speak to you that are spirit and they are life i mean so now the spirit of god goes upon the word of a prophet and it's transmitted that kingdom is transmitted into you and i i mean that we cannot be shaken glory should that make us happy you know i'm about to close that make us happier maybe you know but we are living in an uncertain time but this gospel is certain hallelujah faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god this is why this message of spoken word is so important because it's transmitting a kingdom amen our lord jesus is spoken word he was spoken through the mouth of a prophet and then those who receive it echoed back to god saying amen hallelujah and they see that word putting on flesh in their lives hallelujah you know brother brown tells a story about a about an eagle as the eagle stir with her nest and he he begins to speak about you know that there comes a certain age where where where mama eagle doesn't want her babies in the nest anymore she wants them to fly because she's looking down at them and she knows the same life and the same power and the same ability is in them she didn't raise chickens she didn't raise buzzards she rose eagles she raised eagles she birthed eagles that are exactly the same in her in power inability in strength everything she is they are by birth and our new birth has made us like christ hallelujah so now she comes to a place where she has to stir up the nest to get them to fly because she wants them to see the power that's in her is in them you know you think about a little eagle other than this you know they watch mama way up in the heavens and they're looking up and they see her just swoop down with great power puts out her great big wings and just lands on the nest no doubt they're you know just just just amazed by it aren't you amazed by it and they see mum with a big 14 foot some some some eagle wingspans big giant wings and and she just rests down on the nest and they're thinking that's so amazing mama you're so amazing hallelujah but she wants them to realize you're built like me you're not built to stay in the nest you're built to fly in the heavenlies with me hallelujah and now there's so there comes a time when the when the nest gets stirred up where all the because what happens is an eagle will take things that are soft and nice and lines the nest with say animal skins or brunt your leaves and different things and lines the nest it's nice and soft so when the eagles are hatched they've got a nice soft place to live but then there comes a time where the eagle stirs the nest and takes all the soft things and throws it out and maybe the babies are sitting here saying mama that was my favorite rabbit skin why are you taking this comfort from me but mama's in her mind saying boy you're gonna fly you can't stay here no more you're not built to be in a nest you're built to be heaven-bound you're built i mean to fly like me so she begins tearing those things out and they think mama what are you doing mama sometimes we ask god i don't understand he wants us to fly he wants us to soar up in the heavenlies with him hallelujah so now here they are and then and then what happens is where once we're soft and comfortable it becomes lots of thorns and stickers in there and they stand on something again and it gets uncomfortable and brother ram says it's like us when you begin to testify and people and people kick back against it what's that that's a thorn that's a hard place where it used to be soft and wonderful there's rejection comes and all that hurts that pricks in amen but then but then he begins shipping as a flapper great big wings to blow out all the loose feathers because she's preparing them to fly friends we're going to fly so fast one day we're going to be twinkling we're going to be gone hallelujah we're going to be gone before anyone knows we're gone where did they go well they're just gone hallelujah and we're preparing for that flight you take a space shuttle i'll come back to you you take a space shuttle there's so many checks you know the craft is as as well carefully to the launch pad and and all the engineers check it over is it built right there can be one thing loose it'll make the whole thing blow up which we've seen unfortunately in history one little valve one little thing loose the thing just blows up as it goes up so the engineers check it over is this correct is this right and then they begin to fill it up and as the tanks are being filled they check if that's all right and they check all the gauges and this is why we come to church we're filling up for a flight fuel for a flight hallelujah it's not it's not rocket propellant this is holy ghost power amen but then our gauges need to be checked is our love gauge on full as our malice on zero as our unforgiveness on zero as our long suffering on full as our patience on full amen as our you know as our faith on full hallelujah that's our gauges should be ready and now here we are and the astronauts come out they sit in this great big thing they're not flying anything they just sit there hallelujah and here we are in this gospel rocket what are you going to do just put on the space suit put on the lord jesus christ put on this word sit back hallelujah and and get ready for blast off remember brother brown says we're in the countdown and it's to center from from 543-210 it's gone from seven down to all one to seven and we're in the seven of you know ladies and gentle talk about the countdown he says we are spiritual um astronauts in this age however that we go beyond the atmosphere of this world and we dwelling around this totally foreign to this world hallelujah so here they are sitting in there who's watching launch anyone watch the launch the asteroids just sit there but then finally and they check the weather above is the atmosphere right is it is it clear not much wind just the sun shining everything's fine or is it the gloomy clouds of unbelief and hatred malice strife if that's hanging over someone you can't fly god's got to get it god's got to get rid of it so there so there they are then the countdown happens because the engineers have checked the ship you know this this this gospel i'll just tell you this rocket ship that we're in can't bust it can't break it's not going to blow up on oh now exit out of the world the master engineer has built it the lord jesus amen he's checked it over he knows it works why because he already had a couple of astronauts go elijah went hallelujah he went on the same rocket ship hallelujah and he made it hallelujah amen jesus went up into glory himself he took the same flight himself it worked hallelujah so this is why we come to church fuel for the flight this is why we listen to the message fuel for the flight why because our focus is on i'm going to heaven hallelujah so now mama comes down and begins to stir the nest and begins to shake her big wings hallelujah and then it's the only thing i tell you is god is just getting ready he says as the old eagle stands there she fans the feathers all out of it oh brother what a time then the next thing she does she gets in there and takes out all those little little sheepskins and things that she stuck down in that nest takes her beak and throws them over the hill she's determined they're not gonna be chickens she's gonna she's going to make that nest so miserable for them that they have to get out i'm going through a hard patch hallelujah god is just stirring the nest it's working for you hallelujah hallelujah amen they have to get out so then we have you standing on thorns every time you sit down it's a thorn ever it's a thorn everywhere you stop it's a thorn god does that for a purpose the old eagle wants to make them that way and did you notice when the rushing when the mighty rushing wind hits you you begin to glorify god every hit was a thorn you thought that your testimony would burn the world up and as soon as you told your best friend he said hi you went to see the holy roller haven't you a thorn get ready you got to take a ride that's the only thing i can tell you god's just making you ready get over to the past and say pastor last night i was speaking all at once something happened to me my life has changed i feel different now here don't you go to stretching that around the church another thorn he makes the nest so miserable till you have to get out you can't take it anymore because you don't you can't take that it shows you what i mean you can't take that that shows you wasn't eagle to begin with then after a while when he gets all gets them all dissatisfied then the old mother eagle comes up to the nest and you know really the little eagle hasn't seen this uh what size bird his mummy is so she gets the nest you ought to see a real drama she gets out of the nest and she goes to cooing to them going to them in an eagle voice oh that sounds good then she stretches out her big wings see how big i am and then little fellas we're going to say oh mama what a great great bird you are now some of them them eagles stretch 14 feet across wing to wing spread they can carry a calf and pack it away and that little eagle never realized what her mother had until he began to look on her and she began to show her power human our mama eagles older new testament hallelujah and many times we have never realized the power contained in the word hallelujah but then when she when we begin to realize the power that he has amen why god is preparing us for a flight hallelujah when when when she begin to show her power see when god begins to show his power to you hallelujah god is preparing you for a flight amen when you see the word begin to manifest in your life when you say it's more than in gone paper more than traditions more than more than just a prophet's message but you hear the voice behind the voice speaking to you begin to realize mama you're real powerful oh jehovah god you're real powerful amen you're the most powerful one there's ever been and ever will be as out as our lord jesus hello but he wins to show us the power in his word why because we're about to take a flight hallelujah but why but but why is this all done as i said the reason is that that mama eagle wants his her children to realize the same power and ability and life is in them how loose is the word spreads forth you see how powerful it is who's seen it hallelujah it's delivered many it saved many legion wasn't wasn't too hard for god all the same cases aren't too difficult for god today amen he saves the unlikely he saves the brokenhearted amen he sets the captives free opens the eyes of the blind holly to see where they're going hallelujah we know where we're going don't we i trust that you have caught a glimpse of your heavenly home that it's more than a story but it's a reality i mean it's soon and very soon we're gonna see the king amen and our whole life should be guided by that one thing amen as moses was told you're gonna come back to this mountain of worship again uh he was fixed i'm going to go down to egypt i'm going to get the children of israel out then we're going to return to this mountain although we've been in a place we may not may not have remembered it because we're in the mind of god but now where his attributes expressed on the earth and something within us says we're going to go home hallelujah this ain't no pie in the sky there's reality i remember mama eagle wants her children to know the same power and ability the same life that's in her is in them as the same thing with this word hallelujah it wants you to know the same life by the baptism of the holy ghost the same life that was in jesus christ is in you the same anointing that was what the prophet is in you it means to the same power the same authority hallelujah god sent the prophet to the earth to prove this is the power of the cross this is what my blood achieves i mean that nothing will stand before you the angel said nothing will stand before your prayers and he actually asked the question not even cancer not even cancer why because cancer was the biggest problem of the age harley says that so so he was told nothing in this world will stand before your prayers if you can get the people to believe you i say we're believers aren't we we believe this message we believe the word of god it's true amen if it brought us out of the world just like it brought egypt you know you know the israelites should have you know caleb and them the spy should have thought hold on let's just take stock let's take stock children so the prophecy said i'm just repeating what i said before but we're going to think about this the prophecy said we'd be there 400 years how long were we there about 400 years the prophecy said that that that nation is going to be judged what happened to egypt well i don't need to say anything because you're there you sort yeah they got judged and the prophecy said we'll come out with great substance what is where's all this bling now we've got where do we get it from and the prophecy says we're going to go in and take this land irrespective of what's in there hallelujah if they were speaking that way they would have been speaking what the spirit said they are just echoing it back to god but they didn't take stock their reasoning overrode the word of god for them that's the same thing for you and i we've got a rapture to take this message has been sent to bills in the statue of the perfect man to be made in his very image where god sees brother abraham says that that jesus is the messiah and he says the bride is the messiah amen as he is anointed the word we are their word anointed as well that's what he said hallelujah that's what i said we are and i believe it hallelujah amen so if he said we would overcome see this is this is a good way you know our lord jesus is the high priest of our profession right if we speak back to god his promises he can act upon those promises in our life if we speak negative we'll that's just all we'll be but if we speak positive irrespective of condition remember caleb had the sleigh same same slave marks and you know things in his body as the other spies joshua the same but they didn't take that into consideration they just said we're going to take this land doesn't matter our situation our condition it doesn't matter hallelujah so the lord wants us to have the same experience of the same life the same faith that was in him as in you and i amen because that word that he has spoken has been placed by faith in you and i amen this is the hour of sonship i'm just going to throw some phrases out there but you know this is the hour of sonship this is what the word has told us that nature is groaning and in travail that's why the world's falling apart nature itself is groaning and travailed why because there's birth pains come upon the earth because a new earth is going to be birthed how a new age is going to be birth the millennium is going to be birthed amen brother brown preached birth pains the church is going to bring forth hallelujah we're we happen to be living in the hour of the manifestation of it i mean so this is the hour of sonship this is what the word has told us that that now would be the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god you know i always think of where john said now we are the sons of god right now i say oh god the inspiration that struck him to write that may it strike us to recognize we are the sons and daughters of god right now i mean that means all the devil's works are going to be under our feet right now all the devices of him gonna be under our feet right now no weapon formed against us shall prosper right now aim into the same power those in the mouth of adam hollio to speak the power the spoken word to move things around and take control and dominion is in us right now amen hallelujah amen this is the other full manifestation of the sons of god this is the hour of the breaking of every cycle hallelujah this is the hour where the cycle of death is gonna break amen this is the hour why because there's a people upon the earth i believe i'm looking at them i trust there's something in you says that's me holy that is not gonna taste death but they're gonna step from this world and a glorified body into the next world hallelujah there's a cycle going to be broken this is the hour that cycle will be broken this is the hour where every family trait cycle will be broken if you want it to be broken it can be broken doesn't matter if it's been in your family if your last name means basically temper hallelujah and the reason your forebear was named that because he had attempted to fight a buzzer and you've got their last name there's a power in this room in this word right now that can break that off of your life hallelujah if you want it to be broken off your life amen unforgiveness whatever it may be there is a power in this word to break every single cycle of family spirits tradition whatever it is there's a power in this world because god wants a bride made in his image hallelujah made in his image as where he looks us he sees the word made flesh you know what he's going to see one day he's going to look down i believe he's looking at us in this way right now i just see i see me in a people i see my attributes it's not potential no more it's reality and i just can't stand i've got to take them home holy i just got to take them home to be with me hallelujah this is the hour where the devil's been exposed all of his tricks have been exposed hallelujah this is the hour where the dead in christ erased you know the rapture the cycle of the rapture of the of the of the shout the voice and the trumpet brother brown says the message is the shout he made it real clear the message is the shout so we don't need another shout out so the voice of god has already spoken so now the second part of the rapture cycle is the voice of the archangel that's not another ministry to come upon the earth that's actually a life that's coming to a bride that will literally bring the dead in christ from the grave you take it in the natural and i probably say this bef well many times before but you take a harvest season you see grain you see wheat that's grown in a field the farmer what dictates the harvest is the condition of the wheat hallelujah it's not the farmer deciding well it's thursday i might as well go harvest my crop no no he looks out upon that crop and because he has the mind of a farmer he knows that's harvest condition so the life the life in the field brother and preacher is the rising of the sun to me it's more than a sermon where he says that that wave chief offering the life of christ is waved in front of the people i mean because god is declaring that there's more in the field just like this hello so the life that was in the prophet was waved hallelujah in front of us and god is actually saying you see this that's being waved over you you'll become that same life will come into you and manifest the same word hallelujah so now it's actually the life in the grain that cries to the farmer harvest me i'm ready the sunshine has been what yo yo you're ripening me that all the greenness is gone so it's actually a life that's calling forth hallelujah and that life will call the dead in christ from the grave hallelujah that's why we've got to listen to what the spirit says keep walking with the voice amen hallelujah that's what we should do it's more than a message it's more than a collection of sermons it is jesus christ revealed today hallelujah it's more than a nice idea it's more than a religion it's jesus christ made known today hallelujah and he has called you and i he's spoken to us you're my bride there should be something to say yes lord yes i love you more than anything else there should be something to say yes lord i love you more than everything else too through such a love affair that his word takes preeminence over our lives above what we think in our own humanity hallelujah look so take heed to the voice of god we should speak i'll just finish with what i started with we should repeat back to god what he has already spoken not with our own human interpretation anything we say yes lord you declared it thus amen hallelujah let's have the musicians i mean this morning amen mary did the same thing god spoke through the angel gabriel to her you're gonna have the promise son jesus echo back let it be unto me according to thy word hallelujah amen i mean they stand this morning i mean i want to sing beulah land i'm kind of homesick for our country who wants to go let's not put our roots down too deep here amen get all the career you can job money whatever whatever but the main thing is we're going home hallelujah wouldn't it be good if this was the year wouldn't it be good if the see the loved ones that have gone on you see someone who's 18 or 21 age and they speak something to you and your eyes come open because we've been anointed with isab that we can see we're not blind like the world hallelujah we can see where we're going what's going on imagine if they said you the rapture's on is that you brother so-and-so and there's something in you you don't need to ask you know hallelujah and then these bodies have changed before you realize that we're caught up to meet him in the air i'm looking forward to that moment aren't you hallelujah amen
