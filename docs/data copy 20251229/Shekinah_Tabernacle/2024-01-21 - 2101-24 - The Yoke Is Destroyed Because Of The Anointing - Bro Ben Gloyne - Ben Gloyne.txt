every baby dedication special but we got a very special one this morning amen so B Maggie you want to bring up little Gabriel Here amen as they come should we sing bring them in bring the little ones

Miracles right here hallelujah amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen Isn't Our God tremendous amen amen amen praise the Lord we're here amen finally here amen you know humanly we might not have been here but God had other ideas amen and brother Braham says you know the devil can't take you until your purpose is done so you both Gabriel's got a purpose Maggie's got a purpose Ben you've got a purpose Amen to express the Lord amen so we're here to dedicate Gabriel Jesse Bailey to the Lord Jesus Christ you know as we know on the scripture there's no record of infant baptism or anything like that they just brought their little ones to the Lord Jesus and and he and he blessed them so that's what we want to do amen this morning and um I love he's got a powerful name you've given a real powerful name amen Gabriel means a so it's a compound uh word and it's it means a valiant man or Warrior and the strength of the almighty my amen I pray he lives out all these names it's very powerful amen and and when I I was looking at this um the scripture came to mind from Daniel chapter 8 where Daniel said and it came to pass when I even I Daniel had seen the vision and sought for the meaning then behold they stood before me as the appearance of a man and I heard a man's voice between the banks of U which said uh which called and said Gabriel make this man to understand the vision and I pray that Gabriel as he grows older that people would see him because many people won't read a Bible but they'll read our lives so I pray when he when he gets older you know he'll be such a testimony I believe he's already been a testimony amen that that people would understand the Bible and understand the mercy of God and His grace and his love through his life amen so his life will cause people to understand the vision of the word and we know Jesse it means God's gift or the Lord exists or King so I pray he is God's gift to you amen I think the doctor said you couldn't even have babies eh well here we are amen here he is amen so he's truly God's gift and I pray his life would just shout out the Lord exists he's alive you can meet him he's the same yesterday today forever and Bailey I thought is a very special name the surname Bailey is English in origin it's coming from the anglio French word which means a baia or to deliver Bailey is an occupational surname used most prevalently as a description of a BFF or a steward less less often Bailey sometimes could also be attached to those who live near a castle or a stronghold and a Bailey used to be an oldfashioned Castle there a mountain Bailey it's called so I pray he would he would live out that he would deliver amen the Lord through him would deliver many souls to the kingdom of God and it's an occupational Sur name so I pray that it wouldn't be it would be an OCC it would be a way of life for him Amen to to manifest the Lord Jesus Christ amen as he grows and as he gets older amen so can I can I hold him amen sleeping like an angel amen amen hallelujah let's bow our head shall we gracious father Lord we hold your gift here Lord Jesus little Gabriel father Gabriel Jesse Bailey Lord as we dedicate him into your care Lord into a life of love and service Lord to walk with you Lord you've brought them through many dangers toils and snares already Lord but father you've prevailed over them all dear God and I pray father as he grows Lord Jesus as he Lord may he know your presence even now dear God father may he know your voice Lord Jesus and may you live through him Lord and may you be the Overcomer in his life dear God and I pray father he'd be very strong and Valiant Lord in the power of your Holy Spirit in the power of the almighty oh God and Father through his life may many come to Deliverance Lord Jesus May many know you Lord in the power of your Resurrection Lord I want to dedicate him Lord Margie and Ben as they raise him as well father Lord to love and fear you and walk with you in the name of

got M on and Josh speaking and me if time allows so praise the lord we got a full day amen so let's just uh take the scripture this morning and we're going to go to um Isaiah 10 and verse 27 then we're going to so I don't have a slideshow today so it's kind of an oldfashioned time um and then we're going to go to Ezekiel chapter 28 it was nice here with uh Isaiah 27 because I was looking how to um tie the uh sermon all together I'd been uh just preparing during the week and then after that tremendous outpouring we had on Wednesday night I know it's not on the recording but at the end after prayer and amen you know um um the Lord spoke to Christine's heart this scripture and I thought this just you'll see B tied together so Isaiah 20 10 and verse 27 um says here and it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken from off thy shoulder and his yoke off thy neck and the Yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing amen so it's the anointing that breaks the Yoke of the enemy amen and then we're going to go to Ezekiel chapter 28 we're going to read verses 12-6 so we're just going to talk about this um the breaking of the Yoke by the anointing first we're going to talk about the the the Yoke and how the Devil comes in we got to study our opponent amen we're in a we're in a battle right so Ezekiel 28:12 says here son of man take up a lamentation upon upon the king of Tyrus and say unto him thus sayith the Lord God thou Sealth up the Su full of wisdom and perfect and Beauty thou H has been an Eden the Garden of God every precious stone was thy covering the Sardis the topaz the diamond the barrel the ANS The Jasper the sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle and gold the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created Thou Art the anointed cherub that coverthe set thee so thou was upon the holy mountain of God and thou Hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created until iniquity was found in the yeah by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the um midst of thee with violence and thou Hast sinned therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the Mountain of God and I'll destroy thee Oh covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire amen we're just going to finish reading there this is talking we know he's talking about the anointing on on the king of tyus here so let's just bow heads in a word of prayer you want to be remembered in pray you want to slip up your hand to the Lord just defy gravity this morning say Lord I have a need gracious father we so thankful Lord we can sing Lord out of our hearts we love you Lord because you first loved us dear God we want to thank you as we bow our heads in your presence we just come before you Lord not by our own abilities or anything we could ever do but because of your blood Lord we come into your courts we come into your presence we come before your throne of grace Lord we're asking that may you Lord Jesus open the fountain Lord of Grace and may it pour upon us our god of your great holy presence Lord Jesus May touch each life dear God father as we have read your word Lord we need we need you the great author once again to come and make it live Lord may you may you manifest it in our hearts Lord Jesus may you get Glory out of this day we dedicate it into your hands Lord may you heal the sick oh God may you fill with the Holy Ghost bring Sinners to repentance Lord Jesus renew Minds oh God do what only you can do father we pray father both here Lord and also those who may be watching in the name of Jesus Christ we ask these things amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning so I want to I want to talk about this this uh enemy we face and how he can be broken because we understand that we're in a Warfare as as the Bible would tell us that the enemy uh that that that we have to take on the full armor of God that we may be able to stand in the evil day and then we have to put on the whole armor of God that we may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil that's Ephesians 6:11 now this WS in the in the Greek it means his methods he is a method of of of warfare he he doesn't come haphazardly he comes in very calculated Manner and we need to know how he fights in order to overcome his his Warfare now um we understand that in any any Warfare or or any sport you know you fight according to the equipment you have your tactics are based around your weapons that's right you look at any kind of warfare that's been through history the tactics that they formed were based on the weapons that they had at the time and even this latest war in the Ukraine they fight differently now than how they fought in the past because of electronic warfare drone Warfare there's different Hypersonic missiles there's different kind of tactics they use on the battlefield even though it may look kind of similar there they got trenches they've got bunkers they got all kinds of things like that but it's but it's been modified because of the weapons right and it's the same thing on the sports field if you're selecting a team and just say you got a football team and and and you've got the best striker in the world he's fast he's agile he's very good with the ball he can just s you know he can he can beat any keeper you're not going to put that guy in defense you're not going to put him as a keeper you're not going to put him in defense because he's built to be a striker okay you are not going to put a a a jet fighter pilot as a as a private infantry soldier in a trench cuz he's trained to be a jet fighter pilot he's built to be a jet figh fighter pilot right so so the devil was built a certain way in heaven and he did not change his ways when he failed you know we know that devils are Fallen Angels they are not something different they were once angels in the presence of God doing what God built them to do but then as we read about the devil there iniquity was found in his heart he thought he was something special above what God made him to be and then he thought he had a better idea than what God made him to be and then so iniquity was formed in his heart and then he fell but he was originally the anointed cherub that coverthe up here but if you just have in your mind the picture of the tab um the you know the Ark of the Covenant how there's the two cherums Above The Mercy Seat they are guard or covering that mercy seat so a so a cherub actually guards the way to the presence of God this is this is what the devil was made to be now he will come down now because because he does not want us to get into the presence of God he will try and influence us away from the presence of God or he'll try and influence us to believe a lie and be damned by it see this is his this is his method you see you could say before he fell he was a striker he's still a striker today right he's not a defensive player he's a striker okay so so you just like he's a jet fighter pilot before he fell he's still a jet fighter pilot but now he's in a perverted way so he was the anointed Cher that cover he doesn't guard the way to God anymore in that way he's been kicked out of heaven right but he'll still try and function in that way cuz that's how he was made now praise the Lord so everyone following me so far amen so you know we got to we got to know how to fight this enemy we got to we got to know how to withstand his attacks you see he he can you know if he can he will he will try and knock us out see brother Braham says this here he says now we have to see it's like training so like we're in a contest like a boxer okay you're going to have to meet an opponent now any any sports team or any coach that's worth his salt as a coach or a manager will study the team they're about to play you know you look at any any professional Sportsman they don't just sit around and say I'm going to turn up to the game and I'm going to play against this team or whatever more any manager they are studying their opponent all the way through the week until the big game they're analyzing they got different coaching staff they will analyze different players and then they will ad adopt a strategy to defeat that team on the day right so it's the same thing with you and I we need to be trained to meet our opponent because we're going to meet him amen we actually bump into the devil a lot more than you realize amen but the thing is if we are not trained to meet our opponent he's going to knock us out but we're not ordained to be knocked out we're ordained to knock him out amen so a real good fighter will study his opponent and know how to give him the you know knockout punch and it's the same thing with Christians you know you start with the golden rule John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life you see you start out with that that but that just gets you out on the floor but then you've got to train for The Knockout punches because you're going to have to use them everybody knows that you have to train to hit your enemy so it's not just a train to receive blows or get blows away from you got to be trained to hit your enemy amen and always God uses his word we must remember God uses his word to defeat his enemy so how are you going to defeat him you're going to use the word of God so youve going to take the word in faith speak it across your lips doesn't matter how you feel good day bad day whatever more remember Jesus Jesus was 40 days in the wilderness no bread no water he was in that kind of condition he was at his weakest Point physically but yet he used the word of God to defeat the enemy in his great Temptations showing it doesn't matter matter how bad a day you have how you feel in your body what's going on you can use the same weapon and knock the devil out amen hallelujah so I'm so thankful we have that kind of weapon now so God but remember if God thought he could give us anything better than his word he would have given us something better amen but he gave us the best weapon we have the best weapon in existence is the word of God but you've got to believe your weapon if you doubt see the devil wants you to doubt your weapon amen he's wanting you to doubt that it won't work in your situation it works every situation it worked in the belly well with Jonah it worked in a lion Den with Daniel it worked in a flaming furnace with shadra mesach and ab Abednego it worked at a Red Sea it worked on Mount carel it worked every it worked in Jerusalem it worked down in hell it worked everywhere the word of God worked amen so our weapon will work in lat seej Hallelujah so we've got to have confidence that our weapon works but you've got to use your weapon hallelujah amen now if you ever want to reason with God's word no don't have a reason just believe it don't try to explain it don't try to figure it out now you cannot figure out so God is his word it's just just made to believe it's our strength just accept the word and anyone knows that a seed in the right kind of ground will produce its kind but you see the devil doesn't want us to believe uh he doesn't want us to believe the word of God now Satan as I said he was the anointed Cher that cover so he wants to get in between you and God and of course he will he wants worship so he'll try and get you to worship Him Now worship starts with agreement you've got to agree with any spirit before it can actually have any dominion over you you have to agree with it see so the devil wants you to agree with him now here he comes down into Eden this is the first time he comes against human beings and he speaks to Eve this is you know it's amazing that it's not even recorded in the scripture that God spoke to Eve the first one to preach was Satan and the serpent to Eve and the first thing you did was say y hath God said he proposes a question and you got to be careful because remember nowadays he doesn't come to in a physical form if you really saw the devil for what he was you'd run 10 million miles I remember there was a a brother from Australia he shared a testimony that him and some other brothers went to a restaurant and you know there was this waitress that came up she was anointed with a lust spirit and one of them saw that Spirit on on her and he just threw up in his plate and they left the restaurant because he saw that spirit for what it was and if we could see the enemy for who he is we'd all run a mile no one would touch any of his stuff no one would even entertain him for a second but you see he doesn't come that way he comes with making you think thoughts that he's giving you yeah so for example you know you may feel a bit down you say well your feeling comes in your body you feel a bit done you feel a bit depressed that's the devil telling you that but he gets you to think that way for you to agree with that and then what do you you you start feeling down and if you begin to focus on that thought you feel worse you don't who who's ever felt better saying yeah I feel down I feel depressed you never get happy but that's the devil trying to get you under his Dominion wanting you to believe is lifee because remember we have life and life more abundantly see any thought that comes into this mind contrary to the word of God you've got to identify that's not you that's not God that's Satan amen so you've got to you got to identify the devil at his tricks like that and deny him yes amen so he comes along he came along to say y hath God said he begins to add you know take away change the word a little bit you know apply to her reasoning and then she agreed with him and then what what she did is when she saw the tree she saw it was one to be desired so he will get you to reason and then he'll get you to make emotional decisions see her her decision was on emotion you know yeath God was a question then it was desire came in and then so her so her so her desire or her her what she did was based on her emotions who knows that emotional decisions are some of the worst you can ever make it's not based on fact you're not even thinking clearly it's just pure emotion you can't go with just pure emotion you've got to take it back to the word of God Amen so so that's how he came in and so he he he came in that way and then we know sin came into the world because the devil always try and be that anointed cherub that cover he wants to block your access to God now we can see this very clearly with Absalon when when Epsilon remember he had his motive in his heart was to cause a revolt and become king this is what the devil's agenda's always been he wants to be the God of this world and AB says in this day he is the God of this evil age amen so Absalon comes in in 2 Samuel 15 and you know and then he and he got his chariots and his horses and 50 men to run before him and he went and he went and he rose up every morning and he stood by the king's gate and then when anyone man would come in that they had a controversy they had a judgment that the king had to make because the King was the final Authority in the Kingdom Absalon will call unto them what are you doing friend why are you here you know and and you know of what city are you and he said thy servant is one of the tribes of Israel and then and then what would happen is that the your man would would would tell or the person would tell Absalon their problem and you see Absalon would say yeah see thy matters are good and right see you've you've got a right to feel the way you feel you've got a right to feel angry you've got a right to feel unhappy you Christians fit their rights amen you know we have a right to praise God that everything that has breath praise the the Lord amen amen he says see thy matters are good and right you got a right to hold that Grudge no no let it go let's just let go of everything today that's not of God today let's just open our hands who's ever held on a say so tightly it's kind of can be hard to unpeel your fingers sometimes we've been gripping for things for years and our Spirits we're going to just Lord open my fingers get the blood back in them Lord that they can hold on to you or hold on to something a lot better amen amen he says thy uh thy matters are good and right but there is no man deputed of the king to hear these basically it's a shame no one can hear your hear your uh need and the Devil comes along and says God doesn't hear you but he puts it first person I wish God would hear my prayer I wish he would answer me that's the enemy coming along saying there's a shame no one can hear you God's ear is always open if there's not one sparrow that falls on the face of this planet God's not mindful of Jesus said and you're worth more than many sparrows and brother Braham comes along says one soul is worth more than 10,000 worlds amen there's no man deputed of the king to hear the Epsilon said moreover oh that I were made judge in the land that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me and I could do them Justice and it was so that when any man came n to him to and to do him um obstinance uh he put forth his hand and took him and kissed him and on this man did abson to all Israel that came to the king but for judgment so Absalon stole the hearts of the men of Israel so what did he do he was at he was being that anointed cherub he was blocking the access to the King this is what the devil does he wants to block our access Amen to God if he can he wants to try and this has always been Satan's method okay remember we're studying his methods today I know this is probably nothing new but I just want to bring these things out am mean so what is he doing he's trying Epsilon was trying to control access to the king and tell people his own ideas in order to rule over them and that Satan's method has always been to try and block people's approach to God by telling them his way is the way which is always and it's but it's always contrary to the word brother R would say this in Satan zeden as a businessman that's not a Christian he'll work every scheme he can to make you see something the wrong way he's got a purpose and a personal gain in making you you doing that making you seeing it that way he'll show you everything he can and keep you off from the truth of it because he's got a feeling only for himself no matter how much he lies and cheats and whatever more he's got personal gain am mean to the enemy will try and make you see everything the wrong way he will never try and make you see anything the right way and especially where there's truth is always a battle I remember you know the first church I went to was a Pentecostal church I never had a thought coming to my mind I should leave a service or I should walk out or this but then when I went to Brother Greggs down in Christ Church a message Church wonderful group of Believers a thought kept coming in my mind I should leave I should get up I should leave the service I realized that wasn't me and that wasn't God that was the devil trying to get me to leave so I told I said Satan no no I'm not leaving you can leave I'm staying right put but you see he made it first person in my mind I should leave this what happened if I listened to that voice and walked out of the church where would I be today see we've got to be able to identify the thoughts of the enemy yes sir right but because he's trying to have dominion over you amen see because he see he'll try and show do everything the wrong way see it's the same thing with the prodical son the prodical son did not start off as a prodical son like any child he loved his parents but then as you know he came to an age of accountability became a teenage different things the devil started working on him making him resent his parents make him think that he was in a prison that he you know his parents were just wardens and didn't let him go do anything and the neighbor kids had all the fun and you know building resentment against against the parents this is what this is what the anointed cherub that's Fallen will do amen he'll try and get us to see everything the wrong way amen instead of instead of um the son seeing that his parents loved him were caring for him we're looking after him had his best interest in mind amen he he was beginning to see things through the devil's eyes you know look at what they do to you they make you work they make you do this they make you do that every parent Under the Sun makes the kids do things yes amen you don't see a bunch of you know but look the devil wants to work on our kids because we have the truth amen because he knows if they just get in contact with the Lord Jesus Christ and that flame is lit in their soul amen he is Unstoppable for them cuz God is Not Just rapturing parents he's rapturing children he's rapturing teenagers he's rapturing old people he's rapturing every part of the body amen amen I'm expecting amen it could be very soon William's not going to say Dad you play with me Dad we're going dad and he's going to be yay big he's going to be 18 years old Hallelujah my kids my girls are going to sprout up a bit more hallelujah it's on I'm expecting that amen why cuz they're under the blood of Jesus Christ I believe amen but you see the devil try and work on them too look at what your dad's saying look at what your mom's saying your parents are no fun what about your friends and what about this it's the enemy trying to get them to agree with him to take them away and this is what happened with the prodical son see what happens is like brother Bram says is is who you are today is based on a decision you made about 5 years ago go yes so people will leave church before they leave church people start planning their Great Escape their prison break and it's the devil trying to get them from under the protection of the blood of Jesus Christ he'll work slowly but that you've got to stop him in his tracks am mean you got to stop him you got to stop him in your mind saying no Satan you're lying to me you're trying to take me to one side to take me out but I'm going to be Anointed with God to take you out amen I'm going to walk with God I'm not going to listen my parents love me am mean they can see more than I know they have greater understanding than I do yes amen you say well the world's different today no same Devils we fought here that's right they haven't left they've just rebranded themselves amen the same same Spirits same same anointing on music you know we we fought those Devils amen Spirit song games and computer games and entertainment we fought those Devils amen sports stars same anointing different sports star we fought those anointings we know what it's like to fight amen we know what it's like for God to set us free amen and if those things are so great why are we here why are we thankful God saved us why are we thankful that we've been redeemed why are we so happy that we're Christians because we're not in slavery anymore am mean if this was the worst and that was better this place would be empty come on that's right but the devil don't want you to think that way he wants you to think that there's nothing to it that there is a bunch of just rules and regulations and there and God is dead I'm sorry God's Not Dead I've had the experience I've made he stepped out of History to me he's the same yesterday today and forever amen and it's not just thoughts that you make that control you it's demon powers or it's God I remember the first uh house I I know I've shared this a lot but I'll share it one more time the first house that we have uh Christine and I rented here in Wellington we didn't know it till the day we left but but but the previous tenant used it as a brothel and and when we moved into that house Christine said that she saw a dark figure walking around and I would leave and go to work and then when I came back and as soon as I saw this saw the house I felt this oppression come on and we started fighting and we had trouble but we realized it wasn't us causing the trouble see you've got to identify as the enemy trying to tear you apart trying to tear your family apart trying to build walls see because we remembered what it was like to live in harmony we thought we are living below our privilege there is an evil spirit in this house and we need to pray that the anointing breaks the Yoke of that thing amen why cuz the devil wants to put an impression on you trying to make you think this is how life is no life isn't meant to be a constant battle and fighting fussing trouble and it's not some political debate and all this arguments and stuff it's joy peace Harmony and the Holy Ghost amen so we prayed and I don't know how God did it but but as but his Spirit came down one time we were praying and I felt a real fear come upon me it was a real feeling I rebuked that enemy I said Satan you have no right to put your fear upon me see the devil wants to make you feel afraid you got to you got to deny that thing you have to deny that thing you say it's either you own it or you don't I'm not owning anything the devil has for me amen CU it doesn't belong to me amen so then after we finished praying about that Christian said how do you know that I was feeling fear said why I said I was feeling it too and then we were praying a time after that and I looked up at her and she had a shocked look on her face she was looking at the door uh that was going out of our lounge and she saw that thing stand there and I went and opened the door of the house and we rebuked it the anointing came down the thing was cast out and other people came into our home and said it's so peaceful here we didn't fight I didn't feel that oppression no more didn't have those troubled feelings no more why because that enemy that was in that house left and it goes to show the things you do in in secret will bring an anointing amen so you can pray in secret and you can bring the Holy Ghost anointing you can love the Lord sing to him and God will come down or you can do things of darkness and you'll bring another anointing I would rather live with the anointing of the Holy Ghost and Liberty and freedom than live Bound by darkness and trouble and depression amen so hallelujah it's more than just thoughts see it's it's it's a a spirit motivating you to go a certain way amen so the prodical son it says in the scripture I don't have it on me right now but it says you know when he went to the foreign land he lost everything spent all of his father's inheritance that the father gave him and he's now feeding he's feeding pigs she's a Jewish man you a Jewish young boy living with unclean animals and then he's even so hungry he wants to eat the pig slop but then the Bible says and then he came to himself and brother ad says it's actually the prayers of appearance actually caused the angel of the Lord to come down into the pig pin where he was and cause that evil spirit to come off the mind of the son and he came to himself and realized actually this my father's servants live better Hallelujah than this I'm going to go back home Hallelujah I'm going to go back home what happened is that that anointed Cher that covered him was blasted away by the power of prayer and caused him to come back to his right mind amen then he went back to his father's house see this we got to have full confidence God hears our prayers am me God knows exactly what's going on we can have full confidence that God will answer our prayers in his season but you see the enemy comes along and tries to discourage us because of time he tries to think well it's been so long why why why haven't you had the outcome you want the Bible says ask and you shall receive amen he uses the scripture against you does he not he uses it against me and so he says oh yeah but you prayed for healing why why aren you healed or you prayed for this your family why is this happening all and he wants you to agree with his doubt cuz he wants you to get you to think that your prayers do not have any impact and our Prophet taught us that the weakest of Christians when they get down on their knees the kingdom of Hell shakes I believe that that's more than just nice imagery I believe that's a reality where you can get down and pray you can be the weakest you say well I'm feeling weak but you still shake the kingdom of Hell amen cuz you're a Believer amen hallelujah so now so so he you know begins to try and tell us that you know these things you know don't count and don't matter and what's the point see he's trying to get you to agree with him but we have a right to cast him out and deny him see the enemy brother Braham says in the contest is going to study our strategy with the word so he's going to study you with how you use the word see if he sees that you are just only rejoicing because of instant Miracles he's going to use that against you right he's going to study your strategy do you pray how's your prayer life he'll try and break your prayer life try and break your reading time do all those things because he's trying to wear you down that's right amen but you see the thing is our this is not a war of attrition this is total victory for you and I right because remember greater greater is he that's in you that's he that's in the world so an enemy can have all of his tactics all of his headquarters all of his planning but an anointed son or daughter of God Will Conquer amen amen prise the Lord amen you see he always try and discourage when it seems that something doesn't seem to be happening like your prayer but we know the Bible says that the word of God is a seed right and I've never seen a farmer plant seeds and then the next day dig them up see if they're growing and then plant them again and then dig them up the next after that and see if they're growing no they commit them to the Earth and let the water rain and everything they they have full confidence that there's life in that seed that the atmosphere is Right The Season's right it's going to bring forth exactly what's in that seed and it's the same thing with prayer am mean you've got to have confidence God has heard your prayer who's ever prayed through for something really had to that peace just come and say God I know the answer's coming I don't know when but it's coming you have confidence so what do you what have you done you've actually committed that prayer to God it's like a farmer putting seed in the ground right you've committed to God so so then you say what should I do now thank God the answer is coming thank God it's going to happen I mean water it with praise am mean just like the farmer lets that maybe he's got irrigation maybe it's just going to rain but he Waters that seed that it'll come to pass it's the same thing with you and I water our prayers with praise amen amen and what will happen they will come to life but the devil want us to say say no nothing's happening it's happening right you got to believe it amen that's right you see there's different ways that the devil can get a hold of Our Lives brother B would speak about this in the church AG book he'd say there's in the discernment line he says I wish you could stand with me and see the faces of people when Satan knows he's going to be exposed now it isn't the people that I'm talking about that is that Satan has got a hold in their lives hold in their lives through sin and indifference and disease but you should see their faces Satan knows he's going to be exposed and the most peculiar changes come across people's countenance Satan is afraid he knows that if the spirit is about to let the people know his works that is why he hates these meetings so much shall I say he still hates the word of God being preached because the word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart now he says Satan gets a hold of people's lives through sin indifference and disease so I'm just going to M what it's easy to know how he can get a hold of someone's life through sin which is unbelief but he can get a hold of our lives through indifference and disease so we can't stop getting sick we're in these bodies it's going to be wonderful when they change one day hallelujah we're not going to be in eternity in these bodies no we're going to be in a whole new body that can never get sick never have trouble sorrow no nothing can happen there amen amen but you see it's how we conduct ourselves in the sickness that matters see brother Braham says that we should conduct ourselves like son Sons and Daughters of God through the trial am mean you see Daniel when he was going through the great trial when the Commandment came that he couldn't pray for 30 days to God oh man he conducted himself like a Son of God through that trial what did he do he opened up the windows he he he prayed towards Jerusalem gave glory to Jehovah God Amen he did what he always did but and then when he's going to be thrown to the Den of Lions he he was not intimidated by the Lions then he conducted himself said my God is able to deliver me if I'm going to get I'm if I'm going to become breakfast I'll become breakfast I'm still going to serve God hallelujah he conducted himself as a Son of God through the trial Hallelujah I trust we can do the same thing amen when trouble strikes us praise God we're still his child amen he's still in control we can still trust in him for everything amen amen if if disease strikes Us Praise the Lord our God is can heal amen he's Our Redeemer amen who's with me today amen let's let's conduct ourselves like sons and daughter Daughters of God believing his promises no matter what's going on around us amen but you see Satan can get a hold of our lives through that disease why he'd say God can't heal you your case is too big you know you prayed for it why isn't the answer came why isn't God giving you instant if he's a God if he's the Jehovah of Miracles why isn't he given you a miracle and God will use medicine he'll use love he use you know you prayed for it there's that natural healing process comes into the body it can be instant Miracle be all these different things few well we don't have communion foot washing enough but a few of them ago amen Christine memb she had that frozen shoulder couldn't raise your hand above this she was being prayed for beinging the foot washing and God instantly released that frozen shoulder and she came in into the service I you know and she said I want to testify just raised up her hands like this Hallelujah so can be instant can take time praise God how God you know but the devil always see he wants us to look through it his way way yeah like he when he came to Jesus in the wilderness says if thou be the Son of God turn these bread uh turn these stones into bread basically prove yourself based on what I want you to do jump through my Hoops but but Jesus didn't clown for the devil he didn't prove nothing are you following me today he didn't prove nothing he just said get behind me Satan see real Holy Ghost leadership is not obeying the devil amen that's what that's what because the devil wanted Jesus to follow his leadership yeah but Jesus of course full with the fullness of the Holy Ghost just no he he just withstood him with the word but then there's also indifference the devil wants to make us cold indifferent formal and then he can get a grip of our lives through that way and I think that's probably the biggest thing we Face especially in this country where we have everything on a gold platter not a silver one we've upgraded it's gold amen but so so it can bring IND difference because it's not a drive I've got a you know there's not a drive drive to live or drive to survive because hey someone else will look after someone else will do the job amen so we but we never want to let indifference what the devil through indifference get a hold of Our Lives we should always be fervent amen loving the Lord praising him amen being thankful for what he's done our testimony should never become common to ourselves I mean even if we've just been called it's a miracle to be called even if there's been a desire in your heart I want to know you Lord that's a miracle you should celebrate that amen Hallelujah Lord there's a deep calling to the Deep you put that in My Heart Lord this is amazing am mean God's calling me like he called Abraham Hallelujah I want to walk with you Lord because you want to walk with me wonder praise the Lord amen so we should never let the enemy try and coming through indifference you see but he always he this is what he wants us to have amen praise the Lord you see we shouldn't this is now he's going to try and come come against with all these things but you've got to make a decision see brother Bram says this now he says you have to make a decision are you going to feel and say is my heart better or is my stomach not as bad as it quite as bad as it was can I move my fingers just a little bit don't think about that make your decision that Christ heals you and that settles it and you're well okay because the enemy wants you to look at symptoms he wants to look at you every he wants you to look at everything but the promise of God okay just like the just like Caleb and Joshua see the enemy wanted to cover them in unbelief just like the rest of Israel but they didn't they didn't say there's no Giants they didn't say there's no problems right they didn't say there's no enemies to take but they said God has given us the land Hallelujah let's go get it what so they weren't looking through the enemy's eyes like the other 10 spies were they're looking through the promise of God Amen this is and and this is how we need to be in this day God has made his promises so alive in this day amen we have so many testimonies of of of God's word becoming alive amen that we we should never settle for second best just like I was saying about the testimony of of of Christian I's first house we could have sealed for well I guess we've moved to a new city and it's stressful to move and I've I've got a job and all the other these different pressures of Life have come and I guess this is just how things have to be we could have settled for that but we remembered a time of peace and love and harmony and we realize an enemy had come in to try and destroy our lives and we didn't put up with it amen so you can either come under the anointing of the enemy saying this is how things have to be or you can look at the promises of God and say it shouldn't be this way I withstand you Satan you are a defeated being I'm not putting up with you see it's the decision we make about iten amen that we can either live without our symptoms live with live actually sorry based on symptoms and problem situation or we can live according to the word of God hallelujah amen amen amen why because the Bible says he's not given us the spirit of fear but love power and a sound mind but the devil says you should be afraid it's a fearful time look what's happening in the news he tries to amplify things in your mind what's going to happen to your children what's going to happen to your spouse what's going to happen to you look at the economics and all these things and tries to get you to focus on all those troubles we live in a time of trouble but there's a place we can be hidden and it's not under the wings of this Fallen cherub of demon it's under the wings of the almighty amen we can trust under his wings amen and he will look after us no matter what goes on Lord hallelujah now he says now what if a farmer went and planted a big wheel of um uh a big a big field of Wheat and every morning he got out there and dug all that wheat up so so I'm repeating this for a point to see if it was going to sprout or not as long as he keeps digging up the seed it'll never grow every time you dig it up it delays another day and every time you look at your symptoms it delays you too in your healing yeah amen a farmer just commits a seed to the ground he wants the best seed he can find he puts it in the ground because he's made a decision he wants a crop so he goes and gets the best seed he can find and I think if we just decide I'm going to serve God come what me it's going to be you're going to have a good crop amen amen you say Lord I want to see you live amen I want to see your word become a reality of my life amen you'll get a good crop amen amen be see the enemy see brother Braham said when he was 12 years old when he came to the age of accountability he said he would have been saved then but a spirit hung over him saying just wait a little bit longer what was that that was that anointed Cher that c was trying to stop him meeting God just wait a bit longer so how does that thought come in I'm young there's a lot of life I need to experience first what about my friends what will this person think I know what peer pressure is like it help me back for years but when I came to a point where I'm like I'm sick of this I'm sick of being miserable just having enough of God to be miserable we shouldn't be miserable we should enjoy the Lord amen he wants us to enjoy Christianity he wants us to enjoy our walk with him amen but see it's a spirit he said a spirit kept hanging over him he says that's the reason why you weren't saved at the age of accountability a spirit you got in a crowd and that hovered over you and kept hanging over you you wanted to do right there's not a man that's got his right mind but wants to do right but there is something that won't let you do it is that right that's the devil he says hallelujah Christ paid your healing and your salvation now here it is you get ready he commissioned his church to cast them Devils out there you are in my name they shall cast out Devils you ain't going to heal nobody but you're going to cast The Devil away from them so they can accept the healing I've already done that's right preacher stood on the platform and preach the gospel devil scatter the man comes to the altar under conviction I say I and says I want to get saved he never saved the man he cast The Devil out that's right and the man got saved he come accepted his salvation the same thing by Divine Healing you sick people here this morning believe that and been born again and are Sons and Daughters of God Christ has already healed you the only thing that keeps you from being well this morning is a spirit hanging over you that won't fully let you go out yonder and believe God's promise that he's done it but you see we're here to create an atmosphere to cast The Devil away that every promise we have need of that we can receive amen it's just like the four men that had the crippled friend on the on the on the cot and Jesus was in the house teaching and they couldn't get him in because of the press they knew their friend was not in his ought to be condition right they knew I remember him when he walked I remember him when he enjoyed the Lord I remember him when he shouted I remember him when he got baptized I remember him when he had victory in his life but some a sickness is coming and crippled his walk but we know the one that can undo all the crippling but you see because they knew it could be done they did not stop when they saw obstacles they thought well what can we do and they said well let's go on top of the house and let's pull apart the obstacle until we get our friend into the presence of Jesus Christ am mean and that's what prayer does friends as it takes the tiles off the roof am mean that you can lower your family you can lower your friends you can lower one another into the presence of God Amen that the anointing of God will break that yoke off their life because Jesus said when he saw their faith he said your sins be forgiven thee or what's easier to say your sins be forgiven or take up your bed or rise up and walk but but Jesus if you go read it he says when he saw their faith not the crippled man's Faith their faith maybe he thoughts cuz the devil may be got in his mind thinking I'll never walk again I've got py the doctor say I can't be well it's an impossibility that I you know that I can ever be well there's no medical science that can help me so I've just got to accept that see this is what the devil get you to think you've just got to accept how you are if you're down that's just how you've got to be you look at all life's problems you've had a hard Road you've had a tough past you've had problems and this is why you feel this way don't agree with that amen don't agree with that amen that man was crippled but his friend said no he can walk again and we should have that same kind of faith for one another I can see my kids saved I can see them filled with the Holy Ghost I can see Joy return to the church I can see people dance Amen in Liberty I can see God move in power again amen because I've seen it before this is what this is our inheritance this is what it should be like so what do we do we start praying to pull the obstacles away sir amen if you have that same determination Lord once more Lord move in our midst Lord once more Lord Heal the sick once more Lord fill with the Holy Ghost once more Lord take a wayward son a Wayward Daughter and bring them home once more Lord take the spiritual cripples off their cck that they can carry that thing away and and say the Lord took this off took me off this this morning once more Lord amen I believe Tes can come off sunlight can come down amen and God can come into the presence and into our midst and he can do the miraculous amen do you believe it am mean don't listen to The Devil's lies he says you've lived like this too long who said Moses was 80 years old backslid Prophet just on the backside of deser and God said now's your time amen so you're never too old you're never too young for God to change your life amen because the anointing the yoke is broken because of the anointing you see we have been anointed Amen in this end time to break the anointing of the devil that's the Yoke amen the oppression the lies of the enemy am mean to undo amen all of his Works amen amen hallelujah amen so I think I've spoken enough about the devil now let's speak about God because this is what we' have come Amen to realize that this word Works amen his anointing is true amen I remember when Chris and I when we first went to Papa new guine this on our honeymoon amen and and and and and my parents had this housemid called Ruth she couldn't speak English she just spoke pigeon but she spoke until the cows came home you you had to interrupt to get a word in edgewise she just talking talking talking you know but then when we went up for our honeymoon she was quiet didn't say a word I thought something's wrong with her because this is not how she usually is and before we went up on our honeymoon she was carrying her Outrigger Canoe down the beach and she slipped over dislocated her kneecap went right up on her knee you know snapped some tendons didn't know about the tendons at the time and and and they um and she got taken to the hospital by my mom and they were going to operate on her leg to put everything like reattached attendons and things and she just said no you just put my kneecap back put my leg in a cast God is going to fix my knee but you see as I read that quote the devil can get him through disease and she said this is after when when when she was laying in her bed with that cast on she said this Dark Cloud came over her wow and made her this person that doesn't speak much at all so we found her in this condition we had this house that that that that that we had and we invited to come over one evening to to pray for her cuz I was like the guy carrying one of the four men carrying their friend on the stretcher I thought Ruth is not in her ought to be conditioned Something's Happened to her but I want to take the tiles off to get into the presence of God Amen so so she came in we showed a Gary Walker's testimony you know was it four times dead but alive you know the car you know multiple times and he's alive today amen we showed her that and we begin to explain to her how the reason these troubles have come upon her is because she's embraced the truth and we anointed her with oil now before she ever came into the house my expectation was that because by that stage soorry hope I'm explaining it right but by that stage the cast was off her leg but she couldn't even She had she could barely bend that leg that was damaged so my expectation was after he prayed for us she'd run out of the house screaming and rejoicing that's my expectation after we anointed her with oil and prayed for her that Spirit left her and she started just jabbering away talking like she was her old self Hallelujah isn't that right amen so and then she told us a story of when she was in the cast in her house that that dark Spirit Came Upon her amen so she came back to her ought to be conditioned spiritually back to her old self I went up to papini a couple of months after that and she just had a slight limp now she told me about the tendon snapping in the accident after that now tendons are like uh bungee cords right they don't just reattach when they snap they go like this so who did this God did that amen God did that amen so didn't just restore her back to a spiritually right condition but restored her leg amen but the only reason that well it was God's grace but there was something in us that said something's wrong with her let's pray until everything becomes right again hallelujah amen and I think that's how we should be amen hallelujah why because the Yoke breaks the anointing I mean sorry yeah no the anointing breaks the Yoke I'm glad someone's listening you see so the devil wants to W off the promises of God he wants to keep us away from everything that we would have in the have in the Lord but the anointing of God breaks the Yol amen it causes it causes Deliverance to come into the house of God hallelujah amen so because we are ordained Amen to cast out the enemy amen he wants us the enemy wants us to think that God will only do things a certain way and we just have to live with being underprivileged the devil's lying amen we are ordained to walk in joy and love and Liberty and be happy and have peace in our hearts that's what we're ordained to have I mean we're not called to be troubled and anxious see anxiety people say my anxiety or my stress levels or my depression all that is is the devil says you're depressed feel this way you feel anxious feel this way you you got fear feel this way and they've said yes thank you I'll take that they don't realize they're bought into it so we should never say my anxiety because it's not meant to be yours or my depression CU it's not meant to be yours these things are a spirit amen you say no no my joy cuz that actually is yours my peace that actually is yours my love that God's given me that is actually yours amen amen that's how it should be you see we are called to cast down imaginations and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God I mean so that is everything that tries to be greater in your life than his word amen see the spirit of fear comes in I'm anxious I'm afraid whatever more you got to withstand that thing and say no I will not be fearful amen amen God has not given me the spirit of fear but love power and a sound mind amen see it's not it's not God's idea to make you fearful amen no it's the enemy's idea to make you fearful Lord hallelujah all those things amen all those things are only vanities amen just lying vanities everything of the work work of the enemy is lying vanities it says in Psalms 11937 turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity amen and Quicken thou me in thy way amen so so Lord turn my eyes from beholding vanity see the problem with see the Mental Health crisis we have in this cuz everyone looks at themselves right you want to get rid of mental health problems look at the Lord look at his promises look what he has made you to be amen if he says I'm an overcomer I'm an overcomer amen if he says that I've got joy UNS spiggle full of glory amen I receive that amen I deny the depression and take the joy amen amen you see Caleb and Joshua did not let the sze of the enemies intimidate them they just took God at his word and when we can put aside what we feel what we imagine what we see take face feel hair smell any of those things take those things if they're all contrary to the word of God you throw them aside amen sure if they agree with God's word go with it amen but if it's contrary to the word you've got to you got to identify it and withstand it amen amen see how God does things it's his business see Paul and Silas I was actually looking when was the first time they were ever in jail and the first time Paul was in jail was with Silas in Acts chapter 16 you know and he was not just put in jail they put in the inner prison and they were beaten and they are in stocks and it says you know the Bible says and after they had laid many stripes upon them that means they beaten a lot not just one or two they they receive many stripes and what happens is the enemy will beat us he will trouble us in our minds he will he will bring trauma back up from our past and he'll make those things so real to us and they are right so that's what it's like to be beaten and they're not just and they just weren't just in prison they beaten and they placed in stocks so they couldn't walk like they wanted to walk amen I mean they were stuck in who's ever seen someone in stocks you're pinned man you ain't walking around you're stuck and this is what the enemy wants us to be like he wants us to be a prisoner in our own mind you'll find the thought pattern of the enemy is like a hamster wheel there's no conclusion it goes around and it goes around but remember God is a counselor a counselor brings you to a conclusion right it's not a constant thinking like a hamster wheel that's the devil's thought pattern yeah he doesn't want you to be free that's right I know that's not shocking that should be new to shouldn't be new to anyone he wants to keep you bound as a prisoner in your mind always thinking of the same old things again and again and again it's like it hens to but God will bring things to your remembrance but bring a conclusion bring a way of Escape bring a way to actually come out of those things amen that's right praise the Lord hallelujah amen it's like if you can't forgive someone the devil just keep you on the hamster well they did that and I can't believe they did this and he'll add to it right and they did this and this is why I feel this way but then God will say why can't you forgive them sure they did that to you but why can't you forgive them you want to be you want to be rid of this feeling forgive them give it over to me amen sure you still feel the hurt and the trauma but but let let me heal that from you Hallelujah but you've got to give it to me what is it he's counseling you you're not meant to hold the this pain you're not meant to hold this hurt you're not meant to hold this regret or this shame give it to me stop going on a hamster whe in your mind of Shame and pain and hurt in your past step off hamster wheel is not very wide the hamster just needs to step off and I think many times without thinking we just need to step off or how do you step off begin to think about the promises of God think about something else think of something that's got vert you it's actually got some goodness to it amen just like that you say well this person and this and my upbringing and all these things step off that hamster wheel you can't change the past none of us can change the past see but it's the enemy trying to get you to always focus on those things he wants to control control you but no God wants to set us free of those things so they are in a p you can be a prisoner in your mind you can be trapped in the same thinking your feet can be in stock so you can't walk with God like you really want to you can't seem to enjoy God at all well then what's the way out of the prison what the same way they got out of their prison oh yes amen see no doubt when they were in the prison there would have been a voice whispering in their ears it's all over now you're done this is it normally prison's the end you know but remember it ain't over until God says it's over amen so you may think there's no way out of this problem there's no way out of this complex there's no way out of this pain it ain't over till God says it's over amen amen you don't see just this is not your end praise the Lord we're going through these things that's right amen we're going to come out the other side better loving the Lord more amen so Paul and Silas they were in this condition what they do they begin to they prayed and they sang praises to God this is how they got out of this thing so the enemy wanted to come and say you're stuck here Paul this is the end of your journey this is the end of your life this is just how it's going to be but God didn't say it was over and they began to share testimonies one with another Hallelujah Paul went back to the road to Damascus silus I want to tell you one more time I was on that road I wanted to destroy you silus do you know if I knew you back then silus I would have Haled you into a prison like this I would have beaten you and I would have enjoyed it because I would have hated you but then God met me on the road to Damascus Silas and now all I can do is love you and I love him and he's wonderful and I'm so glad he's brought me out of this I'm so thankful that I'm a changed transformed new creation and then s said Paul you know what when you a pH you I would have admired you I wanted to be like you Hallelujah but one day God met me too that same God you met I met in a different way but he's the same God Amen he's transformed my life too Paul Silas aren't you glad aren't you glad for those moments yes Silas I'm so glad you know what Paul what Silas he's still the same amen we may be in a prison my back is covered and Stripes I'm in a lot of pain right now but I'm not going to focus on that Paul that's right Silas Hallelujah who cares what they can do to these bodies our souls are Eternal we're sealed away in the Rock of Ages we're been covered in the blood of Jesus Christ amen I'm on my way to canaan's F I'm on my way to Glory doesn't matter what the enemy can do that's right Paul you know what silus let's start praying let's start thanking God he's my God he's your God Amen we're two or three gathered in my name he's in the mid silus hey Paul there's two of us yes that's right Silas he's right here with us amen and they begin to pray and they begin to thank God Amen and the stripes didn't matter no more the stocks didn't matter no more and God came down and shook that prison amen the Yoke was broken because of the anointing Hallelujah and every prison door flew open and they got got out of that prison free hallelujah what they broke through in praise and prayer because they knew this is not their ought to be conditioned amen friends if we could take the same thing in the spiritual this morning I mean you may be going through something I'm not discounting what you're going through but don't let it be who you are I mean let God be your identity I'm a son or daughter of God Amen this thing is will not Define me this thing will not be who I am or known by I'll be known by the blood of Jesus Christ I'll be known by his holy ghost I'll be known by his transforming power that's my identity amen my his word is my identity this is who I am amen that's how we should be because if you identify yourself that way the enemy might try and come and control you you say Satan get away from me in the name of Jesus Christ You' have come to steal kill and destroy but my God has come to give me love courage and ability Hallelujah and I am going to walk out of here rejoicing and praising God I mean because the anointing breaks the Yoke I mean so if we could just really think you think about it you know hallelujah our god is the all powerful one but Satan has only as much power as you give him so he can be a very big giant if you allow him to be a big giant you can let that fear be a massive thing that cripples your whole life or it can just be an annoyance and actually or it can just be a trophy on the wall of God's power CU you're delivered so the enemy is only as big as you allow him to be because the scripture says neither give place to the devil am me the enemy can be very big or he can be very small it's up to you brother Bram says in the message the Oneness of unity now when the meeting's going on an evil spirit in the meeting that spirit is almost harmless until it can catch somebody that it can work through then when it can work through it'll certainly do damage because it is a evil spirit so an evil spirit in a meeting is almost harmless until it can catch somebody to work through that's right oh the devil's on the Rampage but he's almost harmless until he can find somebody to work through I want to be the first one to say he can't work through me I'm covered in the blood of Jesus Christ he can't cause any damage through me amen and it's the same with the Holy Spirit he is here am mean trying to find somebody to work through and when it finds somebody to work through it can do good see the two Spirits their motives their objective watch how it is watch their Works watch their fruits then you can see what spirit is on you you're motivated by a spirit if you have no Spirit you're dead and if you have a spirit it motivates your life so what spirit is motivating you is it fear and doubt that's not God you have a right to deny that thing in the name of Jesus Christ you don't have to live under that this is an hour of Liberty amen this is an hour of total Jubilee a total Liberty for the children of God Amen that we can walk under the anointing of the Holy Ghost and not under the bondage of the of of the devil amen so the devil is almost harmless until he can find somebody to work through so we don't need to fear the devil just get under the blood of Jesus Christ amen amen you see see we are motivated by a spirit I pray we are motivated only by the Holy Ghost sure the devil will try and withstand us but just because he's an obstacle doesn't mean we can't go through God will find a way way you know we were driving I think it was up to Christmas I might be wrong we're driving up to um Taran um um up to toonga you know and Christine was feeling very sick and we had a song playing from Brother Paul La fontaine's church as called he's AEL they had a they had a night of worship and and and I can't remember what the pastor was singing and and and and and the chir be singing the song He's Able He's Able God is able amen and the Lord spoke to her heart saying you don't have to have the sickness if you don't want amen amen and what do you think she did she said Lord thank you for healing me in the name of Jesus Christ it left right amen see this is but that's what happens see the yoke is broken because of the anointing we're listening to the right kind of music Faith came God came into the car and said you can be free if you want to be I pray he's speaking the same thing this morning you can be free if you want to be amen you can walk in Joy if you want to be you can have the peace of God if you want it amen amen if see if the yoke is broken then you are free now listen we don't need to ask the devil permission to be free that's right you don't need to ask the devil permission can I go free can I no no we don't have to ask the devil nothing I mean the Lord Jesus has already given you full permission to be free he's already given you full permission because of that down on Calvary he wrote your pardon in his own blood hallelujah amen so you don't need to ask your oppressor can I go free can I be free of you you don't have to ask the devil nothing amen you are free to enjoy the Lord you are you are free to enjoy your salvation you you are free to enjoy church you are free to enjoy your family your spouse you're free to enjoy your marriage amen you are free to enjoy am mean you don't have to obey some cold dead formal Spirit you don't have to obey it you don't have to ask any Spirit if it's okay to clap your hands sing dance praise God to be Anointed with the Holy Ghost you don't have to ask the devil permission your Covenant is between you and God when Jesus died on Calvary for you it wasn't you the devil and God it was God and you and God wrote you a covenant saying you are free you can be free you're free to love me you're free to worship me you're free to praise me you're free to walk with me you are free indeed amen you don't have to be under the devil's yoke because what the anointing breaks the Yoke amen amen so we don't need to ask the devil permission for nothing the Lord Jesus Christ has already given us full permission amen so why not today look at your enemy and say Satan I'm not listening to you no more I'm not putting up with this mind battle no more you're free to you're free to deny the enemy in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus Christ you are free I mean you don't have to you can get off his hamster wheel if you want you say well I'm used to this wheel come into a whole big world come why be on a tridal when you can walk the green fields of God's goodness of his word and his paradises and joy going an adventure with the Lord Jesus Christ but it's up to you yeah that's right I'm just going to close with that what do you want the devil come along what he was in heaven he's fallen on Earth he's trying to do the same thing yeah or why don't you come under the shadows of the almighty God Amen under the shadows of his word and let him guide you and speak to you and lead you because he doesn't lead you into anything contrary to his word let's have the musicians this morning amen let's go on with God shall we amen you say well that's pretty pie in the sky how many yolks have we seen Broken Oh yes come on now how many people have we seen delivered how many we've seen lot we've seen a lot of Yol breaking you know if we had physical representations of those yolks we'd need a bigger trophy cabinet oh yeah amen and that's because of God not because of us right so it's not pie in the sky but the devil will always get you think no you've got to be this way you've got to be stuck this way this is just how you are no don't listen to him amen take God's given Liberty amen he is AB an absolute liar the Lord amen let's stand amen this morning amen let's um can we sing that song um I know it was
