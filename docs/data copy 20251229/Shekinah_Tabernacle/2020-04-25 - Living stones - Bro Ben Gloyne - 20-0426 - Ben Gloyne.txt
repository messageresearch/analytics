William verse 8 rather sorry I mean did you say me and when you're their main trustee once well we good to see all your smiling faces and may God bless you I mean the Ammar and chapter chapter 2 verse 8 and a leader unto SF the keeper of the king's forests that he might give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which are pertain to the house and for the wall of the city and for the house that I shall enter into and the King granted me according to the good hand of my god upon me then I came to the governor's beyond the river and gate in the King's letters now the king had seen captains of the army and horsemen with me when sanballat the horror night and Tobiah the servant and Emma not heard of it it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel a means this is bow heads in a wood of friends gracious Lord Jesus Lord we truly do give you all the glory and all the honor this morning Lord want to thank you Lord for your mercy upon us lord thank you that your mercies as your scripture says are new every morning we sort of pray fathers we have read your word Lord we know Lord man's word can fail my words fail but Lord your word never fails and I just pray dear God mate just take the service under your control once again we thank you for what you did for us on Wednesday but Lord this is a new day there's a new service and they just pray father may you just move upon our hearts once again Lord now we feel your presence Lord may you wash us in your blood Lord may forgive us of all our sons our iniquities and trespasses Lord just take the service under your control Lord have your way in our lives Father in Jesus Christ then we pray amen amen god bless you all you may have your seats this morning I want to UM you know if I can take a time of the miss may seem very unrelated to the scripture we just read I want to speak about God is searching out honest hearts today now we read through the admire where Nehemiah was given you know he had a burden for his people and he and he and he got given letters from the king as we just read to to go to Jerusalem and and he was given authorization to to all of the you know wood and stone and anything he had need of it would be placed in his hand and and here here he comes in an hour of restoration where we're you know Jerusalem as has fallen down and it's a city without walls and you know but but you see the enemy now whenever God begins to do something it makes the enemy mad and I'm actually happy when the devil's mad because if the devil's mad it means that we are doing something against his kingdom I mean so don't be too worried if you know if the devil's raging you know the reason the devil's raging is because you have something that you know you have something that he wants but you're not well to give it to because you're not you're on your you're bought with the price which is the blood of Jesus Christ now now what I'll just show you a picture of so I've just kind of gone to this habit of showing pictures but here is a here's a you know who can see this picture of all these ruins here can even see that I mean so this is not Jerusalem exactly I'm not sure where these ruins came from but you know this is kind of kind of like you know you know if we could go back to nehemiah's day and we you know he would come down into Jerusalem and he began to survey the city and see the state it was then when he found it you know this is how I kind of maybe would have been you know all the stones are pulled down you know it just looks like a bunch of rubble a bunch of mess a bunch of rubbish I mean but but he had in his mind I mean a city to be rebuilt and you know we see that he had here he came a man now that was seeking after the welfare I mean of of the city Jerusalem I mean if we know that this is just as type where I could say just a shadow of our Lord Jesus you know because he is the he is the wise masterbuilder you know he is the builder of his church you know we know that the scripture tells us that we are lively stones living stones built into the house of God I mean who knows that I mean who knows you're a bit of the building I mean by once were you baptized into the body of Christ ami and so you know so I saw here it is now that you know Jerusalem is torn down it's it's it's in rubble but he comes a man who is seeking after the wealthier of the city and and as soon as this happened you know the enemy begin to be mad but I just want to emphasize the fact that he comes a man to seek after the city's welfare and I'll just say that you know you know God God has come down in this in time not to look at a physical building I mean of stone or gold or wood but he's looking you know he's looking for a people who are made and shaped and his image in the image of his word I mean and he's come to seek after your welfare now I just want to just point out though you know when we you know when the Lord came I mean and you know the days of his flesh he began to call different ones and you know he was actually calling stones he is calling butts award he is cool he was he was cool and material I mean for his temple that he was going to come dwell and you know we you know after he came out of the wilderness there to his 40 day temptation he went any and he went and got the disciples he began to call stones I mean he begin to call bits of the building of the mystical body of Christ he began to call Peter James and John II seem to come following me he found Matthew I mean he found he you know he found different ones and he was coming to seek he came to seek after the welfare of his house I mean seek the welfare of his people you know keep this in mind I mean that you know just like when Nehemiah found Jerusalem it was in this condition it was torn down it wasn't built it wasn't look you know you know it was you know it was in rubble I mean you're the enemy came in had burned it had destroyed it I mean in your head you know it had 70 years of you know barely being inhabited you know different you know your your animals would have lived in the ruins and things begin to grow and there was no order of a city anymore was just a bunch of rubble I mean and this is how the Lord found us hallelujah doesn't matter where we came from you know you take you take Matthew the tax collector you know he had a you know he had a good government job and even though everyone hated him but you know maybe actually he'd say he had everything but his life was in trouble I mean his life was a bunch of rubbish or he wasn't in his possession I mean you take Zacharias you know he was up the tree and you know you know I mean you know as xes rather you know he was he was there and you know here - all this money and wealth and things but but he was you know he was torn down I mean he was a stone that was just laying in the rubble but you know but then the Lord our you know you're the great builder of his church I mean he begin to call stirrings and it's amazing where God God finds us and you know it's not thing the thing is we have to look at it's not where we came from it's where we're going to and the reason we're going to his mind we would end up you know it's just so I love the story of you know the thief on the cross and I may deviate around a little bit but we'll get somewhere we'll start somewhere we'd somewhere else but you know I love the story of the thief on the cross because you know God God finds us in all different places and not surprised at the place he finds us they meant he knows exactly where we'll be and and he'll know exactly our condition that we'll be in I mean when he finds us and we have to just kind of you know I want to kind of build from from Wednesday if I can I mean because you know we've come out of I trust some spiritual of Christians your senior Christian services you know we've we've gone into our ethic and we've you know and we've and we've got the treasures out and we have you know your we've gone down home level four lockdown and we're not locked down no more and now we're rejoicing amen I trust as I look out the screen I trust you can say I did you know that today I may not come back to my first love but they know the devil you know it's just like when Nehemiah came to look at Jerusalem it might need to be mad because the devil doesn't want us built up you know he doesn't want us rejoicing he doesn't want us walking in victory but he wants our lives to be a bunch of wreckage amen but I'm glad the one that's building us is five grand the one that's trying to tear us down I mean I'm I'm glad that thee and the one that's trying to build us I mean his purposes I will have a bride she will live be without spot or wrinkle I mean she will be as righteous as I am righteous amen and we need to recognize that he's already made us thus we're just stepping into that Emma tell him I made her as he's called he's also justified him he's justified he is already glorified tells us so you know we're just walking I mean yo into victory hallelujah I think the warranty has the victory amen he won the victory for us hallelujah you know um amen so you know I love thee you know I love the story of the thief on the cross because you know in one account and you know you read the accounts of Jesus's crucifixion and one of them in Matthew 27 and and I think it's a mark as well that says that both thieves railed on him says he's a Matthew 27 41 likewise also the chief priests mocking him with the scribes and elders said he saved others himself he cannot say excuse me he being the king of Israel let him come down from the cross and we will believe him he trusted in God let him deliver him now if he will have a we'll have him for he said I am the son of God it says in verse 44 the thieves also were crucified with him cast the same and his teeth so there's the account that boast thieves you know railing against Jesus they get caught in the atmosphere what's going on they begin to accuse them and all these different things but then it says in Luke 23 where there's the with is the repentant thief and there's the unrepentant thief so so in Luke 23 says that one of the malefactors which was the thieves which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be Christ save thyself and us but the other answering rebuked him saying dost not thou fear God seeing thou art in the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward for our deeds but this man had done nothing amiss and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when I come us into thy kingdom and we know Jesus great words back to him his response was with yo today you'll be with me in paradise so there was a point in time when twenties were worth speaking your rallying against Jesus saying if you're the Son of God you know save us and yourself and do it you're caught up and what the scribes and Pharisees were doing but then they but then that repentant thief remember God knows where we are God knows where we are and and he wasn't surprised where he found us yo our Lord Jesus wasn't surprised that he found that thief on the cross right here he would be there I mean we believe in the predestination of God don't we you know so he was the thief on the cross was predestinated I mean to hang in that place I can even say he was previously to have the life he lived I mean that God would get him there I meant that with me when the mercy seat was on playing for your Calvary he would look again I mean the first time he looked at Jesus he just made fun of him off you're really the self god save yourself and save us but then he looked again and he saw more than a man mean there he saw his lamb hanging there he saw the Lord of glory hanging there I said lord I mean remember me when you come into your kingdom hallelujah and we know that his confession what he said I mean that actually gave him salvation hallelujah I mean and we have to recognize I mean it's our faith revelation faith real faith I mean that actually makes us righteous I mean you know so the reason I'm going on from Wednesdays because you know we are where we had a lockdown where rejoicing but then the devil wants to hold our past he wants to hold you know he tries to get a toehold anywhere you know you know he's like someone who's seen someone who who who like free climbs up crazy big cliffs who see men you know the devil's caught a lot and in our lives he tries to find a toehold at a foothold in a you know hand hold it in your any crib as he can get in our lives and you know then he tries to hold on but but we have to recognize I'm in the blood of Jesus Christ you know washes us clean that he has no claim on our lives whatsoever I mean he has no hold upon us mm oh but we need to recognize I mean what the Lord has done for us and then walking and hallelujah I mean that's where I'm trying trying to go today I mean I mean so so here was that people on the cross now we know that the scripture tells us that when Paul looks at Abraham he looks at yo your abraham believed God and his face was imputed unto him for righteousness so so he saw you know but in James looked at Abraham and James wrote down his abraham's works and he said that was imputed forever Isis now there's not a contradiction in the scripture brother Bram tells us but but the Prophet tells us that that Paul was writing what God saw with Abraham which was his faith and then James was writing what man saw from Abraham which was his works Amen so I saw both of them we know tie together but so we must understand it awfully I think I preached all those years ago now but you know every believer through the scripture has works amen I think when you look at the thief on the cross he may say well how can he have works I mean his hands are Pinto across this feeder Pinto across I mean he only has a few more look how can he have works well actually his works were actually the same works as he bought house in the scripture as his condition works I mean what he spoke I mean what he believed was now manifested out of his mouth as his cloth when you remember me when you come into your kingdom saw his confession was his works Amen so he believed God right and it was impeded then for righteousness amen so as a confession actually made him was a manifestation that was his works I mean you say well is that all we have to do is just walk around and confess the Word of God no I'll say this if the thief wasn't on the cross he would have been in the upper room yes sir I mean he would have been baptized named the Lord Jesus Christ he would have received the Holy Ghost I mean he would have been walking with the disciples I mean that's all he can do but I'll say this that your confession as the beginning and in now your life he lived as a manifestation of your confession yeah I mean it just follows your procedure that's why it's very important that that from our hearts we agree with the word I mean we confess the word hallelujah we don't confess our condition mention of Jerusalem I think when it's there in Nehemiah stained kitchen imagine if it could speak I mean it's confession when it's rubble you know I just pull imagine what would it say let's say we're rubble we got burned down so many years ago the enemy just walked over us and destroyed us and you know this is what's happened we're in this condition and shows us and this is how you know I guess we'll stay like us but that's not what God saw of Jerusalem I mean because because what Niemeyer's eärnur than Ezra's bird and those ones burdened to rebuild it I mean they didn't see just a building project they saw a city rebuilt and this is for the temple in its glory I mean they saw the priest you know manifesting you know you're afraid you're in their office they saw the worshippers come and they sought the singers sing Alleluia I mean I saw the armies of the city on a hill hallelujah that's what they saw I mean and that's what they had in their mind and yes yes just how God works through his word God begins to project a vision to us how the evening is a project a vision to us I mean we're you know you know we're not a bunch of rubble we're not just something that throws around and burns and does what it wants but we're the children of the Living God of Jerusalem they didn't just were added to that wordy they just had to come out of the rubbish and be put back in the wall hallelujah the sons and daughters of God by the new breath now the Signum ations because she were sons I mean he gave us the Holy Ghost hallelujah so we do become anything by the new birth that's just a manifestation of what we are I mean the devil beat you down sank now you notice own I mean I'll say I'll say we are sons and daughters of God I mean this word has become a living reality to us in the scripture and first Corinthians chapter 1 and verses 17 and 18 you know because people people get so worried about how sincere they are or how not sincere they are and you know they mi sincere enough am I not sincere enough I wanna be more sincere and happier and basically they just standing still and they can't really get out of this prison because the devil uses our own sincerity against us yo you know people ponder do I take the word seriously enough do I take it too seriously under my seat and people just stand in the space been there I mean but you know I like the scripture in 1st Corinthians 1 and 17 and 18 for Paul is saying for Christ see me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words least the cross cross of Christ should be made of none effect for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God so now you gotta look at your attitude yeah right Amy to them that perish the preaching of the Cross is foolishness it doesn't mean anything it has no value it has not merit I am as just a foolish empty bunch of silliness you know it has no value it doesn't mean anything to them that's the key the Pickers right people say mi sincere my not sincere yo you look at your attitude towards the word remember brother Ram said the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will cause it to come to pass think that's received in the holy gosh I'll say that's even going in a rapture I mean God looks at me but God puts that attitude in us but you know so we don't need to beat ourselves up are we sincere enough well here's the question as the preaching of the word foolishness to you that means you're not going to perish I mean you to reach others that's what Paul say am I gonna make it am I not gonna make it well what's the attitude of your heart not just up here but what's the attitude in here as the the cross fall is just David I say if it is that means you've been a Pierce but you don't have to stay that way remember the devil thinks it's foolishness because he couldn't see how God could become a man to become the loss of the Lord in order to redeem man back up into glory he could not understand that program because the devil's full of pride he think you know you know Heat there's no humility in him he could not understand how the God who created all things even credit himself could because I love I mean could walk with common man amen I mean could die on the cross in their place he does not understand how God could do this but the devil does not know not what love really is I mean but to us which are saved it is the power of God I mean so so this is a good indication if you've really met the Lord because the preaching the crossed out is the power of God hallelujah so you see that this power and the word to change and you see this power in the woods deliver you you see this power on the word to place you a man in your position in Christ hallelujah I mean so I like don't you hallelujah I love this where you know God is looking for honest hearts he's looking for honest stones and and he knows where those stones are now I just want to go to just a couple if I can let's go to our let's go to this one maybe our Lord Jesus was looking for stones and he knew where they were this is just a picture of the woman at the well I love and how God calls these kind of people does it mean you know you know I'm in that number that blood wash number Halim I remember as I seen it doesn't matter where it came from I mean it's wat who we are in God's thinking so so Jesus went before the scene and on how he dressed you know bimba this is just a your drawing someone drew try to make it yeah but yo he said I need you by the way of Samaria and the reason he needed to go there is because there was a stone he was seeking out there well clear there was a man standing upon the u.s. that was seeking out the welfare of the people I mean so there he was and remember when he seeks out our welfare when he was looking for the woman at the well for her welfare he wasn't looking at oh I need to give her a bigger house I need to give her a put it in a jar baby on eater you know our baby just give her some kind of nice I need to give her a new pot for the whelmed maybe need race you know that's not the kind of welfare then he looks for he's looking for our spiritual welfare yeah we know in the room is too well for us people it's not just a partial welfare it's a full welfare benefit hallelujah I mean I'm in full benefit so so here it is and he's coming to find the woman at the well he knew where she was he knew where the slipping stone walls amen and you know they were going to talk back and forth and then finally she says you know we we know we're Messiah cometh he'll do all these things and now here's the Builder and flesh and and he begins to reveal himself to the stone and he just says to her he that speaks of thee MP and then program said that the light that would struck the seed and she came to life and I'll say the light strikes the seed nothing can put it out I mean nothing hallelujah I mean because maybe the Lord kind of seemed well welfare even in this time when the world we have this lockdown and we have all these things going on you know the Lord's here to see how wealthy people the Lord us doesn't come and check up on us hey doing today and then go home there's not how God works I'm still with us every day looking after us protecting us guiding us comforting us we were in trouble I mean he knows the burdens we carry hallelujah you know if he's here to see Kelly now he's another one and I love the story anymore where's the here we are this is a picture of Mary at the tomb hallelujah she goes to the tomb she finds it - you know the stone all the way you know no doubt in her mind before the scene that you know that yo she is go with the other woman that you're bringing spices to thee to the - maybe now try and think in their minds how are we going to talk to the soldiers that they'll lead us in you know because there's a Roman guard around them how we're gonna convince them that yes unseal the - medicine and you know I don't know what they're thinking in their mind but that's thinking we're gonna anoint a dead body I mean but they weren't there but but in God's mind s I don't know you're not gonna come see a dead body and here to see a resurrected Christ hallelujah I mean so there she washes or troubled bimba even in this time of trouble the Lord came to seek the welfare of his people I mean that his disciples wouldn't stay troubled they once they worried in this resurrection hour remember they were living in the greatest week brother Brad Caesar in history the death burial resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ the greatest week in history said it was and here they were their will has fallen apart the one they loved was hanging on a tree dead a man crying out for mercy my God my God wash out for sake of me then they hastily wrap his body up put it in the tomb you know the disciples hid themselves away in her you know in an upper room and all these things were going on there well that falling apart yeah but I just want you to recognize young your brother Brad sees it so well we see us he wasn't just it wasn't just three it's that day he was four yeah we know and and Jesus Jesus so there's Jesus the two thieves and they were with Judas and we see now Jesus he took the repentant thief who had faith to heaven Judas took the unrepeated feat thief who had unbelief to hell so Jesus claims us and took his Judas took his until cares to his place but you see his here's the thief on the cross he had faith Lord remember when you come into your kingdom that was imputed to him for righteousness and he ended up in the same place that Abraham Isaac and Jacob did I mean he didn't do money exploits I mean he didn't do incredible things but he saw the lamb he saw the word manifested in his day and that was imputed to him for righteousness hallelujah he ended up in paradise and that's the main thing I didn't you know we struggle sometimes are we are we living a Christian life you know are we pleasing the Lord and because we love from me what a pleasing but you know you know somehow you know that kind of thought pattern puts us saved or partially saved a lot saved a man whose yeah this is okay I'm glad it's not just makes you know but you gotta wrestle in this kind of thing but actually God sees your faith I mean he sees you can you know he sees your faith he sees your faith that's a PITA to try justice hallelujah I mean so here she is now now we're just coming to the picture that I've got the air and and you know so they come to the tomb the stones are all the way there's no soldiers around you know all you know this is all going on and then she's wondering where what's happened so number one they are still brokenhearted that dear Savior the Messiah the yes but now they have another bit of anguish where's his body gone because in the Jewish and the Jewish religion so they used to believe that the body should be whole I mean because it will literally come out of the grave right so that's why they didn't believe in burning bodies in cremation and all those things they believed the body had to be buried whole but now is his body gone where's this one with their you know it's it's tough enough that they Messire is near to the tomb but now he's another piece of anguish but where is his body and then she's weeping there standing and then the Lord is standing behind a resurrected glory amen and then he says woman why are you weeping and she needs to say you know she thought he was a gardener and said have you taken him that I can go and carry him away you read it in John she wanted to carry his body away hallelujah but she wasn't mean to Carraway I did fall need me to run with a resurrected Christ the Lord with the seek the welfare is people in a time of trouble and you know we are in the same kind of resurrection cycle I mean just as they were did my brother Brian would preach the sermon Mondavi to make clear my prophecy and he goes to Luke chapter 24 and he begins to read about the - on the way toward - I forgot the term and what he is saying is he's saying these modern events who's living a modern event here we are I made clear by the prophecy which is Luke chapter 24 oh that's a prophecy so if it's a prophecy there has to be a people that live that fulfill the prophecy so what's in the prophecy the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ I mean they try and seal them away behind preaching dogmas of man I mean behind that term and then what else is in the prophecy the believers that again themselves to this Living Word this one they rejoice in that he remains back like this man and he's done incredible things and you know if rallied to him but now he's crucified and and the whole world that seems is falling apart and they don't know what's going on big trouble hello that's not a night oh wait here we are I'm in but then that's not the end of the picture in the Lord comes in another form that same one before years crucified it's now alive again and he walks with him and he opens the scripture everything concerning himself beginning from Moses he sees think of Matthew 24 - the way to run away so fast and he begins to preach them the scripture thus say the scripture is fulfilled in your is I mean but but they don't recognize that the one that fulfilled the scripture is walking with them oh yeah but he went with them all the way to Emmaus opening the scripture and it's exactly the same thing with you and I friends up our Lord isn't dead he's risen I mean he's walking upon the earth he's come to seek out hallelujah and he with you or he is going with you and he's opening this book Rory's in a bunch of history and a bunch of rules and invites a love letter and he's hoping the word I mean not just a show where he is in the scripture but to show you the scripture you know I was I was thinking you know I watch this is a few weeks ago now our first find about these kind of thoughts you know I was watching brother Bissell's testimony being read out just the first part and I was sitting there at work and such a humble sweet feeling came over me where he was you know it's amazing how the Prophet would would would go and you know he'd have a discernment line and he'd say now this is like Jesus at the wall and the woman at the well or this is like the Lord coming to a bruh Haman Sarah you know you know he'd speaking about the two going into Sodom and all those things we see but what about the royal seed you're waiting for a sign as well and then he'd go down to you know speaking about how the Lord was sitting there and your two angels are in flesh as they were talking to Abraham and then Abraham would say you know I mean I mean the Lord would ask we're sure thy wife and the and Abraham would say to him she's in the tent behind you and then our poem says now I'll turn my back to the person and he's trying to get the people to actually see you know he's not doing it as a show but he's trying to get the people to see that same God back there back in 1965 just about discernment I'm talking about God taking the scripture yeah this is where I wanted to come to at this point is that it's one thing it's it's only to me now it's an incredible thing where God would come and show you in the scripture and it's more than you working it out it's more than you trying to find a Bible character that fits your situation but you're reading through the scripture and God says that's you that's you it means just like you know you had the term reading of the resurrection and these Mary they're troubled and God comes down really he can do it comes down says you're married hallelujah I'm still here amen I'm alive I called you by name I mean this message just called you by name and then recognized I'm not dead I'm not back 50 60 years ago I'm not 2000 years ago I've been 2020 and even gonna say you're married and no one's told you he told you David's life and God says you're David he literally transports you I wish I could put this in words but I trust you understand website he literally takes you put you in those in that scripture and it's like David's not called baby's called Ben thank you to wear maybe Hannah was crying before the temple your private full the tabernacle crying for birth for life to come out of herself halogen and your and the Lord let's we put you on this and your henna Rebecca maybe Isaac whoever it might be down through the scripture God will take you Chris had that experience and what he's doing he's trying to say that as you are that person as I was gone to them on God to you because that's the thing the Prophet that it over and over again trying to get the people to see the same one is here and it started Stein's glory as the Stars I said were predestined to life there's nothing special about us didn't work this out didn't earn this thing because I was good bid or whatever no God saw the Stars laying in the field playing in the earth he saw you where you were whenever you were born he knew you'd be there hallelujah and he saw the Stars anytime to see you welfare I didn't work in the muck and mire and he didn't one you in a bunch of rooms hilarious he's not gonna take these studs because they're about in my mind I'm gonna pull them in the building of my body hallelujah and so when he came to this generation huh that's why that's why I believe the Prophet laboured so I'm not saying that this is like the woman at the well indecent should I say the same things happening today more than a gift more than just the supernatural but as God Himself coming to a generation and and he begin to cool that generation because he was looking for stones he's looking for parts of the building I mean it just like those ones when Jesus came the first time the illiterate the outcast light Legion or all the water of the well or Mary Magdalene who ever was I mean Peter James and John he came to those stones and there's something in those dogs saying I'll be placed in the building because it's a choice member God you know God doesn't forces in the body of Christ I mean he's not a bully he's a gentleman you have to concede I mean will you be placed in the building you say yes Lord I'll be placed in the building how'd he get place in the building repainted me baptized am i Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you'll be placed in the building I mean so he found us in this generation oh we can see I trust that you know when he takes you under the scripture and he shows you who you are in here because what's he been doing now what's he been doing now walking with us in these these decades he's been opening the scripture and showing everything concerning but Sonata themself but showing you in the scripture I meant to show you the same God I was to David I'll be to you the same God I was to Hannah I'll be to you the same motto was to Isaac I'll be to Solomon I'll be to use the same God I was to to remit care or I mean to see I mean the same God I was to Peter James and John I'll be to you hallelujah I mean the same things that you're the same thought I was to Rahab all be to you hallelujah no but yeah I like how the Prophet puts things now remember now I won't have time I don't think to read all the scriptures but if you're going to say Romans and and and Hebrews different places where Paul is writing he says that Abraham was justified by his faith and not only him but also all those that are the ears of the promise yes I mean as their faith that justifies us now talk about God revealing you know his faith to you right real faith I'm not doing my - human faith I know about real faith Amy so now he sees this doesn't show us the father he sees the reason our sins are covered by the blood he says blood is a danger sign to us read is a danger sign to us but it's also a sign of redemption it's a red streak of blood wine that's way all the way through the Bible you can take red and look through read it red and it looks white who's done that amen though your sins be as scarlet God looks through the blood of Jesus they're white as snow hallelujah he don't see sin any more when you've confessed your sins and took the blood of Jesus he says sin problem is over I mean God is looking for a red and you look whiter snow I want to say this because I like it when you've confessed your sins and took the blood of Jesus sin problem as Arva the problems I'm up halleluja whackers goddess looking through red and you look whiter start now I can find this now as I see if we're going to jump around a bit so we're going to jump around a bit more but maybe the Lord's come to seek our welfare now when we talk about being covered by the blood now I love the definition of the word covered it means past tense only it's happened in the past I mean covered now it means to put something on top of or in front of something in order to protect it or to conceal it yeah I mean so now sorry so when the blood was put on the doorposts and the lintel there on the Israel you're the Hebrew children's houses there you're you're in in Egypt before the Passover it was to protect them or to conceal them I mean so so when the Death Angel came and I think it was brother Jason walk and see this and it just bless my soul so much when he said you know when the Death Angel came over Egypt and and he would come to a house and had the blood on the doorpost and in his testimony his confession was I see the Blood I can't go in there I mean that was that was that this Angels you know testimony of the believers under the bloody sea like to see the blood I can't go and there are contact the first form hallelujah and as and it's exactly the same I mean in the South at when people are truly under the blood that's actually the death angels confession I'll say no no they did then you but the devil's confession I see the blood may be the devil's gonna testify but they will kiss the Flies of the bride to Pilate Jesus enemies do not find no fault in this man well then within the enemy now testifies of us saying I see the blood elio I can't get in there I see the black hole testimony of you as soon as I see the blood and we know that the blood the blood is applied when the Holy Ghost come into our life right I mean we know that token today just like Israel had a token I mean the token today is the Holy Ghost believe it so now so the devil when he testifies of you my trying to think try to make you think many things about yourself and none of them are good I mean isn't that right he never tells you that you're victorious and you and your gods proud of you and you're gonna make it and you know rules well if you're just overcoming you never ever tells you those things anyone likes me and I'm accepted and you know I'm um y'all just fit into the body of Christ and everything's like he never tells you those things you always tells you that you're not accepted no one likes you God doesn't love you God doesn't know you you don't know God you never overcome is it just me now he tells us things okay I'm glad all my friends and understand me today I mean so so he never tells you good things now but his testimony he may tell you he may put those thoughts in your mind but if he was really honest and I don't think the people really can be honest but just happy was he would say his tears I would say would be I see the blood I see these people are covered I see these people are covered by the blood now remember to cover something means um it's covered in order to protect it or to conceal it right Nima is a man that has come to seek our welfare that is the Lord Jesus Christ I mean so obese time to see how seek our welfare meaningless must come to protect us or to conceal us hallelujah so now something's covered now this just so I'm just kind of gone away with the where's the mouse gone let's go to another picture now so he came he came to protect now this is when I think I've covered now I think of flood waters this may seem a bit now this is Mozambique they had a terrible cyclone I'm not sure how many years ago but you see you see that place is covered by water once they covered so in that picture if you look at it you know if you took the floodwaters away there be roads Debbi your fields there be areas cultivated for farming may be there be sports grounds may be did be you know power pole still be ditches there be all these different things but you can't see them we - covered right they've been concealed you don't know what's under that water right you don't know what's under that water why cuz it's been covered and it's the same thing with you and I you know we have our flaws we have the bits of ourselves that you know that frustrate us you know we have our personality traits good and bad and you know but if it's covered by the blood hey follow me I mean I'm gonna have it by the blood I'm in the devil t spicy's I see the plot and God doesn't see them right why cuz we covered by the blood hallelujah amen no this is good he's another one this is this is just something that's covered you can't see what I don't know what's under that thing I don't have another photo to show you what it is I don't know is it about is it a table is it maybe some old school TV I don't know what is it who knows it's covers but all we can say is it's covered by read it's covered by a scarlet cloth Holly its hammered hallelujah so we don't know what's in it I mean it could be a it could be a cage with a bunch of snakes in it who knows but it's covered only and it's the same thing with now we know a bunch of snakes but I just want your box of snakes but I just want to give an illustration you don't know what is under that thing right it's covered that's the main thing and it's the same thing with us I mean the believer is covered by the blood memories come to seek after welfare hallelujah relevance oh so remember the sin problem is over everyone I got an announcement if you know the Lord Jesus the sin problem is over for you hallelujah no Britain would say in the position of a believer in Christ 1955 he says but God before the foundation the world for Dane that Jesus would come the perfect Lamb of God into a perfect cell that God Himself created to bring blood into the world to offer that blood that houses life and through the tearing down of this house a blood that the spirit that was in that blood cell which none other than got the holy ghost himself after that offering of that man came back and and perfected the believer he brought eternal Redemption amen now how do you get that then how see it through the blood washing up the blood taking away see if writing up sin that the Holy Ghost now I love those how he sees this that the Holy Ghost worse the believer through the blood cleansing of the soul into fellowship into his spirit life inside with Christ shut out the world and the very nature of God is in you so I love it that the Holy Spirit was the blima through the blood she had Paul I mean the love all of my life as a drawer II I mean I was drawn and I tried to hide it I tried to smother it I tried drawing there's a deep calling there wonderful when you call God began to coalesce a child come to me holy my child don't stay we come up high we come meet me hallelujah what say this the holy lowing you through the blood yes I mean cleansing of the soul into fellowship elderly I'm glad this this message is a just like a love song from glory come down maybe to awesome drawers yeah glory to God so he sees now so I'm just gonna repeat part of this cleansing of the soul into fellowship into the spirit life inside with Christ shut out the world and the very nature of God is in you still subject to mistakes but God can't see it because it's covered by the blood thank you it's covered by the blood I mean they're just saying I was you know applause under this red scarlet cloth right these still mistakes and then yep but God can't see it for you I just somehow I said Lord just take that you know I don't want us to be we should be carefree and one sense because this remember the sin sin problem is over mm right so we should not be concerned that we're gonna make no we're not gonna make it that's gonna get us there what honey bolus this message called us into a marriage it's a bridegroom all right it's not a servanthood comb it's not a tribulation call people have you know there has been a tribulation cooldown out people are preparing you know these Preppers and all different kinds of people they're getting ready for a tribulation and I believe they're being anointed to do so that's not this not my portion and that was my portion I would be more than in the air Katara's I'd be somewhere far away I mean I would be tripping I'd be pricked but but I'm not under that anointing but I'm under a bridegroom colon oinking I'm gonna marry shepper of the Lamb anointing away this one this eagle anointing does Texas back up and glory hallelujah amen so you know this is so they still mistake still subject to mistakes but God can't see it because I'm covered by the blood God can see through the blood every time he looks through the blood it looks white he looks through the blood it looks white ladies thank you yes say well what about all this demon power that's running around brother Prem ceases in fellowship 1956 that's why in Africa amongst the witch doctors in India amongst the who do they was coming they're trying to put a spell on me for all of that I didn't get scared why I knew I was covered by the blood of the Lord Jesus I had fellowship with him I talked with him he was the one directed me to go and I know that he can keep that which I've committed to him against that day who believes that I've got my salt on those hands Alleluia I'm covered by the blood weevil what is the Dibble attacks you remember God has confidence that you'll overcome and I try my job he can keep them with jobs committed to him against that day see them sit in their seat and paralyzed when they were sitting there how they called the storm and tried to shake the place down raised our hands to the heavens he thought of him and you made all things stop that storm and five minutes to Sun be shining what is it it's a hidden life consecrated away with Christ where all things become possible amen hallelujah now please go we should if we are covered by the blood I'm just I'm just looking through my notes a bit here if we're covered by the blood we should be the happiest people in all the world that's right if we are part of the building remember this message is not just some big blanket call this message is an individual call when the Lord came down on the you know you know on the plains of Mamre he didn't do a blanket call to everyone he went to Abraham and Sarah yeah write me one who stayed with Abraham and Sarah run to her blessing but he went to them that they would bring forth life that was the purpose I wasn't nothing right and when he came the you know in his first coming he came to find certain ones all right everyone has an opportunity member as I said on Wednesday you are the government in your own life you can in lockdown you could you know you can stand level four if you want to or you can in lockdown and go free and you know walk with the Lord that's your choice because it's your free moral agency but he came to find specific ones specific stones they meant no it must be the case we should have such a such love for people we share such a love and a concern for people and it should be such the spirit of Christ on us I was thinking because we're like like we're reading through the Psalms and you know many of the Psalms you know that your David will praise the Lord but they'll say basically cut my enemies off destroy them you know almost you know and and I was thinking you know we do have enemies in this life we do have critics and I think it's brother on speeds a seat you know you know everyone should have a critic because in order to be a great piece of art you have to go through the hall of critics before you can be in the Hall of Fame so so we'll have critics but to me when we read in the Psalms about David saying yo yo hey you're asking there's enemies being cut off and you know and you know that other people are either out outrightly against you or even suddenly against you it should you know trying to destroy your influence or whatever it should immediately throw us into intercession on behalf of that person do you mean I mean that's what it should do and should ever be in they deserve it I mean we all deserved help we all deserve it and but God Richard mercy found us watch this and I've redeemed us to himself and it wasn't my choosing it wasn't your one day I woke up said I'm gonna be righteous now right you know none of us have had that decision I'm just gonna be holy and I'm gonna be washed in the blood you know it no it was God's mercy you know God actually chose yeah but the man speaks in the church age book about God's sovereignty he says that be a whole other book in itself he just mentions it but you know it was actually God's choosing I'm gonna wash you on the blood I'm gonna make you in my image it wasn't our choice memorize not having a will offer on earth but God to show us mercy I mean sir and then even brother Aaron says he says you know we we wouldn't even wish we wouldn't even wish Helen out we shouldn't wish hell on our worst enemy or even the tribulation I'll say whenever we read about those cross things in the Psalms to me I mean we should be crying up an intersession for those who may be against us by doing it right and now brother Graham sees in the Uniting time and sign he says and I don't want to say too much on you know about people complaining we shouldn't be complainants yeah because I think one of the hardest things is to see a man or a woman that's constantly complaining is one of the most horriblest things is a man or woman is constantly complaining so we shouldn't be complaining amen why don't we got to complain about I'm not close on I mean witness when the service ends oh they'll be starting to eat they'll be lunch I've got a roof over my head I mean and even if I didn't have any of those things I have eternal life and it's all the matters y'all think brother Isaac said we never eat pizza while there I say what's the worst of good they could have to me I could die why is it such a bad thing I'll go to glory I think you have a dish wishing you want to die but you know what's the worst thing that could happen my soul is sealed away I'm covered by the one hallelujah we have to complain a bit hey I've always thought so I'm just reading the quote again I've always thought God keep me from it see that weakens faith all the time you want to weaken your faith complain that's what he's saying yeah I don't have it on the screen but it's there it's playback the front but anyway I can I can see that tears and uniting time inside 1963 see it weakens faith all the time you know I know as they get older each one of us we're going to get something happen and something happened and I know those little things are going to keep accumulating then as you get older they just got to but I think one of the most horrible things is for Satan to crown some person's life a crabbed old man or an old woman you see I hope that I don't get to that place I hope that I can bear it my burdens and get to a spot he says I want my life crowned with the glory of God his long-suffering gentleness meekness and filled with the Holy Ghost he said well how do I become a crab dog man or old woman he started some with young people who are in that condition they start something and it becomes a habit to complain about everything yes and then the devil just annoys that person's life but all they see now is through something's wrong something's wrong here I don't know I don't know one guard on the subject but here we are you know something's wrong over here and this is wrong and this is not right and this is how she be this and it just weakens their faith all the time and eventually it just becomes like a subconscious habit my brother Andy any preachers are just become so pioneer subconscious then everything is wrong it's negative it's bad it's never right enough oh I wish you could be this way and you're living in some nostalgia idea that if he really was there way to be good month and what happens and he's become this crabbed old man or old woman I said Lord Jesus help us ever to be a bunch of complaining it has always beat and everything give thanks that's how it could be I mean I'll just amen now I'm just gonna read two more scriptures in the anvil and then and then we're gonna in Hebrews 6 verses 10 to 12 for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which he have showed towards his name and that he have ministered to the Saints and do minister Emma God is not unrighteous to forget your work he doesn't forget what we do know that we're trying to get a reward and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end may it be not slothful but followers of them that through faith and patience and hear the promises you know it's not in my notes but I was looking last night at the word guile and the word guile isn't just someone who deceives and things but it's actually people are slothful it's actually got quite a broad definition and I read that I said lord I don't want to have guile take all the guile out of me take a look all out of me I mean we should mix getting you know we should be in this lockdown we should be changing some heavens you know we should be using this time as an opportunity to change your habits change our change our prayer life change our walk with God I mean we should be you know we should be trying to change everything that that when the lockdown ends we don't just go back into the same rut that we came out of a man amen a man came in and then he sees an x-15 8 & 9 and I'm just gonna finish this in the end and this is where I started with you're the thief on the cross and also you know how his his heart his confession was his works and by that he received salvation and God which North the hearts is x-15 8 and 9 and God North the heart spared the witness giving him the Holy Ghost even as he did unto us and put no difference between us and them purifying their hearts by faith amen we went as many times that our hearts pure had they been washed in the blood of lamb well there has a purified by faith well how did that happen with the jinn does it you know they're talking about the Gentiles well this just got to Cornelius house for a second he's praying he's seeking God an angel comes to him and says go go get Peter and Joppa he'll tell you the words of eternal life he begins to gather his people around there under expectation then he comes one that's carried the Holy Ghost carrying the word for the hour he begins to preach to them they believe what he says and while you and because they believe what he sees while yet Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost fell upon him like it did on the day of Pentecost yeah I mean they believed the word they received it that the right mental attitude towards it that wasn't foolishness to them they weren't perishing they were saved they made us the power of God unto them hallelujah and they received the Holy Ghost and what happened beautify their huts amen hello exactly it's exactly the same with you and I and I'll be washed clean I say well do you have a heart of faith for the whole Word of God not just four bits in the Word of God remember this message is to actually restore respect to faith the faith of this I enter the whole Word of God maleate not just a parts of it but to the whole thing you know like for example Peter sit on that that Pentecost repent be baptized name Lord Jesus Christ I use this little strategy because the most obvious one but then people take Matthew 28:19 and Jesus is baptized in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost and a lot of people say well I'd rather take the words of Jesus about the words of Peter now to me that's unbelief because they don't have faith in the full word of God I mean but those who provides have been returned to the faith of the fathers also actually that is Jesus speaking Matthew 28:19 is the same Jesus speaking through Peter that's not Jesus's words and then this Peters words down here the same ones speaking in Matthew train times it's the same one speaking X 338 the same thing with Paul's writings you know I've had people say to me all that was his Paul's opinion that's not important but impulse in every all Scripture is inspired by God other translate translations that says all Scripture is god-breathed right so so those hearts that we turn to faithful actually say yes this is not God's Word and in business man's opinion this is all pluses normal oh yeah that's all the Word of God so how do you know your heart has been purified by faith you actually brother Gramps in this is a sign you have the Holy Ghost you say Amen you're lucky I ain't mean to every word of God all your emotions necessarily because you could be the other wood can be correcting something and your emotions will be upset but the young you say Amen that's true and you last died your most and you just take the word yeah I'm changing amen but anyway there's a man who's come to seek out well fear no more Jesus Christ himself was coming the South they see our welfare so don't be troubled don't worry he's here walking with us I mean to make sure our spiritual welfare as exactly as he intended it to be hallelujah which is covered covered by the blood hey men oh god bless you all let's just bow hits and price y'all turn the service over back to the Chocolate jamas but if you don't want to be remembered in prayer just want to raise your hands Amen God sees your hands God sees your hearts gracious Lord Jesus I just want to say thank
