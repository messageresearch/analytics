oh Lord we love you so much and now Lord we pray that we are in the right Spirit to receive your word because you are here Lord and we honor you with your with with your presence we honor you I want to thank you we Usher in the word thank you my Lord amen great God bless you Saints um I don't know brother brother and you hooked me up so I'm not sure which one is working so I'll just move this one up anyway greetings in the wonderful name of the Lord maybe you can just be seated amen amen so I'll just take the cue from Brother Andy as to whether the sound and everything is fine so um certainly are probably to be found in the house of the Lord this morning amen Hallelujah we just thank the Lord for his grace and for his Mercy Hallelujah so we certainly happy to be found in the house of the Lord are you happy this morning amen come through a tough week so by God's grace and by God's mercy he is the one that has kept us he's the one that is protected us so we are here this morning amen Hallelujah certainly a privilege for brother Ben just to have been able to extend the invitation amen so we certainly wanted to salute him as well I think he's preaching somewhere else this morning amen so we wanted to salute him thank him for his sacrifice that he's making amen um it's a great calling I was just thinking in the week when um I was listening to the testimony of brother Ed Briscoe and he heard a lot about brother brother Brandon heard a lot about brother Ed Briscoe and then um so you know sometimes God don't show The Profit everything so he didn't sew the profiter brother obviously brother brother Ed biscal before the time so when brother Ed biscal came to the uh came to the hotel and brother Branham came and they said he was sitting there and brother bully Paul and I think brother Donny whoever was helping brother Billy said oh brother brother Eddie's here to see you so when brother Ed came in and um brother Brandon looked at him he said wow you're just a child you know because he was 27 years old and and and brother but he said brother Branham was obviously shocked to see how young he was being a pastor ministering and so we're just really happy that God has laid a call on our precious brother's heart amen it's it's amazing it's just so wonderful I believe it's it's also the praise um you know of brother Branham that's being answered I might read I I pray um later on and you can see that none of the praise that you ever make none of the praise that you ever make brother and he just tell me I can switch over to the normal Michael so you know so I'm all in your hands so yeah so we want to salute the the pastor in any you know you pray it may seem insignificant but God answered those prayers amen so yeah we want to salute also the ministers in the church brother Isaac Brother Andy whoever is still preaching a little testimony up incoming ministers um you know we want to salute the ministers we praise his brother cubain just want to say thank you for the service that you render to the church amen it's a great calling um you know you you sometimes there's some people that's in the Forefront and then there's some people that must be in the background never see you know so so we just want to say then that's that's what keeps that's what keeps the the the the the the the the thirds going there's some some parts of your body that's external and there's some parts of the body that's internal and it's hidden away somewhere and you don't see it you see the face you see the eyes you see the hands and then there's other organs that God is placed in the body and they are there but you don't see them but they are just as important it's the posit you see you know so so so um you know whatever you do you may feel insignificant you may feel well I'm just insignificant I come to church I'm just insignificant but you are maybe that small organ somewhere that is that is needed to keep the whole body going you know your little pray your presence here this morning you say ah no I'm not going to bother with going to church you know the church is full but God needs you in needs that small little organ in there you know so so that's what's keeps us going also just the the musicians our precious brother John did you appreciate the singing this morning let's give brother John a hand of a praise amen and also the rest of the musicians amen our precious brother Isaac just also playing this morning or brother Ed we just want to say we appreciate you all the sacrifices the practicing and whatever rather Armand on Wednesday night seems like he's he's going into a different dimension he's going into a different calling so while while the brothers they weren't here and they were out traveling and um so brother armande to stand in and lead the choruses and it was a blessing brother he was he said it was his first time so um yeah no that's just how things get going you know it's just that's how God works you know he will cause the others not to be there so the gift can get exposed you know um brother Branham when he when he gave his heart to the Lord and um and he was in the Baptist Church and was young and just testifying and then um brother Davies Dr Davies the past of the church saw the gift saw the saw the the the the the the eagerness that brother Branham had saw the willingness that he had to to share with with people about what Jesus can do and he opened up the pulpit for brother Branham to preach the Sunday morning and it was his first time preaching and brother Branham couldn't even read properly so sister hoped it to come and sit behind him and he couldn't read properly so she had to read the scripture he said it would be too embarrassing for him to try and read you know and she would be reading the scripture and he would be doing the preaching you know so each of us have thought to play you know it may be small whatever but you have a part to play you know part of the ministry um you were we are working in the ministry so yeah no never ever think that you are insignificant um we'll see a little bit maybe this morning how to load leads um and what the Lord does in your life it's all been pre-planed by God Amen so yeah no we we really see the hour the latest of the day it's um it's a it's a late hour wait it's a late time and we want to do everything that we can just to press on in the battle we've seen many things in the world we've seen many things in the message over the years and I'm honest with you I'm honest with you my wife we were fellowshiping just carrying on and yeah God is is really done great in marvelous things in my life you know I see it a little testimony with some of the brothers Brother Andy and his wife and it probably it's also I think it was this Monday Monday evening to see a a little bit with brother Ben and his wife of my life how God is you know just done things in my life as well growing up you know Pentecostal home and um small boy where's the small boys something there might be a bit smaller than them because I used to hold on to my mom's skirt so I think maybe three years old or something and they would be doing Outreach work missionary work my dad and they would be preaching and you know and then and we call it the cape Flats down in South Africa and I would be preaching in the Kingston infested areas and um they that was um that I was born in 73 so that was year 75 heavy Pentecostal anointing and um yeah so so that's that's how God you know my life was just how God has brought you up in a in a in a Christian home and I was just listening to the testimony of brother Pauly Paul you know and um myself I'm remembering the times you know as I was growing up and uh just laying on the carpet playing with toys I can remember and I'm playing with some toys or stuff like that and there would be country gospel music playing you know so um my mom didn't like the my mom like the old country gospel music and um very very uh quiet persons he didn't say much but very quiet and um like to play The Old Country Costco country gospel music and it was just playing in the background playing in the background and you know when I was in high school um when I came to high school but uh going off the road and trying to be the great person that you you know teenager you doing all sorts of sports and doing this and winning Awards and stuff like that so you know you lose your weight and many times I would be sitting in the in the school and the night before we would have been gone going out we would have been doing whatever we were doing the next day because they knew I was also involved in the in the in the in the youth functions of the school in the Bible studies so last night I was out in the discourse and drinking with my friends and the next day I would be in school and we were sitting in class and that and then many times I would be sitting there and doing the Bible study and then one day I heard some friends walking past me said wasn't it the guy that They carried out of the Disco last night and they was um uh now sitting in the Bible study you know and um It's amazing And when they and and I can remember as they were walking past the window I was just sitting there and you're thinking yeah and they walked and everybody left the Bible study and I was just sitting back in the in the clothes though and the songs this country gospel music just kept on keeping me you know I was just singing to myself I had a little small little blue Gideon's Bible that they used to give and I pulled out my little Gideon Bible and I was just reading and when I listened to the testimony of brother bully Paul um when brother when he he came to brother Branham you know and he said Daddy I'm you know um I bet I'm sitting in Bali you're going on a very dangerous road you know going on a very dangerous role play and he said yes Daddy I know and and then everybody Paul is crying when he gave his testimony and he says look um Satan had me he gripped he had a whole grip on me so you know and he said um brother Branham was explaining to him there telling him well brother Branham was washing his car one morning and he said Billy you know the house that we live in uh it's not our house we don't have a house brenhams never have houses they don't own anything this was given to me by the people of God you know to live in while I'm here and he said um you know what the life you love you can't live with us you can't stay with us because I'm a servant of God and I'm he said yes daddy and then he said brother Branham asked him to to turn around and give his sow his hands left up his hands and he said he he lift up his hands like this and brother Branham said to him no bully not like that stretch it out and he stretched his hands out and while he stretched his hands out he turned around and he could see the the sun and the saddle against the building on the back and it was making a perfect cross as the sun was signing and brother Branham they insult him but he uh he was standing on this point he said this side is the road of the devil the side is the road of Jesus you know and he said like this side is redemption that side you are lost that's the road of hell but decent and he says buddy you are going down this road he says it's going to take you know you're going to go down but at some point along he says you couldn't you cannot hope you are standing here you cannot hold both of these roads at the same time you know and you cannot hold both of these roads at the same time so you're standing here and your choice is to go this way and he says but I have claimed you under the blood and somewhere on this road you will turn around and come back you know and he said he was just listening to his dad and you know and and it was that he's just giving his testimony and he said he left and he's relating that while down the road he was standing at a at a you said you like to play cards and he was standing in a poker game and it was coming into this place wherever they were playing the game and he walked in and he was standing there and told the guy that he wants to play and they said to him no it's a close game it's been pre-selected who can play this game card game or whatever it was it's been pre-selected who can play and he said no but I I would like to play um you know and one of the other guys that was in there walked over and he said let him play this is Reverend William Brennan's son so he used brother branham's name and who brother Branham was so that they can allow Bali to play and uh brother Paul looked at him he says no I'm not his son he says he said he looked at him he said I'm not his son I'm not I'm not I'm not his son he said there was something in him that realized knowing what type of person brother Brandon was there was something in him that just could not identifying playing cards with brother Branham and he said in that defense of brother brain I'm trying to defend him not being but I said but you are he says no I I'm not not in this condition and then he never ended up playing he never ended up playing the game so there's there's while you lost somewhere in the world it's a little piece of God somewhere there's something somewhere I can remember when I uh you know would go out with a friends and you know one one evening I don't know what happened and they must have done some stuff with my Coke and um they they say they carried me home and my mom opened the door up till today um that's what my friends told me my mom never ever spoke to me she's never ever spoken to me about that day being um at that time being um you know leaders by then by then I think they had started a few churches already different churches which they then handed over so they never spoke to me about that evening and when my friends I think a few days later when I said hey Don we carried you into your room into your house you know your mom opened the door and I was like Wow and I believe it's the praise of my mother that carried me through that one day when I came in contact with the word of the hour amen I one day when I came in contact with the message of the hour that I could be a testimony of God's grace and mercy Hallelujah so no matter where somebody might be no matter what a child may be doing no matter what they be doing um uh you know latest neighbor as we also listened last night my wife came across something very nice of brother bully Paul let us never embarrassed embarrassed them try to to portray that we are Holier if somebody is in the world or somebody is a sinner and they don't know let us never come across that we are more holy or better than them tomorrow that person might become converted may give their heart to the Lord may serve the Lord and you you've embarrassed that person somewhere along the road you know so so always have that that good spirit and yes as time went on I might have seen a little bit you know I think it was it was somehow just taking another two to five minutes and um we were living in another area very very rough area and then we moved out of this area to another Another Part of of the city which was a bit more stable um and when we move there I I decided no I'm not I'm not joining the new school and my sister name went my sister she went there I said no I'm gonna I'm gonna carry on going to this old school where I used to go and um I used to Hawk so now because we moved it used to be about a 10 minute walk from our house now it was an hour walk for me in the morning and I was about I was about 10 years old 10 11 12 10. you'll see the South African standard three so yeah and I would walk this hour in the morning and another hour in the afternoon hour in the morning and it carried on like that and I don't know up till today why they never forced me to change School my parents you know and um they left me they said if you want to carry on with that school it's fine you know so I just carried on and then some others walking to schools has got to me it was just too long by the time I had to leave my sisters just got up and I have to leave already and when I got back ah they were playing outside already and I thought I'm changing schools I said no I said to my mom oh no no no I said no enroll me the school was just down the road like just down here and I took our walk my I was not even seven minutes walk and I walked an hour and they said okay arrange everything and then on a on a day just then any day and odd day you know another particular day start of a a new um yeah or whatever just any day they said ah next week we'll take you they arrange everything you can come next week I said yeah fine next week so whatever my dad was working night shifting whatever so at this particular day it was off and right tomorrow we'll take you to the school so it was not on a Monday evening I think it was on a Wednesday Wednesday not in the beginning of a particular semester or quarter whatever it was not in the beginning of a year it was just a random day out of a space of time of 10 million years just a random day and when I got to the school sitting there in front at the back day and looking at brother could be and I'm sitting there by the principal's office like that and then as brother brain him sitting brother they see the sister sitting there so another boy was sitting like that and he was sitting there and I'm looking at him and he's looking at me and he also came to enroll in the school on that day and the teacher came to fix us and And she said Oh Come Oh you come to both of us hope and we ended up being in the same class and she put us right next to each other both of us right next to each other so odd day no time no no all day this at the same class I walked home and as I walked home he walked home in the same road that I'm walking I'm turning left he's turning left but he's walking on the other side of the road I'm walking on this side of the road I'm turning this way he's turning this way and as I'm walking I find out he's living here I'm living here and we just live right across each other and the reason why for the time I never saw you was living with his Grandmom because his mother had passed away a few years back and his grandmother he was staying with his grandmother oh he at this particular time felt you also wanted to long story sword when the two of us were sitting in this particular bins right next to us was another boy so myself this boy on this odd day and right next to him was another boy and we made friends with him and a few weeks later we started playing and whatever we did and he invited us to his house this boy the two of us that has come to join the school and the two of us became very best friends we became best buddies best friends for years after today he's still my best friend you know and we became best friends the two of us and then this was now the triangle was complete this was the other boy and he invited us he said we must come to his house and we walked into his house and I'll never forget when I walked into his house when I came in the very first thing that struck me we don't have the pictures up here but the very first thing that struck me as I walked in as they opened their front door they had the cloud picture Mount Sunset they had the cloud picture up and I walked in and I can remember and that I looked at this wow this is whatever and then I walked in and then I saw another picture and it was the one of brother Brennan with the Halo on his head and um as time went on we would visit my friend a lot and when we would visit there we were coming in there we were doing you know now you're going from primary school to high school now you're becoming teenagers now you're coming in there and you're coming in with you or whatever your clothing and you are in your skimpy t-shirts and your vests and you are just building muscles and my friend was always he was always dressed nicely and you know and I mean now I know but he you know and I would come there with my swords and hat and his dad would always talk nicely to us he's there to say sit down give us a coffee and as as we were in high school this friend do sometimes we would be sitting and then he would be telling us about a man that met an angel in a cave and this is not myself this friend and that boy and as we were growing up this boy would be telling us things about a man in a cave that met an angel about Los Angeles that will sing about stuff and and we were arguing I was arguing with him because I know the scripture my dad is uh my dad is a bishop you know I know everything I know everything man and he was telling me and then sometimes he would invite us when they used to have youth meeting I would be going there as well and they come there and I'll come there in my whatever dress the way I am and and I'll tell you that you know just the youth here now they say something about the hair is the covering of the human you know my mom name the Pentecostal day that time they were very very much you know you have to just follow what whatever they believe was and she would always have a head covered you know many people after the day that she passed on they never they never knew they knew her hair and they always knew she had very long hair but see you know they were Pentecostal people and I would come they said no no no no they must be covered and I was fighting years later God calls that we left the area we were building a house my dad lost his job the house got auctioned off and we moved out of the area when I moved out of the area now my friend the best friend we both started working at like what you would call your Pax pack and save so when we went high school we started to work working school holidays weekends we started working there and when we moved out of the area I didn't see much of him and one day I came to work because we only made it to work you know we only made it to work after school on Fridays and Saturdays and I came I haven't seen Mata beam it was matricid during the time that we had to write matric exams and I was just isolating and it was a final year and didn't see much of him and one day I came to work and I was wearing my swords and I was carrying on like I normally did and I saw my friend the space friend sitting with the Bible and sitting with a small book any sitting there and as I'm walking in he said to me Donnie now you know friends are friends you know you don't tell you can't you can't go say the same thing to somebody that doesn't know the message of the hour but a friend that's why God knows how to use people and he just said to me he didn't see me for months now he just said to me why are you wearing this the sauce that you're wearing you know God has no desire in the legs of a man and I'm looking at my friend like what's wrong with him you know and slowly he started as he was sitting there he started gave me a scripture for it he said to me go read one Psalm 147 verse 10. he said go read that script so I always remember that scripture my friend just gave it to me Psalm 147 verse 10 go read it and wow I mean the evening I read it's actually right and slowly God used him and the word came to me and a few months later I um you know God just threw me in threw me in I gave a little bit of an extended testimony to some of the people and yeah and I came to the message of the hour and then the next battle was in her in the home because my mom then there were Pentecostal people and I had to come and I had to stand for the message of the hour and had to start telling them and I had my my Bruce Lee pictures up and all the karate pictures up and I started peeling all these things off and I had brother branham's pizza and I had a eagle picture and they thinking what's wrong with this boy and I grew up in the church I grew up in a church at our house if they had Services sometimes on a Sunday sometimes they didn't travel to the church because they had they headed in a school then some some of the people when they were done they would come to our house and then they would have services and then when they when they would be singing they would be so under the anointing and singing and singing and just happy and then they would be dancing outside around our house and nobody they didn't care the neighbor saw them so so I knew what is the height of what you would call the the Pentecostal experience I've seen speaking in tongues I've seen all these things yet when I came to something else I pulled pictures of my wall so what was this this is you know when when I came to something else I I told them that God requires a higher you know dedication and yet Pentecost is the highest and that's just God's grace and mercy and one day they decided that's enough they're going to drive out this this demon or whatever I'm following out of me and my dad by then they had started a lot of churches so they called a lot of people to come and drive the demon out and um I was laying in my room and a few days before that I was reading Cod questioning answers my brother Branham says Let Me Take You Before Time let me transport you a million billion years before there was ever an atom or a molecule and then he speaks of how you were there way way way way way back in the mind of God and I was reading this now this is the first time I mean I I was in the height of the Pentecostal realm I know everything and and I've never heard somebody preach like this so this was something different and I mean I could not put that book down and in that week while I was in my room I still don't know whether it was just a dream or trance or whatever and there was just this um tremendous prison in the room you know just in a tremendous praise and as I opened my eyes the whole room just was like like like you know um just Sprite and um I just got a conviction to to actually request that I'd be baptized and I asked the brother can I be baptized and he said yeah you will arrange for the pastor and I was baptized and a few days later I didn't know what was what was coming you know and a few days later I'm laying in my room you know come from University laying there and um my dad had arranged with all the churches everybody to come they they really need all the support of the Believers to drive this demon out so a lot of people the cars were packed around they're going to drive out this demon out of me and I didn't know you know I'm laying in my room and I knew that was my time that I would be resting and then they would be coming in and when I woke up I'm laying in next thing I see my door open they knock can they come in here walked in and the whole room was specked with pastors they are right around my bed everybody was there my room was spec my aunts all the people that were in the church they just the whole house was full of people and they're gonna drive out whatever I'm believing this thing that I'm believing here and then you started praying and started carrying on and they're gonna they're gonna now drive out this demon whatever I'm following you know because I'm I'm abnormal you know and I don't know I just got up and I just said in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this is the true word next thing I don't know I everybody left my room I don't know how it happened I I don't know what happened but I know it was must have been a tremendous power in the room because I felt the same prisons that I had when I was when God convicted me to be baptized in the room and everybody was out of the house out of the room people were just out of the house everybody was out you know I just say this is the true word of the Lord Jesus Christ you know everybody was out I don't know some of my aunt Sons there they up till today I made him at funerals in readings sons that they up till today I think I was about 17 18. some of my aunts never ever spoke to me since that day so I don't know what happened you know um it's just God's grace and and true that by that God's mercy he has just taken me further and further and we've seen many things this morning and we've seen many things you know by God's grace this morning we can just say it's it's it's his loving kindness that is better than life I can I can say like brother buddy Paul when he was standing at a poker game when he left there and then obviously when he went and when they were going to operate on him cavey's testimony when he left home found lost lost along the way and then he stopped in his Testament he said never leave home you know never leave home and I cannot test I mean I never left home but I can really say he said when he was laying on that bed he told him call Daddy and for days they couldn't get a hold of brother Branham and they said Billy we'll cut out whatever they to cut out he'll carry a little bag for the rest of your life for the rest of your life you'll carry this little bag and he said it was where's Daddy and he said if daddy wants to stay here you know and he said the lord gave him the privilege to see the angel and I won't go into that now and he said then wow brother Brennan was on a camp with a family Revenant said the angel appeared to brother Branham and said you better make your way down to bully anybody was finished they were just about to go and operate and then the next thing he said he just felt a hand on him and he looked and he said there was his daddy and brother Branham said to him bully the angel the one that God allowed for you to see he's come to call me out of the hoods to come here and then brother Brennan was speaking he says daddy pray for me and then brother Branham he said that he said to him nobody you are the one that went off the road you have to repent and I will pray for you so you know and and that that's just God's grace and his Mercy we may think that our children away what we just have to stay calm we may think that our family members we may think of your mom your brother your sister just relax don't worry don't worry don't worry about your brother and your sister and your mom and your dad all we have to do is testify to them don't convince them brother Ed biscal said one thing that is learned when you swim brother Brennan was speaking to him it was a it was a difficult time for him because on the one hand people were telling him about things and they said that Brennan was a false prophet and the other hand God allowed him to meet with brother Branham and more and more he started realizing but this is the real thing this is it what brother Brennan was saying what brother he saw the real things and he had troubles in his own heart and when they were on a little Camp he felt his heart and packed his bags he had to leave and then brother Bradham told him came into the tent sit down and said to brother Ed brother Ed don't worry they won't take the church from you he had three problems that he had in brother random named all three and it was only in his heart he said you see it earlier this morning when I took the horses across the river the Lord appeared unto me and he said to me what's burdening in your heart and brother Ed said brother never tried to convince anybody he just tried to tell him about of the goodness of Jesus and you know the wonderful thing is that um years a few years later my mom and two sisters passed away in a motor car accident I was driving in the one car they were driving in another car they never came to the message of the album they never came to the message of the hour right but I believe that they will be there I believe there will be they right um so rebellum says all that love you and all that you love will be there now I don't know how it's going to be I can't explain it all that you love and all that love you they will be thee so if you have a little cat or a dog they're going to be there now if God is gonna have your little bird over there because you love that bird I if he's going to have brother branham's dark fruits over there you know the fruits was poisoned the policeman poisoned brother branham's dog Fritz brother Brandon was very very sad about that and he left home because of that because he was going to go kill the policeman it was not converted in and he said when he was taken across the curtain of time in fact it was the millennium because in occurred enough time when he was taken over he actually saw his dog over there so if God is going to have your dog over there don't worry the old mom that gave you that food your dad had looked after you so nicely that honed you from all the wrong things he may not be in the message of the hour all that you love and all that love you they will be thee and that just takes all the praise of you to just live a normal normal humble Christian Life you don't have to exert yourself you don't have to fight you don't have to try and convince them you don't have to try and write emails and put things on Facebook to convince your mom and dad and your aunts and uncles that's lovely we do that what is the Lord leads but it just takes all the praise of you it's all in the hands of the Lord amen so brothers and sisters can we stand amen I trust that a little Testament it wasn't long just blessed your heart amen Hallelujah so we'll just read in the book of Genesis chapter 37 amen Book of Genesis chapter 37 and then we'll read another verse out of the Book of Genesis 45 verse 3. amen so I've got about 40 minutes left to preach the sermon to finish by trial so we'll just see how the Lord leads us amen it's really wonderful really enjoy the singing this morning it was really blessed really blessed our hearts brother it's wonderful amen let's read Genesis 37 amen one to five oh sorry 15 to 19 15 to 19. and a certain man found him and behold he was wandering in the field and the man asked him saying what Seekers thou and he said I seek my brethren tell me I pray thee where they feed their flocks and the men said they are departed hence for I heard them say let us go to doton and Joseph went after his Brethren and found him in Dothan and when they saw him afarov even before he came near unto them they conspired against him to slay him and they said one to another behold this dreamer cometh was Genesis 45 . amen I'll just read one verse for now verse 3 then Joseph said unto his brethren I am Joseph dot my father yet live and his Brethren could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence it is as close eyes I mean Hallelujah father God we just bring your word this morning father we pray that you just come and answer nice the word Lord break it to our hearts father God says come Lord and Lord is we prepare our hearts to listen to you Lord as you speak to us by each and every one oh Father this morning may they receive their personal father Lord dear Jesus may you take the vessel out of the way this morning and may Lord God by your grace and by your mercy you'll get all the glory this morning Lord at the end of the service may we say like those men of Amos did not our hearts burn within us as he speak to us along the way father there's someone this morning that has a special need father somebody that seek somebody that's a desire in the heart made by the word father is you speak to us may they find the answer of God may you come in Lord God mend every broken heart this morning may you answer every question this morning father as we come at all in Jesus name amen you may be seated amen so we are certainly blessed this morning to be found in the house of the Lord I'm using my daughter's tablet because mine was stolen so it's just um wonderful I just want to read something for you out of the title this morning just taken out of Genesis 45 is verse 3 I am Joseph I am Joseph amen Amen brother Branham says here he says this is out of the Revelation series brother brilliant preacher Series in in the in um I think it's in 60 60 between the 60 the last in the month of December 1960 he preached the whole Revelation series after they preach I think the third sages upon my heart the Holy Spirit had laid this warning of conviction that the church in this day should have this message because I believe that it is the most outstanding message he says here of the Bible because it reveals Christ in his church at this time and then no one can have faith or know what they are doing or whether they are or where they are going unless they have some something to base their thoughts and faith upon therefore if the scripture is revealed Christ to us in these last days and the condition of times it will do us good to search the scripture he says here find out where we are at so you want to know where you are going you want to know what's the direction you should take in life you want to know what decisions you should make tomorrow you want to know whether I should do this and that he says no one can have faith he says unless they have something to base their faith upon so you must have something to base your faith upon you must have an absolute so if you're not going to be sure is this right is that right sit down do this should I do that you don't know what are you doing is right amen and he says it never dawned upon my heart so much until the last election so it's 1960 brother Branham 57 something happened 56 he starts he starts feeling the presence and he's now after the election and then he realizes and he's reading this and this is when JF Kennedy was was elected and I said and then I seen where we are at and the Holy Spirit begin to reveal to me to hone the people and to place this he says and I cannot decease the church like this sufficiently and then if I sit down and wrote a book I feel that if I got to the pulpit then the inspiration of the Holy Spirit amongst the Christians Came Upon me to help me then I would be more sufficient to write the Books of brother Branham wanted even to to Europe and he wanted to write some stuff because you know he felt it anointing he sees the hour now he wants to bring it over and and he says I even want to write a book so that you can see where we are at no he goes in he's speaking of Revelations The Book of Revelation now we will do everything we can he says here this morning I'm starting here first chapter of Revelation The Book of Revelation and a revelation is set in three parts The Book of Revelation is set in three parts first three chapters he says is what we'll be dealing with in these eight days when one Church AIDS could take us a month but we'll just have to hit the high places and we call it then we get to the book this he says yeah it will be written out in more detail now Revelations the first three chapters deals with the church he says the deals here you see all the way from Ephesus to lodicia the first three chapters then then the church disappears we see it no more until the end time from Revelations one two three the third then he says from Revelations 4 to 19 is Israel a nation so Revelations one two three deals with the church 4 to 19 Israel a nation right then he says now the third part in 19-22 is now the third part so Revelations one two three the thirds and 4 9 to 19 Israel 19 to 22 is both of them together and the plagues and the warnings and so forth at the end sit in three parts see now you can't also just take it in another place but Abraham says you can't run it chronological like that because you'll get confused because between 4 and 19 there's a lot of things happening between Revelations 4 and Revelation chapter 19 a lot of things happening and if you take it chronologically like this because in other places you can't take it chronologically you now have to have Revelation right so he says because there's things happening in between there in between there that he deals with the Gentiles right because when he's done with the church ages the book is a tremendous wonderful book it runs up and if you can open your Bibles fast in Revelations chapter 4 it runs up to a certain point and from that point onwards he's done with the Gentile Church he's done with the 10th outside Revelations is finished one two three is done now he's telling you this over here that now he deals with Israel from Revelations 4 to Revelations 19 he's right he's right but remember he is now from Revelations 4 onwards he's not dealing with the church but he's dealing with the bride so so brother Brandon doesn't say that in that quote he says to you he deals with the church he says he deals with Israel and he says he deals with both of them together but Revelations 4 there is a different thing happening there is the Gentiles it has come Hallelujah to him the bride and they have been called out so let's go to Revelations 4. Hallelujah so so this this this oh this Bible is just alive it's just a wonderful book and brother Branham says this book is called the he says Revelations it means the unfolding the unveiling he says it's a great Revelation is an apocalypse and opening up Hallelujah so so so it's God unfolding the word all the time it's a great unfolding so now Revelations 1 to 4 you see that you might even see it in your Bible if you look at the Revelation 3 to 14 which is the you might have it on your Bible so I'm just stopping there first verse 14 says 3 14 and unto the angel of the Church of laodicea laodicea is the last search age if you go back and you read back back you'll find now there's seven thirds ages so he's taken you all the way from Revelations one I'm the one in the midst of the candlesticks I am this great one we'll touch a little bit just on the quote but then he goes and he goes in the third ages Revelations 3 he speaks of lodicia the world that we are in I am rich I have need of nothing and that's the spirit of the day see people have no need of anything anymore they were not like the forefathers they they struggled to get something so they had to believe on God they had to trust God they had to do to know we can do it ourselves that's load easier we can do everything ourselves Hallelujah and that is the spirit of laodicea so now I'm not talking about 2021 behold I stand at the door knock I'm now past so now Revelations he's 21 he's now even 321 he's even being put outside the church and then it's a Dimensions change happens right a dimension Saints verse 4 tip to four one after this so now you've seen what happened John on the Isle of Patmos after this I looked after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven different dimension Paul said I was caught up in the heavens of the heavens I was scored up in the dimension of the dimensions Hallelujah so what we're dealing with here wow I should have actually put a picture on I don't know if you've seen the picture of brother Brandon preaching they pull it on fire over there you might have seen it when the little Lily just became bigger amen and brother Brandon was preaching and they were behind him was in the polar fire was a face it was like an Indian behind him you know and brother relates about that he said it was his old mates are always haunting him always chasing him that you know that nature and and but in that and what with brother brother was standing there when that picture was taken I think it is Zechariah or Isaiah one of the prophets they actually saw that and they prophesied about and they saw it they said and around his lawyers he says curded with stripes of pillars of fire and you see how it makes types of color on fire so what we are dealing with in the message of the hour we are not dealing with Building a Church after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven so that's why in brother brenham's Ministry brother Branham things that happen in his life things that happen in his ministry that serves his head to else brother Branham right they had to think and they said he spreads present states of my Ministry he preached my new ministry it was a stage where the pool the first spool was was throwing the people all over you could see yeah I mean I listened this week to brother Sydney Jackson I listened to his testimony this week he said people in Durban South Africans Johannesburg when people were coming still they were still coming to the racetrack right they were still coming there to the the one was in the racetrack in Durban I think the other one was in the what a big building of the Railway Station that they're using Johannesburg but he said the roads were blocked off and he says people be coming what their wheelchairs people were crutches in the lakes with pieces of Steel and as they got out of the ambulance they pulled it off and they walked into the services Hallelujah so you talk off you talk of a a different pool that was pulling them and it was right around the world bully poor relationships we would want to go home and we're playing outside we come in I want to grab a donut on the kitchen table I couldn't the whole table is fully I was laying full with tickets from all air tickets flight tickets from all over the world for Daddy and we couldn't get to our little Donuts to eat so you took off that pool and as time went on no more tickets on the table this man is stopping off serpent seed this man is talking this and that and God was changing the pool first he was throwing out that net pulling in pulling in and people were coming coming and then later on Jesus was walking with him and then Jesus started saying that you must eat my flesh and drink my blood and the people saying what's wrong with this guy what's wrong then he didn't come now and say bring bread I'm going to feed all of you it was a Saints in Jesus ministry what Jesus was saying is uh you must come now to a different realm and then it so happened that people you know the crowds were there when he took that boys three fishes and and two loaves of bread he fed five thousand only the men and the boys what about the females the Bible said so maybe it was ten thousand people from that he Faith so there was a big following when he came to this point so many things started happening in his ministry because he gave The Sermon on the Mount he started giving different things he says you know your mother and father you must forsake mom and dad you must forsake your father you must leave your mother and you just say who in the people started leaving him what was he saying leave your Traditions leave your old way of doing and Jesus was wanting them to come to a different realm and then the crowd was starting to move out maybe there was only 85 or 100. and then the Bible says and that 70 also left him when he's my when he said this saying that you must eat my flesh and drink my blood they also lived and then he turned to Peter them and he said to them do you also want to leave leave you see that so you can see this message that we're dealing with it is completely different it's not such ages is after this I looked it's something in a different realm and then Peter said to him Lord where can we go we can't go anywhere you alone have the words of eternal life so so so so the the and brother Branham says nothing in Peter men kindly speaking could say that but it was granted to him from the father above to say that Lord I don't know where to go I can only stick with you you have the words of eternal life Hallelujah and that's what you do you know brother Branham says it one place he says that related to you in the Revelation series brother Branham says that this Revelation is for a special class of people it is for the it's for a special class of people not everybody can see this word not everybody can see this message of the day it's for a special group of people Hallelujah let me see if I can find it for you yep there he is let me see and the Book of Revelation has more symbols he says in it then all the rest of the books in the Bible it is more symbols because it is a book of Prophecy now this is the Book of Revelation it's the last book but it's a book of Prophecy it was not prophesying he says it's a prophetic book therefore it has to be understood by a prophetic class brothers and sisters you you don't know you are like that woman that came to the well there was something in you this book is not meant for everybody he says there's nobody can hardly understand it this book is made for a certain class of people he says here over in Deuteronomy it says the hidden things Belongs to the Lord so you are like that woman in the world a special class of people that can live in your son that you are busy with right that is a party to play out if you follow the life of Joseph if you follow in between Joseph after he was rejected by his Brethren right in between there they speak of Judah and how Judah went into a harlot and one of the sisters Tamar played the part of our hearts he was supposed to be married to Jesus Son and said him and Judah never gave her the son he forgot about the promise and what she did she dressed herself as a harlot she said by the gate and he went in unto her and she said well if you come in unto me to raise up seed what are you going to give me and he gave his ring he gave his bracelet do you want to read it let's read it quickly Hallelujah this is this is we we we're dealing with a tremendous thing in the hour that we are busy with Hallelujah let's just read it in Genesis amen so you you'll see what our lives is all about God doesn't do things has it God doesn't do things for fun no brother Branham says this whole Bible is it's inspired this whole Bible is it's a book of redemption it's a book of how God hallelujah is trying to make that whole plan known amen so here it is let's just see here amen I read it in the week okay okay sorry I just want to go back here amen I think it is hey man just trying to get this one here 37. yep there we go great Genesis chapter 38. so we'll go back to Joseph but we just want to throw this in quickly right and it came to pause at that time that Judah went down from his Brethren and turned into a certain adulamite whose name was Hira and Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was sure and he took her and went in unto her and see conceived and bear a son and he called his name air and C conceived again and bear a son and she called his name Onan and see yet again conceive and bear a son and called his name Cellar and he was he says here at Jason and see bear him and Judah took a wife for air his firstborn whose name was Tamar and air Judas firstborn was wicked in the in the sight of the Lord he says here the Lord slew him he says in Judah said unto Onan go in unto thy brother's wife is obviously the tradition was he says you're going on to the end or marrying her and raise up seed to thy brother and owner knew that the seed should not be his and it came to pass when he went in unto his brother's wife that he spilled It On The Ground lest he should give seed to his brother and the thing that he did displeased the Lord wherefore he slew him also his daughter-in-law remain a widow at thy Father's House told Selah my son be grown for he said Lester Adventure he die also as his Brethren did and tomorrow went and dwelt in a father's house and in process of time so you see this boy must have been about five or seven when he say this wait till he's grown up then you can have him and that's I've lived in the East and I've worked there that's exactly what they do when they say this uh the Boyer side or they say even the scripture when the scripture would say sometimes and um Soul reigned and saw rain in the state of David and then they say who how could he have reigned he was only seven years old but they they the rain is given to him till he's reads maturity that's how they do it so you they say I'm your husband but they wait till you are reach a stage of maturity so they were set aside for each other so that's what he did right and and in process of time the daughter of Seward judah's wife died and Judah was comforted and went up to see Furious all of them not to terminal sorry he and his friend Hira did a dilemma and it was still tamas saying we hold thy father-in-law go out up to terminal to seriously and she put her Widow garments off from her soul Mary died second one died now she's still mourning she's putting over Widow the garments right and covered with and covered her would a veil and ripped herself and sit in an open place which is by the way of temnot and she saw that Sheila was grown and she was not given unto him to wife according to the promise of Judah was supposed to keep the promise and he did not and Judah saw her now she's playing she's sitting there let me read this slowly sorry I'm going a bit faster and she put her with his garments off from her and covered her with a veil right I'm a bit conscious of time because I was thinking maybe there's this evening service you know you're pressing because you're looking at the time so you know but we don't have evening service do we so praise God I won't be too long just want to throw this one in he says here and sit in an open place which is by the way of timna for she saw that seller was grown and she was not given in and given unto him to wife and Judah saw he taught her to be in Harlot so what she did heard where he was going take off a widow clothes trust yourself as a harlot and sit in this place because she had covered her face and he turned unto her by the way and said go to I pray thee let me come in unto thee for he knew not that c was his daughter-in-law now I'm just stopping this here I've read a scripture for you out of out of Genesis 37. something happened with Joseph came unto his brethren and when he came unto his Brethren his Brethren said behold the dreamer cometh and you can go read what happens further in Genesis 37 where his Brethren took him took off his coat of many colors threw him in the pet will relate on on that now they sold him for 20 pieces of silver well brother Branham says Joseph is a perfect type of Jesus Christ he's a perfect type of Christ in his first coming he's also a perfect type of Christ in his second coming was thrown into the pit came out of the brother Branham says the blood on him he says Jesus Christ the first coming thrown into a Putin overcame raised then in the second coming which will touch on a little bit later he also is portraying the second coming which will touch on further from Genesis from Genesis 42 on which we'll touch on it but now here is Joseph then the story in Genesis chapter 37 all of a sudden it stops and then God brings in the story of Judah in Tamar God interrupts he interrupts the the story of Joseph here is Genesis 37 Joseph he talks of Joseph then he interrupts it with one scepter and then Genesis 39 he carries on with the life of Joseph he's sowing something significant in between that it is a Redemption to a gentile people that is sowing in between there that's happening because Joseph is a he plays a part in brother Branham says that he's the perfect type of Christ Hallelujah a perfect type so he interrupts his program and he throws something in the Bible and if you read the Bible you will say but I think they should have taken Genesis 38 and just put it somewhere else because it's interrupting it's talking about Joseph and it brings about Judah and what he did and all these bad things and then all of a sudden it carries on with those of God it's perfect Hallelujah so so let's carry on and he turned in unto her a right verse 16. I pray they let me come in unto thee for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law and she said what will thou give me what will you give me if you're gonna come in unto me I'm playing the spot of a holiday but what are you going to give me and he said I will send thee a kid from The Flock and sees it will thou give me a plate till thou send it and he said what place shall I give the NC seed thy Signet right so first he asked for a Signet die bracelets and I starve so she asked for those three items Judah being a ruler Judah being rich you know having all because they were and she's saying to him I want these three pieces from you I want your Signet I want your bracelet and I want your staff that that it is in thine hand that is in thine hand and he said it and and he gave it unto her and came in unto her and she conceived by him and see a rose and went away and laid by a veil from her he says yeah and he and put on the Garment of a widowhood so he changed the game went back put who we don't on again playing a drama playing a part playing a part of a harlot she was not a harlot she played a part of a harlot to make the promise come to pass and brother Branham says through her King David into David came Jesus that same limits so she played a part of a harlot and that very lineage goes through and through her comes David and through David comes Jesus now this hectare God is God is great why would Jesus eventually want a son arise the one which is the savior the Conqueror why would he arise through the limits of an harlot brother Branham says it's the Redemption he says you were he says here you see he said you had no desire to serve God you lived in this world the way you are living you came to the world speaking lies Hallelujah let me just read this further you came to the world speaking lies but he said but you had no power to play in it you only put on the garments of ahalat is you arrange with God before the foundation of the world God asked you do you want to go and represent me on Earth you said yes he asked you what trials do you want to have brother Branham says every trial that you have you pre-arranged it with God he says he's a gentleman God is a gentleman he asked you but he says you see you can't remember now because you have amnesia way back before there was an atom of the molecule he said you and God you were sitting and having conversations and he says there's a scripture that you can pick up when job was sitting on the Airship and he was despondent God called job one side rejected by his friends and his family God God said job come here a minute he says let me take you before there was a world he says let me take you before there was a world let's go before there was time and job was sitting there having been feeling sorry feeding all my friends looking at the situation I've lost my kids I've lost this he said job where were you so God has brought you into a space of time and you forgot that you were up there so God allows grace and mercy by the message of the hour to come our way so by the message of the day God asks you the question when you read something in the message of the hour all of a sudden you say you you feel wow it's like an angel was it I never saw this I never saw this wow wow is this what heaven is about you all of a sudden you realize wow I said oh you are always a Son of God you are always a daughter of God and God wow is this and now he says you see what he's doing you're sitting on the Airship he's telling you where will you drop in job said he said job where were you when the star sung and the sons of God shouted for Joy all of a sudden job realized but I was one of them that shouted God stuck his Amnesia away and it was all done for job brother Branham says one day one day you will realize that the god that you serve is not out there it's not in heaven he's not in clouds somewhere you will realize one day now he said it it was the same one that said to that little girl he was the same one that made a prophecy he's the same one it prophesied us and it came to to pass now he said the same thing he said one day you will realize that God is in you now he's the same one that said in 1933 by Vision there will be a car come people will play a little game it will be a round saved call we all people are now on Facebook they're all getting excited about that I said to my wife get off Facebook now you now you read more the spoken word now because they're going to be going there and saying yes yes yes we have to now go and hide ourselves more in the message of tower that is just showing you this one of the things but that same one that said they're that and it comes to pass it's the same one that said one day you will realize the god that you serve is not a god out there he's a god inside and he says when you realize God is in you he says it will be all over for you you know there was a man in the Bible called Enoch now I'll just translate it in Afrikaans I preach sometimes you know in South Africa I preach the different groups and people so there's a man I said I must you know in Afrikaans you know so his name is Enoch so this man one day because he was the seventh from Adam if you go and count if you count the different sons and we did it with a with the children in the in the in the Sunday school lessons he was the seventh one from Adam so he typed the Bride of the end time he was a type of the bride and he was doing his farming and he was doing his things and one day he realized by Revelation that he is a type of the Bride and he called his wife and he called his children and he said to them I'm going to take a little hope this afternoon daddy where are you going he called the eldest he told him he helped mommy with this put that in place put this in place he told the daughter you know don't do just carry on stay modest dress yourself you tell this one do that then he told the wife look nice to have like where are you going I'm taking a walk this afternoon and brother Branham says and Enoch hoped and as he hoped wherever it was he just walked out of his body he just walked the one minute he was there in the next minute he took a step and he was gone but Brandon says that's how simple the Reps is going to be that's how simple the Rapture is going to be we are a people that is called to that type of calling when job was sitting there he said to himself where were you and so realized but I signed a contract with God I said to him I would want to go down and I would want to represent you on Earth and that's what each and every one of us are doing each and every one and you know come and tell you something brothers and sisters that the the trial that you have the test that you get on your life things that you that come across your life a test your husband your wife your at work or whatever and you you see brother Donny here in front I'm preaching I have a trial I have a taste you have one do you know that I will not be able to to stay in the artist I will not if if whatever comes your way no matter who you are it's insignificant or small I might never be able to stay in your test because your test was given for you and God knew before the foundation of the world you're the only one that can stay in the test and he's gave it to you and he knew you're going to overcome it and he signed a contract up there saying that that's your taste and he gave me my taste and he says while you're there you live a life of a harlot you live a life of a sinner you come to the world take on a garment you see this brother Branham says when you came in by birth right we were never supposed to be born this way that's why do you know when the persecution started for brother Brenham when brother Branham got the revelation of the serpent seed when he was when he got the revelation of the serpent seed that's when everybody started pulling away when he started telling people about the serpent seed he started telling them that and if you listen to brother brother Bo in all of them listen they say that's and then he told them that that serpent is the son sorry Kane is the son of the serpent ah how can it be it can't be and my brother Branham started and then people what is this man but you know why that's the key that's the link just is Satan brother Branham says he cannot create God can create so he created us he brought us forth from the dust of the earth Hallelujah and he says Satan could not create so he has to take something that is already created so he was waiting for for that body to come because he was also there were certain things we must remember he was way way way back there he was the angel that led he was the chorus leader he led the Angels In Worship right he laid the Angels In Worship so he was that was before the before the creation of the earth and all that they were worshiping up there they were angels and xerophones and cerebrums and Satan was one of them he was one of the main Angels leading the Angels into worship but then the same thing that happened with Joseph his brothers became jealous of him right his brothers became jealous and brother Branham says why did Joseph end up in Egypt because of jealousy spiritual jealousy because he could actually see dreams and they could not now this comes from way back there if you trace it when he was there he said I will exalt myself above God he wanted to exalt himself Lucifer he wanted to be greater than God he wanted to be higher than God so the serpent and that's why brother Branham he picked up that's where he come but he could not create he could not create but he had part of the plane of God was already made known part of the plan God did not tell him all the plan he was sitting there he was listening when God showed him this and God said so he knew oh you're going to go to that planet you see the stars the galaxies there's many planets the Bible says that Satan he was walking on the coals of the earth while it was so hot in new this planet not go to Mars not go to Jupiter he knew this planet he knew the plan but they were certain the Bible says the hidden things of God belonged to God he hided away the mystery part the Revelation stands seven the things that brother Branham came to bring God hid it away he never knew God only said certain things and he went and that's why he knew he was going to come here he knew he said he was going to manifest himself in place he was waiting there Adam came he could not go to Adam he could not go to the animals who created in the image of God and he could not deceive the man he was waiting for the female and if you follow the pattern of God everything in the Bible is perfect God created everything the Bible says and God rested on the seventh day and then Genesis 2 7 that was after God rests so after the seventh day God is particularly in everything that he does he rested now everything is done and now we form the man from the dust of the earth and Genesis 2 7 when God formed the man from the dust of the Earth then man was walking about and Genesis 1 26 27 28. that was built in male and female created them so inside of Adam was both a feminine and a masculine part locked up inside of Adam was his feminine spirit and his masculine Spirit was locked up inside of him you're getting the picture of Satan's Eden you see why in this hour in this day you saw you see so many males wanting to be female so many females wanting to be males because Satan's Eden is trying to copy what God did back there but Adam did not behave like a female he just heard the spirit of the feminine part locked up in him but just that you're seeing today it's a perversion Satan is telling God you think you're the only one that can bring both Spirits into one body answer you I'll do it and he crosses a man and the man starts saving him he's got muscles but he's saved in his long hand or his legs look so stupid right but you see you know what that is it is a reproach back to God to say you think you're the only one that can create an Eden you see when Satan comes and he does things he cannot create the perverts so he takes that boy he takes that girl he takes whatever and he needs a body he grabs a hold of him Hallelujah because he can't create and he's only sowing God you think he's the only one and that's why in this day brother brilliant preaches a sermon called Satan's Eden he says finally finally he also had his six thousand years he's six days finally he's also got his own Eden so now you must remember how dark the world is if he took six thousand years you know he was bad in the first AIDS you know he was bad but now he's telling God you see I have my own Eden that's why brother Branham says in the last third age when he looked there was no more light it was complete darkness Satan was a reigning Supreme right you see how the people are dressed you see how the females are dressing you see there's no more morality you see how men you see what's happening Satan's Eden he's sowing back to God but you see there is a little group brother Branham says they are tucked away they are hidden away they are the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ out of this whole Wellington of 500 000 people I don't know how many people as believers hey of the whole world people are and you can see the world is going insane but God has got a particular type of people that has got prophetic insight a special class of people when a prophet walks down or sits somewhere see comes and she comes to draw water at the well wow a harlot you came your life was dirty you ate a what type of life you only left the portals of glory and you put on the robe like Tamar brilliant Pizza hey we must all get together wow I'm never gonna go to Joseph so you see she only took on that part that's why God interrupted the story of Joseph he interrupted the story of Joseph brother Brennan picks it up he said it's a Redemption right there the god sows you you see you can't remember it you concentrate on on this right you you you're looking at the flesh you're looking at the body of time Hallelujah but you are not uh you are not uh a fleshly body that's one thing to become Eternal it's the other way around you are an eternal being that took on a body of Flesh it's the other way around you are not striving every day God please let me not die I want to love Eternal no you don't have to pray like that you don't have to you already that Circle that we had on the last time you are already brother Brandon preach on it in things that are to be and nobody had not and different things it's a place as he preached on it he says you are already Eternal Eternal he's got no into it it's a circle there's no starting into it but all you did you by God's grace and God's mercy you gave God permission to say take me out of this eternal realm and drop me in a body of time I want to go and represent you in a body of time and one day when the portals of Glory open up and you hook up the steps brother Branham says he says the angels that know no sin the angels of this never sinned it has never gone to do maybe what we think bad things or whatever that angel will have to hang his head like this you will have to hang in and he has to give obedience to you he has to give obedience unto you as you hope the portals of Glory he says you took on the body you became lost and you were found again that angel never be was lost and was never found he says that angel while you sing there you come up I Am Redeemed by love divine Glory Glory Christ is mine yes you hope they as you sing the different songs of the redeemed whatever song of the redeem you are singing Hallelujah I am redeemed I'm redeemed different songs that you sing as you walk up he says the Angels cannot join in your song let Angel will have to take some of them have wings some of them don't have wings some of them standing as you walk back to portals they will have to walk back here comes the Son of God here comes the daughter of God blood was by the lamb himself Redeemed by him himself it is it is beyond what we can ever think of we spend a lot of time with things that's that's that's that's carnal as we said the circle the last time brother Branham through a very big circle and in they interjected and he made a little hickey and he says that hickey connects back with the Eternal Circle so we spend so much time with this little hickey that is 40 years or 40 years that's why I was listening to the testimony brother I'm listening to the testimony of of brother Billy Paul he said you know what that he was a poor man that he was a poor man he says did he spend all his time in prayer he spent all his time in prayer what you spend all his time trying to serve the people of God he spent all his time trying to do things for the people of God Hallelujah he says here let me read this for you Revelation series you have to have spiritual understanding this is in the Revelation series chapter four three remember God never did and never will on this Earth dwell in glamor so so can we read the quote further yes he's against it that's what a prophet says glamorous things golden signs around the neck looking like the black American rapper you you don't put that profile you are a son and a daughter of God you conduct yourself like one and if they ask you why do you do that you say but I'm not an American relates that we've read it many times he told his wife we are not American but the daddy Rebecca says that he doesn't that but I believe says no we are not Americans we are Christians we come from Beyond the curtain of time Hallelujah so so so you we we we're not we're not new zealanders or South Africa we come beyond the certain of time our life trying to do yes buy your potatoes buy do your job that's not it that's not you know we are from Beyond he said we are not American we drive a car like he does a car we do it to the honor and glory of God not to spin wheels not to buy it to break and so you just do it because it's the means is there otherwise you'll have to walk and it will take you a few days to get to the church so God has made the technology available so we use it but as soon as it becomes a stumbling block walk away from it if anything becomes a stumbling block the Bible says if your arm Jesus said to them if your arm is a stumbling block to you cut it off he says if your eye is a stumbling block cut it out and people think oh must I not cut my arm off it means the things that happens in your life it symbols things that you see that's upsetting you things that's causing you not to love the life that you suit things that's causing you not to be able to read your Bible things that's causing you not to be able to go in the message if anything becomes a stumbling block leave it alone if the magazine that you buy although it's cookbooks or whatever leave it alone if you don't have time anymore for the word if this is a problem that's a problem you know nowadays people are on Facebook all of that they they take so much time for that that's fine I don't have anything but if your arm starts becoming a problem Chop It Off take it get rid of it close your Facebook account say let me rather listen to a sermon you'll see what will happen in your life you will see how spiritually you will just be able to have Victory and just grow in a different dimension he is against it the great messages will never be says here I don't do that way his servants don't work in that manner his glamor and glory is of above yesterday two days ago yeah to Kentucky up in Kentucky with my good friend brother bankswoods there was a woman a policeman woman it's fine standing all this he said and he said boy we better slow down say she's rough that's brother banquet's telling brother and I said yeah that's right I said random Mason gets to a million employed and they have to have to make women make policemen and make them out there and put them out there stay in them Aldi and cab drivers and things like that it's one of the great stains of our nation it's a stain on our nation a sting like a beautiful white dress and there's a stain on it this is the stain of our nation because brother Branham said you see brother Branham when he speaks when a prophet says something he doesn't he never makes a mistake a prophet never makes a mistake never a prophet never makes a mistake when he preached the sermon those of meeting his brethren brother Brennan preach the sermons those of meeting his Brethren which one I don't know if I was meeting his brother when he preach the sermons those are meeting his brethren I read it a few times how many times ammonia sitting and reading and a week without because I've been busy with it for a while random C why did Brother Branham say ing then it gives them the scripture then he says did I tell you what chapter it was it's Genesis I believe I've seen I've seen Genesis 37. and beginning with the 15th verse and you mark it now I believe I said now when he spoke when brother Branham spoke right when he spoke here I'm just trying to get it for you quickly when he said to them yep paragraph 47. brother Branham comes in episode things Saturday morning early a prophet never makes a mistake never does he make a mistake when I went back and read it I almost allowed almost I said Lord now you take me immediately prophets do not he's introducing the scripture now he says here we want to turn over in the book The Old book the first book Genesis 35 and we wish to read just a little portion of the scriptures here out of the Book of Genesis and we pray that God will richly Aid his Blessing as a background of something and how many like Sunday school now he gave the scripture now he starts talking it's just giving the people time giving the people time to find the scripture so he's talking from here he's talking he's even going over and he's even singing a song they come from the East and West they come from the lands of our brother Brad I'm singing a song and he's scaring on and he's doing and then he starts and he says oh yes let's get into the 15th verse and when he reads he reads Genesis 37 verse 15. so some people in the audience were sitting with 35. and he reads verse now you can open your Bibles in Genesis 35 because we've read Genesis 37. he's just a prophet just said 35 and he turns his Bible into 37 and he reads 37. and it's it's under the anointings never makes a mistake he was called by an Angel I said to my wife the Abomination that make a desolation brother Branham preaches in the Seal's book brother preaches there now the Abomination that make a desolation we know about it Jesus spoke about it he's taking picking up Matthew 24 speaking of the end time where we are in now the power of the Abomination that make a desolation when they will turn against the Jews and all that and we know about that brother Branham stops and he says oh I see the Muslims of Umar I see the Muslim of Umar oh look at their filthiness they are so filthy thinking we told my wife the other day yesterday look at brother Branham he says the Muslims it's he refers to the mosque of Umar because the mosque is standing where the Temple of Solomon is I know I grew up amongst Muslims so I know about it this is the Muslim of Umar and the next thing brother Branham goes over and he says look how faulty they are the faultiness the Abomination that make a desolation the fourthiness you see now only when they crossed over and they're going to live in other countries now the people say they're raping their daughters they're having a homosexual action but they are Muslims brother Brethren they under the anointing says the faultiness prophets never make mistakes never make mistakes so let's go let's see this look at how beautiful this is brother Branham said that scripture he reads the one that we read then it comes in this quote and he says oh Genesis I believe I believe I see I've seen Genesis 37 the beginning the 15th verse and you mark did I say 35 is asking he read the scripture he said 35 he read 37 and then afterwards he says did I say 35 a while ago I had two pages that stuck together there was another time that two pages were stuck together brother Venom preacher choosing of a bride and a priest came and handed him a book brother Bradham says in this sermon here in this sermon brother says this portion of scripture that I will read to you this portion of scripture I'll get a quote for you now so he does not make a mistake never brother Branham wanted to go over to Israel with a gift to show them the prophetic gift of being able to discern the heart and brother Brenham says oh if Israel sees that they will repent in one day because they believe a prophet they know brother Branham is standing at Cairo Airport he's got a ticket in his hand he's ready to board the plane to go fly over right into Israel he was going there and that everything is arranged for him to go to the stadiums and to go and do the discernment Israel will repainting one day the Bible says that wow brother Branham is standing at the airport the angel came to him and he said You Heard a Voice said he's standing at the airport he said this is not yet the hour brother he's looking around he says is somebody talking to me now then you heard the voice saying again this is not yet the hour so you you must remember when God moves over into Israel Gentile days is done so so so look at the anointing on the prophet which is Eliza so that same Prophet is going to raise there he's he's under the anointing and Elijah says I must go over and I just stopped him there's still some that must come in otherwise it's gone it's finished it's I think about for the Gentiles brothers and sister you you you realize God God actually kept a little window open for us he kept the window open because if he goes over to the Jews he never deals whether it says God never deals with the Jews and the Gentiles at the same time Hallelujah he never deals with them at the same time when you know the story of Joseph whoa this is remarkable that's the another place where the pages was stuck when I saw this Saturday morning whoa brother Brahm look at what brother Branham says about the scripture that we've read he says here I just need to find it so you pray for me I trusted you you're really blessed by the word this morning amen Hallelujah I trusted you are blessed everything according to God's plan and God's purpose everything Hallelujah amen God maybe just want to have the the just to tone it down a little bit is to be winding up as you're winding up yep here we got it now therefore so it's now a few pages later on now therefore on the word it's beautiful now we are faced this morning we got before us he says here under consideration to my opinion we've got before us under consideration to my opinion one of the most vital texts of the Old Testament Joseph we're going to speak on meeting his brethren there could be a hundred different ways that the Holy Spirit get into this and unfold it to our hearts and our minds Hallelujah he says here how did God in his omnipotence in his great infinite mind seeing something fixing to happen he can forewarn he can make everything work together even the wrath of man to praise him even someone who treats you evil so he combines those two because his brothers treated him evil right and he says with God before us one of the greatest texts in the Old Testament brother Branham you see we'll go back to Judah and tomatoes now Joseph he perfectly types Christ Abraham was Faith this one was that partake of types Christ his first coming his second coming rejected by his Brethren and sacrificed brought before the Father the coat of many colors Jesus Christ thinking now I have you now you are nailed to the cross now I have you when he did it who did it where did you get the scars in your hands brother Bradham says brother Brenham says when Jesus is going to go the Messiah when he goes to the Jews when he goes to the Jews now there's a script in the book of Zechariah Zechariah Chapter 12. right I'm jumping all over this morning if you read Zechariah Chapter 12. the Bible says maybe we should read it just open your books in Zechariah I'll show you there that really stands in front of them he's making himself known to the Jews he's making himself known now to the Jews Joseph we all know Joseph appeared to his brothers we'll close with that part so it's it's it's it's it's it's just tremendous it's just wonderful the blessings of the Lord that maketh rich and that adds no sorrow this this characters they play the character you think that that Joseph was he no it was Redemption brother Branham says it was Redemption being played out Hallelujah Zechariah Chapter 12 and some of you might be getting excited already those of you that is founded I used to have another Bible but this is a Bible that I got so pages in this hey somebody got a day Zechariah Chapter 12. okay now broken uh brother Ed can you read first day if you've got it or sister brother brother Armand you can read for us Zechariah 12 1 from verse one please brother from Zechariah 12 1 to 12 rather exactly foreign wonderful you follow the scripture brother Brady the Bible says in that day in that day in that Day verse 10 and I will pour upon the House of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and of Supplication and they shall look upon me whom they have peers now brother Branham gets moved under the anointing brother Branham sees what happens in brother Branham says he sows them the scars and they ask where did you get the scars and brother Branham tells them brother Brennan says Jesus tells them I got these scars in the house of my friends Bible says when they realize that it was them they discuss the scars of the Messiah they will all go in mourning and the whole land of the of now those are Benjamin that's little Benjamin right all of them in one day will go in mourning for what they have done and the whole of Israel will be saved in one day he says he can take thousands of years with the Gentiles with the Jews they will that's why if you read the Bible says in that day indeed brother says in one day Israel will come to repentance in one day just like that and they where did you get those Stars I got these scars in the house of my friends your house of your friend is a place where you go when you are distressed a house of your friend is a place where you go where you said a house of your friend is a place where you go with this with this where there's a little Solace for you where there's a little something of rest you you go to the house of your friend to to to be strengthened that's what you do when you go to the house of your friend yeah he's standing in front of them he says I got these scars in the house of my friends a place where I was supposed to be protected I have no home I lost my business I lost my house my friend I can knock on his door That's What Friends Are and when he says but he says but what did what did he do he says they were blinded the brothers of Joseph in their Fierce jealousy were blinded so that Joseph could go and let's go and we close now Genesis 35 37 and we'll flip over to 45. so I got these scars in the house of my friends wow they will repent in one day they are the 144 000. now while you turn to Denison Dynasty seven and we're just busy rounding up you all know the history those of you that maybe don't know or maybe don't know what we're following the message of the hour some people somehow means a Vietnamese World War and we all know that how Germany Mussolini first and then Hitler how he rose up and how the sermons rose up and how there was this hatred towards the Jews right and they persecuted the Jews and all that brother Branham said that what happened there what happened there it was the tender hand of Jehovah the the tender hand of Jehovah that was gathering little Benjamin from all over the corners of the world and bringing Benjamin Beck into the Homeland when you have persecution when you have things going wrong when you have troubles when you have trout I was telling my wife yesterday it is it is when you have things and you don't have money and you don't have this and you it's the tender hand of Jehovah we we think blessing I must have blessing I must have the then the hand of Jehovah to to make sure you don't have so that you can go on your knees and then a character attribute of faith can come out which is the attribute of God only operates by faith God does not operate by my bank account or my medical cover or my insurance cover God does not operate the moment I have something to do with protecting and it's not God God is is one that operates in the Supernatural Realm so so when that persecution came Mussolini Adolf Hitler when those Jews were burned and taken to the slaughter brother Branham says it was the tender hand of Jehovah you I I can't explain it it's a prophet it said it that was taking Jews bringing little Benjamin back into the Homeland are we closing with little Benjamin 35. remember he said 35 little sermon Little Summer this is not big man this is not seals a little sermon called zones of meeting his brethren and in their Pages were stuck together on his Bible so let's read three five so we pray 37 which is the one that he intended but he said 35 because his Pages were stuck together and his brothers came did what he did now let's go over to 37. now you see there was a special bond between Joseph and Benjamin right Josephine Benjamin had a special bond it was a special bond between them because they were in the in the flesh they had the same mother they came from Rachel both of them were from the same mother but Joseph was born so you had Judah and you had different ones and you had Reuben and you had all the brothers being born and in between Joseph gets born and I think they were more born after Joseph but little Benjamin was born last but Benjamin and Joseph comes from the same mother right so Benjamin is lost right and Joseph and you read it was the last born of the twelve right now the Bible does not even make a mistake when the Bible places the two of them together when the brother Branham says 35 I went to go read it I I said whoa Lord our time is up when brother Brandon preacher the anointing said he wants to go oh he said this is not the hour it's 50 years later let's read and we're busy closing the Bible is a marvelous book the message of the hour it's it's wonderful verse 1 and Jacob dwelled in the land wherein his father was a strange in the land of Canaan these are the generations of Jacob those of being 17 years old so when that when that happening happened with him when they which is just a few chapters later on he was 17 years old so also in the message circles in the message circles the number 17 the number 17. relates to a system chains it relates that at 17 when something struck 17 God does something when samething strikes in your life God does something when brother Branham baptized the 17 person on the Ohio River now you can you do the maths you can do the math Revelations 10. 17 is always significant to God things can happen in your life things can happen in your life you can struggle but somehow the music you know when they have the orchestra and they play music in the orchestra and then they will boom boom it's relating a wall and then and when they hit a certain notebook and then and you know and the players on the stage could do something and all of a sudden when it hit a note it changes and then you just see there the swan comes up and the Swan Lake in the swan is changed back to a swan and whatever so that happens on a certain note and it denotes a change in the system so God does things the same way 17 is always significant to God 17 Joseph is ready he's ready to be given up by his brothers 17 is significant so look at this the Bible says and and the Bible does not tell you how old is Judah that doesn't tell you all these Reuben it tells you are all these Joseph it says he's 17 years old so the Bible itself is an inspired Bible Hallelujah was feeding the flock with his Brethren and the lady was with the sons of and with the sons of so far so sorry I'm saying it the way the Jews would say it because they don't have an eight uh yeah so far but so far is the way they would say it his father's wives and Joseph brought unto his father the evil report right and now Israel loved those of more than all his Brethren because he was the son of his old age sorry I'm reading 37 myself apologies I'm selling 37 I wanted I meant to read 35. sorry Genesis 35 that's what I meant to read wow I'm into read Genesis 35 sorry verse 15. wow that must have been God because I didn't mean to speak about how old Joseph was I wanted to go straight into Joseph into into the spot well sure so look at this Genesis 35 15. so we read 37 verse 15. we back here 35 15. and Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him Beth L right this is the now my Bible Bible has got something in here pet L is the house it's in the it's in the god of the house of God or it's the house of God Bethel that's the meaning of it 16 and they Journey from Beth L and they was but a little way to come to Israel and Rachel travailed so she was in travail and we was closing and she had hard labor and it came to pass when she was in hard labor that the Midwife said unto her fear not Thou shalt have this son also and it came to pause as her soul was departed departing Force he died that's he called his name Ben Oni but his father called him Benjamin she's giving birth to Benjamin hard labor she's supposedly dying she sets out the name of the boy before she dies and while she sells out the name of the boy the father Jacob calls the other name at the same time he calls Benjamins he calls benoni Rachel died and was buried in the way of Ephron which is Bethlehem I'll just stop there because I want to just go down to verse 22 in and we'll close with Genesis 45. C calls the name benoni the same time Jacob is under the anointing and he calls the name Benjamin the name given by Rachel benoni means a son of Sorrow a son of Sorrow we see we see Israel always in the news a son of Sorrow always they are persecuted always they always need this one always wants to kill him that one always wants to kill them this one always wants to kill Israel that one always wanted the stroll it's my land it's my land you know what brother Branham says it's us we Are Spiritual Israelites sons of Sorrow Satan is always after you always after your Bloodhound trying to get you brother Branham says it's like a bloodhound the son of Sorrow always trying to destroy you then he's throwing this muscle over then he's doing this then he Rams a car into a few people he's always trying to destroy Israel we are the spiritual Israelites always something happening with you you got Victory Today Tomorrow there's something else you're happy in the church today tomorrow you have problems son of Sorrow see something that out Under The Inspirations he dies at the same time the inspiration is on Jacob he calls out the son of my right hand so Benjamin means the son of my right hand someone I can depend on sees out Ben only one of Sorrow that's what we are sons of sorrow but also the right hand of God once a God can depend on that whatever happens no matter if the muscles fall that son is going to stand then you know the Bible says I don't have time I'm closing up there was when he was born you go read the account I'll just read this one and I'll close when they wanted to have Benjamin to come through does it no to this leader he said you can't let that sun come he said but you said you have another brother because they they only the 10 of them went they said to him and they came in front of for in front of Joseph you know his dream came true you go read the accounting when they had to bow in front of him and he said okay and they said this dreamer says we're going to bow in front of him then he had a second dream the moon in the stars the Sun the moon and the stars were bowing in front of him then his father said to him it cannot be you mean mother and father and your brothers are going to bow in front of you 13 years later in the process of time the vision comes into fulfillment reasons cannot fail the little boy he saw them falling off the bridge 16 years later it happened in our lives what does it show us God cannot fight if God has got a plan for your life it cannot fail brother if God sees you going in the Rapture no matter what I try and do no matter what who tries into you will get into that Rapture Hallelujah it will happen and they just in closing as Jacob was there shouting out that name giving out that name Benjamin the prophet says are named the noun character it speaks of the character that the person has got when you get a particular name it's your character and there was a special bond between Jacob and Benjamin and when they came in front they said yes yes we told you but surely you cannot let the youngest one come and he spoke through an interpreter if you read the account when they came in front of Joseph he spoke through an interpreter they never knew that that was their brother I don't want to go into 42 43 44 you go read it and he spoke to them through an interpreter and he said to them go back and bring that boy and he said okay let me keep one of the brothers here and then you bring that boy back the next time brother Branham says what was happening those have wanted to sow them who he was he wanted to show them that he was his brother but he could not reveal it to them unless they were all together 144 Benjamin Benjamin if you read the Bible if you read the way we follow the message of the hour for the Brenham in different places Benjamin little Benjamin refers to the Jews the 144 000 a specific number of them A specific group of Jews the the Orthodox ones the ones that believe the word though those ones that return to be back in the Homeland that's little Benjamin 1948 different between that stages 1946 47 48 they were boarding planes they were boarding planes they were trying to flying over in brother random says what was that anointing on them that called them from all over the world where they were living for hundreds of years scattered after that the mosque of of after the temple was taken over the Jews cattle over the world and after 2 000 years after two days I will bring you back after two days I will bring you back and he says and he pulled all of them and they started going back let me just read this account close up with this and then we read the last verse and we close verse 22 Genesis 35 and it came to pass when Israel dwelt in that land this is Jacob name is changed to Israel that Reuben went and lay with bilar is his father's concubine and Israel heard now heard it now Jacob were 12. the sons of Jacob were 12. now look at how the Bible records the twelve Sons are there certain numbers but the Branham speaks of how God works in numerology gods and numbers God's numbers must tie up God is the perfect mathematician he knows how to tie the numbers because when the numbers hit right that he says the anointing comes down when the numbers hit right sister Hetty right say the right thing and said brother Branham that is nothing but the truth when she said it the anointing came in the room whatever you want twelve Sons the sons of Leah now he gives the sons now we're closing up we're closing up brothers and sisters now he starts giving the sons the sons of Leah Reuben Jacob's firstborn Simeon and Levi right Simeon Levi sorry let me go Reuben Simeon Levi and Judah and izakah and Zebulon so we're on six so six Sons through Leah Bible records him now the Bible records the sons coming through Rachel the sons of Rachel Joseph take the numbers right now when was Benjamin born last but what does brother Branham say in the message of the hour what does eight mean eight means eternal the Bible records them but now look at how the Bible records their birth always when the Bible records records the different learnings it always says the first of the last when it recorded this I've come across this and I looked in the Bible I can't recall anybody else in the Bible when it records it like this it does not recorded from the first to the last it changes the pattern how the Bible records the chronology the chronological bird it says it tells it now according to mother and now it says the sons of Rachel to those of which were seven now he doesn't give you the next one it was born because you break the order according to the Orthodox system you go from the first to the last because the blessing is passed on from the first it breaks the order according to the Old Testament way of writing chronological way of writing it but it's perfect because it says the sons of Rachel Joseph seventh and Benjamin it speaks of when Benjamin comes on the scene we strike the number eight which is eternal that's why brother Branham was suppressed so pressed when he's when that anointing came Hallelujah because the Jews are back in their Homeland brother Branham says God is ready to move and to work with Israel he cannot work with the Gentiles and with Israel at the same time I'm closing Genesis 45 and this is my last verse and we're closing and I trust I read a quote what brother Brian says in the Revelation series I trusted by the word this morning it has just given us a a little bit of a of an appreciation and saying Lord now I want to read my Bible I want to read I want to know more I want to know more about the message of the hour brother Branham says it in the Revelation series as well he says I trust this morning I've studied and I've seen history I trust by what I will preach this morning I trust it will bring certain answer in your heart that you will go and just read your Bible and read so so that's what preaching is also about you know it helps us but it also sort of gets us to drive us back to read our Bible so I'm closing with this beautiful scene beautiful beautiful scene beautiful most one of the most beautiful scenes in the whole Bible one of the most beautiful scenes in the whole Bible the fathers did not want to let Benjamin go the father said he will bro bring my gray hair down you will take me to their grave if you take the sun away from me they said father but if we don't take Benjamin with us the master of the house won't give us bread we will die we have to take him with us he says he will bring down my gray you will bring down my gray and while they were standing in front of Joseph started making all sorts of funny demands telling them go leave the boy with me you go all of you go he stays here let us kill him repentance and Judah comes and said oh he said to him oh let's read it oh this is beautiful brothers and sisters oh verse 27 44 27. and I servant my father said unto us you know that my wife bear me two sons so he's telling Joseph you can't take this boy this is coming in and he was the brave one that said kill him let's kill him let's kill this Dreamer he doesn't know who he's speaking to he's standing there he doesn't know there's a special bond there's a special bond between Benjamin Netanyahu and Vladimir Putin there's a special bond between them I didn't know what it was a Russian don't cry Russians don't cry they are tough they are the toughest people you can get we saw a picture of of of of Putin crying because of what is happening to the Jews tears they took a picture of him his tears were running brother Branham said while that reason came while the reason came 1933 some anointing dropped on him something special because the vision broken the vision said to him what's Russia the King of the North what's Russell he ate his thirds when he related stand up he says what's Russell Watson Ross the King of the North he heard it repeat because Russia has got a special place in God's hand what's the King of the North the bay special place God uses Russell if you mess with Israel she will step in there's a special bonding you messed with Israel Russia is prepared on the other side because they cannot say blood David God said you've said too much blood you cannot build me a tabernacle you cannot build me a tabernacle you've saved blood Solomon will raise up in your Stead the pattern of the world cannot be broken but God will bring judgment with judgment is due so this is now today is pleading to Joseph he says here oh it's it's so wonderful I just can't seem to close the day but we'll close in the next minute or two hallelujah it's just so wonderful this is a this is one of the most beautiful Parts because it is it is the first coming of the Lord India and the second coming he was already in the pit that was the first coming this is the second coming playing out this is the second coming because it's the ministry this is the time that we are in he meets his brothers three times cow out what Seekers you I'm just looking for my brethren brother Branham says you never look for God God always look for you his brothers after they did what they did to him they were never looking for him the second time they came that came in front of him they came in front of him they did not recognize him but they were looking for food this is the third time they came back in front of him right and he's telling them now thy servant my father said unto us ye know that my wife pay me two sons and the one went out from me and I said surely he is torn in pieces and I saw him nonsense I told Judah is not pleading to Joseph he's telling now Joseph you can't do this what you want to do in the he says here and ye and if you take this also from me and must have befall him he shall bring down my gray hairs would sorrow to the Grave this is what Jacob said when they sit let Benjamin go now and he said Benjamin stays here you can go back this this man is making funny demands now right this is playing a part out there's a special bond because all the time when the brothers came if you read you always ask them always ask them bring that boy bring that Benjamin bring that one Hallelujah now therefore when I come to the servant my father and the late be not with us seeing that his life is bound up in the LEDs of life if I go back to my father and he's not with us benzem he's not with us his life the father's life is bound up in his life God and the Jews are linked together who I bless no man can curse and bound to Israel who can pluck out of my hand this is look at this yeah you see it's the same thing he says the Lord's life is bound in the father's life Jacob and Benjamin is bound together brothers and sisters this world has got the best arms and bombs they are being funded by Rome America has got all even America is going to turn against Israel all of them will turn against Israel you see even America is going to turn against Israel wanting to blast them from the face of the Earth and God said who can plug them out of my hand Hallelujah my life is bound up in the last life there's something about the people the syrians and that they wanted that if you read the articles if you read the account brother and he puts a lot of it on they want to blast Israel of the earth they sit in such a small country let's just blast them off brother they cannot do that our life our life is bound in the father's life no matter what Satan tries to do this morning you can have a cancer you can cry what your life is bound in the father's life Hallelujah it shall come to pass when he's here that the Lord is not with us that he will die and thy servants shall bring down the grace of thyself of the gray hairs of thy servant our father would sorrow to the Grave for thy servant became Surety for the land unto my father saying if I bring him not now this is Judah speaking he's saying I'm not standing in for him and here's those of knowing it was you that threw me in the put yeah he says I say to the father he's seeing now the heart of Judah was sins oh don't worry brother Bradham says they will sweep out very nice spirit upon the bride at the end time they will sweep a beautiful spirit on us brothers and sisters but he says there will be a love that will come amongst the bride God will sow Miracles brother Branham says yo yo yo your brother your sister that's one will come to you and says I'm a farmer he says I don't have rain he said you will speak in the rain will fall it happened in the days of Eliza he says there were people will come to you and you will speak and lumps will grow back somebody that doesn't have a lake you will speak and that limb will grow back somebody that doesn't have eyes what brother Branham did I believe and I believe it's not far it's right now if you ever need this morning when we finish here we will pray and we will believe God will answer every need don't put God off over there that was the difference with brother Branham that's I believe when we go into prayer and supplication it takes something that's far and it makes up the right here Hallelujah it puts it right here today brother Branham police said he was laying there but he said I know I have seen Daddy I have seen they could bring any case in front of Mary when he was laying there let Daddy come where did he come he was dying but he Paul says he was dying they said we have to operate you dying boy he said let Daddy come there was a woman that died in that service brother Benham was preaching brother Branham told bully bully we standing he says Billy go pray for the woman brother police making a joke on on the tape he says Oh Daddy did that he says oh no I'm not touching a dead person he's telling the Believers and they love him he's looking at that he says no I can't go pray for that person so when you it's natural you won't go pray for a dead person but they will sweep a spirit upon you your mom will die you will go there you say mom rise up there will be a spirit and I believe the hour is now Brothers you see he wants to go to the Jews he wants to go Joseph wants to go but you know what happened in the interim you know what happened in between there when when Joseph revealed the dream then he said to him there's a wife that you can marry it was a gentile wife and during that time brother Branham says what happened he says Joseph married a gentile wife which is us she was tucked away she was stuck the way it's revealing us sent out Christ in the interim while the brothers rejected him he moved and he turned to the Gentiles and he married a gentile Church through seven Church ages she was stuck away in the castle Hallelujah he is about ready to switch over he's about ready for this scene to happen he's about ready for Zechariah 12 brother Armand to come into fulfillment he's about ready in one day whoever stands against Jerusalem they must deal with me he's ready to go there but we are not ready Hallelujah he says for thy servant became Surety for the land I told the father let him go unto my father saying if I bring him not unto thee then I shall bear the blame to my father forever now therefore I pray thee let thy servant abide instead of the lead abandonment to my Lord and let the lead go up with his brethren for how shall I go up to my father and the Lord be not with me Lester Adventure I see the evil that shall come to my father the very one that cared about nobody a few years ago is now saying let me stay abundant under you a slave for you for the rest of my life let my brother go he was the big one that said kill Joseph in due course God sends the heart and there was Joseph and I'm closing and Joseph could not refrain those of could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him right and cried and he cried cause every man to go out from me understood no man with him while Joseph made himself known unto his Brethren this is 45 verse 1. and you whipped aloud Joseph wept aloud and Egyptians and a house of pharaoh heard he screamed aloud he heard I get whipped aloud and those have sit unto his Brethren I am Joseph I am Joseph dot my father yet live and his Brethren could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence this one that was taken from the pit was put in the highest place when those of walk in the streets every knee bow down and the Bible says not anything happen in the whole of the Kingdom except it came from the mouth of Joseph that's how high he was exalted and here he's standing in front of his brothers and those who sit unto his Brethren come near unto me Zechariah come near unto me I pray you and I came near and he said I am Joseph your brother whom you sold into Egypt now therefore be not grieved no angry with yourselves he says here that you sold me hither for God did send me before you to preserve life you see many times when we go through troubles it's it's not because of us losing something Genesis 45 verse 5 to not to lose something I thought my book was falling here it's not to lose something it's to preserve life God sending came in a position and they heave through the wisdom of the dreams he told them store up the food feminists coming across the world and when there was a famine in the land where did they turn to forbred they came to Joseph you see brother Branham if you listen to the testimony of Bali Paul wondering why why why Derek for soup Mommy why did he foresee all of us he says I came in I want to play with Daddy and the cars are parked he says the house is full the ambulance are standing the people are standing I want my daddy I want my daddy if you listen to his testimony he couldn't have his daddy instead he was busy Hallelujah I was looking at through all the sermons yesterday and I was copying some of the sermons over to my laptop and and I thought yeah brother he was praying for the sick he was pre when did the man ever have time for his family to preserve life don't feel sad I did this to preserve life God did this to preserve life God you know brothers and sisters we don't realize it there's our family members they are not saved our family members is not safe God is letting new year suffer many things going through you're in the pit you're going into the prison by a lie you're in the prison and all that Potiphar's wife all that he comes before them and he also over time realized the grace of God because even in person in prison the Bible said he prospered so you go read the account when he stood in front of his brother I am chosen this was done to preserve life God is pleased I believe God did not place this message in front of us he did not make us part of this message just for jokes I don't believe that brother Branham says he says God will sow he says this church he will see if God says he does is his Masterpiece he says brother Branham says they will sweep a working of the Lord upon the bride I believe I was listening to brother Sydney Jackson in the week I believe what happened there when when those scars were parked in the streets were full and those things were happening and and and and they brought people in courts they brought the men in of us he had some sort of a sickness or whatever it was and they brought that man and the gambling said to carry him he was he was completely couldn't lift up his neck or anything he was there to carry me in this thing and they put him there and when they brought him yes They Carried him in when they put him down and when they put when they turned away to all he got up already brother Branham told him when brother said to him if I was you you have a choice you can continue laying there but if I was you I would just get up now and hook so the man just got up and he walked brothers and sisters I believe when you read that accounts and you listen to brother Branham I believe it wasn't done for us to to admire and and say oh it was nice like you know you could say oh that was a nice cowboy movie you know it was done to sow what we will do and not wall what we are doing today and I believe as we go into prayer this morning I Believe by the opening of the word I believe we are Joseph this morning done to preserve life God has given us this there's somebody this morning you've got a family member whatever the need is this morning in the audience it doesn't matter while the musicians come to play a song for us doesn't matter what your need is this morning doesn't matter what what the situation may be this morning doesn't matter if it's if it's I think the Sister Sister Hera told us me the last time the sister is suffering with Emmys how was this praying for her the lord it's just undertake for her I believe this morning she's already healed by the grace of God Hallelujah whatever your situation this morning you have a sickness you have a conditioned TV whatever God has given us the greatest Joseph is in the camp I am Joseph I am here to preserve life he has sent me to preserve life if there is a situation we told Brother they told Brother Billy Paul if you're going to die boy he said get Daddy get Daddy he said people came from let me just get to brother Branham I'm not taking anything away from Brother Branham I'm not taking anything away they people came in the presence there I up till today they go to his gravesite when they walk away from there they get healed it's not unscriptural I think it's the grave of Isaiah when they threw a dead man up and a man came back to life it's not what brother Branham is not here today on the wings of a snow white dove God gave his love on the wings of Snow White down in that sermon brother Bradham says he says I will ride this trial once more all right let's travel once more it will be in you and me brothers and sisters under the anointing when he was preaching that sermon in the few sermons before and after that brother brother me speaking and he's saying oh Get Ready Get Ready oh I will come back again brother Branham was taken up like he was when he wanted to go to Israel he was transported under the anointing of the Bride and brother Branham says oh let us get a tint and they thought they that's why they call it a 10 division was speaking of the word that God is going to do that's why God just took him off the scene and they were surprised but he said he was going to ride this Trail once more he was going to do this what was he saying he ate the book John in the book and prophesy Revelations 10 verse 11. it's now our time it is the Bride season it's the bride's day today Hallelujah while we all stand this morning this place where you are while the musicians just oh brother
