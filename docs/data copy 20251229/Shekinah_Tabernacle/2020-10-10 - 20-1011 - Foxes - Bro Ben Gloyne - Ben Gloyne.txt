great to have brother alpha and sister sailing here god bless you amen welcome god bless you amen david god bless you great to have you here too god bless you bro amen amen and we've got a birthday girl here too amen god bless sister brony happy birthday amen 21 amen amen there we go amen oh i forgot the i think the the clicker i think it's in there sorry but um as we're standing let's just go we're going to read one one verse from the song of solomon today um amen um song of solomon 2 and 15 and um thank you appreciate that thank you brother i mean we're just going to read this one one verse and you can you can take your seats here it's like brother brown said it's not the amount you read it's it's it's what's in it that you know that matters and amen take us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the vines for our vines have tender grapes amen may the lord bless the reading of his word you may have your seats this morning i want to speak about foxes i was walking i was you know i work at esr and we go across there's more wilson's there's a bakery and a sushi place there i i was walking monday at lunch time just just walking to to get lunch and this the little foxes just came on my mind i thought there's something in that you know we've read no doubt we've read this many times you know take us the foxes the little fox that spoil the vines for the vines have tender grapes and you know we sing that song it's manifesting time the fruits are on the vine the lovely one is coming in plain view and you know but to me when when when solomon was inspired to to write these words it was more than just what would appear to be some abstract kind of poet poetry but you know as as brother um said on wednesday we should be able to see god in everything so you know just like the prophet he said that that his first bible was nature he could see god in nature the change of the seasons how the animals behave the vegetation different things so we should be able to see god and nature as well so you know it's very interesting when when solomon was was inspired to write about a a i'll say a being that that could that could spoil a vine notice he did not go to the birds that would eat the grapes he did not go to maybe the bugs that would eat it but he was inspired to point out the foxes now this is this is very significant because the lord is pointing to to something here and um i just want to talk about us today i'm not talking even about salvation today i'm not talking about your soul i'm talking about your spirit and your body talk about foxes talk about there's a there's a battle that the apostle paul would would would would write about and we'll read about it later there's there's a war between the flesh man and the spirit man and and it's amazing because you know we can you know when you first meet the law the law gives you incredible victories you know things that would maybe were massive things they just they just die at your feet you know and then but then there's other things in your life that seem to linger and you wrestle and you wrestle and you overcome and you know and it's it's very interesting how you you know that that that seems to be but sometimes there can be an enemy that you're fighting and you're just something that you're born with or something that you've maybe picked up in life that you weren't looking for but it found you and you know you can be fighting that thing and maybe you can even get discouraged saying why have i not overcome this thing you know it comes around and it goes and it comes and you know it's because this body has not been changed you know that's why we are looking very very forward to a change in the body aren't we are we not amen the longer we're upon the earth this longer lord and it's not because we're aging yeah you know necessarily notes lord i want to get out of this pest house into my real home amen so you know so there's things that we just live with and we and but we've got to come to peace with this thing we are in this guy it doesn't mean we have lost our victory doesn't mean that we're not you know gonna overcome and win no no we're in this guy but there seems to be so it can turn into an eternal your internal battle but i but the lord you gave me great victories over these things yes why am i having this going on and we can lose our our victory in it but don't you worry in a moment of a twinkling of an eye it'll be all gone but while we're going along in life there's foxes and we're gonna shoot those foxes right we don't know no good gardener just looks out at his garden and say well there's these aphids there and there's snails and there's slugs and well i guess i've got to put up with them because they're there oh no no they get rid of the things and they spray and they and they put stuff around and you know they kill the enemy amen and our our lord jesus he is well he is the good husbandman he wants fruit he's going to get fruit so don't misunderstand me this morning where i just say well you just got to live with this and this is just how you are and oh no no no no no oh no it's not that way at all okay but so it's the foxes that spoil the vine now the so the the foxes that's the the little foxes now you would think about you know they're in the middle east where you know uh you're the holy land there were there were other enemies there there were bears there were lions big predators but but solomon pointed out the little foxes and foxes are not big they're not the big things little things that hang around but the nature of the fox is is very i've i've been i've been just having a good time in this but it all cuts both ways oh boy you know anyway so um the lord would call israel the vine he says this quite a few places in the scripture thou has brought thou hast brought a vine out of egypt thou has cast out the heathen and planted it speaking of israel coming out of egypt into the promised land thou prepared us room before it and let us cause it to take deep root and it filled the land so he's not talking about a natural vine he's talking about the people that have been planted as we have been planted in the you know we are the planting of the lord amen in hosea 10 and 1 the law israel is an empty vine she bringeth forth fruit unto himself according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images so they are vine but they are fruitless but as i'm just saying here that you know israel is a vine now we know that jesus is the vine and we are the branches but you can't kill the vine but you can stop the fruit coming forth on the branches right and we know we are the branches right amen brother ram said if that vine ever puts forth another branch or write a book of acts behind it and we see a book of acts being written hallelujah so yet you know yet though we are eternal beings going through this period of time you know we pick up things in our spirits that we're either born with great trauma or trouble that's passed down through generations or even things that just happen in our lives that you know we weren't looking for but things just happened to us and it can just be a very brief moment in time but it can affect our whole life after that those are foxes paul wood so we're just going to jump through these things galatians paul would write about this for i say then walk in the spirit that ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lust us against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would but if you be led of the spirit you are not under the law so you're saying that the flesh does this it wants to fulfill its own you know our body has a mind of its own thing is when we're born there's no internal struggle sure our conscience should tell us we're wrong and we need to put things right and there should be a call of god in our lives but there's no battle because there's only one nature living but then when we're born again by the spirit of god another nature comes in and that's actually the real lust that's coming forth so now there comes to be a battle because you know we can be pandering to this guy for decades and we can get set in our ways and we can have our routines but then one day god finds us and then our whole life has got to be basically redone but this guy likes to be in charge you know we yeah we've been pandering to this guy for years oh boy there's got to be a real upheaval that's got to go on hallelujah but this thing this guy will be subject to the word of god amen you know you may think oh boy i'm just a big fox then that may be the case but there's one present they can get rid of them okay so we have the answer amen he'd say in romans 7 for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do now if i do that which i would not it is no more that do it but sin that dwelleth in me i find in a law that when i would do good evil is present with me now we are not exempt from this doesn't matter how long this is the prophet messenger for the age he says when good's hear evil's present with me he knew about this battle real well he was chained to a soldier for many years he had to drag this dead man around and when he was chained to the soldier he would receive the revelation of the epistle to the ephesians he would receive great great you know inspiration and prayer and god would come down that dead that that man he was changed who didn't hinder him didn't hinder his walk none amen amen this guy hey i'm not chained to a physical person you know someone else you know but this guy shouldn't be able to hinder anything god wants to do we have overcoming power today hallelujah for i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death i thank god through jesus christ our lord so when with the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin there's two laws going on one is going to win amen amen and i've read the end of the book i know where i'm going to end up and we'll be on streets of gold and we'll be saying hallelujah to the lamb and glory to god amen now brother braham's asked a question romans 7 14 to 18 we know that the law is spiritual blame carnal soul under sin for that which i do not for what i would i would not but what i hate that i do if then i do that which i would not i um unto the law consent to the law that it is good then and now then it is no more i that doeth it but sin that dwelleth in me he and the question is and he says i cannot understand well says brother brahms answer he says they wrote out the scripture it's paul speaking to the romans now he said let me kind of pull up so you can see he says in me as two persons right one wants to do see one wants me to do wrong the other wants me to do and every time i start to do right then wrong hinders me so there's two natures in a born-again christian there's two natures the nature we're born with and god's own nature god's nature wants to manifest the word in your life the first nature well he just doesn't want to do nothing you know there's going to come a time where your body will thank you you drag him to the altar right you drag him to be baptized you drag him to church you drag him to read the bible you drag him to pray you drag him to a camp you drag him and then eventually you drag him to a body change and then he'll thank you right but but until then you've got to drag the sky around hey he doesn't want to get out of bed he doesn't want to pray doesn't want to read i'm just i'll just talk about myself he doesn't want to listen to the message he wants to just relax watch the world go by but there's something within us that should be driving us saying i no this is not our final destination this is not our portion you're going to a body change hallelujah but it's foxes now foxes are very interesting creatures a fox when i talk about foxes i'm talking about the spirit we're born with our first nature all those kind and then we're going to talk about dogs because foxes are related to dogs now we know the spirit of man really is kind of a mysterious thing in terms of how trauma and events impact our lives we know that there's the you know there's the memory you know there's the gates into the into the spirit there's the reasoning and the conscious the memory affection imagination but the effects of trauma and stress and traits that are passed down are not really that well understood i think if man could really understand the impact of events in people's lives then i think we would there'd be a lot less trouble in the world because they try and diagnose mental health and give different pills and uppers and downers and lifts and trying to stabilize someone's spiritual you know being but if they could just get into the root of the problem and get rid of that you know problem solved now brother brown would say quite a few times i don't have the song up here but people would come before him in prayer lines and he would go back into their life and pick out events that caused him to be the way they were and and so he's just one in 1953 says all right lady look at here if god know what was in your life and what has been in your life he surely would know yet you are healed you've always been a little bit nervous when you was a little girl one time coming from school i see you or something or either you run up towards a dog or something and you got frightened by it way back had a little checkered plaid dress on you remember that it's all over now you can go and be made well god bless you be healed maybe she forgot about that maybe she didn't even have the understanding of the impact that that that little event i remember walking to school when i was at primary school me and my brother would walk from our house to the primary school we went to i remember two dogs running out and barking at us that was just a very brief event was it scary it was scary i was yay big and they were yeah big you know everything's bigger when you're little but it was just a short event no i don't know how much that's impacted my life but hey those things happen was i looking for dogs to bark and run at me no was i looking for that kind of trouble no but it finds you and foxes are an interesting creature because they are one of the few a few wild animals that are called resident urban carnivores and that means that they would actually be so well adapted to human environments that they will actually live within human environments and we know that adam before the fall we could say now i'm talking about the human man now talking about the first nature right before the fall he had no foxes right he had no foxes in him there were no foxes in him there perfect love was there you know he was walking in perfect faith and all those things but then as soon as the fall happened foxes begin to gather around humanity there are wild animals who begin to gather and try and begin to feed off wherever humans were living and one of these was foxes they would they would hang around human camps we're told they'll begin to eat the you know whatever the humans would leave over and eventually did come a time when the foxes would become domesticated and this is what we know as being dogs today they are related to foxes they didn't start off as dogs as we know them today but they started off as wild animals but they came as generations went on you know they went from being very wild to very tame so the things that adam started with maybe a bit of trouble or something hurt him in his spirit and then he passed it down to us to the next generation and something happened to them another thing happened it was passed down to that generation and then eventually because you think about it when you first get angry at something it can be a shock to you you know or or you hold a grudge or resentment it can be a shock i can't believe i'm holding on to this i can't believe i'm just mad at this person but if you let it go on and on and on you get used to feeling like that you get used to having that response and it becomes part of you just like a fox you know just say this is our little village and you say there are some wild dogs out there yes and we would be alarmed about them we'd maybe have the men with your weapons or you know keep the children close or keep the you know babies closer make sure they don't come into camp but eventually we would get used to them and they'd become part of our village just like strife or envy whatever anger whatever it may be a lust spirit trouble you know insecurity whatever it may be eventually that becomes part of the family why because as generations go on they get you know adam imagine adam and eve they were the only two on the earth that knew what it was like to be in the garden and they no doubt would try and describe it to their children no tell them what it was like but they were the only ones who were there so everyone who was born after them they didn't know what it was like to walk in that kind of atmosphere they didn't know what it was like and they began to live a different kind of life so they just were getting used to fallen human condition hey amen foxes foxes are omnivores they eat meat and vegetation their diet is primarily primarily made up of invertebrates insects small vertebra um vertebrates such as reptiles and birds they also eat eggs and vegetation they are you know some species of them are specialist predators but basically a fox will eat anything so trouble comes into your life it'll latch onto that hardship comes sadness comes disappointment comes it'll just feed off that right it'll eat anything basically so this is where a wound of a spirit there's a fox right can come in that will feed on anything yeah the devil's no respecter of persons he doesn't just i'll leave that one oh yes i'll attach myself to that one no if there's an opening he'll jump in and if there's food there a fox we'll eat it praise god amen now foxes are primarily nocturnal so that means they're mainly active at night foxes can be seen during the day but most of their behavior is at night so this really shows out you know that our fallen human nature you know at night most people are asleep they don't see you a lot right you don't see like you know it's normally so our fallen human nature really mainly comes out if we're not careful when we're alone it's very easy to put on my tie put on my suit and god bless you brother god bless your sister and put on my face but at night time i could be i pray i'm not but i could be a different person why because foxes come out at night not during the day time only they sometimes will but it's mainly at night are you all following me i really pray i've just been having such a good time and you may think why are you happy about fox as well david prayed lord cleanse me of my secret faults and a fault can be very obvious to everyone but the person that yo i can have a big massive i probably have a lot of them and maybe everyone's like i don't can't believe me why does he not see that and i can be totally oblivious to it and walk on and everything's dandy and oh boy you know but that's why david said lord cleanse me of my secret faults you know and this is why you know we've got to really take stock see the amen so you know they were once wild they eventually became domesticated let's just read this i was saying this taking for myself like you was going to say william branham well 40 years ago the william branham it isn't the same one tonight if somebody back there would say william branham here's a rank rascal see because i was born of charles and alibranum in their nature i was a sinner i come to the world a liar and all the habits of the world laid right in me but down in there too was another nature presence see predestinated was in there by god in the same body see two natures in there well i only catered to one oh boy and we cater to it it's a full-time job it's very demanding amen it wants this it gets that it wants this it gets it i can't get this well it'll work for it that'll get it it's a very demanding thing but you've got to put it in its place amen because of member you say well i was born in a broken my my great great great great great great grandfather's family was broken home broken home broken home whatever whatever so it's their fault no no what do you do with the foxes the garden's now yours do you let the good husband come in and shoot all the foxes or do you just look at your mess and say well this is not fair for me remember we can call them jesus on the main line tell him what you want hallelujah he's only a call away the fox exterminator is only a call away and he's not late hallelujah no so there was another nature in me see two natures in there well i only catered to one as it growed i good as a baby dadda first thing you know i become a liar become everything else that's a sinner because i raised up that way but down in there was a little speck of life all the time thank god for that speaker life i used to remember as a little boy i hope i'm not holding you too long but knowing sitting out here on the creek bank and i would sit out there and look around at night time pop and mom they'd gone out to their rest them days they were sinners there was no christianity in our home at all and oh my my drinking and parties carrying on it made uh uh it made me sick i'd take my lantern and my dogs and go to the woods and stay all night in the winter time i'd hunt till the party was over maybe daylight in the morning come home wouldn't be over i'd lay on the top of the shed and sleep waiting for the daylight to break then i think uh how many times so i just read the series a bit small how then i think of how that times then been out there in the summertime get my sticks and put them down for a little wind break where if it rained lay there and have the pole sticking out um on the water fishing mile dog landing out saying lookie here you know last winter i camped right here one night i built a fire right here when i was waiting for my old dog here to tree and i had a fire here it was froze five inches deep in the ground but little flower where'd you come from see well and where'd you come from who come out of here and planted you and what hot house did they bring you out of or what about it where'd you come from see that little flower i'd say well it was frozen everything and i built a fire on top of it besides the freezing element here was a heat element laying here on a big old log where i burned you and yet here you are you're alive where'd you come from what was it there was another william branham see a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of god the word of god that was placed in there each one of you can think of similar things see it was working will you remember those times where'd this come from where did i come from what's this all about there's another nature china come forth this is a domesticated fox this is from this website verge.com it's a science website so here's someone holding this fox this was 60 years in the making now you think 60 years that could be say three generations of of of people now foxes live about three or five years some up to ten years but this is a selective breeding process at first this would have been a foreign you couldn't just go pick up a fox it would bite you so remember but now generations down now this fox is tame you can scratch them behind the ears maybe play fetch you know train it to do little tricks but in this fox is a wild nature and it doesn't matter what kind of dog you have you can have lupine you can have poppy you know you can you know in those dogs deep deep deep deep down there is a wolf nature you may think i don't think i could find it but it'll be in there because it's traits that are still in it so it's the same thing with you and i we can get used to they got so used to these foxes they became part yeah pets become part of the family and and if we're not careful temper can become part of the family strife envy unforgiveness bitterness resentment lust amen greed whatever it may be you know all those things just become part of the family at first oh no they're not part of the family but you led in a fox oh boy he hangs around and then his children we hang around as children's children will hang around and eventually you pick him up and you defend him you look after him you feed him you feed that ego feed that unresentment you know feed that bitterness well this person did this to me and they did this to me and you know basically you're patting your fox and scratching him behind the ears what you need to do is throw him down and shoot him hey man hey man but the pro and and the thing is it's amazing with animals it's amazing with animals the pet industry is a very big industry multi-billion dollar industry i remember i wish i had a photo of it but i think you know there was a billboard i can't remember where it was in um wellington and there was i think a child needed some money for some high-end drug for cancer or some very rare form of cancer and the billboard said if this was my dog i would have had the money already nothing wrong with pets you got to be careful with what pet you have right yep so we can hang around we can things can be part of our life it can become normal i just you know all jesus help us now because you know we are in these bodies if we do not understand how we're built we will end up hating ourselves brother bam says in 1961 do i have this up here somebody told me oh this is a chief i was rejoicing about them paul put this up somebody told me here one time one time was converted received the holy ghost said to me how are you doing hey getting along says well pretty good pretty bad he said well how you mean pretty good and pretty bad he said well since we received me received the holy ghost he said there's been two dogs in me one of them a black dog whether my white dog he said they argue all the time they growl and fight at one another they said the white dog wants me to do good the black dog wants me to do bad did they fight they you know as i said we'll drag this guy into a but i'm gonna drag this guy's being dragged to a body change he may resent it he may resist it and he will because it's the two different natures fighting but this one will hallelujah remember the greatest enemy we have is not the devil and not the hordes of hell it's not it's not satan our biggest member he was defeated it down calvary amen our lord jesus went down took the keys of hell death and the grave of him he's absolutely stripped of all power but he's a bluff right he's a bluff buddy so he's not our biggest enemy you say well what are we fighting against then you're fighting against the man in the mirror this flesh man that you wake up and you you know look at him in the mirror he is your biggest enemy it's not the devil yeah yeah the devil must be so happy sometimes we get so mad at him and we we accuse him of all different kind of things and he's just like what what are they accusing me of now okay i'll take credit for that that's fine and the reason he'll do that is because he just thinks they don't understand it's that human nature that i cause to be hybrid with the serpent and it gets passed down that fallen human nature it's actually that guy that's their enemy but they're but they're so angry at me and says okay it's fine i'll be the fall guy i don't mind because as long as they don't see who's the real enemy what's you know it's like you take in the political arena what if we start i don't know you know some nation wants to destroy the world and we're blaming some poor guys in south america saying they're the beginning of me you know these guys who want to destroy the world they don't mind they read the western news these silly guys are thinking that south american can't no no we're gonna do it they wouldn't mind it's not the devil he doesn't mind you know if we blame him for everything when it's not always him we give him too much credit sometimes sure sometimes it's him and it's really is him but sometimes it's really really you why foxes fox is spoiling the vine oh boy i think we just get a big shotgun with the poison what if you want to just just let's just get rid of the things we have the holy ghost here amen we have we have the guy that can eradicate the foxes you mean this little thing i've been fighting with for decades yeah him there come a time when he comes into subjection there come a time when this guy is dealt with we don't have this is not a place where we live without problems this is not a place where we just get used to him well this is how you feed him this is how you look after him and rearrange this this person's life is rearranged now around this fox it can be a very big extent it can be a very small extent but this fox has part of this person's life so the temper can just be a little bit of time or it can be all the time the unforgiveness can be a little bit of time all the time right hallelujah stubbornness oh boy all those kind of traits you say but i'm in the bright age i'm the bride oh yeah but we're not exempt from this that's right last time i checked i was a human last time some people may not think so but i'm pretty sure i'm part of the homo sapien race or whatever they call you know i'm one of them there's seven billion out of us upon the planet doesn't matter what color height width whatever you know dimensions we're human but the difference with the bride is there's a seed of god on the inside right there is a redeemable soul on the inside i mean when the holy ghost comes into that soul then he begins to take over that person's life but we have to let him take over that's right amen so in a way it's like a rental no pets allowed no pets allowed on this guy oh but he's so cute look at him look at him he's like a corgi isn't he cute my friends had corgis little round guys and they run around their little legs and no no no no pets allowed amen so there's two natures so i haven't finished this quote yet the so the black so i said well chief which one of them wins the fight i said well that depends on which one chief feeds the most so i think it's a good answer here see it just depends on the warring of the body that's in you depends on which one you cater to because we've got to understand you will cater to one you will cater to one right which nature you cater to the carnal nature after the things of the world or the spiritual nature after the things of god that does it just like brother brown would say saying thinking man's filter man just has it is mine some drink or some woman that's all they think about that's catering to this guy the carnal man which one are we kating catering to you know we had we say well i don't have any foxes in my life well you know as i said foxes eventually became dogs by selective breeding yes right remember there was a male and female dog in the ark and out of those two we have these big ones this big one's this big one's you know all different colors sizes it's all by selective breeding now so you say well i don't have any any any uh foxes in my life well you just gotta see what happens when certain things happen around you you know we can have you can have two people and they can have exactly the same temperament born on the same day same nature even the same kind of socio-economic you know conditions where they're raised in two parents all those things but yet and and something can happen in front of those two people and they can act very differently to the same situation why because of foxes scars in the spirit pain hurts that they carry in their body one can flare up and be so distraught or troubled and the other one doesn't affect them at all foxes you know we had a labrador growing up he's a great dog you could throw him around you could body slam him you could land him you can you know we used to we you know we used to push him around you know his fat rolls would make him move a certain yeah you just push him around and you know it wouldn't bother him he was he was just placid as placid could be but then when the neighbors came along with someone that he didn't know to the to the gate he would bark and he would jump and he would you know and and it never bothered us but it bothered those around see see many things in our lives it doesn't bother me when i go off the handle it doesn't bother me and it's just like our dog he never did that to me we pushed honestly we pushed him around you know laid on him used him as a pillow he he just took it all not one nip hallelujah amen so hey this temper never bothered me i've got righteous indignation this person gotta they've got to repent and they've got to ask forgiveness and i'm not gonna do that hold on that's that's that's that's the dog barking you know it's never been a problem you know some people seem to think some people seem to think they can only you know they'll blame everyone else for their problems when they're by themselves i'm rapture ready but when they seem to come in contact with certain people and it may be their spouse or their children or people they know or they get so troubled and this happens and they just flare up and but it's the other person's fault no it's not you've got a fox you've got dogs on your property that need to be shot hallelujah amen they'll blame you know they will blame their failure of a christian life based on their spouse or their children or on their extended family and all the reason is because the dog is jumping and barking and making a whole bunch of noise ever seen people they just you know it's like a buttons push and crazy just pops out why on earth do they react in that kind of way i didn't call them a name i'll just call them fox amen but then as soon as all that's gone they're quiet hey our labrador quiet peaceful you know but when people came around oh boy you know that's why some people seem to think well if i was by myself up in the woods someplace or you know on an island i'll overcome but we have to understand we bring ourselves with us we're turning a page we're going to go here you take yourself remember the biggest enemy we have is the man or woman in the mirror hallelujah but we have the weapon amen to defeat that guy [Music] you know and and people can you know we we already had fences around our property but you know just say if you got a dog and you know there's no fences that would just roam and trouble the neighborhood and come back and so no doubt you want to hold on to that dogs you'd put fences up you'd compensate to keep that dog on the property maybe well it's trouble when when the postie comes or the courier comes so you'll put some fences up at the back of your property that it can't come to the front and you know you'll compensate they'll compensate their whole life to keep that dog on the property but it'll get out amen eventually there'll be a prison break so we can you know try and control ourselves and our human self will and you know keep it all sorted you know all right oh but there's there's a dog in the back and he says are you following me this is not a reforming this is not well seven steps to good behavior that becometh a christian no no no this is a transformation but we understand that as we as we go from glory to glory hey foxes are getting killed they're being pushed out i mean they've been driven off the property things that are you know how we're raised is normal to us until we get older then we can see a contrast right so when you're young you think well this is normal and you may have had the craziest parents that are from the crazy crazy crazy line your last name might mean crazy but when you're young you think that's normal and so what happens is the things that subconsciously now how your race will actually when you get old have children that will actually be passed on to your children so there's been some foxes raised in the family you inherit them and then you pass them on you know i doubt very much that a parent would wake up in the morning say how can i scar my child today i doubt very very much even the most twisted broken person i don't think they'd wake up and say i'm just going to break them again unfortunately we all have foxes right we all [Music] we all have things in our spirit that come up and trouble us which is a fox i remember it was actually not that long ago i so i had a soccer injury where i i i tried to kick with my foot and my big toe tried to take the half of the field with me when i kicked the ball and i did it twice and so the joint with my big toe into my foot it all puffed up and you know so i was limping along but then eventually it became right but then not long ago i was carrying our sun down the hallway and my foot just went my toe just went click and every time i'd walk would you click click click click it was real weird i have the same kind of thing with this thumb i tried to jump a creek in my old days and i didn't jump the creek and for some reason this will click every so often but so what happens is so this was a past injury and now it's flared up again and so what i was doing is i was walking in such a way that i'd compensate how i was walking and now this knee that was never originally injured i can't really even bend down and put weight on it anymore and this has come right again but this hasn't come right again so i'm so i've compensated naturally walking now i've compensated naturally walking from an injury here to and i've compensated now i've just injured another part of my life and so someone comes and hurts us when we're young man or woman whatever it is and now we put up a defense and now we can't someone comes along who's maybe you know totally different person decades later and they're actually part of your family now and you can't trust them because you're been compensating your walk for so long because of a former injury why didn't you go to the doctor and get your toe fixed i thought it was fine she'll be right i don't know if he could have i don't know if he could have fixed it i don't know but i didn't go we have a great physician right we don't have to compensate our walk with god right because of trauma that's happened in the past amen so we don't need to compensate for barking dogs so maybe something young that happened to us but it still affects us that that so that took 60 years in the making i don't know how six thousand odd years this has been in the making too spiritually so i said children normally think how they're raised as normal yep they're all thinking deep maybe but then when they get older they see a contrast maybe now just as chief said here chief said here there's a black dog there's a good and a bad dog which one you cater to now our body is is an interesting thing now this is from remember now keep dogs in mind remember we've gone from foxes in a while they become domesticated now they're part of the family now this is from dummies.com i thought it's interesting now it's very important how you treat a dog in a family because remember it is there's an instinct in it it's got a pack mentality a wolf pack mentality or wild dog mentality it's still in it so it's very important how you feed your dog or how you treat your dog this is this this guy okay keep this in mind when i'm talking about a natural dog now when you eat your meals you must eat your meals before you feed your dog your dog should not eat before you do this is from dummies.com in the wild the alpha dog chows down first and lesser pack members snivel in the background waiting for the leftovers eat your own meals before you feed your dog if your dog's meals are scheduled around your own breakfast and supper times be sure that you feed her or him after you've eaten why is that because if you feed it first it will think it's the top dog you haven't told it it's the top dog you haven't said no you're in charge of this pack and i place you in the highest place and you no no it's just how you treat it it thinks it's the best now which one are you feeding right which one are you catering to see see a natural family can cater to a dog and it can think it's top dog because it's fed first another thing they say is do not pet your dog when he or she nudges you with a nose or a paw so dog can come along and nudge you or pour you it wants a scratch don't do that because in dog language that pit is ordering you to pander to its needs all right i mean but we would probably do it because we love we love our pet hey i don't hate this guy amen you know no one in their right mind hates their own body so we can't feed it we can't feed it first we can't pander to it just because it wants to be pandered too but some people literally worship their dogs they literally worship their pets now i'm saying if you ever got a dog you enjoy your dog right now as i said we had a dog growing up here's a awesome dog and their lives will revolve constantly around their animals until they become their comfort zone i'm talking about this guy here you've got this guy in mind yes so their whole life remember the scripture says they'll become lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god so they will love things that pander to this guy more than worshipping god amen right and they will some will actually put more time and effort and heart into their own dogs than they do their own family because he's never done me wrong what because he's never barked at you he's back to this guy this guy's never done me wrong yeah but he's barked at that guy right yes see you cater to a natural dog you just think about the let's just go into a mind of a dog just your your a four-legged friend you feed him first and then you pat him and you scratch him when he wants and then now he thinks subconsciously i'm the top of this pack so wherever the husband or the father sits he'll sit on that chair or he'll go lay in their bed he could because he's being told you're number one you're in charge and then you come along and say get off my couch you stupid dog and you get angry and get frustrated and this poor dog is going but you let me sit here but you let me be and now you're telling no you're telling me i'm stupid and i'm dumb and i'm not listening who's following me and then but the thing is so so one gesture you're the top at the next minute get out of here you mangy animal imagine the the anguish in that dog's mind but i thought i'm number one why are you treating me like this but i'm number one you're showing me on number one by what you do to me but now you're telling me i'm the last and the and you know am i the top or am i the bottom of the pack tell me someone and then now a person comes this way a believer right they love their flesh they let their spirit lead them around oh i don't feel to to do this today the heart is deceitful above all things well i just don't feel like this who said we're led by our feelings you know the world says just follow your heart well where's that lead then it's going to lead them to nuclear nuclear war that's where it's going to lead them you know live for the moment i'm living for a moment a change in a body moment that's the moment i'm living for you know so a person will because remember we've got two natures within us we'll cater to one and then we get mad at ourselves i can't believe i said that i can't believe i did that and we get frustrated at our own flesh are you all following me right we get we get angry and frustrated why it's just like the dog he's gets fed first he gets looked after the best and then you tell him get out of here you're not in charge and he has this emotional roller coaster and it's because we are treating that dog not where it should be it's the same thing with our flesh we'll get frustrated i can't believe i did this i can't believe i said that comes if i acted that way things he thought that were were dead and gone somehow they rise up well what nature are we catering to what nature are we catering to that's why i said you know we'll drag this we'll drag this guy to a body change eventually amen so but we can't get we can't hate our own self see people actually begin to hate their own selves you know you take even and you know and these things can can actually affect you years down the track you take a young person you know we are all built to love someone biologically right man loves a woman woman loves a man it's just built within us we can't help that right but then the world has perverted that to such a degree you know that remember i'll say it like this sex in its right place there's nothing wrong with it in marriage perfect thing god ordained beautiful thing but the devil's perverted it so much that now what happens is people get so they can get so twisted in their minds that they can't even actually love someone or feel a physical attraction to their spouse but god never ordained it that way so you know they can begin hating their bodies because they've had a maybe a trauma in the past they're trying to compensate for it oh boy we shouldn't remember everything just because the devil makes something horrible he had to pervert something to make it that way i just put it like this when you're growing up you'll be attracted to someone until you find your real mate and then you just love them amen right because we're built that way we can't become like a statue that has not just a robot and eventually you say i do then you can activate all those senses that's not how it works but yet some people will try and live that kind of way because they get angry at their own selves they don't understand how their bodies work job would say in job 11 and 12 i hope that's okay now for for vain men would be wise this is job 11 and 12. for vain men would be wise though man be born like a wild asses cult so um so job is looking into the nature the first nature we're born with and he's saying that we are born like a wild asses cult that's a donkey cult what's a donkey stubborn this flesh is stubborn indifferent it'll kick you if it can it'll cause all kind of trouble this is the house you live in i'm talking about your house i mean you know it can be all that kind of way but there is within you a power to overcome amen holy member there is a power to get rid of the foxes what kind of foxes are there and security is a big one how do i fit in the grand scheme of things you know you you know insecurity maybe you are moved around heaps as a child you just want some stability and people will virtually build a fortress around what they love in their hobbies and they say all because why a fox of insecurity instability's there amen unable to trust that's another fox because something happened i can't trust this guy i can't trust her i mean bitterness resentment can't feel love to empathy towards people because no one felt it towards them or because they were hurt all those kind of things they are foxes and we didn't want them we didn't sign up for them but they found us now be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever man soweth that shall he also reap for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap ever life everlasting and let us not be wearing well doing for in due season we shall reap if we fight not as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith so we want to reap life everlasting he says here don't never let a little ism or a little something another a little bad feeling ever rise among you get it out right away now see that's it's the little fox that spoils the grapes you know so keep it out of the way as soon as the fox comes on the perimeter of your life hey if you can't hit it just shoot a warning shot just get that thing out don't even don't even name it just kill it just just chase it away amy tell the per um any little feeling go and tell the person uh to it say i'm wrong i don't i don't feel right towards you or something help me pray over it that i'll get better because we don't want nothing but just purely the unadulterated holy spirit of god among us that's all we want then the gifts and things will work right and everything will be coming right amen now this is a wild dog who's seen these we saw them in the in the kruger they were we actually were driving along and and they were they were right there we actually drove with this pack of wild dogs along this road now that just looks like a dog doesn't it that thing will eat you alive they don't kill their prey and then eat them they just start eating and so they look up at you with these puppy eyes i thought i could have got out and give them a scratch that would have been the last scratch i'd ever give don't eat don't yo yo there's a saying don't feed the animals right don't feed the animals don't feed this animal don't feed this animal don't pander to this guy because it will eat you alive why has the world got so many problems they've been feeding the wrong dog i mean they've just got the black dog you're the evil dog whatever you want to call it you know it's just pandering to that one don't feed the animals oh but i want to domesticate them why i want to get used to having this in my life why what good what good has bitterness done anyone let's just let's just let's just think about this what has business done anyone what has unforgiveness done to anyone what's a grudge you ever done anyone what's mistrust on anyone oh i've got to protect myself no no haven't done anyone any good so why feed the animal why keep the foxes around they'll ask you the question what has joy done anyone what has peace done anyone remember which dog you want to feed because one will one will eat you alive the other one will be real good to you hallelujah the white dog will be real good to you so what's joy done for anyone has it it's done no one anything bad peace has done no one anything bad peace of mind just done amen love has that done any anything bad to anyone real love no holly long suffering gentleness have they done have those things done anything bad to anyone no so why do we feed this guy does this mean i just live in another in a monastery no no no no you go enjoy life go on holiday whatever you know brother brahm had to unwind had to relax go do the same thing right sure life is to be enjoyed but don't feed this guy don't pander to him why are you going through all these things foxes spoil the vine we want to see the lord live in a greater way you know you say well do i need to go through my life and make a big checklist of everything that's happened to me and then you know no no no you don't you just got to come to the law and say lord see the prophet had the gift he'd go back in someone's life and say this is what happened this is what happened this is why this is this i don't have that kind of a a gift but that holy spirit that did that is still here to meet every need that is here i mean we don't have to box and itemize everything you know people can be so you know people can be so insecure in themselves that they can they can be so worried about everything that as soon as something good is they'll just latch onto it and they'll basically just let everything else go we don't want to be insecure in our marriages and our friendships whatever it may be we don't want to be insecure we don't want to be insecure in the lord but that can be a fox that we can just get so used to looking after he's good he looks after me real well no no why you feed the fox you got to spend time and effort to feed this fox i think just get rid of the fox yes but i don't remember what it's like never to have foxes where's a whole new world a foxless world that you can enjoy oh but you know well what do you mean what's you know you take a natural animal you can't just go on holiday you've got to have someone look after it you've got to have food for it you've got to have their vet bills you've got yeah there's a lot of things you need to look after as i say i'm not against having animals but your whole life it's got to be actually built around you know if we had a dog we couldn't just drive up to tauranga and just here we are in taranga or go visit someone we're to look after our dog and that's the same thing with foxes in our lives we actually our lives begin to revolve around those things yeah there can be one thing in our life that our life can revolve around for decades but when that dog's gone when that dog's gone you can do what you want you're at liberty hallelujah and you can just walk on with god i'm going to leave that there this morning someone's going to break the cycle someone's going to break the cycle i believe i'm looking remember this is a generation that will break the cycle not just the cycle of death life and death but there'll be a people upon the earth that will break the cycle maybe their grandparents were indifferent and and and unforgiving there'll come a time when that comes to an end maybe an adulterous spirit came down through the family it'll come to an end maybe resentment or stubbornness or whatever it may be that will come to an end maybe just be emotionally detached that will come to an end oh then i believe i'm looking out of people amen that we are the cycle breaking generation i mean because this message that we have received breaks the cycle it breaks all curses it breaks all pain it breaks all worry brokenness complexes whatever it may be it is here to break the cycle hallelujah so the foxes that adam begin to live with from the fall we're gonna go back before there was foxes hallelujah and we are gonna live in such a way i say even now where hey the foxes can hang around all they want they're not going to come onto my property they're not going to come spoil my vine well how are you going to stop at spoiling it are you going to build a fence around yourself with quotes and scriptures and build and defend it oh no no no i have the good husbandmen i have the lord himself and he will take care of the foxes remember i we are a garden we are the lord's garden ali and the lord wants fruit hallelujah and so he is here if we let him take control you know we've got to give him the keys of our life we're going to give him the key say take control do what you want to do rearrange the furniture get rid of the foxes [Music] we have to let him do it and if we let him do it hallelujah one by one boom boom boom boom boom where they gone they're dead you mean that thing that my great great great great grandfather passed down to me that family heirloom that trait that you're known for as a family yeah he's dead he got taken care of how'd that happen i was born again hallelujah well i thought that happened years ago yeah but but we're grabbing foxes out as we go we're getting rid of these things as we go hallelujah we're going from glory to glory amen so this may have been 60 years in the making and it may be 60 years in the unmaking or it could be in a moment in unmaking this thing that we lived with for so long see you later amen amen let's stand shall we this morning praise the lord hallelujah amen let's just let's just all bow our heads shall we i think we should just talk to the lord together if you're like prayer you're more than welcome to come forward but you know the foxes on your you know the dogs on your property you know those things that run around and cause trouble to everyone and you're so shocked and resented i can't believe i let
