========================================

[Music] do [Music] so hey man good morning god bless you we're going to read right from our reading in the book of revelation chapter 2. greece in the name of the lord and happy to have you here in class this morning i came aware that the live class might be a bit small today but that's all right we've got a number of people out of town a little bit of sickness going around and we have kind of a moratorium on coming to church six so we've asked everybody if they're feeling the least bit down not to do that and so some my family my sister rachel some of the kids woke up went to bed last night woke up this morning not feeling too great and so i just advised him to stay back but the jd's out of town also ministering brother matt is away ministering in arizona and uh other different ones but we're here praise the lord and uh we all i i see enough uh on our facebook page to know that we have always a nice size um virtual audience amen on there who are streaming so we're going to look right at uh chapter two we got into the first church age on our last lesson let's pick up at verse one unto the angel of the church of ephesus right these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks i know thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are apostles and are not and has found them liars and has borne and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love amen we'll cease reading there today and move right into our lesson we came covered quite a bit of ground last time and i'm definitely not looking to go back over that material because we're in a series so if you missed it you can just get the archive all right so when we look at the church ages one of the things that we should point out is that god in the book of revelation and in and in the i should say not just in the book as it's written but in the ages themselves follows the pattern from genesis chapter 1 in that in verse 5 of genesis 1 and god called the light day and the darkness he called night and here it is and the evening and the morning were the first day so that you can see that brother branham points out to us how that in every age god brings the messenger at the end of a previous age when it has gone into darkness and so thus you can see that paul comes on the scene at the very close at the very darkness of the jewish age and he comes in then to usher in the next stage and that cycle continues all the way to laodicea now when it gets of course to layer to see and this is jumping ahead a little bit we'll cover this a little more thoroughly when we get to that age but when you get to laodicea then you have to have a change you know otherwise you would have the messenger coming at the end of the wesleyan age which we know that brother branham did not do that he actually didn't come on the scene till the middle of the 20th century and so and he even described his ministry as one born out of season now the reason he would say that is because the pattern had always been that he should have been back there but we realize that laod the laodicea age opens with the azusa revival which would be something that would look very much like the last day message which is why you would think we would have needed our profit right then to usher that age in but the very fact that he wasn't born at the end of the wesleyan age and he did not usher in the azusa revival is indicative it indicates to us that that that that the azusa revival was not and could not have been the restoration of the message of the original uh word that it was the long-awaited restoration it was not we have discussed many times the further evidence that it was not that long awaited restoration was the fact that they denominated as had luther's age as had wesley's age and as would azusa the revivalist and by the time brother branham arrives on the scene late to the party it they're already fractured and brother branham even says when i found them uh he said i found that they were just as fractured as we baptists were and that troubled his mind but you have to realize that that in the last day there's the prophecies from the old testament is that he would there would be a former rain there is a ladder rain but the prophecy concerning the restoration was that he would bring the former and the latter reign at the same time right in the same age in the same time frame and so uh it winds up very uniquely with with christ being put out of the church and thus the age of the church ends because christ is no longer there to represent it and we find that that uh the bride then is brought on the scene by the word now again i don't want to get too far ahead we'll cover that more thoroughly at laodicea but what we do find out then is that this is why paul would come upon the scene and he's going to introduce this next coming age the the age of the holy ghost not the christian um era because that's during the time of the lord jesus earthly ministry of christ but this is the era of the holy ghost which is going to move christ the man moving in the body misses jesus christ and we've talked about that extensively and we don't want to uh just go back to too much into that that's why you know that that pre um that pre-restoration message time of laodicea brother branham refers to that and just simply calls it nearly he said it could almost be called an extension of the philadelphian aids because it was accomplishing things in prophecy so we find then that when he comes here paul comes to this age uh we come down to verse 2 i know thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil thou has tried them which say they are apostles and are not has found them liars so he says here i know thy works and thy labor and so brother branham begins to point out to us as he's teaching on this age that you can see that legalism is already starting to creep into the church which which you have to take this into account that if brother branham is indicating that here is where legalism is starting to creep into the church then you can know by brother branham's statement that the the the opposite of that would would have to mean that the church was not ever founded on legalism that if if it was founded on legalism then you would either have to say legalism is continuing or legalism is starting to fade but actually he notes their their works and their labor in the first age don't forget that this is the age that starts in in 80 53 once the church starts to fall away brother branham doesn't associate those first couple of decades with the age of the church because that's the ministry of the son of man the ministry that was in christ is now moving perfectly into his church when it moves into the chur age of the church and we find that they start to backslide they start to get cold then christ has to begin his intercessory work on behalf of their ignorance now it's not to say he wasn't interceding already for their transgressions just like today he's not interceding for ignorance anymore but thank god he's interceding for my transgressions so we do find out that he doesn't need to mediate for the age anymore and he's not mediating for the age anymore but he is mediating for his family so don't ever let anyone tell you that he's not still the lamb of god as a mediator for his family brother branham said he must continue in that office until that last name is brought in so but that brother branham is clear i know some men have tried to make strange doctrines out of that but i you excuse me if i just stick with what a prophet taught us would that be all right beth tabernacle and so we find then though that now that this is the age that they've began to lose their first love and he's noticing its works and labor brother branham points out to legalism creeping in and so we we find out that that by that by you know by by our human nature we fall into legalism it's human nature to think of keeping a scorecard on your own life and so we have to continually be reminded of the grace of almighty god paul spends a lot of time peter john all of them jesus spent a lot of time talking about the grace that comes from god and we were told particularly of a prophecy of the end time that we should be prepared for the day in the revelation of jesus christ for the grace that will be received i'm glad to know today friends that in the then the most wicked age of all time where we very likely have more missteps than any other age there is a grace promised to us as the as the headstone comes crying grace grace unto it so it was relaxed it was a relaxing time we've talked about that i don't want to go back over all that again but they were beginning to relax the standards of what the new birth meant and what it would take to receive the new birth it's false doctrine is already coming already starting to creep in individuals are already starting to make something you know more out of themselves and you get kingdom builders already rising up and john had a particular issue with a man who who who anybody that went to hear john preach that man would excommunicate him from his church can you imagine and that was going on right in the time when john was still alive and so then you know to say nothing of of the the things that peter had to face you know when here's ananias and sapphira his wife or when he's facing simon the sorcerer who had all this influence among the people or when paul has to constantly battle against the judaizers and their influence in the church was so strong that in the book of galatians you find peter and barnabas even get swept up in it and paul has to rebuke him openly and say my goodness you know we're not we're not that's not what calvary came for the the the grace of god if you're gonna live by that legalistic code then you're making the cross of christ vain so you can see that by the time paul is going long gone and the church now is receiving its its message as it's began to decline not not before the decline but in the decline god in prophecy would already be telling them here's going to be your problem paul called it grievous wolves coming in not sparing the flock the holy spirit interprets it in john's prophecy that you're going to leave your first love you're going to start to have legalism come in you're going to be you're going to get all about works by the time you get to thyatira that's that's all they got left i mean they've only got their works and god says look the age is so dark i won't even put anything else upon you just you know just carry on as best by your works and uh and in fact is the last vestige that luther was uh compelled luther was compelled in his ministry to take a hold of the last thing which was about to die it's the last vestige of true christianity which was that calvary made a way that man could have direct access to god through jesus amen but the catholic church had turned it into wax candles and purgatory and praying to saints and rosary beads and virgin mary and all this stuff and so luther's given a given a command get a hold of that last element that that the just shall live by his faith in christ and and strengthen that which is about to die and of course luther uh accomplished his his task because that uh that the just shall live by faith has never been threatened again uh since the dark ages because protestantism that's what all protestantism is established on so they've never been able to threaten it again but he says here you know this is the age where verse 3 where you find them or verse 2 you found them has tried them which say they are apostles and are not and so you know he's commending the church that they're still willing to go back and try the spirits according to the word not by experience but by the word brother branham would say away with experiences as your measuring line i was reading uh this morning a story that um that uh wigglesworth told about how that he was you know him and his wife were visiting two young sisters and um and suddenly while he's talking to them one of them says a voice is talking to me and the other sister's like oh what is it and says well it's a secret and says well you but i can tell you and as she begins to tell it there's brother wigglesworth and his wife listening and they're supposed to go and to the to the train depot and they're supposed to buy a ticket to a certain place to glasgow i think and when you buy it you're going to have exactly six pence left and when you get on the train there's going to be a man seated who's going to give you all the money you ever need and there'll be a woman across from him with a nurse's cap on and and brother you know wigglesworth says i could tell immediately that this whole thing was of the devil he said it didn't witness with my spirit at all but the the story goes that those ladies got there and sure enough they bought a ticket and sure enough when the change come back they had exactly six pence and now they're running all over the place you know god has spoken to us we're gonna go be great missionaries and when the train pulled up there was no man there was no nurse there was no nothing and then then one of them says oh the voice is talking again and it's going to be on the next train and so they wait and they're running all up and down the depot and wigglesworth said he's watching the whole thing and they got on train after train after train and never found that and he said they went on until after nine o'clock that night and he said it just goes to show you that if they would have went back to the word and tested their voice by the word they would have never fell victim to that and so he says here you know you you you have those who say the apostles but you found them liars and brother branham said the way they did it was that they they would judge them by what paul taught were they teaching and if they weren't that would be the indictment you're not teaching what paul taught i think that's our measuring line today friends we have a message that came to us and anybody that teaches contrary to that message is not teaching what paul taught because this message that came to us is the restoration of paul's teaching completely verse 3 and has borne and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted so he goes all down you know for my for my namesake that's interesting because you know when when you it you know what they're what they're battling there in the beginning in this early age you know everybody is baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ so he says for my name's sake so you're taking a stand for true christian baptism later in subsequent ages he'll come and say you have a name by which you think you're saved but you're dead because by that time now the trinity had taken over and so but in this first age you find out that they they they would come later and have a name that you live but you're dead because you know baptizing those titles of father son holy ghost but here in ephesian church age they're saying that for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted so verse 4 nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love all right so your first love now it's interesting because when we talk about the love affair of god you know i i when you i i heard a brother um this morning uh brother tim calhoun was teaching not on this particular passage he was actually teaching on the philadelphian church age but he went back and and founded you know because in the first age they're leaving their first love in the sixth age the it's the age of brotherly love where love is being restored and that's of course restore restoration of the bride tree that makes perfect sense and so we find that brother tim went back to leviticus and i was astounded because i realized that when you look at the book of leviticus and you've heard me say it before to me the book of leviticus is the gospels of the old testament in the new testament you have matthew mark luke and john in the old testament you have the book of leviticus because why the entire book of leviticus is the story of jesus it's all about appro getting the approach to god and the sacrifices it takes and the step by step and the priesthood and and coming to the shekinah and the high priest and the lamb sacrifice and the sprinkling of the blood so that whole book of leviticus is the old testament gospels to me and and so when you start thinking about men now you watch what the catholic church did this is an interesting point because the catholic church what they literally have done is taken the old levitical worship those standards of you've got to do this and bring this and have this and there's got to be this and this and it's all very meticulous and they have literally taken that style of worship and overlaid it into christianity and that's why you have people today they first have to come light a candle then they have to go have the eucharist and then they you know they have to say the rosary and they have to hold their bees and have to pray to a saint it's all about these approaches and then they have to go into the confessional and the priest has to forgive them you can see that what they've done is take the free access that god made that christ made to god and and brought it back to steps and ritual and works and legalism and this and it and you know what it ends up being it ends up being a an overbearing burdensome guilt-ridden penitence and you know uh lashing themselves and works and crawling on glass and all of these things and and and and and they they've made and they've literally turned the old testament law into something that it never even was to begin with you have to remember that in the garden of eden when fellowship is lost between god and his and his children adam and eve aren't the only ones out they're not even the main ones the one that's hurt the worst is god because now the whole purpose that he made man he's cut off from it his whole thing was he loved fellowship brother brown talks about that god was lonely he didn't like that he said it's not good for a man to be alone so he he creates him a family and a kingdom and so now you find that god who loved fellowship now it's cut off and brother branham would say that immediately he began to make a way back he would not see his masterpiece laying there face down in the dirt broken ruined he said he began in masterpiece to build it back immediately he said because he's god and he won't be defeated and so you realize that what's the first thing he does he gives a revelation to abel to take a lamb sacrifice it kill it on a rock and offer it to god because what is this doing this is god trying to get restored he's trying to say i've lost fellowship with you now i can't have it back perfectly until the lamb of god comes at calvary but i'll give you a substitutionary way i'll give because i want you to be in fellowship with me and i don't want to wait 4 000 years for calvary you see my point so so when this is why this is exactly why sons of god never had a problem with the law that's why david had no problem with it david said i love the law see so to david to men of god the law that came from sinai was never a burdensome thing never a loathsome it was not like the catholic church has it set up it was this was our opportunity they would read the word in the days of ezra they just read the word and they read it all day and the people stood there and just rejoiced at just hearing it read the law and they and they they had a desire to change their lives they had a desire to undo the things that had separated them from god and so you know that's why brother branham when he comes to the statue of a perfect man and he goes to peter peter saying that by these precious promises you might be a partaker of the divine nature so that's the good news that's not legalism that's that's why the law wasn't ever designed now the those false jews they wanted it to be that way that's why brother branham said it was a rational decision because god was looking at their heart at their motive they they wanted to be able to not they wanted to be able to dot all the eyes and cross all the t's of the requirement but not have to have a relationship with god but relationship is what he was after that's why he gave the law you understand that's why it was never a problem to a son of god to a daughter of god they loved the law of god david said i hide it in my heart that i sin not against it that wasn't fear that was love in fact his brother branham said the thing that wearied david in his heart was that he had hid the law in his heart put it between his eyes tied it to his bedpost meditated on it day and night but brother branham said because he didn't have the holy ghost and couldn't get a new birth the thing that weared him was he never could make that word live in his life and that was a dread to david it's a dread to us amen friends because why we're afraid we'll miss the rapture afraid we'll go to hell no because i love god's righteousness his law is my delight amen and so so so you know i think here some time ago we made we made the point that you know if you consider the where your relationship is with god today and we would ask the question to say when was when since the day you gave your heart to the lord when is when has the your relationship to god been the sweetest and and if you're if your answer is not right now then you need to get to praying see just like in the my own wife the love affair that we have i mean i loved her the day i married her amen and then we began to have children have a family and made me love her even more but if you ask me today brother jason did you love her the most when you first met her i would say i loved her but not that wouldn't be the most what about when you married her and stood at an altar and said till death to his part yes of course i loved her. but what about when he started to have children oh it became even more but if you ask me when do you love her the most i would say right now those times can't even combined can't compare to how i feel about her right now and and that's that's our relationship to god and that's why the problem in the first age was you've left your first love and so it wouldn't be very hard for rome to talk everybody into let's make it a legalistic let's make it a ritualistic let's make it spiritualism because that's that's what was uh what israel done they tried to make it like that and that was never god's plan god came down to be their god and to talk to them and to have fellowship and they ran and moses pleaded with them don't go backward he wants to talk to you come forward and i don't know moses no we don't want that level we don't we're not here for that level just give us a do's and don'ts list you know we're not we're not interested in that kind of a level we're perfectly happy you know with the life that we have and so so you see that that this is god complaining to the church you're you're falling away from the purpose i died you're falling away from grace you're falling away from the fact that i love you and you're trying to serve me by works you'll never do it israel couldn't do it i i only gave them the law to prove to them they couldn't keep it see man shall not live by bread alone why did he why did he why did he do that so that why did he give them manna to prove to them they had so much mana they got sick of it and the and and the reason that he did that was to prove to them you think you need bread but i'm here to tell you you need more than bread you can't live by bread alone so there's a there's a whole heaven of blessing and anointing and righteousness and love and and and the love of god that can pass all understanding so that'll take us down to to verse five we're still working our way through um the ephesian church age amen let's stand father we thank you for our lesson today and we take took just another step lord and i i'm grateful to you lord jesus as i stand here today so grateful that you bring these things out to us and make them live we see you more clearly as we study your word so we commit it to you now in jesus lovely name amen god bless your friends um there will be an intermission and we'll start back shortly god
