brother Paul wrote back when he was 18 years old so amen it's always been one of my favorite songs and I've been praying for quite a while when the Lord would let me sing this song and then finally he gave me the okay he said probably within a couple weeks ago so we haven't really had the chance to practice it much but we're gonna give it a try you have the words for that song this world is falling apart amen if you can see that out on the internet then sing along with me if you know it clap your hands amen here goes while living below everywhere that I go this world of trouble and pain there's

I wonder if you could brother Luther come and pick up the offering and the prayer requests brother Branham said that amen no service is complete without an offering so we're gonna take it up I got to thinking about that it was at first last service I did it it was just out of kind of what I was like normal and then I thought about what brother branham did say no service is complete without it so we want to do that amen got a couple prayer requests here and you can play some softly sister Deborah the next song that was on that list a man a couple prayer requests yesterday I neither was on Facebook chatting of our four old friends and it finds out we found out that a friend of ours from brother vales church brother Li vales Church when we were attending services there up in Ohio Amen she is right now she's on life support and she's fighting this kovat 19 she's fighting for her life amen so it just goes to show my brother Matt has said I know he said it in the past on it just because we have the Holy Ghost it doesn't make us exempt from attacks from the devil so we would like you to pray for this sister her name's Angela white even after today if you want to just write it down amen and remember her in your prayers or the week that's coming and so forth and we'll try to give updates also I'm speaking with brother Isaiah Brooks last night and in his church in Iowa City there's two brothers that have it and they're in the hospital one's name is Isaac Mutombo and another is brother Marcus James so again just remember them maybe write these names down because this could be an ongoing fight that we're in I need these these believers need constant prayer also I have a special unspoken request that if you would remember me and my family amen [Music] god bless you

Lord most high Jesus Christ amen may man you love the Lord this morning god bless you brothers and the sister Deb we're happy to have you all here again amen helping us make the service possible across the stream amen it wouldn't be possible without the help of all of these various teams and so we sure are grateful for them all praise the Lord we're going to turn to Isaiah 53 this morning amen and what I'm going to do brother George you got the the third video I'm going to show again right so I'm going to probably show that right after we read the text will it the pray and be seated then we'll start it right then because I want to from where I left off Wednesday and so I want to go to that last video that we showed Wednesday because it's going to be significant paramount even for carrying on in this thought today I want to speak to you on the arm of the Lord the arm of the Lord Isaiah chapter 53 and a single verse verse 1 Isaiah speaking here concerning Christ who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed one more time who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed now it's both a question and but it's a little bit rhetorical because it implies that that somebody believed it and the arm of the Lord was revealed so amen let's let's pray father we thank you this morning for your word which is open before me and Lord Jesus anyone as brother Brandon would so often say anyone with human ability can open the pages of this book anyone Lord with a Grammar School education can read the words of this book Lord you don't even need to have eyesight they for blind people they have a language and Bibles written in Braille that you can read from there's so many ways you can hear it read for you you don't even have to read it you can push a button on a device and an artificial voice will read it for you Lord there's many ways that we can read and hear these words but as brother Branham always pointed humanity to this fact that it takes God to open our understanding so Lord this morning we are helpless without you this morning though we can open the book though we can read its words we can't know its depth of meaning unless you reveal it we learned Lord in last service that that you are you reveal your word to people and that Lord in and that that there's no way that anyone can see it unless you reveal it so master this morning we look to you as children unable Lord to feed ourselves we look to you to do it master help us father all across the airwaves now and in this sanctuary and Lord chiefly with me who stands here now Lord at the post of duty Lord I would be all together undone if it weren't for you so I'm surrendering myself to you we're all surrendering our hearts we're humbling ourselves and we humble ourselves again in your presence now make it known Lord it's important these are serious times and we need to see Lord clearly your movements in the world we need to know what is your perfect will for us in this hour I pray that you give everyone Lord here in the building today attentive hearts and ready minds give everyone sitting in their homes for them it'll be especially needful because the home environment produces a relaxing atmosphere and lord I pray that you will quicken everyone sitting now Lord listening and standing or and will be sitting to hear the Word of God I pray you granite now give us hearing hearts today above all things give us a will to do thy word granite master we confess our selves now dependent on you completely in Jesus name Amen god bless you as you're seated amen we have read this verse who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed now I want to show again that that last third video concerning how they build vaccines amen if we don't get it it's when I did my graduates No if we don't get it it's not critical because we've saw it already and I can refer to it and I'm sure everyone will remember so we'll give you just a minute here by the Georges human viruses are highly adapted to growing in human cells these viruses reproduce thousands of times in human cells gaining access using specific receptors that match molecules on cell surface receptors that match molecules on cell surfaces like athletes they get stronger and stronger by collectively training under the same conditions by continually training under the same and yet it's this very strength that makes it possible to weaken it's this very strength that makes it process leading is the key to making live acces vaccines how do scientists make this kind of axiom to scientists by forcing the virus to grow and regenerate lines of cells kinds of cells in the lab in these chick embryo cells most of the virus particles that were so good at the rare occurrences that exists the chickens can't access the chick cell with sheer numbers on their side but with virus particles are able to unlock the chair articles are able to unlock the chick cell and begin adapt into this new environment begin adapting to this new environment the virus adapts by modifying its Jesus but there's a price to pay as the virus gets better and better at growing in the chick cells it gets worse and worse at growing in our cells now when reintroduced to the human body as a vaccine these modified or weakened viruses have a hard time infecting human cells the virus multiplies less efficiently giving the immune system the time it needs to gather information about the virus and mount an antibody response the vaccine provides immunity to natural infection without making us pay the price of natural infection to relish its lessons and you know I I want to bring it in to the context of where we are today now we certainly it is not lost on us any here today in the building or over the airwaves that we are in a national crisis in fact is a pandemic represents a global crisis and I'm not here really to to you know just preach on you know the fears and and everything and there's all kinds of science and statistics we could give you today that would be perfectly fine it's just not my intent here today we I what I want to focus on is what does it mean to us in the word what because we know that brother branham has showed us time after time in numerous places that when when something climactic are serious is happening in the earth that it's a sign that something is happening in heaven now that's an important point just know this friends as we've said before you know I I don't know even what will be reported in the news tomorrow whatever this becomes in the next coming weeks they're showing certain things in China now where they're starting to get back to business as usual but then some people are saying there's going to be a second wave you know there are so many people saying so many things I just I just want to say that I'm just gonna worry about what he has to say that I'm safe in the CLEF of the rod now whatever happens to my body that's it's really not important jesus said that we're not even to fear that which destroys the body whatever happens in our body be it today tomorrow next week or next month we have access to Jehovah Rapha and that really ought to assuage all of our fears friends it really ought to put us at rest to say come what may these things if you want to call them pre-tribulation whatever you want to call them if you want to call if you want to use the word plague fine use the word plague all I know is that I'm I'm covered in feathers today hallelujah I'm under the wings of the great Jehovah eagle and so we realize friends listen when God promised Israel to when brought when God promised that Jerusalem would be restored and you can find this in prophecies through Ezekiel different places where he talks about the rebuilding the city and he actually is very specific on markers and it's going to go from this ancient marker which the Jews would understand and it's going to go after this because it had been Zack so many times it had been sacked by the babylonians it had been it had been sacked by the Romans in it you know uh all of these things that we find but you know Jesus I mean the Bible promising Israel that someday I'm going to rebuild it and it'll last forever and it'll never be raised again it'll never be sacked again it'll never be invaded by sin again in him it'll never be invaded by sin again and when and he one of the things that he promised them is that one of the corners would go over I forget the name of the Hebrew Valley but it was literally where they you know oftentimes the the dead were there the the the the waste of the land was there it was a it was a junkyard of of dead human remains and human waste and and every kind of debauchery and and he was saying to them one of the corners is going to go right over that Valley it doesn't matter what has happened in our lives whatever kind of death our defilement we've ever had I'm here to tell you God is erecting a new City over all my life hallelujah and I'm promised that I'm going to be lifted up into that city so it is a wonderful promise today I choose to think in those terms because first of all Paul says that to the Thessalonians in his letters to them how that he's reminding them they're not of the darkness there over the daytime they're not children of the night who are drunk in the night there are children over the day and so he says let us be sober in the day and he comes down and and every time or many times when Paul begins this this segregation between God's family and everybody else he where the weather he's talking about predestination positioning of the believers election God's position of the bride its position in Christ he often reminds us to encourage one another in these things so let me tell you today I'm not here to make you feel sad and say oh there's a global pandemic hey there is but guess what you're caught of God your chosen you're elected you're a peculiar people so we can lift up our head and rejoice today we find that whatever we see happening and I I made this statement before that it's it's at the very least a harbinger of transition because it's either it's either in coming weeks and months it's going to continue to get worse and worse and worse until I don't know maybe it'll spiral so bad that God will have to sweep in and rescue us in a rapture wouldn't that be amazing friends oh you can have this world I'll take the next one you can have this whole world just give me Jesus that's all I care about and I tell you God has a way to get us to only care about that and I just say Lord whatever it takes to get me to care about the word then whatever it takes because that's what i want to singularly focus on today because everything else will become ash and cinder i'm here to taste something friends this world that you pursue I don't care how lively and actively you pursue it I don't care what you accomplish everything you achieve in this world is going to ash and cinder and the only thing that will last is those things that are eternal which cannot pass away they were here before the tribulation and they'll be here after the tribulation so whether or not it spirals on down and this is the this is the beginning of the end of of our 2000 year journey of the Gentile church would to God it were so but even if it's not and if in weeks and months things seem to get back to somewhat normalcy I'm here to tell you something friends that's the psychology the subconscious of the world has been shocked and I don't think from this point on even if things go back to kind of normal I don't think that's ever going to be undone I think that mankind now has turned the corner I think that he's he's on just like us he's on his final stretch to his in and we're on our final stretch to her beginning hallelujah oh my can't come soon enough and and I know that even if things were to normalize to a degree they'll never go back I'm here to tell you the life though of the world that we had before this global scare and pandemic you'll never go back to that again because the world can't get better it must get worse and worse and worse Oh hallelujah so regardless of what it if it seems to improve I know this that this would only be the beginning of more coming and as I said get past this one and break the government and give away trillions of dollars fine I'm happy glad that everybody's gonna get some help but what are you going to do with the next five that come and the next ten after that I'm here to tell you there's not enough gold in all the world to hold mankind on his feet oh there's only one way that man can be saved and that's in the arms of Jehovah God hallelujah we know that what's happening listen friends I had a a very good friend of mine a minister pastor who we all know well you know he just sent me a message yesterday and just a single short question could this be the third pool very stewed brother one of my mentors and I and I and I wrote back to this is say some of the things I've said to you here I said you know it I can say this you know that that there has never been such an all collective I there's been times there's been national listen there's been wars and rumors of wars since the early days of the church we understand that there's been perilous times but we also know that the Bible talks about a multiplication of that that it's uh that it's an increase that it can't hardly even be kept abreast of that that once the world's knowledge increases and it keeps heating off of that tree rapidly his heart starts failing for fear mission starts rising its nation and now now you're starting to see everything that has ever been times a thousand and so we realized that it and I said look here's what we know this thing can't just keep going on and on and on and on there were only seven ages and there aren't anymore ages God only had seven stars in his right hand and they've all been spent hallelujah what do you think it's just gonna keep going and keep going and keep going it's impossible to just keep going and I said you know it seems that that I have never seen such out cumulative collection of events and transitions in the world like we are seeing today brother Branham when he's making reference in what thinking of Christ to when when threat strikes his children because remember friends and this is very clear in the scripture our squeeze is not a tribulation time squeeze that's not our squeeze our squeeze is an ecumenical squeeze and we don't even know you know you know there's a lot of things in play I mean I don't think that you can at least take a partial connection to brother branham standing in pulpits and saying listen friends you won't always be able to meet like this I won't always be your pastor won't always there's gonna come a time where we're gonna long for these days that we can gather together now listen friends we might end up gathering back together I don't know you don't know we might not I know we're not now we're under a mandate and even actually where we're violating the the requests of the governors to not be more than two people I'm glad he left it at least two because we're even two or three gathered crisis in the myths but here we are 10 today which is several times over what they're asking us to do and we're trying to follow all of the protocols a very weird time and I'm not here to be an alarmist but I am here to remind you that G the Prophet said these things would come and I don't know it I'm not trying to say I know what tomorrow holds or what next week or a few months holds but I'm here to take something friends I'm lifting up my head because I see these things as something that is actively moving towards that day that I have waited for all my life since I was a little boy and I said it my mother's knee and heard the stories of Jesus and heard about heaven and heard about that land and I've looked to the eastern skies all my life is this the hour what might be ahead of us just shortly and as I said even if we transition back to somewhat some semblance of normalcy what are you gonna do when playing upon plague it's like that brother I read his quote from Africa said welcome to a dress rehearsal not here to be afraid of that I am not the least bit afraid of it I said to the Lord last night I said Lord if I don't even doesn't even matter if the if the economy would collapse and we would all get down to just how come it may be communism as in the book of Acts not the man-made devil kind but in the bulk of book of Acts when they had all things in common I don't know will we return to that I don't know but I know this it won't matter I gotta tell your friends if we all end up in a tent city out in the woods we're still gonna be believing God oh I don't know I'm not trying to be an alarmist today that's the furthest thing from my mind but I want us at the same time to be aware as we said with to be on set of this and I said to you as a church take this time take this time when you can't a symbol take this time to gather with your families take this time to draw closer take this time to read more pray more study more talk to God more adjust things in your life don't don't don't let this time where God is obviously doing something in heaven and you miss out on all the benefits that you could have from it I know this I want I I said to the brother I said I know this friend I said to me I see a paradox and it's paradoxical to me because it is in such contra distinction as to be paradoxical I'm not talking about mere contrast I mean absolute contra distinction polar opposites at the very least where I have never in all my days seen such a conglomeration accumulative organised or highly organised forces of spiritual darkness coming against God's family trying to wreck homes and wreck children and wreck marriages and tear down the spirituality of God's people while at the exact same time I seek God's people with a greater thirst and a hunger and a zeal and a sincerity for spiritual righteousness and overcoming power I'm here to tell you those are so opposite and when the devil has reached his zenith and he's got all 16 cylinders running and this he's got pedal to the metal and yet a bride seems to be immune from it and she keeps rising higher and the harder he pushes the higher we go explain that you can't it's super natural it's not natural natural would be see the devil expects a natural response because we're natural people but his in his equation he doesn't count for the supernatural element so we real our the supernatural element so we realized that you know the question always comes does the enemy really think he's going to win the devil keeps pressing even though God has prophesied his destruction God has never been wrong Lucifer knows he's never been wrong God has already told Lucifer his in that's why he hates the book of Revelation hates Genesis because it exposes his deceptive start he hates revelation because it speaks definitively and I'm here to tell you the book of Revelation does not mince words it doesn't care anything about political correctness it literally tells everybody that are sinners you are going to burn in a lake of fire and that is unquenchable it tells about people who are going to be judged people who think God won't judge them you better read the book of Revelation it doesn't snot Gates doesn't care about political correctness it doesn't care about you know you know positive reinforcement it gives you a clear choice like God did to Israel when he had part of the priesthood stand stand on evil and part of them stand on ger ISM and the people had to walk in the valley between the two mountain peaks and these priests would shout down blessings purveying the Word of God and these priests would shout down cursings for disobeying and the people had to walk and listen to both sides of that and make up their mind I'm here to tell you that's returned and you need to make up your mind because the word isn't joking the world is coming to a complete end and God is going to wipe it clean of all evil and he's going to reestablish his kingdom right back here on earth God doesn't need to build a new plan he's taking back the one he built hallelujah it's full of trespassers and squatters and he's taking it back and he's going to put every person back in their brightly position so when we see things happening in the earth that are climactic - God's family brother branham comes to the to the three Hebrew children and he says what thinking of Christ and and he talks about now here when he got right up to the edge where they was - where they was to jump off into the fiery furnace and there it was about the darkest hour they had ever seen he didn't you can call it the darkest it was about the darkest they'd ever seen I'm here to tell you something friends I don't know if you're seeing the darkest hour but it's sure the darkest we've ever seen that is anybody in common sense would have to say that it's certainly the darkest hour we've ever seen and he says coming up to this fiery furnace furnace and just about the time they got ready to step in notice notice these loose words not not when they stepped on the buzzer it was as he says just about the time he didn't have to be stepping on the buzzer just about the time they got ready just about the time they got ready I'm here to tell you I think we're in just about the time and we're getting ready just about the time they got ready to step in brother Branham says let's turn our cameras I'm so thankful to brother Dale called me yesterday reminded me of this quote about shouted he says let's turn our cameras this morning and look up yonder in heaven break out of this dimension and look up yonder when things look so dreary here there's always something pointing on in another world I'm here to tell you something friends we're we're there we have arrived at the darkest hour we've ever seen we're just about ready to step into something we're getting just about ready to step in so let me say to you today don't worry about what's happening out here turn your cameras turn your cameras if this is happening here wow there must be something happening up there I'm here to tell you you can rest on that today I don't know what's happening all here but I know it's something's happening up there God is getting ready there's too many prophecies prophet left us with too many things that we know are coming and to be fulfilled in this brain and I just say Lord bring it upon my life now I so desire it whatever I got a surrender this ought to be an hour of surrender let me say it again this ought to be an hour of surrender not getting more stuff it's time to unpack well you you can't go up because you got too much weight as Paul said throw aside the weights and sins that beset us if that was ever true it's now that's the hour we've come to now as a number of things that would naturally come to our mind our worthiness it's not the least that should be on our mind our because it's going to take faith and you know it's just like when you are trying to believe for divine healing what does the devil attack your faith with symptoms and the real they're not figments of your imagination they're not metaphors they're not lost stories Satan comes at you with physical palpably real symptoms pain nausea fever weakness and and then you know and then these things then then he uses he goes through those physical realms to suddenly start afflicting your mind and then suddenly your imagination starts getting involved and then suddenly you know you're because you're got a conscience and then you got a memory and he reaches over here and plugs it into a memory and way you know how somebody then your family and then he lights up imagination hey that could be you too you know he's all working on your body that's not redeemed yet he has he has all of these powers to to afflict that soul quite naturally then he just runs the same playbook on a different in a different way that when we when we began to say you know because what is he trying to get you to deny in healing that by his stripes I'm healed he's trying to get something in the word to be doubted by you and and I can tell you a much greater word then by his stripes are healed because that's just for your physical body of course divine healing in the soul is a much much greater thing and what does he do when a man comes with a soul that's blackened by the smut of sin he tells that man you can never get free you can never find your way out you're a hopeless case what is he doing bombing the mind and the man is aware and the woman is aware that they really are they in that condition but if God can just get his word down inside there until that man or that woman can look up and say but yet God lives and I'm going to believe his word and it can literally transform that soul it's this exact same thing we talk about the third pole and we talk about the operation of the word and speaking the word we don't know I don't know will I be called to the hospital and one of our dear family members here at Bethel Tabernacle laying in a realm of unconsciousness can't even believe for themselves will I be called upon to lay a hand and speak a word like a prophets when God said when his wife had the tumor and and and he prayed and prayed and prayed and finally the Lord said now say what it'll be and he said I say that before the doctors hand can touch her God's hand will dissolve it Merritt a something friends there's something to be said about the hand of Almighty God I'm preaching to you today on the arm of the Lord what is an arm it extends a hand amen now let's move on so we read now we see how that who has believed our report and a whom is the arm of the Lord revealed watching my time closely expositors have called this chapter in Isaiah literally they call it the Holy of Holies of Isaiah it is also the middle chapter in part 2 of the book now these things aren't accidents God builds his word with meticulous care most of the approximately and there's a roughly about 80 or so references as I can uncover there's roughly 80 references to Isaiah in the New Testament all right and-and-and-and and most of those come from this chapter Isaiah 53 we could have kept reading who hath believed our report in to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant as a root out of dry ground he hath no form or comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should areum he's despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted I love this next one but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed all we all we should be able to all say amen to this all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all you see when the devil comes to battle your mind that this third Pole might be here but you're not living up to the standard to operate it I'm here to tell you you might have iniquity but the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all when God is determined to do something you or I aren't gonna stop him all I can do is just get with the program and start walking in the vision and say whatever happened in failures that was then this is now and I'm going forward hallelujah because God chose me for this our God is the one bringing it to pass this chapter of 53 of Isaiah's in fact the most quoted or if it's not quoted it's at least alluded to throughout the entire New Testament by far Isaiah 53 various parts of it rally says that beyond question this chapter is the heart of the Hebrew prophetic writings now it's interesting because when we read who hath believed our report in to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed you know Isaiah when you begin to to read the whole context prior and after you find that Isaiah marveled at the message of the Lord it was astonishing to Isaiah what God was revealing to him ah that and and and it was basically it was basically this that that God was going to to use Israel to declare to the whole world that they were going to be a declaration they were going to be as lights to the nation this is what God total and that you you see very various times where God meant not just in Isaiah 53 various times where where he he makes that where he makes that assertion let me see if I can find a couple of references that I thought I had yeah I do right here all right just let me get right to it one second right here so he's had said and Isaiah 46 6 i the lord have called the in righteousness and will hold thine hand and keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the gentiles so now say well he's referring to Christ of course that God was going to give Christ as a covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles that the people were going to be light bearers you see that you see the pattern that it's going to be God condescending or distilling into Christ the logos and then Christ promising that someday he would live inside of his family in a way that they would be lights to the whole world now you wouldn't see it in perfect fulfillment until the era of the Holy Ghost in the New Testament but yet at the same time even Israel with the law of Moses they were to live it and their lives were a lived light of the law in other words God took Israel and put them right down in the minced he brushed aside all of the inhabitants moved him away and dropped Israel and all around Israel was nothing but heathen nations who hated him and God said I'm gonna I'm gonna take you as a light and plant you right there now I want to click you on click now start emanating light to the world start showing the world I'm not going to go over here and reveal myself to these people I'm gonna reveal myself to them through you and I'm going to come down and go out of you and you are going to scatter light to the world you follow that here's another place isaiah 43:10 ye are my witnesses saith the lord and my servant whom i have chosen that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he before me there was no God form neither shall there be after me I even I am the lord and beside me there is no Savior so God is calling Isaiah you're gonna be my witness Isaiah when you go down you're going to give this word to my nation and then they're gonna be witnesses so I what I want you to see is this connectivity between here then here then here then here you can see God moving sequentially alright don't want to spend a whole lot of time on that but but but but - Isaiah this was almost unbelievable because Isaiah being a prophet knew the hearts of the people in astonishing to him first of all that even if they were perfect people that the great being who all of heaven is his throne in this earth is his footstool that David looked at and beheld the stars and said you know what is man you're even mindful of him if it blew David's mind it big blue Isaiah's mine you mean this great God has chosen little old us to be his single voice to the whole world that sounds astonishing today when we declare that the bride of Jesus Christ was sent a message to accomplish that exact same thing the world says you're a cult it's natural that then they would say that don't feel bad at them if you were outside looking in you'd have the same conclusion listen friends the only reason you see it is God rich in mercy it doesn't make sense that he would do it this way to the modern thinking but that's exactly how he did it in the Old Testament he's doing that again at the end time and you have he chosen and I say anew they had problems and and a prophet knew we had problems how Allah you think God doesn't know you got issues you think God doesn't know you got problems and weaknesses and failures you think but he did it anyway he's still declared in his word I'm gonna do this and nobody's gonna stop me it's almost unbelievable who hath believed our report and to whom now see watch it's a connection and whom is the arm of the Lord revealed so believing the report then connects you gives you access puts you up with the arm of the Lord see so the ones who believe the report so he's saying I'm giving you you know a part of the report God doesn't give everybody the whole shebang all at once you know he's its pearls to him it's here not you're not even supposed to do that you're supposed to be selectively prayerfully careful who you reveal the mysteries of the kingdom to but you got to be led by God it's it's not yet we I might go preach on the street corner and I'm the shotgunning I'm just blowing I'm just casting see God will find his angels are gather his children if there's any out there but I'm talking about when you're one-on-one you ought to always be in prayer and sometimes you might fish a little bit you might put a little plug out there and just see if you get a nibble if you get a nibble work it a little bit and see if you get a bite get it get a strike or two you know you might have a hot fishing hole there hey man I'm here brother Bradley saying amen brother Jason amen so so we find in that you know if you cast that lure in there you don't get nothing in Cassidy don't get nothing move on don't force nothing you're commanded to not do that because you you throw down pearls and to swine and all they do is trample the precious pearl of God so we have to use wisdom in this hour we're supposed to be led of the Spirit see all right now so you know he's saying I'm gonna give you this part that's all he was giving to Israel that a Messiah's coming they didn't exactly know what it was going to look like say well you know that's a pretty presumptuous statement well when he came to kill him so I think I'm on pretty good ground to not tub to believe that they certainly misunderstood what he's going to be in brother Branham alludes to that says you know they thought it was going to be some great general coming in to free him from Rome they thought brother branham uses you know language descriptive and he's such a storyteller it's beautiful how brother branham can draw you into the story make you feel like you're standing right there and I love looking at the scripture through a prophets eyes and any he says you know Caiaphas thought you know there's gonna be this this great big conveyor come down to the earth and and you know here comes the Messiah and he's gonna cry town and he's gonna walk straight to the temple and he's gonna walk straight up to the high priest and go I'm the Messiah I'm here and he's gonna be glowing and effervescent and and they're gonna and we're all gonna we're gonna set up the kingdom and kick the Romans out and Jerusalem is gonna be reestablished in Israel rule the worldé that's what they thought and and to a certain extent a lot of that was true he was gonna come down and he did but it but instead of coming as a general he came as a baby and instead of coming to the denomination's of the day he came to simple people who would believe him like babies he did the same thing in the upper room he came down to people who were ignorant and unlearned but they observed that they had been with Jesus I don't need this world's intelligence I just want the world to know who I talked to on a daily basis hallelujah and he moved out across the world he's done the same thing in this hour again so he says you know to Israel at this time I'm just going to give you a part of the report and if you can catch it then the arm of the Lord is being revealed to you that's important that's the connection of that first verse in Isaiah 53 I'm going to start giving you some revelation and the revelation is not to increase your theological intelligence the revelation I'm giving you this an important point we'll say it again the revelation is not to be stored as data in your theology hard drive the the revelation was coming so that you and catching it could become an extension of an arm which would be a hand you follow me understand God wants you in on this he could eat he could easily he could have easily chose the trees but he chose you he could have chose the wind brother Ram said in fact if he had weeded them been finished long time ago because the wind will just abate him the wind don't care about political correctness the wind will come in and blow whole cities down and not apologize for it trees don't apologize to anybody they grow wherever they're planted they'll grow right up in the middle of a metropolitan city they don't care they're commanded by God from a seed grow and bring forth and unless man comes as an amateur guarding cut some down that trail does keep right on growing to the end of its lifecycle and so we find that that he's extending his revelation so then what is an arm an arm is what extends a hand and then what is a hand alright so a hand is help from God so therefore the arm of the Lord is the extension of God reaching down to do something in through and for Humanity so who have believed our report well a very few ok who ever believed it they are the arm of the Lord is revealed say to them but not just to them through them amen you're getting it I can see your following right along watch now so the arm of the Lord which is the hand of the Lord extended so when it's the hand then it's the arm extended into human instruments and now you can see this pattern in Isaiah because we know and it talking and I don't have time to get tracked off into the Godhead brother Jason's been doing an awesome job teaching it to us uh revisiting that fantastic subject what do you chase five supports deep at this point and so and I would imagine you got a bunch more to go amen it's a vet I used I remember the days when I thought the Godhead was a simple thing like God's not threes one and it's just one of the most basic simple died and then brother Branham comes along and preaches Christ as the mystery of God revealed and blows everybody's minds and you realize wow the Godhead ain't just a simple little doctrine when you when you listen to God when when you listen to Christ is the mystery of God revealed then then because that's that's Christ as the mystery of God revealed is the is brother Branham answering the what's happened in the opening of the seven seals that that's what it was all about that what was happening and those seals being unfolded was God revealing himself in Christ and then Christ revealing himself in a church that's why I would come and then preach the masterpiece what's the masterpiece a piece off the master oh my and brother Brandon would say to me the flaw critics said on the floor ruined and brother Brent said no the flaw to me to a prophet see not to an art critic but to a prophet the flaws what made it a masterpiece because if it had a flaw if a piece full off if there's a piece over here laying and you pick it up you can you can be sure that there's a master piece somewhere to this piece and so we find out that when you come it fits perfectly and I'm here to tell you God knocked off and and Here I am today I'm a piece of the masterpiece and I'm trying to get my life to fit then the image of where it came from you came from God you're going back to God hallelujah this is the great mystery of the Godhead and and so you find that that there's such a confusion about how that the logos which came out from God and then you know human reasoning says well it's got to be then a separate person because in the beginning was the word and it was with God so it looks like a different person until it turns around and says but it was God you say oh well then it was the eternal son of God in brother Branham said how's the son eternal I have an eternal son that's stupid a son means something born something that started there's no way it can be eternal you can't have a son that never had a beginning that's the very fact that he's the son means he started oh I'm not here to preach on the Godhead but I love that subject but I'm making this point that that it was in that it was not God in his spirit in visible form that no man have seen at any time that created the world it was that being but he didn't do it in that form he he he condescended into a form of the logos and in that form he the word or the Sun he took a designation of Sun because he came out from something God condescending into that and in that form he made all things so when you see that God didn't start producing things until he entered into that sonship then you can see why God needs you in sonship as sons of the Living God to continue the plan this is it's not when we talk about that in the world says all you're a bunch of elitist I'm not an elitist I'm just looking at the pattern and I see that God doesn't change he's the same yesterday there forever and how he started as I worked in the middle and I worked in Christ and I worked in the church and how he's working in me and in fact is that that that you can see the arm of the Lord and in the scripture of text in the context of it the arm is is set aside as something different than God but yet that's again human reasoning would look like that when you read it that way just like just like you can read things like that in the New Testament and Trinitarians jump right on it you know Jesus in the water and a voice is speaking and they look at stuff like that and they deduce they make deductions that are incorrect and when you read isaiah 53 it looks like that this arm oh that's got to be Christ I see he is different but no unarmed I thought my arm isn't different from me my arm is an extension of me and my hand is just an extension of that but in order to in order to move something my hand has to pick it up this is how God anatomically made a man in the image of God see so then so then his hand is extended and and you can see how that that you see it when Jesus comes and you look at people who hear the report he's risen to the degree now here comes Mary and some women they see the sloan rolled away they see an angel sitting on the stone and and why you seek the living among the dead he's risen go tell his disciples you know and and and here married they all go running and here Mary lingering and she comes upon who she thinks to be the gardener it turns out to be Jesus himself and so they go running back with this report and that the disciples you know don't really believe it you can tell they don't really believe it because they're coming to investigate it when you don't believe something you just go investigate it I don't need to investigate what I heard surrounding that the stories of this message because I know that when I hear this message it changes my life and that's all the evidence I need and they go running to investigate you can see they're doubting and then it's further shown that they're doubting because Cleopas and a bunch of his mates yeah in his head day his head for home yeah we ran and found an empty tomb and Peter was you know so big and you know and and and John Rena ran ahead of him outran because young kid and John got to the door he's a little afraid to go in Peter has busted right in walked right down inside looked in it was all gone he was empty he was gone they knew they didn't take him you take him nine and take me buddy take him no we don't know who took him well those those those crazy women said an angel said he's risen oh you know what Peter's response was to that I'm going fishing I'm going to I'm going back to work I don't know I'm so confused we had thought it would be he that would be Messiah I followed him for three years and now he's gone and now he's risen and we don't know and we didn't get him we haven't seen him and and this is so confusing we're just gonna go back to what we know didn't do him any good they couldn't catch a thing the road to emmaus they're walking around sad until Jesus rebukes them you notice who the ones who were in action the women you know why they believed it and the news they hadn't seen him that Mary stayed back those other women took off running when they got there they hadn't seen him but they believed the report and they were now the arm of the Lord to the disciples he's risen you understand they've literally become the hand to the arm you get me but because that the disciples didn't believe it they're not running around telling the world they're not a hand of God they're not the hand of God they're not an extension of the arm of the Lord because they didn't believe the report all they can do is go live there are simple ridiculous human lives while the greatest event to ever strike the earth is happening an unfolding over a period of 30 to 40 days things are going to unfold the world had never seen the lights out see Jesus when he raises up out of the tomb I mean if you if you track that back into the Old Testament and you see that when the high priest went in the high priest spent a lot of time getting himself ready he had to wash himself he had to have his garments perfect he had to have everything exactly he had to rehearse he had to practice he couldn't miss step anything could mean his life and in fact is it was so serious they put bells and pomegranates on the bottom of his skirt so that when he walked he jingled so they could hear him moving but just as a fail-safe they tied a rope to his foot head in a case he went in there and dropped over they didn't hear the jingling anymore they dragged him out oh well we got a new high priest so when the high priest finally spent all that time getting himself ready and all dressed then he went in now he wasn't first he wasn't going in for the sins of the people it Abel's no he wasn't going in for them at all he's going in first for himself first he's got to be accepted and then when he goes in and makes the offering then he comes back out and presents himself and the people start rejoicing hallelujah we got a high priest that's been accepted now he can go offer for our sins so you see people say people misunderstand Calvary they see Jesus coming out and they say oh when he when he rose out of the tomb then that was salvation for the whole world know it wasn't that's not true Jesus only proved that he was accepted by God brother Branham shows us that and in the Rising Sun he says you know what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is said he rose from the tomb many men had died no one had ever able to bring himself back and brother him said it's a glorious resurrection but he says what good does that do me brother Graham said it great for him he rose but how do I become a beneficiary and in Jesus even says now don't touch me I've got to a sinned I've got to go back into the presence of God I've got to offer my blood and when I when that's mad I'll lay the body on the altar I'll take the life in the blood and bring it back down into the church and on the day of Pentecost one of em says what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost you believe God and you repent of your sins and then he says he gives you on the Holy Ghost as a seal proving that he has accepted your faith and he comes down and falls on 120 and now redemptions claims have been met and God has a body in the earth and now misses Jesus Christ in a multiplied form is beginning to move around that's what we've returned to today that's what the seals were open for was to stand a bride back on the earth again with the full abstract title that God intended for his church to be the hand of the arm of God by believing the report brother Branham says it like this so he's talking about in serpent seed says now when Jesus I'll get a hurry when Jesus rose on the third day he did not have the keys to the kingdom of heaven did you know that he says he says I got the keys to death in hell but not to the kingdom because they had been given to Peter and now Peter whatsoever you loose on earth I'll loose it in heaven what you bind on earth I'll bind it in heaven so God in Christ as we've said his brother branham taught us God and Christ did not create the earth for himself to rule God created the earth God rules the universe he created the earth as a headquarters for his family to rule and and and that you can see why in time past in ancient time where the sons of God morning stars sang together and sons of God shouted for joy seeing the whole plan of redemption seeing how it was going to be accomplished by the Lamb of God that's why the book of Revelation says he was the Lamb of God slain before the foundation of the world when is the foundation of the world when morning stars sang together sons of God shouted for joy because friends it wouldn't just be that they were seeing the Lambs portion they were seeing their portion they were seeing an age when they would go down and they would be an extension they would be the hand to the arm to the being hallelujah that listen God watch what God says that in Psalms he says he created the world and the stars in the heavens with his fingers but you'll notice that in Exodus I think Exodus stuff 15 God shows that he reminds the children of Israel I thought I had a note for that somewhere in case I missed quoting that ah but I'm pretty sure it said Exodus 15 where we find that he's say it I'm sorry Exodus 13 there it is thirteen three he reminds the children of Israel now how were the children of Israel delivered by Moses God said brother branham picks this up in the fourth seal in various places and he says God says I have come down I have heard the cries of my people I have come down I have remembered my promise he promised Abraham he made that promise to Abraham your children will sojourn in a land for four hundred years and I will bring them out by a mighty hand don't worry Abraham go to sleep go sleep with your fathers don't worry about your family your there gonna be more than the stars of the heaven don't worry Abraham doesn't matter I've got this Abraham and Abraham could rest in that and then sure enough four hundred years they sojourn in a strange land they were oppressed and God comes down to Moses and says now I remember the promise I made and now the time is up it's been 400 years it's time for me to do it though Paul shows us it actually hit 430 years so you see there's something to be said like in brother branham's quote when they were about ready when they were getting ready so you know what we've been doing here all these decades since the Prophet went home been getting ready you've been getting ready I'm here to tell you say brother Jason what's coming tomorrow I don't know but you've been prepared for it I'm here to tell you something friends you've been trained for this hour you've received the word and I don't know how it's going to be used but I know it's being used and it's going to be further used that's why I said to you that we don't know we don't even know what we don't know so let me know him who knows everything because this is God's water and God says and brother Brent picks up the fourth seal says now I remember the promise I've heard the cry I've come down but I'm sending you Moses and God says to them in Exodus 13 you were delivered and he didn't call it Moses he didn't even call it a man he didn't call it a prophet he said you've been delivered by the hand of God and the hand of God was a prophet named Moses he was the human extension he was the revealed reality of the arm of the Lord and that's why when Moses said they won't believe me he gave him signs so they would have to believe because God wasn't intending just to have Moses as a servant he wanted all of Israel to be his extension to the world this is the hour that we have arrived at I here I would say here today who has believed her report who among you brother have believed the report that God has sent forth a message in this hour why did he do it to fill up your theology data no sir to make you a hand that extends an arm that comes from God and ronon what's down in humanity see so he says his family so so he says he didn't have the keys because he he put the keys in his church so his family think of the plan now that his God's plan is to have his family descend into a fallen earth you think about that you believe you come from God see question has never been where am I going questions always been where I come from so I'm going is retroactive it's automatic I will return back to where I came from so coming from God when morning stars sang together and sons of God shouted for joy whatever reality I'm not here to preach on whatever reality that was I know that we we brother Branham said before there was start us you existed in the mind of God so well I was just a figment of his thought no you were way more than a thought you were a gene you were an attribute you were literally a DNA extension of Almighty God and that's why you respond to the word because you are always intended to be the hand of the arm hallelujah why do I respond because I'm a hand to the arm hallelujah I can promise you if this Rainn says pick that up the arms gonna reach in the hands gonna grab and that's that's the that's the synchronous way that God is trying to operate through his church here he was going to send you knowing what he was doing he was going to send you into a fallen world and in the era of the Holy Ghost when he fulfilled his promise to not just be above not just be with but to be in and live through and multiply through the body what is the body of believers the vehicle to multiply God's family you take this word to somebody you bring them to life listen you realize you have their power to raise the dead what good would it do you to go to the graveyard and raise the dead they'd die again but if you can raise their dead soul to life if God can use you and you can raise the soul to life that life will never perish it can never die and you become an extension of Almighty God because you believe the report God kept left the keys it stands to reason to me God knew that he would be dropping you and me down in the worst age of all ages the complete conglomeration of all the the white horse all of his deception all of the violence of the read all of the darkness and suppression and oppression of the black and bring it to a pale but he would accumulate the lion and the ox and the man and a flying eagle and he'd give you the keys because if you're gonna operate if you come from heaven and you're gonna operate in a fallen world you're gonna need the keys to the heavenly power you're gonna need keys to operate the kingdom in a dark world well that's not going to believe you and if they don't believe you they're lost and so to get them to believe you as they were as they needed to believe Moses he has given you power and he says I've given you power all the power of the devil oh we ought to rejoice today friends because we have become the extension of the word in this hour I'm so glad I know you said I don't feel worthy I don't feel worthy none of us have ever felt worthy this is not you doing it this is God doing it he gets the glory to God we live let us say Lord whatever you can do with this rusty old life whatever you can do get whatever usage I'm willing to dedicate myself I'm willing if I fall I'll repent if I need to pray I'll pray I'll read my Bible I'll fellowship I'll come to church I'll hear the tape I'll do whatever so that I can be usable so that I can be ready because I'm not here to accumulate a wealth of data the data secured unchallengeable I've been preaching it too long I didn't been to too many continents preaching it I'm here to tell you the data in this message is unassailable in the Bible but it's not about the data there's lots of the data I don't understand but I know who is the one I know that's who my life is plugged into and maybe just maybe there's data in this Bible that's never going to be understood theologically maybe it can only be understood physically maybe when people who can't understand the written word see it in you they go oh say that's pretty far-fetched that's how God's going to judge them God is going to righteously justifiably condemn the world many of which most of which probably never read this book so God put this book in human skin and now this book walks around in flesh to whom who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord extended you want to extend it to your families what extended to the community you want to extend it you want to be the hand of God oh let's stand to our feet friends I dare not go any further I'd need much more time and we're out oh that's what I want to be brother can come and let's sing a song or two come sister dad brother Chris are you playing yet Josh are you still okay you're still in practice mode okay great but josh is joining the team of the musicians and so we're gonna have some wind instruments here some reed instrument working up here a man we need to get sister Julia back get our flute back and I sent a text here the other day the sister charity say hey we need a violin going so well I play a violin on a violin watch same thing same thing just a fancier word and a little different sound but Amen I I want to see people a man using what God you owe it to God if he's gave you that talent and and you owe it to give it to the Lord amen you know brother Kenny had these requests I think he read them all often your brother Ken and we just want to pray again earnestly for them there's other needs that have come in various people that have been struck down by this affliction and we're praying for them you know even the ones that I'm aware of seem to be all on here no I think I did see one other that might not be here I'd have to hunt it but anyway that's not so important but I want to be an extension I want to be used of God friends that's to me that's the advantage that I want to take of this time that we have we're not assembling that's that is so vital Paul was so specific in the 10th chapter of Hebrews there is such a necessary element in fellowship and and you know depending on how this goes long term we we may have to evolve the way we're doing things but we're gonna keep going on the short term here as I said through the first four weeks so we're approaching the middle of that by next Wednesday I think we'll be at the past the middle and headed into the second half of it our four week time period for a short term plan then we'll move to a longer term plan if necessary but my I was looking at a picture the other day and I don't know I guess somebody shot from our Facebook stream I think Moe might have taken it and posted it somewhere I think I don't know where I found it but I was standing in a pulpit preaching and and this place was full and people had their hands up and my heart is 100 oh I didn't know you don't know what you got till you don't caught it friends how about we just pray for these needs and say Lord even so come quickly Lord Jesus and if we've got to be here some more time lord give us a way to get back to come back together I believe that it's going to be a wonderful thing people are going to be eager to get back in church I bet we won't have one empty empty seat amen I bet even people who rarely come will come when we finally get to come back amen before we pray let's sing brother Kenny oh yes for my transgression oh my he was bruised [Music] Burtie surely surely he bore our sorrows oh yes and by his stripes we are he he was wounded sing it oh he was wounded for my transgression Oh hallelujah he was bruised for my knee [Applause] surely surely well surely he bore our sorrow and by His stripes we are healed let's raise our hands and sing it now all over those in your homes now raise up your hands for my transgression oh he was bruised for my what thank you Lord thank you Jesus Oh surely he bore our sorrows Oh and by His stripes we as they play that for me softly let's pray father we thank you for that day on Calvary he was wounded for my transgressions bruised for my iniquities surely he bore my sorrows and by His stripes we are healed Lord you having done all of that would we not avail ourselves of every of every blessing that it brings would we allow our lives to come short of realizing every benefit when you were wounded for our transgressions when you were bruised for my iniquities would I let anything hold me back from fully maximizing as a beneficiary of that day on Calvary he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquities surely he's born all my sorrows why would I bear him if he's already born by His stripes I'm already healed lord help us today to have a real living faith we have believed the report we are now we have we have we have received the arm of the Lord and we found out to our to our amazement that you always were intending it to be connecting to a hand and when it was the hand it was immortal Moses was a mortal man with all kinds of ups and downs and iniquitous things in his life but yet you were going to use him you had four ordained it before the foundation of the world even botched it he even first tried to go forward in his own strength ruin the whole thing but when you took control of it Lord Father I remember when Moses felt so overwhelmed he was dr. Moses brother branham said all the cases come to him all the troubles come to him all the sickness he had a doctor's bag and He healed the people and counseled the people and decided court cases and it just broke him down and wearied him and his father-in-law takes him aside said now son-in-law listen listen to your father-in-law here I got a lot of years of wisdom what should i do Jethro all right here's what you do you get yourself seventy princes you set them out over people you segment at all you group it all together and and you you you you distribute your authority and delegate it to these men and let them take this load off you Lord Moses goes forward and the whole thing falls flat Kukui just nothing but a bunch of nonsense and chaos and Moses comes crying to you Lord what must I do and the Lord says the right Moses here's what you do get yourself seventy princes delegate your authority and set him over these matters and when you said it and he did it it worked perfect we're not here Lord for the wisdom of man I'm not here to figure out the calamities of the world I don't need to know all I need to know is to be led by eternal life I want to believe the report I want to look upon we don't know what it's what it all entails we don't know father but we know you and that's all I need to know I want to know him who knows everything and I want to know him in the Fellowship of his suffering I want to be made conformable unto his death Lord that I might live and reign with him grant it to us in this time Lord that we will we will avail ourselves of everything that day on Calvary provided everything that when you poured out your spirit into the upper room Lord you didn't you didn't even have a church until the Holy Ghost it was the Holy Ghost that birthed the church so Master there there's not a man that's alive outside of the Holy Ghost he's just walking around in an imagery of life but he's actually dead in sin dead in trespasses and sin dead while he lives you don't even start really living til the inner man has been brought to life so help us Lord to be an extension of the arm help us Lord God to realize what our mission is here in the world I want to be effective at it Jesus whether it's healing the sick raising the dead converting the lost calling for the Holy Ghost Lord whether it's it's scriptural understanding whether it's healing of homes marriages young people whatever it is if it's going into the hospital laying hands on the sick to recover whatever it is if it's the spoken word and we find a need for it and you anoint it and we must speak creative power so be it Lord we want to be ready I want to be ready for that Lord I want to have my life ready for that moment may you grant it father we commit ourselves in this day into your hands Lord all of the sick that were request and read and sorrow and lives have already been lost and we're praying for families praying for sister Elizabeth and her family and she has cousins who are sick and a mother who's already and and her her auntie has already passed away Laura I mean her first cousin Lord and then her sons are now sick and father our sister worried about her
