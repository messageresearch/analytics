========================================

We're going to turn to Hebrews chapter 12 and we'll read verse 14 and 15. Follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord. Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled. May the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word. You can be seated. So, as we were speaking before, just to replant that seed in your mind, is that we're looking at the life of Christ not so much as just a generic term that we want the life of Christ manifested in our life. But we want to look and see what how is the life of Christ actually manifested. You know, we speak about the love of God. We want to talk about that. We speak about holiness which we spoke about last time uh and we'll speak about some this time as well but we want to go go through this and look at it and hopefully we'll challenge ourselves a little bit by it to draw nearer to the Lord and that he'll help us be able to deal with maybe some things that are are blocking or hindering us in our growth in Christ. And so as we finished last time, we were talking about much about bitterness. And so if you think about bitterness, it's spoken of as a root of bitterness. Can never have a root without first having a seed. So a root really is a secondary issue. So the first issue is the seed that's been planted. Amen. So there's a seed that's planted and whatever that is, whatever that seed is, it grows then it produces a bitter root and then that bitter root will ultimately grow and produce a bitter fruit. Right? So if the root is secondary to the seed, we understand that actually we need to prevent the seeds from being planted or if the seeds get planted, we have to deal with it right away. If you don't deal with the seed that's been planted, it will produce a root. And so think thinking about that, you know what what could be some of the seeds that are planted? You think about that. um uh by no means an exhaustive list but you know it could be something where someone you feel you feel someone treated you unfairly or you could say somebody treated me wrong or spoke to me wrong or or snubbed me or whatever it might be someone spoke badly of me or someone spoke behind my back about me the list goes on you can get the idea something something happens whether true who are not misinterpreted and so a misinterpreted snub or someone speaking against you in some way and what ends up happening is that seed gets planted down in our heart. And so there's two choices to do. You can just let it sit there, right? And if you let it sit there, what will it do? secondary things will happen. Amen. The root of bit you'll start begin to feel bitter towards that person. Amen. Or towards the situation or towards a group of people. And so if you if you refuse to communicate, if you refuse to if you stuff it and say, "I'll just deal with it. I'll just deal with it." But actually you're not dealing with it. Then what ends up happening is a root begins to grow. And the root of course is the foundation of bad fruit. And bad fruit of course speaks of the type of life that you're living what what you're manifesting outwardly. And the fact is as Christians we can allow roots of bitterness. And if you haven't here allowed a root of bitterness to grow in your life, you are a perfect one. And I want to be your best friend. But the rest of us who are imperfect have allowed seeds to be planted. And we we've just we've allowed, you know, for a seed to grow, it needs to be in the right kind of ground with it needs to be fertilized. It needs to be watered. So what what do we do? We begin to meditate on that. We begin to think on this person did this. They meant this. They they said this. I'm always treated this way. People always say this, I'm always this. And this this is watering and fertilizing the seed that's been planted. And when you do that, every time it produces a root, then a chute, then a fruit. I didn't mean to be a poet, but that's what it that's what that's what it ultimately does. And so you can judge what kind of seed is there, what kind of root is there by looking at the fruit that it produces. And so if it produces um isolation, uh anger, outbursts of anger, um depression, and the list goes on. Um those things are are uh results of a seed not actually being dealt with. A problem in your life or something someone said or some something someone didn't say or what some something that someone did. When we don't deal with that that's and that ends up producing the wrong kind of fruit. And so there's not a person I think on the earth that doesn't deal with this kind of thing. It's normal. And as life goes on and as you get older, you deal with it more and more. And the problem is is that you see you'll see older people and they're isolated and all they can do is complain and be angry. That's the result of a process that began in their youth and wound up here. And so it's a great warning to all of us is that actually we need to deal with the things that we come across. And number one, we got to surrender these things to the Lord. Number two is we got to pray over it. And number three is we got to take the action that the Lord prescribes to us to prescribes to us both in the word but also as he deals with our heart of how we're supposed to to handle it. And it's a it's a very tricky thing because these things can build up to the point where we are so damaging ourselves, so injuring ourselves in this process. And as the Bible says, not only does the bit root of bitterness spring up and trouble you, but then the next part is says thereby many be defiled. And so there's a defilement that takes place of those around you because they're going to have to taste of the bitter fruit that your life is producing. And so that has a negative impact on everyone around you. And so it's very important when we understand holiness. A person can be holy and think that they're think that they're so holy and they're treasuring up so many hurts and so many pains and so many frustrations that actually they're just isolating themselves into what they refer to as holiness. But it's only a man-made holiness. It's only a human set aartedness because you have created that isolation of yourself into your very own little world. Amen. And so that defiles you, that defiles your family, that defiles the people all around you. And so true, true and genuine holiness is not darkness surrounding you and kept away from everything, but it's actually the light which is God himself shining down upon you and reflecting himself through you. And part of that shining upon you is he he comes into those dark places in your heart where there's evil and he shines the light there so that you deal with the issues and the problems that you have in your own life. Running from them is only going to fertilize the seed. And so it's not a matter of running from them. You have to you have to be able to deal with them and then commit it to the Lord because then the temptation is to pick it up and pick it up and pick it up and pick it up. People don't understand me, people this, people that. And again, you're meditating on that. When you're you're you're you're meditating on a thought. As a man thinks in his heart, so is he. So you're meditating bitter thoughts and you produce a bitter life. And so it's so critical to fight the battle. If you don't if you don't actually fight the battle, you'll end up in a situation where that bitterness that you thought you dealt with keeps coming and keeps coming. You have to hand it to the Lord. Leave it to the Lord. Let let him deal with it. I mean, I think that's I think that's so key. How can a person go through this life with all the difficulties, all the trials, all the things that people say, all the misunderstandings that they have without Christ? I I I just some people have a disposition and stuff just rolls off of them. But other pe most people aren't like that. Most people are in a situation my we need we really we need Christ to deal with our hearts so that we're our hearts don't become hardened. Amen. So we don't have that place where this bitter root is on the inside of us. We're focusing on it, meditating on it. And again, out of that root of bitterness is where defilement comes. Out of that root of bitterness is where trouble comes. Hebrews 12:16. Again, context matters. We're talking about a root of bitterness. We're talking about first a call to holiness and then a root of bitterness coming and hindering that call unto peace and holiness. Right? So then he goes into okay when when that happens, what will the results be? Lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright. Again, we go back right to what we were speaking about last time between David and Saul. Outwardly speaking, you have Jacob and Esau. We would all choose Esau. But God's value and vision was different. Esau, we we say, "My goodness, Esau was a terrible guy." I mean ultimately sure he was but why was he evil is because he disregarded what God valued. Amen. Jacob was as rotten as can be. But yet he regarded with high value what God regarded with high value. And God's grace covered a multitude of sins in Jacob. And so this is the problem that we have is you you might have all kinds of of sin in your life, problems in your life, but the reality is if you can simply take God at his word and walk in it, love covers a multitude of sins. The problem comes in is where we let this root of bitterness come in. What is ultimately what is this root of bitterness? Is it has actually become it's actually like distrust distrust to the point where you just remove yourself. Yeah. And ultimately what is the root of bitterness doing? Fine. It might cause you to distrust the people around you. That's a part that's part of life that happens. But ultimately the problem ends up being is instead of pointing this way to the people you don't trust, you end up pointing this way to the person you don't trust anymore. And and many times you see people, they go through a bad church experience. they've been hurt and damaged in a church and instead of going like I'm just going to deal with this and I know it's on this level it immediately turns into God you would have total control over every single person here to prevent them from giving me making my life miserable so God actually it's your fault and so this is the problem and ultimately this is part of the issue with Esau is Esau went through a trial and instead of trusting God, he he took matters into his own hands and he tried to solve the problem without faith in God. And that is ultimately what a root of bitterness is going to lead to is you're going to try to solve everything with human thinking with human ways with human appeals and what ends up when what and and you'll actually go continue to go along thinking that you're walking with and pleasing God. And we all can get in this situation. And it doesn't mean you're lost. Doesn't mean you're in Esau. We all can go down a bad road like this. Amen. Amen. And so it's so important for us to realize that many times we choose our own undoing. Oh yes. Amen. Instead of actually dealing with with our problems, facing them, we choose our own undoing and we walk down the path of undoing instead of the path of healing, of strength, and of deliverance. Verse 17, for you know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected. For he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears, he already undid everything. He already called the birthright useless and worthless. So God simply gave him exactly what he felt about it and transferred it to someone who felt it was of course we understand that was because of God's plan of election. Amen. But yet it worked out in the lives of men. Interesting to look at this scripture because you have a similar one back in Deuteronomy chapter 29. Verse 18- 20. I find this very very fascinating. Says, "Lest there should be among you man or woman or family or tribe whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord your God." Lord our God to go and serve the gods of these nations, lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood. And it come to pass when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart to add drunkenness to thirst. The Lord will not spare him. But then the anger of the Lord and his jealous jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book book shall lie upon him, and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven. So notice how the root this root of bitterness that's spoken of is actually founded out is its foundation is in the self assured attitude and in fact the false revelation of what eternal security is. If you think about that he's saying I'll have peace even though I've chosen my own way instead of God's way. I've ch has chosen my own path. I'm walking in the imagination of my heart. Yet because I'm a part of the covenant. Yet because I go to a message church. Come on. Yes. Yet because I have an anointed pastor, everything will be fine. Even though I choose to walk in the imagination of my own heart, that is actually amazingly a false understanding of how eternal security works out. Amen. Right. Because if if you actually are a possessor of the if you're sealed with the spirit of promise, you will not it will it will work within you and cause you to not walk in the imagination of your own heart. God will work things out. If you've allowed that bitterness, the seed to be planted and the root to form, God is going to deal with it. Amen. Right. Amen. Either we can deal with it, that's the easy way. Or we can leave it there and God will eventually deal with that. And boy will it hurt and boy will it be painful and boy will it bring a lot of changes that you never want expected or thought would happen in your life. And so this attitude of I'm under God's covenant. I'm a part of this. I'm a part of that. I've fulfilled all the outward signs of obedient, religious obedience, but actually I've I'm committing adultery and wickedness. I'm committing adultery against him. I'm I'm actually I'm h holding things in my life that are have become idols. Amen. Things that I'm actually committing idolatry. Idolatry isn't just bowing down to a little statue. Idolatry also isn't merely worshiping a trinity of gods. That's that's not the root cause of idolatry. It's putting something in your heart before Christ. Amen. And we take those those hurts and those pains and those things that we talked about earlier and we actually begin to treasure them more than Christ. It becomes an idol. hurts and pains of the past become an idol. Amen. Pastors can become an idol. Churches can become an idol. Nothing is supposed to stand before Christ in our hearts and in our lives and in our homes. And what it ends up doing when we when we begin to make idols out of things, you'll you'll see that this is the fruit of bitterness. It's idolatry. Amen. So when we when we really look at the root of bitterness, we really have it's it's very necessary for us to understand the fear of the Lord, right? The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. So you can actually never have spiritual wisdom which comes by revelation unless it starts with a proper understanding of the fear of the Lord. If everything is just flippant and easy and we make a joke out of things so easily, we don't have the fear of the Lord. And so we need to come back to that foundation of having the fear of the Lord in our lives. That's that is a huge issue when it comes to understanding what eternal security is. Because without with the outward teaching of eternal security, the human soul, the human heart being so deceitful will assure himself based on a few different outward signs that he's done. I take communion. I've been baptized. I go to this church. Yeah, I know I don't really live a very good life, but I've done all that I can do. the the fear of the Lord is on its face before him saying,"Lord, there's something in me that's not right. Take it out of me." That's eternal security manifested. And so again, bitter fruit, that's the result of the wrong kind of seed being planted. Amen. To go even further, we talked about the the fruit is what people will that that's what's produced by the seed. So a bitter seed produces a bitter root produces a bitter fruit. Another way of speaking about that the fruit is the atmosphere that you create around yourself. the kind of atmosphere. If it's an atmosphere of love or if it's an atmosphere that's repelling people, you could see if you have an atmosphere that you're repelling people from you, there's something wrong. And you should seek you should seek the Lord to find what what have I what have I done? What thought what bitterness, what root have I allowed to grow inside of me that would produce this this kind of atmosphere that's repelling people away from me? Because the atmosphere of Christ is is love. You know, it's possible for us to really actually outwardly confess Christ. This is this is actually message 101. When you think about it, it's we can outwardly confess Christ but then have the produce the kind of life that ultimately defi defiles others because what kind of example is your life producing? Is it producing a life that makes other people around you want to get closer to Christ? Is it producing the kind of life that makes other people thirsty for more of Christ? or is it producing the kind of life that is an atmosphere that's taking people actually taking people away from Christ? That's very that's important for us to understand and to examine and to look at because again it'll trouble you. Yeah, that's bad enough, but then it'll defile many as the scripture said. So ask yourself, this goes both ways. Do you cause your friends to draw nearer to God? Or are you producing the wrong kind of atmosphere and then defiling and deforming them and conforming them to the world? It's one thing to say, you know, don't be conformed to the world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. But what about you? What about the atmosphere that you're producing? What what about the life that you're living? Is it causing other to to be conformed to the world or to be transformed by the renewing of their of of their mind? You God wants to use you and I to change others. Amen. To transform others. That's actually how that's how he does it. We're not to be a neutral uh impact have a neutral impact on the world. We're have to have a positive impact. We're to be a transforming impact to we're supposed to both challenge people to come up higher. Not by being angry and mean, but by li living and speaking of the Lord Jesus in such a way that it helps others. First their desire would grow for Christ and second their their they would desire to take the steps to grow into Christ. The second part of that I would say is ask yourself do your friends cause you to draw nearer to God or are they producing the wrong kind of atmosphere and thereby defiling or deforming the life of Christ in you. So that goes both ways. are you and are they? If they're not, then you need to learn to have good boundaries. This is a very difficult thing for people to have because they think one of the fruits of the spirit is being nice. And this ties closely into what we we're going to talk about in the future about the four different kinds of love. But being nice is not one of the fruits of the spirit. Neither is it one of the descriptors of love. Um, you need to have good healthy boundaries in your life. And if you if you don't, what actually ends up happening is you don't protect the things that are valuable. You don't protect the things that are good. And this is especially hard for young people. They they don't want to be in a position where the crowd says, "Oh, they're not going along with the crowd. They're weird." Amen. And so that that takes us into to fundamental things that are not directly connected to this subject. But as parents, we should be raising our kids to be first attached to us as parents, not to the peer group. If we raise them in such a way that they're attached to the peer group, they will always devolve to the level of the peer group. They will not s stand apart because they'll be looking for what they need the affirmation that they need in their heart from their peer group and their peer group affirming comparing themselves with with themselves are not wise. And not only that is it will leave them eternally looking for uh uh for affirmation that they actually can't find and that only is actually meant to be find found in Christ through the parents. And so when they're so oriented towards their peers, it's just it's going to wreak havoc because they don't understand boundaries. Because as soon as a kid has boundaries in pure oriented kids, what ends up happening is they're weird. Amen. They're weird. Why don't they Why don't they march to the beat of the drum that we're playing? And they're going, I don't need that. Mom and dad love me. Mom and dad affirm me. Amen. They strengthen me. They they spend time with me. in instead in especially in America we raise them to be oriented with their peers and that always produces kids with no boundaries kids that are bitter towards their parents and and if if there's a love connection between the heart of kids and and their parents and their parents are really connecting with them. What ends up happening is the other kids could say what they want about him. they're getting strengthened by the relationship that's supposed to strengthen them. And so very critical in raising our children is to you to have good boundaries as an example. And again, what is boundaries? It's not just saying no to everybody. It's not being mean to people. It's saying there's something valuable. There's a family. There's Christ. There's the reality of the word in this day. And you can't cross that boundary.
