central classes because I'm going to go into some areas that I've had a lot of requests for and I'm looking forward to it I'm also going to do it on an occasional Wednesday night through now from now through June but I have to limit myself to about 30 minutes and I'm under strict doctor's orders not to exert myself so it's not preaching it's teaching and I was getting a little laughed at this morning that I've kind of moved into that and we determined that my problem is the Holy Ghost amen so that's a good problem to have amen I told him I said I was trying to you know you know bring it back and and um I'm not gonna I'm not gonna call any names but her initials are sister Ruth said that she said well you can't you can't limit you can't pull the Holy Ghost down you can't I said well then my problem is the Holy Ghost amen so we determined that was a good problem to have amen I appreciated that so um I went early this morning um the doctor actually wanted to meet me on a Sunday morning she came in to look at my eye again and she said it's doing good and it has it's making progress there's still some pressure in the back of the eye pushing and so she added now a a fourth medication of eye drops to put in my eye to try to reduce that so I'm on multiple antivirals steroids and now this fourth one and um so I covet your prayers I apologize for the sun shades but I I'm not supposed to let a whole lot of light into my eye I'm not supposed to be in the Sun and even these lights here in my screen trying to look at a screen is very difficult so this helps and actually

Lord I feel his presence Hallelujah I guess you can't tell what I'm going to be speaking on this morning surrounded that's just it we know brother Brown read this scripture for the background to a rapture Lord I won't mind it before we're done with this service this morning that the Rapture take place the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes come up on me to eat my flesh they stumble and fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war shall rise against me in this will I be confident one thing I have desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to acquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion and the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me Hallelujah and he shall set me upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy yea I will sing praises unto the Lord Hallelujah you can have your seats Hallelujah I always wanted to say this we could leave right now and say it's been good to be in the house of the Lord Hallelujah surrounded how many surrounded you're surrounded by something I don't know brother Jason asked me on Friday to speak this this Sunday and actually told him before that Sunday month Friday morning that are even in in prayer and the Lord spoke to him and said I'd be preaching this Sunday I was like yeah yeah whatever did I get the text from him and then it started going through my mind Lord what should I what do you want me to say and I always have brother Jason we always have sermons that automatically pops in your head and so some started popping like oh yeah that'd be a good one just a couple weeks ago I started putting down a couple of scriptures and his thoughts surrounding him coming to my mind and I just kind of put it on the back burner started studying other things but yesterday this never happens hardly ever but yesterday while I was studying the presence of the Lord just come into my office you know it will ever so often when you're studying stuff you'll feel something and you'll get that auction and you'll start but yesterday the presence of the Lord dropped into the office and I would go ahead and say it was around all day long even I had to go run a couple of errands with the wife and go on the Bluffton no matter what place I went still felt that presence around me I was like Lord what's going on here Lord okay can we still feel that same presence here this morning that presence is in the building I feel it I woke up this morning with the same thing you know the Devil Comes against me yeah the devil does he likes to come against you he'll say listen whatever you're done in your message that there's a mess it ain't gonna make any sense to the people but then you wake up this morning brother Luther a whole fresh day a fresh anointing come upon this oh brother we know the presence of God Is Right Here Among Us right now this presence is so strong if you're lost you should not leave this presence until you're saved you're he if you're sick you should lead this bill and not healed oh the Holy Ghost is here that presence is standing right here oh I feel it right now all surrounded you gotta know you're in a presence greater than a man we're in a presence greater than any human being you know I usually have Sarah try to sing a song to go with what I was what I preach yesterday I hadn't told her nothing and while I was driving out and she she says what do you want me to sing and I'm like I don't know I I don't have nothing so she she what she know he does she gets in the car and starts playing songs of the radio and the song come on and she she says what's this the song come on the Lord is my shepherd he goes before me Defender behind me Who Shall I Fear [Music] I'm filled with the anointing I said you're seeing that thank you sister Amber who all was up here oh Hallelujah surrounded means to be enclosed on all sides to envelop is to cut off communication nothing's getting in and nothing's getting out oh bro if you had the Holy Ghost this morning you're so surrounded that the devil can't get in oh the devil may think he's got you surrounded but he don't know you've already been surrounded by God he can't get past that defense Hallelujah when it looks like I've surrounded I'm surrounded by you Hallelujah oh that Devil's on the outside looking in I say if you haven't been surrounded by That Glory don't lead this building until you are Holy Ghost Fire that's what we're surrounded by hallelujah it's protective custody Psalms 32 7 Thou Art my Hiding Place which is a covering a shelter a hiding place a secret place protection Thou shalt preserve me to guard or watch over to guard from danger to keep secret to be kept close blockaded thou are my Hiding Place Thou shalt preserve me from trouble Thou shalt Compass surround me about with songs of Deliverance Hallelujah songs of Deliverance Hallelujah we are in protective custody my protective custody is when somebody sees a crime or they see substance fixing to take place they know what's happening they'll go to the police and they'll say Hey listen this is going to take place and the people know they got towed on so they're going to try to go kill them and so what the police do they put them in police protection they put them in cast police custody they had changed their identity they changed their Dwelling Place Hallelujah they no longer live in this house that they live in they're in a different house laughs you're under Cassidy of God hallelujah we're in protective custody we're so covered up that the devil can't find us [Music] I'm feeling good oh we know too much on the devil we know all these tricks all these tactics everything he tries to throw against us we know so he's out to try to kill you he's I can't let you live with Chris he's I gotta get you he can't find us we're being protected by the blood of Jesus Christ oh Holly we're surrounded we're protected on all sides oh it's like Aaron when he entered into behind the veil when you come in behind the veil through the doors and we enter the sanctuary we enter the presence of God's glory his glory is surrounding us oh hallelujah we're at Shekinah Glory what happens in the Shekinah Glory fire is down falling down behind the veil let's close off the veil from the world and watch the Fire Fall Among Us oh it's a dark day we're living in the pressure of this darkness is so pressing down upon us sometimes we feel like we can even lose our minds I'm so glad it says in the evening time there shall be light that's our hope we're surrounded by light we're like we're like the children of Israel down in Goshen surrounded it was dark in Egypt but they had the light oh it seems that the enemy is surrounding you and coming in for the kill God will send reinforcements what happened to Samson he went into the into Gaza this shows the mercy of God to Samson we know what he was in Gaza for the city the people in heaven says Samson is here lock the gates don't let him out they had him surrounded so they thought this Tooty little man walks to the gates and picks up the gates and carries them to the top of the mountain one day he was surrounded by a thousand Philistines the anointing of God hit him he had a Nazarite vow what happened to those Philistines every one of them were dead if you're surrounded by Devils today it don't matter what it is take up your Jawbone pick up what you got and start slaying a devil you have power in you let's don't be like Balaam do you remember the story he gets on his donkey he says I'm going God says no you're not easy I am the donkey had more sense than the human being had the donkey could see the angel blocking his way every time he tried to go that that donkey bump up against that angel and you can manage that donkey can talk okay I think you did can you imagine being him Baylor when that donkey started talking to him some of us are so stubborn we got to have our donkey talking to us we didn't say God open our eyes cause I don't want to go nowhere without you I can't Hallelujah Romans 8. I love this verse 8 31 who shall we then say what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us I don't know why in the world I stuck this in the notes yesterday but here we go it's like job Satan comes up with the sons of God we're getting ourselves together to God as Satan comes up in the midst and God says where you been devil oh you know I'm in Roman two and fro on the Earth I'm seeking whom I may devour that's what the Bible says he's a roaring line he's seeking whom he may devour but God just says hey you considered my servant Jason Watkins put your name there have you considered my servant Steve Curtis sister Debbie Sister Sarah sister Rachel put your name there have you considered my servant job please say that about me that there is none lock them in the land we're a special people is this microphone dead turn me up please God says yeah but you got a hedge around him of course he's going to love you oh we might seem like everything's going good and me and my wife just talked about this the other day it seemed like everything's good everything's good our first year here the Lord get me acclimated to this thing three or four or five months ago the devil says well okay God says let's open the little Hedge for him unless the devil start causing trouble that's what God did that to job he allowed Satan just enough room to get in to afflict him but he says do what you want to job he won't curse me says oh yeah will I'll give him curse you to your face so job so the devil goes it takes his children takes his animals takes everything go was his confession naked I was born naked I'll leave you give and take away blessed be the name of the Lord can we say that we were going through the worst of Trials it's tough sometimes but blessed be the name of the Lord it don't matter if you're about to lose everything you've got it don't matter if your truck broke down take away Hallelujah oh he'll make you work get slow he'll make you finances get in trouble he'll afflict your health he'll flick your family maybe sometimes God allows it but in all this job sinned not so it come again Joe Walk Satan coming before the for the Lord as the sons of the God will gather cells together which to me they went churching even Satan comes to church like last couple ministers I've heard preach say devil just come on in here and have a seat you need to hear this so Devil he's more faithful than most of us church members again say devil where you been oh I've been roaming to a fro again well how do you considered my servant job a perfect upright man after all that he went through he was still a perfect man Satan says oh yeah of course but let me afflict his body let me touch his body let's see what he'll do God says okay just don't kill him Hallelujah so Satan afflicts Joe's body boils on his thing he takes his assists in the ashes and scrapes the Bulls off of him oh my my goes where job was the richest man at one time in the land down into an aheap my mind goes back well we had the richest man the richest The God Who on a cattle on a thousand hills he came from that down to Ash heap of humanity to know what we go through to know exactly how we feel that he could just take his arms around you that in times of trouble I'll hide you in my Pavilion Hallelujah but after Satan was finished with job even his wife was against him his friends had left him everything was against job Hallelujah job's still had his confession and God doubled his portion oh God takes stuff away from you just remember he'll double that portion Hallelujah Zechariah 2 5 4 I saith the Lord will be unto her a wall of fire round about and will be the glory in the midst of her there's a firewall around you well JD there's firewalls on these computers they keeping stuff out they're protecting the data we got a firewall is better than that because sometimes things do get through those firewalls but we got a firewall that nothing can go through it Hallelujah that word fire means altar fire Hallelujah we're altar fire Cain and Abel was going to bring their sacrifices up to the altar Cain his revelation understanding was that the fall was caused by fruit so he brought the best he had here you go Lord boom there's my best Abel he knew it was fruit get what I'm saying he knew it was fruit that caused the fall oh but by Revelation he knew it was lambskins that came to redeem them I don't know how he knew it because when Adam and Eve fell God killed a lamb and threw the Skins down behind the bushes says get dressed and they come out bloody so Abel knew something that the lamb covered their sin so here come Abel he come dragging out his best he come dragging his best up through the aisles of the church with a rope around around his neck pull this thing in a rock in the other hand grabbing that lamb and dragging him up there to the altar oh you could if you could hear that lamb speak he was probably saying not my will but thy will be done oh Hallelujah Abel picking up that lamb and throwing it up on the altar taking that rock and start hacking the blood hacking the neck of the blood squirting out everywhere all over him oh he was covered by the blood all over the altar and the last words you could hear that lamb say before he died it is finished and God has so much respect on that sacrifice that the fire fell out of heaven and consumed it what sacrifice we're given are we Justified are we Sanctified are you filled with the Holy Ghost I will go further than that you can be filled with a holy ghost have it on field on your flesh and spirit every day and still die go to hell but you gotta have that Holy Fire When God says you're a perfect upright man or woman you've been anointed by the Holy Fire of God Hallelujah you don't Elijah on Mount Carmel Oh Glory we know a story it ain't going to rain for three days it ain't gonna rain until I call for it God finally says okay let's go it's time for Showdown well he tells Ahab you go get your prophets of Baal I want you to meet me on top of Mount Carmel foreign God's going to approve by fire who he was Elijah he comes to the people he said how long halt ye between two opinions how long will you go from one side to the other they were serving Baal when it was convenient then they'd go back to God when it's convenient to serve God they were back and forth a bunch of wishy-washy people kind of reminds me what's going on in the message today oh is this message right is this message wrong is this message right brother Brad him a false prophet was he a true Prophet wishy-washy people no backbone about them how long will you halt between two opinions he's I tell you what you do if the Lord be God follow him if brother Branham be God you follow him thank you no disrespect to the prophet you know what I'm saying foreign and the people answered him not a word they do the same things today there's too many fence Sitters in this message you either on God's side or you're not the offense ain't on nobody's side if you want to say it whose side your defense if you're sitting in the middle of the fence you're on the devil's side and will you are God because in this message there ain't no fence sitters Elijah says let them there forgive us two bullocks choose one I'll choose one I'll address it you dress it and call ye up on the name of your gods go ahead and call upon your two Soul God go ahead and call upon your true God religion go ahead and call upon your tape recorder Hallelujah you said what in the world this God do is surrounded I ain't got a clue brother Brown said it when it come to the place Elijah says let us prove who is God the fiery God our God is a consuming fire let the goddess answers by fire that's what I say tonight let the goddamn answer by fire the Holy Ghost and Fire let him be God so Elijah said unto the prophets go ahead get your Bullock put it up on the altar but put no fire under it and I'll do the same thing Elijah knew that these prophets or Baal were known for a man to be under the altar they would act like they praying for fire to fall down a man would be under the altar to light it so Elijah says I don't want no man under that altar I don't want I don't want nobody on that organ try to work stuff up or on that piano or on that drums because people get under some kind of emotion and think they got the fire cause we know in the New Testament as they were preaching the word the Holy Ghost Fire fell upon them foreign so why they do they just thought the prophets of bell thought this is going to be an easy task this all be fun because they knew what they did they knew how they tricked the people but like you knew he said no you ain't gonna have nobody under light in the fire if a fire is going to be lit it's going to be lit by God no man can light your fire it takes one and they took the Bullock which was given them and they dressed it and called on the name of Belle from morning until noon my have we been known to do that have we been known to get up in the morning and call on our God till noon oh Bale hear us but there was not there was no voice voice nor any that answered and they leaped upon the all leaped upon the altar which was made oh they got so fired up they were jumping back and forth jumping over the altars oh they got Ray really got into worship it puts a lot of us a shame they worship a God that wasn't real we worship a god it's real my God is real for I feel him in my soul [Applause] Hallelujah all we feel is presence surrounding us and I feel it right now if you don't feel it where you're sitting come on up here a little closer they always say the fire falls up front somebody told me it's gonna be on the front row the other night I don't see them but I expect to hear their amens Hallelujah and it came to pass at noon that Elijah mocked him and says cry aloud for he's a god he might even be talking to someone aren't you glad that when you want to talk to our God it don't matter who he's talking to he can do it all at one time he's talking to every one of us this morning each one is how a different need God is speaking to you either he's talking or he's pursuing oh he might be on a journey anybody decided to go to go to Myrtle Beach he might be down in Florida somewhere if our God does take a vacation we know we can get him 24 hours a day seven days a week Elijah said if he truly was God either he'll answer you Elijah making fun of him come on where's your fire and they cried aloud even more and cut themselves after manner with knives and lances till the blood gushed out of them have we praised and worshiped that much Hallelujah help us Lord and it came to pass when the midday was passed they prophesied until the time of the Eden sacrifice around three o'clock in the afternoon but there was neither voice nor answer nor any of that regarded Lord I can imagine the devil down in hell he's probably back there laughing he no doubt has him a big pizza got him a can of Mountain Dew enjoying this because they know there was no way that fire was going to fall on that altar wow the devil knows the devil know who has true fire don't tell me he knows who you are Hallelujah hips in here watching people that don't if they don't get their lives straight they're headed for hell a come on many people sit in our churches unconverted I don't see how when the presence of God is moving Among Us like it does that an unconverted person can just sit there and leave this building the same person I don't see how we're going to be held accountable one day over opportunity after opportunity after opportunity that God is giving us been right here Among Us and we just deny it I can imagine hell is going to be harder for people like that even those same people's blasphemed this message those that's affected and says they're free they ain't free first thing they do when they leave this message they get more bound up they were within it they go after women cut their hair and they look like the world the men starts drinking and partying how's that free you're under the bondage of the devil I'd rather be a slave than Jesus Christ because I know that's how I'm getting out of here I like what brother Andrew said last time he was here I'm going to use it I'm here I might as well preach they have no representation in heaven no Holy Ghost no fire vindicating them those peoples left the message say they got a move of God we'll issue a challenge we'll issue a challenge if God be God God will prove it pray a sick person up here and you pray for them bring a blinded person up here and you pray for them and see what happens we'll issue a challenge this ain't for you all stinking people on the internet and brother Jason these ministers lay hands on them Watch What Happens I've seen it done I've seen the death able to hear the dumb speak all by a prayer you do that let's see where who God vindicates but I I'm here to tell you he won't vindicate you he's Vindicated this message around the world seven times that Pillar of Fire as he dropped and seen in the meetings a picture was taken of it there's your Vindication you showed me a picture with a pillow fire over your head I seen the I've been in meetings where the pillar of fire has been present and people's actually seen it I've never seen it a pillar of fire but I actually have felt the very presence of it like it bumps up against you when it goes by y'all know what I'm talking about you see the same thing brother Jack the power of God so strong we had we was down in Texas at a family camp it was Saturday night brother Ron Spencer was preaching it's supposed to be in a big prayer line after service but brother Ron got the preaching and you could just feel the way it was building up laughs he says I'm not having a prayer meet we're not having a prayer line we don't need one tonight the presence of God was in that building so strong it was no longer we all stood upon our hands I'll be up on our feet raised our hands lay our hands on each other I don't think we were five seconds into that prayer that the pillar of fire dropped down brother Ron Fisher said he's Seated on the people those people that were sick were healed you don't need a prayer line those help we've been in where we see them help but the pillar of fire is Among Us right now oh can you feel the effects of it Hallelujah Elijah said it to the people come near come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the Lord he said I've got to repair the word I've got to take these people back to the faith of the fathers Hallelujah he grabbed the first stone faith is a substance we go on and on to the last Stone of the rapture brother Brandon getting our hearts ready turned us back to the Faith of Our Fathers so that's what Elijah was doing he had to repair the altar Elijah took 12 Stones according to the number of the tribe of Israel unto whom the word of the Lord came Israel shall be my name Hallelujah when he made the altar he dug a trench why in the world is he digging a trench for I can imagine the prophets over there they're laying on the ground by now they're wore out tired what is he doing he'll just say hey I want you go get me some water filled up with water in the sea I want you to bring it I want you to feel it all of the altar fill up the trench that's the first pull he says go do it the second time the second pool he says go do it the third time third pull brother sister did his third pool hour the fire will vindicate us in this third pool the fire will fall down who is at this third time that's when the Dynamics will strike the mechanics and the water ran round about the altar he filled the trends also with water they had put 12 barrels of water on this sacrifice and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the Eden sacrifice that Elijah the prophet just came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel he didn't say Jacob Jacob had a name change he said all Israel let it be known this day that thou art God and that I am thy servant that I had done all these things at Thy Word what took the prophets of Baal all day to try to do Hallelujah Elijah walks up there Hear Me O Lord hear me that these people may know that thou art the Lord God and thou has turned their heart back again no sooner than he said those words then the fire of the Lord fell down and consumed the birth offering that word consumes to devour burn up oh God burn me up this morning May that Holy Fire come down and consume me Hallelujah fire fell and consumed that sacrifice because it was pleasing to God and he accepted it does he accept you today if he don't find out what hinders you from being accepted there's something there's something that's hindering you consuming fire God's Gonna prove with he's going to prove who his true bride is and it's proved by that fire same fire that fell in the Tabernacle in the wilderness that same fire that was at the beginning that said let there be light that same fire that Moses sent at the burning bush that same Pillar of Fire that fall children of Israel fought out in out of Egypt that same Pillar of Fire when Paul was on his road that that same Pillar of Fire had knocked him down who are you I'm Jesus that same Pillar of Fire is sitting beside you brother Gideon recap and just touch it oh Hallelujah let's change gears just for a minute and you can put up second Kings chapter six and do 14. we know the story there the king of Syria kept wanting to trap the king of Israel and he was saying Elijah would tell the king hey don't go that way there's a trap set for you there's a trap set for you every time the yard Syrian Army come up no king of Israel he didn't do it just one not once not twice but many times was the king of Israel's life saved all because Elisha knew what the King was thinking in his bed chamber God knows what you're thinking even right now it's like oh lord it's getting 12 30. I got food in the crock pot over here he knows what you're thinking laughs we're out he knows exactly what you're thinking and the King says what's going on who is tell the king where I'm at boy if we could if we could just listen to that voice sometimes you'll be driving along going to you going to your happy place and you might go the same route every day but one more decided I'm gonna go this way and unbeknownst to you there was a car wreck right here that God was protecting you from the devil likes to set traps for God's people if we just saw the leading of God what he'll take us around what will we avoid he's like where is this Elisha at then oh he's down in the city of dots Dawson and he says therefore sit he thither horses and chariots and a great host they came by night and can pass the city and when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth Behold a host can pass the city with horses and chariots and his servants got kind of nervous a last master how shall we do and the answer says fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them water relationship unless you had to heaven what representation Elisha had in heaven don't worry there's more here there's more here than any devil Hallelujah oh if people can really see what follows a believer these signs shall follow them that believe we are the Bride of Jesus Christ if he could just open up our eyes today and we can see what's live along these walls [Music] you know Elisha probably could have got out here and looked it out out there say you know what servant it looks like I'm surrounded it may look like I'm surrounded he could have sung the song if it looks like I've surrounded I'm surrounded by you as service is why in the world are you talking about all he could see was the devils all he could see was a sickness all he could see was the line vanities oh Hallelujah you know when that Army surrounds the city oh that King sin is cherishing his horses and what that meant when they sent the carrots and the horses it was to show their great power there's wanting to scare the inhabitants of the city bring Elisha forth but I can imagine God looking down on that and kind of laughing oh look at all them horses and chariots that devil thinks he's so powerful he thinks he's so powerful oh the devil thinks he's so Paris brother Matthew powerful he released 200 000 000 demons out of pits the hell against us you know Muhammad Ali when he when he was a he when he fought he fought one fight I can't remember his name but where he that guy punched him hard and it got round after round Muhammad Ali finally got up there whispered in his ear is that all you got can you imagine brother Luther how that boxer felt he had given Muhammad Ali everything he had I could imagine God telling the devil is that all you got if Satan comes against you come here devil he might have you in a headlock he might be punching you grab his ear is this all you got come on come on Hallelujah is this all you got you gave me cancer is this all you got you give me back trouble is that all you got you have flicked my eye is that all you got Hallelujah is that all you got devil there's more for us than against us Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes and the Lord opened his eyes to the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about Elisha that's what the devil sees where he sees you he sees our host of fire around you it don't matter what he afflicts you with there are surrounded by Holy Fire oh you know that same fire was a charity one day when Elijah and Elisha was gone across Jordan Elijah says what do you want Elisha he says I want a double portion of your spirit while they were walking along here come a sound of a whirlwind that Holy Fire come down and split right down between Elisha and Elijah picked up Elijah and carried him home Elisha says I see that I want that double portion these chariots are surrounding us this morning that one day between six and nine o'clock those same chairs that carried Elijah those same character horses are right here in this building it's going to sweep down and pick you up and carry you on in Hallelujah Supernatural fire is a definition for this fire this is the same fire that I went Ultra fire this is another definition it took me this long to get back here Supernatural fire accompanying theophanes that was a definition of fire Supernatural fire accompanying theophany that Pillar of Fire is Supernatural you know sometimes it ain't because I'm somebody because I'm not I'm a nobody but ever so often when I'm administered in a church basically does it mostly here that the glory of God is in the building it gets hazy somebody's probably been in Services where it's been hazy you can't hardly see the people in the back that's the presence of God it's right here that's your kind of Glory can you feel him can you feel his presence Hallelujah brother said he seen that Syrian Army All Around Dothan it backed up he says my father is the servant this is look out there what a great number why we're surrounded he just looking with his natural eyes with everything seems to go wrong when they point a finger at you and say this and that the doctor says you can't get well that's just a natural thing for you to think and you'll say oh my This Is the End but Elisha says there is more with us than there is with them he looked over again and says well I don't see nobody and he said God open this boy's eyes and as soon as God did something here it is get it when God opened his spiritual sight all around the prophets the chairs of fire and angels of Fire that they outnumbered the Syrian Army by the thousands the mountains was on fire oh if God could open up our spiritual eyes this morning and see these walls are on fire the angels of God in Camp about those who fear Him just the same tonight he says I wonder what would happen if man here tonight had the power to strike across their eyes and say look stand it around this Tabernacle tonight I love this next line he says look standing around this Tabernacle tonight and if you've seen it he said you would be a member here for the rest of your life if you knew I was standing among you you would want to go to no other Church you will follow no other religion because they don't have what we got you know sometimes you can't see it with your natural eyes but you can feel the impulse of it bro Steve we feel it it's that Sixth Sense that tells you something is near faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen no man has seen God but we sure do feel his presence even yesterday when I was telling his presence all day long I am so peaceful [Music] I said Lord why can't we stay like this forever but we're human beings we can't I would love to Brown says this Elijah probably didn't even see it itself wow he probably didn't see the angels in the cherished himself but he knew they was there oh we might not see him but we know they're there brother Travis they're here but Elisha was conscious they were there we're conscious they're here I can see it right here feel it right here there is on things unseen things in this building this morning there's a host of heavenly angels they're with us we're beginning Fellowship says did I think that whenever this Soul leaves this body we go into another house made with hand not made with hands we go into the presence of God and they're Tabernacle with him in the presence of Lord Jesus omniscient omnipresent Heath He Is We Are when we go into that into our new Tabernacle over there because he said we're two or three are gathered together I'll be in their midst one two three God's here then he's bound to be here this afternoon it's his word [Laughter] in our prayer meetings we might have six or eight or ten last week we had five it didn't matter the presence of God still come down Among Us so now you Brothers need to come to prayer meetings that was free there too he didn't pay me to do that he he can't seem but there's something about a Christian soul when man realizes when he's in the presence there he's standing in the presence of something [Music] that he can't see he says we know there's radios going through here right now there's television going through right now if we had receivers we could pick it up all kinds of things going through this building but it's in another world and so is there's angels of God placed around in this room watching this afternoon he's watching you the Angels Our God are encamped about those who fear Him Jesus is all present all the time watching over us we're surrounded says a servant why do you keep reading these quotes because they're good because I couldn't think of these I just use them we're plagiarizing mother Matthew God opened his boy's eyes when his eyes come open the mouths was on fire the angels of fire character fire sure he's here and when the Christian Believers can breathe can't believe that presence is here right now sitting together seated here in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus fellowshipping he says amen around the word of God the Holy Spirit here taking the word of God by vision and moving it out there into every heart as the word is going forth every believer receiving it we could stand and claim our god-given privileges that's the the time that God can ever take that Wishbone out of you I don't know what people's gonna think of me if God comes on me and I jump up and shout if I jump up say Amen to the preacher what's the people behind me gonna think God's here to take that Wishbone out of your back and put a real old-fashioned gospel backbone into you somebody who will stand for the truth no matter how dark it gets I think I busted my lip the Bible says the angels of God are encamped about those that believe that fear him and he'll deliver them God made an unconditional Covenant this is infallibility of God's spoken word and I sent this to the brothers last week two weeks ago he hooked it into Jesus Christ bear it's anchored there's no slipping no sliding there's no way of it getting away what is it is hurt by God above by the Son of God beneath it's a pathway it's a traveler's way from Earth to Glory and you can't fail look he says there's a great company of angels up and down here ascending and descending picking up the weary and the sick healing their bodies showing Visions Mighty signs and wonders can't fail it can't slip it can't slide you're safe Hallelujah it's hooked around the heart of God hooked around the Son of God down here and we're brought into it through the Son of God we Ascend to him there's an open line we have a direct line to the throne room he'll give his angels charge over thee and the angels of God are encamped about those who fear Him in Revelation the book of symbols brother Brown says the angels are encamped around us they don't go back to Heaven they are with you through life every day they are here the angels of God are compassed are camped about those they don't go back to heaven they Camp there they're sent on a mission to watch you you know sometimes you know before you got saved Lord I should have been dead I should have drowned it in the ocean but my angel was protecting me because he had a commission laughs that angel is here with you right now they might be 75 people 80 people if they're that many I know it they're at least 75 angels in this building right now not counting the ones that's lying the walls Hallelujah every now and then though one of them angels will bump into you and you'll send a charge to you like a battery oh if you talk about God he'll come near you you know it's truth people sit and you'll still sit and talk about awful things talk about a movie they've watched and talk about demons and stuff and you start feeling pressing in that's what happens when you talk about Jesus remember Tony on the phone the other morning and we're just sitting there talking and it's just start out with business then all of a sudden he got over to God and he just mentioned how he's getting sick of the devil I'm tired of it I told you I'm gonna preach a sermon on that one night tired of it we're tired of what the devil does to us talk about the goodness of God and what God does to you and I'm sitting there driving down the road and I said brother Tony the presence of God is right here in this truck when you talk about God he's going to come around you we've been talking about it right now for has it been an hour already over time we've been talking about him now for over an hour he's here he's right here God is real as we say he is something ought to declare him if we could just open our eyes and you can see God oh Lord let me skip the very in question answering Jeffersonville the very Lord Jesus that was back there in the days of the Apostles is right here right now and he is just winding up at the end of the Gentiles a great move is going on just Supernatural believers how many Supernatural believers do we have this morning what about the rest of you is if you're not be so before we leave here it's just winding up a great move is on cause we believe that God is here just think your glorified body is right here at the Tabernacle now the presence of the Holy Spirit which is your glory find condition you're glorified in Christ right now those he's Justified he's also glorified your own glorified body standing near you right now I got my arm around mine to give you strength like a charge going through a battery brother Steve reach for that battery hook up to it Hallelujah the Holy Spirit In You to charge your body and give you new Strength to heal you from sickness that you got to make you well that's all I'm saying you just come laughs I had this in my notes and I wasn't going to read this like this ain't got nothing to do with it but brother Brown says in the rise of the Sun all these Easter bunnies and ceremonies and big churches and finderies will fail and pass away until that church both Dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of God that moved him to do those things that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also this is probably why I was going to read this I'll give get hard of my Dynamics [Laughter] his mechanics that the world will not be able to withstand it so that angel is standing right here you're a glorified body is standing right here to give you a charge don't leave this building without it you know like he is when you have a car [Music] Well Jack can you bring me some jumper cables bring your car and you hook those kegels up to that battery cranky cranky engine [Music] unhook the cap the cables and drive down the road you come to church this morning here are you barely struggling and walking in the door your battery's about drained God is here to restore your joy God is just for here to restore your peace God is here to restore your happiness just take your spiritual battery cables and hook them up to your glorified body and start your engines Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah his loves for me love for me is just like just like big old my God is real foreign [Music] so yes God real for he has washed for me love me just like just
