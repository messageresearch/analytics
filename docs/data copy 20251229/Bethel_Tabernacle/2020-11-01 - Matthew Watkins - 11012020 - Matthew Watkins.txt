knew he was going to have to and i thought well i'll take sunday school then i thought what am i going to do for a sunday school lesson and the only thing i could think of was i want to do a song and um practice it and hopefully sing really soon it's just a hymn that we would all know and i thought well i don't know when we'll sing it but we're just going to get sing we'll sing it in sunday school so we jumped in and me and the kids we practiced it and just kind of went through it and i thought well i never got a chance to talk to tony and i meant to ask him last night but it just didn't come up and i hadn't talked to the kids yet and um so as we're practicing tony comes by the fellowship hall and he sticks ahead and goes hey you got a song for us this morning i was like as a matter of fact i do and so i haven't had a bad dream about it last night that the dog was barking and wrote the song but um so um you all know the song and uh just um this was just what was on our hearts so um

bless you amen happy to have you all in the house of the lord today got a couple of announcements i promised to make concerning our harvest gathering and explain a little bit about the details uh first thing as i gave you uh on the uh church chat was that it is said to be saturday the 14th uh but i've also had it on my heart to do it a little bit different this year and as it as it stands almost everything is different this year and so um amen brother manuel says to carol happy to have you all here with us today um so what we're what i'm about to announce is kind of you can't take it anywhere see it's kind of top secret so that's why we have it on the internet so but it's okay i actually am going to make the announcement that um you know because of the situation that we have during the pandemic we're not going to do it like we normally do it normally it's it's over the top way large way big big lots of activity lots of things going on we're going to first have it here on the church grounds and we're going to uh scale it back uh quite a bit we're still going to have activities um you know but uh and i may i haven't it's hard for me to resist getting something for the kids to play on so i may put a slide up over here and by the way i sure enjoyed that song today that they did i vote for sarah putting that together every sunday only me every sunday she's standing behind you she can see your hands amen amen amen thank you sister sarah that was fantastic and so i just i love little children and so i love to see them having a good time love to see them worshiping the lord and so we may we may put that up i've given rachel uh if she wants to pursue that permission to do and we're still going to have other activities here i think the uh they'll they'll have the octa ball out and the corn toss and the ping pong tables and and all that kind of stuff and we'll have we'll have the fire and the lights and the eating and the of course we're gonna have the eating absolutely nobody would come if we didn't do that so and we're gonna have lots of fellowship and uh but it will be on a smaller scale so we're not even going to call it a harvest fest this year because of the scaled-down version we're just going to call it our harvest gathering and i've had it on my heart for weeks and just been secretly praying i haven't even only sister debbie only heard about this when i told rachel about it just the other day sister rachel's heading up our the teams and so any sisters that want to help out please see sister rachel about volunteering we're going to have we're going to do the food a certain way that we've discussed but i've also had it on my heart that you know the pandemic friends just if i speak to you from my heart for some it has taken quite a bit from us um and you know we were under restrictions for our church and we we first you know we were the skeleton crew a preacher of one musician and two booth personnel then we went to um the silly alphabet system we had to do it because i didn't never like it but we had to do it because of the it only had one purpose behind it was that we could not socially distance the building isn't big enough and so we couldn't socially distance having everybody here so because we felt compelled in the word of god to follow the restriction that our local city fathers had placed on us and i felt that i felt that in my heart as a servant of the lord i didn't make that decision lightly i didn't make it arbitrarily these decisions have been made with the entire board of elders deacons and trustees and we've and the ministry team so but through a lot of prayer i felt compelled by god's word and by things brother branham said to uh follow those restrictions they've since been relaxed and now we're able to meet uh together we do still ask and expect you to comply with wearing your mask coming into your seat and then leaving to go back out you'll notice even brother luther will wear one coming up here and we've got the three back rows reserved for people who wish to wear their mask throughout the service and there are people who do that's perfect there are people who are you know concerned about that and i have nothing at all negative say about that i think it is a concerning thing people are getting sick message believers are dying sister seal is on a ventilator right now and thankfully thankfully to the lord we're very grateful we're one of the few churches that this is true about so it's just god's grace but but we have no known infection from coming to church everyone that has got it was traveling away and got it while they were away or perhaps in a business somewhere we've we've not found any contact tracing that would lead us to think anyone caught it from here and we have installed new air quality systems to deal with pathogens of all kind and so the trustees we announced that last week so we've been doing good and we want to keep it that way so remember friends that the whole thing about asking you to wear a mask coming in or going out is because you're going to pass by people who who who have a concern you know about the mask and remember that the science indicates that the mask doesn't as much keep you from catching it as it as it more keeps you if you happen to have it and don't know it it helps prevent you from spreading it so that's why it's so important when you walk in because you're going to walk past people on the back row who are there because they have those concerns and want to wear a mask and so we're just asking you to follow that strictly remember i think that brother jason sunday school this morning was astonishing my wife and i were having that conversation this morning and i told brother jd in the back i said you know we were we were talking about what you know love versus selfishness and self-centeredness and i think i learned so much about brother jason breaking down that it's more than just agape love it's more than just the love of god that comes by the new birth there is a human interactive love as brother jason was breaking out and and and in order for the church to function according to the way god desires it to function all three of those forms of love need to be in need to be moving so you you've got to remember friends that that self-centeredness and selfishness uh when you're self-centered i want to tell you something what happens it creates a self-blindness and a self-deafness and a self-numbness to the effects of what you do in your life and too often times in an absence of the right kind of love and tender heartedness toward one another as the bible says we get self-centered and we we we tend to say you know i don't care what people think but just understand this please that just because you might not care that doesn't keep it from happening that it's still going to happen the effects of what you do are still going to affect people around you so you can you cannot care all day long that's not going to change the reality of what it's going to cause and so because that we are commanded you know to be kind-hearted tenderhearted one toward another kindly affection uh toward one another we ask that you for the sake of others follow these coveted rules we have been coveted free as far as anyone contracting it here in church and we would like to keep it that way there are other churches right now brother luke gibson had several cases of covet and some other illnesses that were also conspiring and so they've actually closed their services other churches have had to do that we've been we've managed to keep going uh even albeit limited at times but uh we we want to really there the nation is in a uh in an increase right now in 32 states and i'm not talking about positive tests that's just because they're testing more but hospitalizations and deaths are up south carolina has about a 92.1 percent death rate right now uh fortunately thank be thanks be to god beaufort county is uh very low right now um very low in fact is it has some of the when i i was looking with the ministry team yesterday at the graphs from dhec and on their seven to 14 day window the seven past and the seven i think they do seven past and seven forecast uh they say right now beaufort county is quite low so i'm glad i'm thankful to the lord for that and so um jasper county was was one notch above but even still it was only moderate so we're thankful to the lord that he's watching over us i think maybe our coastal coastal breeze kind of helps that a little bit so there's advantages to living near the ocean amen we don't call it a beach here brother man you'll call it the coast the ocean amen so if you if you go to the coast or to the ocean you know you're fine don't be telling people you go to the beach but i'm just kidding i'm totally kidding i don't doesn't matter whatever to me what you call it amen you're going to be a christian wherever you go right so praise the lord and uh so we're going to be doing our harvest gathering on saturday the 14th and i i've had it on my heart that you know i would i would i we've wanted to try to figure out how to run a meeting of course that's wow how do you do that during a pandemic and all meetings have been canceled this entire year uh even some of the biggest meetings that we've been accustomed to for 40 years or more had to be set aside for 2020. so what we're going to do is we're going to have i'm going to take the wednesday prior uh to that saturday that's me thank you uh yes sir correct and that that wednesday we're going to move that wednesday the 11th and i will i will let you know my final decision but my my tentative plan is to move it to thursday the 12th because i would like to have a couple of services leading up to our harvest gathering you know a revival time a rededication time i think the pandemic has taken something from us and i think i would like to see our hearts brought back into rededication to the lord and i appreciate all the dedication i see you're a marvelous group you've survived well during this unsettling time i think we're doing wonderful but i also feel it in my own heart and in your heart and and from the lord's heart i think i would like to see a time of reconsecration and rededication and because of that we'll have maybe our wednesday night service will be on thursday the 12th so we're just moving it we're not canceling it reading my lips we're not canceling it we're just moving it to thursday and then also i'd like to have on the 13th friday i'd like for us to come back and maybe have an abbreviated service where we have the lord's supper now we won't be able to do foot washing because several reasons logistically the fellowship hall it will be prepared for the harvest festival the harvest gathering the next day so the brothers can't go in there and bulls in a china shop and wreck everything that the sisters have done and imagine that we could get it back in the order they had it in so we're not going to be able to use that plus that would really put some close proximities i think i'd i'd just be better part of wisdom would be not to do that so we'll just have just the communion service just the lord's supper we'll have a little bit of ministry as we do we cut all the song singing short the ministry short and uh and then we have the lord's supper and i think that that thursday which is just our wednesday relocated to thursday and then the 13th friday as a rededication service reconsecration service amen i think that it would be wonderful and i like doing it that way because sometimes people won't come to communion service because they you know because of issues in their mind that they're aware maybe they're not they don't feel like they can take it and it's uh that that can happen i i'm i have nothing disparaging to say i'm glad if your heart feels hesitant but remember that paul's instructions are is to is to consider yourself make your heart right and then take the supper don't just not take it you know that's why friday will be we'll have some preaching to wash you up cleanse your hearts and minds give you an opportunity to re-consecrate your heart and then come and partake of the lord's supper it's a sad case when you see and i'm glad we don't have it very rampant here over the years but i have occasionally seen you know there's certain people and you go 5 10 15 20 years and that person is never at a communion service and that's very sad so you don't want to do that friends that's not why the gospel came that's not why you're a believer that's not why you're a christian you're a christian to be an overcomer so we'll give you a service a little bit of preaching even if it's a shortened version and i have it on my heart to bring a friend of mine down i'm i've texted him to ask him if he's available if he can't do it then we'll just carry it ourselves with the ministry here but i've had it on my heart to bring him in i'm not going to tell you who it is until i can get a confirmation from him but he's a wonderful wonderful friend and um just has a way about him that he will melt your heart and um he's he's he i don't think he's preached in this building maybe he maybe that might stand correction but it's been a long time and he's a very very dear friend of mine and so i think that he he his testimony will be great for our senior youth because this this is the white version of jewel forney i mean raised in the streets was in almost every uni i mean you talking about a uh you know a twofold child of the devil the devil this was this was one of the devil's franchise players and uh you know one of his one of his leading men and god snatched him from the devil amen and now he's a glorious christian and uh he has a powerful testimony that i'd like i thought would be good for dedication and if he can't make it we're definitely going to get him but well i'm just going to tell you who it is so you can help me pray that's brother richie douglas in north carolina good friend of mine since boys and uh he him and his mother and father were great friends to my parents and so his mom's still alive and boy she's their sister jean hey at least 90 yeah and so um i'm sorry to keep taking all your time anthony we'll we'll give you all the time out so don't change anything just carry on um we'll we'll limit the preacher i'll hold my watch up at him if he goes too long i used to see brother eddie do that to me he would he was too slick to just go like that he'd wear his watch upside down and i would notice him just go like he's looking at his hand but i knew what he was doing back i think we maybe have another special and we want to hear back i think we maybe have another special and we want to hear i want to hear what brother matt has today i have had to stand down actually i've stood here too long already i've strained my lower back pretty bad and i was over to see doc meredith yesterday an x-ray and different things everything's fine just uh just some inflammation from an old injury and some arthritis trying to creep in which i call lying devil and uh never gonna sign for that never gonna sign for that uh but uh you know it's my own fault you know i kind of felt it coming and should have took it easy and didn't uh should have continued with my stretching and my core strengthening coulda shoulda woulda isn't that what we always say when we're regretting man i could have i should have um so uh just need to be a little more diligent on keeping my temple uh healthy for the lord's use it's not mine doesn't belong to me and i need to take better care of it so god bless you again we will keep you up to date on our harvest gathering but that's our plans to move the wednesday the 11th to thursday the 12th and then add in a 13th friday for uh the lord's supper and a reconsecration service amen and then saturday will be our harvest gathering it'll be all right here on the grounds and then sunday if we can keep brother richie over we'll maybe turn him loose and let him preach us a full sermon on sunday so god bless you let's stand back to your feet and so you be pulling on the word today so matt stepped in i actually was supposed to preach the adult sunday school and the service but brother jd had to cover for me on sunday school and brother matt's covering for me on the service today it'd be too much on my feet and so uh if you see me moving slow i'm okay it's just i'm having to move a little slow so god bless you thank you kindly brother anthony god bless you you may be seated this gives us to dorothy a handyman i asked her to give us a selection this morning [Applause] [Music] i've got a home in glory land they'll outshine the sun i've got a home in glory land they'll outshine the sun i've got a home in glory land they'll outshine the sun look away [Music] beyond [Music] [Music] me [Music]

bless you this morning let's turn to psalms chapter 23 amen i'll have you go straight to the word this morning psalms chapter 23 we'll just have a one scripture very familiar psalm here but i i just wanted to read this we won't get to psalms 23 right away but we just want to um want to pour out what the lord's put upon our heart you love him this morning amen certainly appreciated all that good worship from the back i could hear and feel amen but we just want to look to his word this morning psalms chapter 23 very familiar scripture here the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the pas in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anoinest my head with oil my cup runeth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever amen heavenly father we thank you lord for your word this morning that we've read already lord the sunday school that was taught father your word that went forth we believe lord that you're already here amongst us lord and you inhabit the praises of your people lord and we worship you this morning with thanksgiving in our heart lord we have something lord that we can rejoice over for you've done so much for us lord as your children god and so we just ask now that you would come by your spirit lord let not this be just the work of a man lord of the words or the thoughts or things that i've studied or looked at lord but i know you've placed a burden upon my heart now god would you come and quicken your word to the heart of your children lord i pray father it would reach every person in this building lord every person that's streaming those that'll go later maybe and see this lord i pray that your word would hit its mark father may you just move us out of the way lord be with the hearer and the speaker we ask in jesus christ's name amen amen you can be seated this morning i'd like to speak to you on the lord is my shepherd very simple title and we'll get to psalms 23 here in a moment but i'd like to begin here and if you have a bible handy and the brothers on the screen if they'd just be ready i'd like you to look at genesis chapter 17 and we're just going to read one verse and just want to want to begin here with a word that we have perfection and we know that word uh means something uh unattainable is what we feel like when we hear that word perfection uh we automatically think well i'm separated from that because i'm nowhere near perfect and i can never be perfect which is true let's see what the lord says about perfection here in genesis chapter 17. what has begun reading in the first verse i am the almighty god this is god speaking to abraham walk before me and be thou perfect so god gives this commandment to abraham and he says walk before me and be thou perfect he says also and and if you'll just follow me here on the screen in deuteronomy chapter 18 verse 13 he says thou shall be perfect with the lord your god so this is god speaking of the children of israel not only to abraham but he says this to his family also thou shall be perfect with the lord your god uh and and you'll find this laced all the way through the entire old testament and then into the new testament uh and when jesus says unless you're perfection exceeds the pharisees and he begins to talk and and use the example of what we think of when we think of perfection but god looks at perfection so differently than how we look at perfection in our life god even says here and he says and this is david in psalms chapter 101 and verse 2 uh and we're just going to go through these i've got a lot of them here before me he says in psalms 101 verse 2 he says i will behave myself wisely this is david a desire he has in his heart he says i'll behave myself wisely in a perfect way oh when will thou come unto me i will walk within my house with a perfect heart and so notice david doesn't say i'll walk perfectly and all my behavior and my conduct and and everything that i do will be perfect we know his life definitely was not perfect and it was a life that was marred and scarred by sin and a lot of failure and a lot of mistakes but david purposes something in his heart and he says i'll walk within my house with a perfect heart we know solomon fell from that perfect from that perfect heart the bible says in first kings chapter 11 and he says here in verse 4 first kings 11 chapter chapter 11 verse 4 he says his heart speaking of solomon here he says his heart was not perfect with the lord his god he turned that his wives turned away his heart after the gods his heart was not perfect with the lord his god as was the heart of david his father so notice the correlation that god makes for perfection he doesn't point to conduct he doesn't point to behavior but he says a heart that's perfect before me david said i'll walk with a perfect heart in my house solomon we know the bible says he didn't walk it wasn't pointing to solomon's mistakes or his failures but actually something had happened in solomon's heart and the bible says he says he he didn't walk like david his father with a perfect heart he went not fully after the lord as david his father uh he says in matthew chapter 5 verse 48 uh this is the lord come in the new testament this is jesus speaking and he says be ye therefore perfect matthew 5 48 be ye therefore perfect with the lord uh uh let me back up be you there for perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect paul speaks of this and he says and we don't have to turn but he says i have a desire that i may present you uh every one of you perfect chased spotless without spot without blemish without wrinkle without any such thing and he says in colossians 1 28 he says that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus that same exact book of colossians he says in chapter 4 verse 12 that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of god first peter chapter 5 verse 10 this is peter speaking he says but the god of all grace who has called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus after that you have suffered a while make you perfect here's that word again make you perfect establish strengthen and settle you so what we find is that perfection doesn't mean flawlessness as in the sense of human behavior because we already read that david was a perfect david had a perfect heart before the lord in fact god goes further and says he's a man after my own heart so david was a man full of mistakes full of fear full of failure full of anxiety constantly was a man who was up and down and in and out had many highs and lows but the scripture begins to tell us that there's there's a perfection that doesn't mean that you're perfect in the sense of flawlessness or even sinlessness let me go further and say that you as we preached on wednesday you'll never be sinless in this body because just the fact of being in a carnal body it's already sinful so no matter how much we try we read about monks who uh you know have have self mutilated themselves and tortured themselves looking for perfection we learned about that in the men's breakfast yesterday of a monk who spent 35 years on the top of a needle of a tower and lived there when he couldn't hold himself up anymore he chained himself to a pole just to hold his strength just to hold his body up there it was trying to look for outward perfection it was this this roman 7 law that paul said i realized that within me there's no good thing that is in my flesh and so this this he he begins to speak here and in god we know that we know very well that the bible says that man judges by the outward appearance but god looks upon the heart i know all these things are very elementary for us but i just want to cover them so god judges the heart god looks at the heart he doesn't look at the at the outward appearance as he says to david about saul but he looks at the heart and i believe sometimes we so rejoice in that we say oh thank god he looks at my heart but i think it's a much more weighty matter and in some ways should almost alarm us more are you with me this morning because oftentimes we look at that god looks at the heart as relief that oh well god doesn't look at my outward mistakes and we look and say well i have so many mistakes and i'm i'm just a mess and brother matt god doesn't look at my god doesn't look at my flesh praise god he looks at my heart praise god but do you realize the the seriousness of a god who looks at your heart because in your heart is what's not in your flesh what you can never see in the flesh is the motive of of a person and that motive comes from the word motivation what motivates you we can't we can't judge the intention of a person no all the time by what they do on the outside because sometimes they have very bad there's bad intentions that are covered up by good actions and so god says you know th this is a serious matter it's not a it's not a matter of relief though it is many times for us as a believer to say lord i'm so glad you look at the desire of my heart because god does look at the desire of the heart but the bible says he judges the heart are you here this morning and so what god judges he he sees uns the unseen part of you he sees the part that no one else can he sees the part that no disguise or religion can cover no amount of actions or good behavior can cover because sometimes some of the most corrupt people some of the most corrupted hearts we find are covered by religiosity and what we look at as outward perfection or blessing to stay with me here this morning we're preaching on the lord as my shepherd so david the bible says he was he had a perfect heart in first samuel chapter 16. in first samuel uh brothers on the screen first samuel chapter 16 and verse 7. i want you to notice what the bible says first samuel 16 verse 7 because this is speaking of david it says but the lord said unto samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of a stature speaking of david because i refuse are speaking of saul because i've refused him for the lord seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the lord looketh upon the heart perfection that word means completeness means maturity fullness and and the hebrew and the greek the definition when you look up the definition for uh perfection when it says he served the lord with the perfect heart that the hebrew in greek define it as uprightness or being without spot or without blemish or totally obedient it means to finish this is perfection perfection means to finish what has been started so what is god doing when he's perfecting me he's finishing what he started glory it also means a complete before performance there shall be a completion the bible speaks of there shall be a performance of those things which he has promised so what is god doing by the perfecting of the believer by the preaching of the word uh he he's bringing to completion what he started amen and it it it means a complete performance uh wesley calls it a constant obedience so you say brother matt what is a perfect heart i want to have a perfect heart this morning i believe any christian i don't even have to ask you here this morning we would oh identify and say lord i want to have a perfect heart before you i realize i'm not going to have a perfect life but i want to have a perfect heart i want to serve you with a perfect heart i want my motives that says why david said search me o god see if there be any wicked way not we're not this wasn't actions not wicked how i dress or wicked how i look or wicked in my conduct but a wicked heart is there a wicked way inside of me the lord searches a heart that is perfect is a heart that can be searched by the spirit a heart that can be searched is a heart you say the lord searches the heart but david speaks of something here in first chronicles this is first chronicles 28 verse 9. i've given you an exercise back there but i just i want to display these they're so important verse chronicles 28 verse 9 the lord searcheth all hearts lord searcheth all hearts wicked hearts righteous hearts rich people's hearts poor people's hearts young people's hearts elderly people's hearts the lord searcheth all hearts this is very familiar in psalms 139 verse 23 david says search me oh god and know my heart now this was a this was a a plea this is david asking search me o god and know my heart try me that means the test that means i i'm going to put something i'm going to put it to it i'm going to put it to a test to see is it is it going to withstand and this is david asking saying lord search me know my heart try me know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me jeremiah 17 10 you don't have to pull this one up god said to jeremiah i the lord searcheth the hearts uh the the this is the hebrew word for for search you say because we think of that and it's a searching like i'm looking for something and i'm i'm trying to find something that i've lost and we search for it but it has a much richer meaning than that when david says search me oh god and he says and god says to jeremiah i search the heart the greek word the hebrew word there for search means to penetrate to examine like an examination amen so it's a it's a it's a it's a breaking up of fallow ground and a it's a uncovering what god does when he searches the heart he peels back all the layers that we put on he peels back all the layers of our mind and all the facade that we as christians can have many times and the lord begins to do deep examination he begins to to search the inward motive in the inward being i penetrate examine deeply you remember first corinthians he says for the spirit searcheth the things of god yea the deep things of god and so he says the spirit what is doing the searching the holy spirit is searching and and you know what friends let me just stop preaching here for a moment and just say we need this more than we've ever needed it before and say what do we need brother man we need the spirit to search our hearts more than ever before every day as a believer as as we live in this world you say why because sin is more deceptive than it's ever been before in any other age sin is more subtle than it's ever been in any other age it's like dust that settles down on something and you don't notice it at all you live in a uh you know without your air filters in your hvac system and you get dust that settles sometimes you don't realize it until you wipe your finger across and you're like oh man that's dirty that's dusty and let me say sin in this 2020 age is like dust that settles down upon our hearts you say what we need a we need a searching more than ever before revelations chapter 2 it talks about the depth of satan that there's there's a there's a there's a depth to sin that's a profound darkness an abyss it speaks about darkness shall come upon the people in gross darkness darkness shall come upon the land and gross darkness that gross darkness is not gross like yuck or disgusting but it's a measurement it's a weight and so he says the darkness is going to be so gross it's a it's a it's a it's a heavy weight in the world and he's saying evil the evil that exists in this day penetrates further than your than your five senses i hope you hear me uh both old and young but particularly the young people today sin is so subtle in this age that we live in and it has a much greater desire than just transforming the the outward look or appearance that you have you know music the wrong kind of music will do that to a person it'll change their entire appearance it'll change how they dress and they don't realize their influence is be the influence is the reason why they're attracted to certain clothing is because of certain outward uh influences but let me say that the desire of sin is not just to change you outwardly but to totally change you inwardly and the effect of sin is to deform you emotionally to to deform you mentally to where he changes how you look at the world he changes how you look at life he changes how you look at your parents how you look at the bible how you look at faith how you look at church and sin wants to completely deform you inwardly it wants to do just how the holy spirit wants to do an inward work sin wants to do an inward work also so he says it goes down the this is this is this is david speaking he says the inward thought of every one of them and heart is is deep so it's a it's a warning and david's saying search me o god and before more than ever before sin is more accessible than it's ever been it's it's easier to access than it's ever been before and so he in the this is this is exactly what has prophesied in this last day that because of a bounded iniquity the hearts of many would wax cold because of the deceitfulness of sin and so there's a there's a it takes roots it goes into the channels brother adam preaches on this and he says you've got to clear out the channels because the flu can get clogged up with the wrong thing and then we wonder why am i why am i struggling to with this or with that or why am i why am i struggling to believe the promise over here many times it's oftentimes it's because our channels are so clogged up we don't even realize it and so david says search me oh god see if there be any wicked way in me so this is a this is the desire of a heart that wants to walk perfect before the lord the heart says i want to be searched lord i want you to search the innermost part of my being go beyond my dress code go beyond my religiosity go beyond my so my my my uh affiliations with with believers go beyond my chur what church i go to go beyond who my family comes from lord go beyond all of the facade that i can create search the inward part lord search the hidden part shine your light into the darkest parts and investigate dig out can you say amen this morning this is what the believer wants dig it out lord expose it expose it a shallow christian just coming to church won't do that because sometimes people wear the thickest body armor they have at church sometimes people wear the thickest body armor emotionally and that nothing's gonna nothing's gonna uh uh uh penetrate them but the the perfect heart says lord i i'm going to let go of all of my body armor i'm going to let go of all of my layers i'm going to let go of all of pretense and so he says this is what it means to have a perfect heart jesus says in revelations 2 verse 23 he says uh all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reigns and hearts and i will give unto every one of you according to your work so this is what the lord says i i'm searching but here's why now here's here's something so important to understand about the lord the cops investigate and they search to bust somebody they they they launch a covert operation and they begin to spy and surveil people for the purpose of not helping them but to take them down but let me just say something very simple god doesn't search you and expose you to bring you down or destroy you but god searches the heart to redeem you what a very difference the the the the you know that we have here the holy spirit isn't there to bust you or to expose you or to embarrass you or to shame you but god says i'm searching i'm exposing i'm pulling out the under layers because i want to redeem you i want to save you i want to clean you i want to wash you i want you to have a pure heart i want a heart that can trust and i almost titled this message trusting the shepherd and you're going to see why here in just a moment but god wants a heart that can trust because when a heart is laid out before the lord it's a heart that's trusting david says in psalms 22 verse 4 he says our fathers trusted in thee they trusted this is our david's speaking he says our fathers trusted in thee they trusted and thou did delivered them they cried unto thee and were delivered he says that again they trusted in thee and were not confounded you know how many times in your memory you can remember reading psalms and and especially the psalms that david wrote because david didn't write all the psalms but you'd notice the ones david you you you even if it's doesn't even if you're scoffing or whatever bible doesn't identify who the writer is you can identify just by some of the things that are being said because david is repetitive he speaks from something you can always identify he says in psalms 11 verse 1 in the lord this is david in the lord put on my trust and psalms 25 verse 2 he says oh my god i trust in thee so the trust you say well the the what does that word mean that word trust means i'm going to read you the exact definition to fling to fling oneself off of a precipice this is what it means this is what david says lord i'll put my trust in you i'll trust in the lord and he says it means you're you're you're you're casting yourself you're you're throwing yourself like a child would would have so much trust in a father and take a little baby and they don't know there's no fear there there's such trust in the arms of their father they'll just fling themselves off of a high place unto their father because they know he's going to catch me amen do you realize this is what david means when he says i put my trust in you david says when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i when my enemies come against me i'll put my trust in you what's he saying i'll throw myself off into your arms lord i'm going to trust you so much with this matter this problem or this situation i'm not going to worry about it i'm going to trust in you i'm going to cast my cares upon you for you careth for me this is like to be a child again as the father says jump and there's no pause there's no question there's no wondering they'll just freely do it it's only fear of falling that that that they lose their confidence but god says i want a heart that's perfect so it's got to be a heart that can be searched it's got to be a heart that can trust me in all matters of our life and let me just say this to you my brother my sister some of us even here today are in situations where we are we have one choice we can either trust the lord or we could give up on god because sometimes god puts you in spots in your life where you have to make a choice and you have to make a decision i'm talking very naturally here you've got to make a decision to say lord i'm on the edge i'm about to go over i'm going to either i'm going to jump and i'm either going to trust you lord or i'm going to fall to my death and god says will you trust me in the darkest moment will you trust me uh in the most impossible situation can you trust me then and you know some people say well you know i'm just trusting the lord and i'm just i'm just going to resign to whatever happens that's not trusting the lord i'm just going to resign whatever happens happens that's fatalism you know quesara whatever will be will be future is not mine i'm just going to just i i you know i can't i can't handle it i can't do anything else whatever i'm just going to let it go just whatever happens i trust you lord that's not trusting the lord that's not trusting your shepherd that's numbing yourself to the pain to where you become so numb to it you just i'm not gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna uh i'm gonna disengage i'm gonna check out and try and tribulation can bring us to this edge trouble can bring us trial could bring us to this edge to where we become almost numb to it to resign from it to say i i just give up i'm just not going to do anything else but let me say this to you my brother trust is is not a passive thing that a believer does trust is an active faith that you have in your heart that no matter what happens it's going to be for my benefit because i have a heavenly father who's my shepherd and i'm not going to fear i'm going to trust him that no matter what happens he has my best interest in mine amen you know we treat the lord that you know well i'm going to trust i'm going to trust god and you know and and and and you know when satan comes and he he lights my house on fire and my marriage is in trouble and my children are in trouble and and you know and and and all my house is burning down i'm stranded on the top of the roof and the flood water's coming here comes a helicopter over oh it's there they're there to rescue me lord save me so here comes the lord and he sends his helicopter and he drops out his lifeboat and he rescues us and he and he tells us you know you got to jump or your house is going to burn down many times people limit their trust in the lord in that way amen you know i trust you lord to come and put out all my fires save me from all my troubles deliver me out of all my i know the lord's gonna be there i know at the end of the day when i need him he's gonna show up do you know so often times we credit the devil for being in control way more than he is when the devil comes and burns my house down then i'll trust the lord when the devil comes direct my family then i'll trust in the lord you know when the when the devil causes this issue in in my in my in my life and we credit everything to the to the you know as if as if as if the devil is the one who plans all of your tests as if the devil is the one charting your journey of life devil has not the devil doesn't chart any of my life he has no control over me as if the devil is the one ordering yeah he needs this trial and he needs this test and needs to go through this listen friends every trial test trouble that you go through is ordered by your father the devil is just a thief and a robber everything you go through it doesn't matter what it is god is the one who's in control the devil's doing this the devil's causing this let me say this god doesn't god's not a reactor to what the devil does god's the initiator and god says i'm the one calling the shots here not you if anybody's on the run responding to what i'm doing it's the devil it's not god you know why because you're not the devil's punching bag hello somebody i know you may feel that way i'm just beat up so much let me say this to you your heavenly father wouldn't allow his how would you allow your child to be bullied by a bully would you let your child just be the punching bag for the street uh neighborhood bully would you allow your child to be defiled by someone else no you wouldn't do that you're a heavenly father how much more god who can say i'm not gonna allow my children to become a a punching bag for the devil i'm not gonna allow my children to be picked on or pushed around i'm their shepherd the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he watches over me he takes care of me he controls everything that happens in my life everything jesus even the bible speaks of jesus being led into the wilderness you know and here's the devil here comes satan to tempt him the bible says he was led by the spirit into the wilderness satan didn't lead him there the spirit led him there are you with me here this morning think of job brother adam says god can't he says he says even satan had to get permission from god before he could touch a hair on the head of job amen he couldn't kill him couldn't hurt him even the messenger that paul uh receives the bible says a messenger there was given unto me by god a messenger of satan so god allowed it in his life god allows everything that happens to us he signs off signs off brother adam speaks about job and he says god's god's seen every single bit of it satan couldn't touch a hair on his on his head you know who removed the hedge god removed the hedge not satan god had hedged him remember satan says you've put a hedge around him you know what that means satan was revealing something to you here in 2020 god puts a hedge around you and no devil can take that hedge away unless god says to take it away and you say well then why would god because here's here's the difference god knows what god knows what he put inside of you and he's your heavenly father can you say amen this morning what is trust trust says every step that i take is ordered of the lord even my last one every step i take is ordered of the lord my moment of life my moment of suffering if he permits suffering if it permits trial if he permits loss if he permits sorrow if he permits or whatever it is in my life god orders my steps whether i'm standing whether i'm lying whether i'm up whether i'm down you need to get this fixed in your mind i am the apple of his eye you are the apple of his eye you know what that means that means you're you know what the apple of the eye is it's the iris you know when god calls israel and he says they're the apple of my eye he's not speaking of an apple that you eat some people look at that and go oh i'm the apple of his eye i don't know what that means but it sounds good well i'll tell you what it means the apple is the iris go look in the in a mirror you'll see that apple and god says this about you you're the apple of my eye you know what that means watch what happens when you touch someone's iris you know what happens there's a knee-jerk reaction your entire body convulsing this is what god is saying you must this is what he said about israel you mess with israel you touch the apple of my eye you mess with my family you're touching the apple of my eye you're going to get a response from the angelic host of heaven you're not on your own my brother my sister we're not fighting these battles by ourselves this isn't god just casting us out as children but god says i'm going to be their shepherd i'm going to lead them i'm going to guide them all i'll lead them beside the still water i'll lead them into greed pastures yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i'll fear no evil because why there's a shepherd there and i trust in that shepherd a a perfect heart this is this is this is a word that we know so well a perfect heart and i'm going to read you a scripture in psalms 34. notice this psalms 34 verse 18 the lord is nigh unto them this is means close he's closed unto them that are of a broken heart so we have a perfect heart that trusts a perfect heart that can be searched and then we have a broken heart and god says something about this heart the condition he says the lord is close he's nigh his spirit his comfort his presence his person god says i'm nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and saveth such as be of a contrite you might wonder what that word contrite means it means crushed those he says i'm close to those of a broken heart and save as such as be of a crushed spirit contrite spirit so brokenness you say brother man what is the lord close to brokenness that's my weeping that's my crime that's not really what brokenness is that's my weeping that's my crying that's the beginning of being broken but that's not brokenness are you here this morning the lord is close to a broken heart but let me say broken is more than sadness it's more than blues it's more than sorrow it's more than tears it's more than being crushed in humility and you're just crushed uh and you say brother man is that weeping yeah weeping is a person who's broken you could say is a a person who's weeping is broken-hearted and we groan before the lord and many of us here today we groan before the lord we we cry we sigh the bible speaks of that and don't never lose that because that's part of that's part of of who you are you're a child that's why the bible says we cry abba father do you murmur no there's a big difference between murmuring and complaining and crying and sighing and we cry and we sigh we weep and we groan and we're broken and spirit we're broken in our in our whatever the situation is we're broken and then god says god says here in psalms 51 verse 17 he says the sacrifices of god very familiar he says the sacrifices of god you have that psalms 51 verse 17 the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and contrite heart o god thou will not despise a broken and contrite heart psalms 51 thou will not despise and you know who god relates this to god associates brokenness to a story in the bible you know very well and that story is the story of nehemiah and the broken walls of jerusalem this is what is being referenced here because the walls were torn down the walls were broken the walls were shattered were tattered there was nothing left and so he says this is this is this is what it means brokenness is walls that are broke down ruin that's laying in our lives ruin and and he says the sacrifices have got a broken spirit a broken contrite heart and he says notice that what the very next word uh verses in verse 18 do good in thy good pleasure unto zion build thou the walls of jerusalem amen so you see the connection with brokenness and the walls of jerusalem and he says build thou the walls that are broken and contract he says brother a a a a the sacrifice of god or a broken spirit broken and conquer heart of god that will not despise so do good and thy good pleasure unto zion build thou the walls of jerusalem build thou the walls of jerusalem you know your mind immediately when you read that goes to a man who was broken a man who the bible says was weeping nehemiah was weeping over what he's seen after he surveyed jerusalem and the scripture says nehemiah he says in nehemiah chapter 2 verse 12. he says and i arose it in the night and i and some few men with me neither told i any man what my god had put in my heart to do it jerusalem neither was there any beast with me save the beast i rode upon then went eye up in the night by the brook and viewed the wall and turned back and entered by the gate of the valley and so returned so nehemiah goes on this journey and he views the wall what what what was a wall if you use the condition of jerusalem we don't want to take the time you know the you know the history here of the babylonian captivity and that their their jerusalem is now ransacked and is destroyed and nehemiah comes back and he gets permission and he's viewing the walls and he sees this broken down city he says in the dark of the night he viewed the walls this is the word shabar it's the same exact word in psalms 51 verse 17 for broken heart and so nehemiah's heart is broken it's a broken heart it's a brokenness a heart that's broken before the lord and the bible says he sat down and he wept and he mourned certain days and fasted this is verse 4 of nehemiah 1. he sat down and wept and mourned certain days and fasted and prayed before the god of heaven let me say there it is brother matt there it is nehemiah is broken that's a broken heart that's brokenness he's weeping he's crying he's he's in distress but let me just let me stop you here and make you realize this was not a broken heart this was the beginning of brokenness because brokenness doesn't doesn't end with crying it doesn't end with weeping it starts with weeping it starts with crying are you here it starts with morning it starts and he sees all the ruin he says all of the waste and he sees all of the destruction and let me just say this he could have nehemiah could have stayed in shushan and the king's palace and he and he could have had went back home and just weeped and he could have cried and went next month and oh i just got the blues and all i'm i'm just i'm just mourning over all the brokenness that i've seen and i i'm just so what's wrong with me am i oh i'm just so sad i'm i'm so torn up over what took place i'm so messed up over what's happening oh you don't know what i'm going through you don't know what's happening to me what are you doing i'm fasting uh uh you know i'm i'm i'm i'm i just i can't believe what what what's happened but let me tell you something friends that would have never led to restoration if all he could do is sit and cry and mourn and be sad over but that sadness that weeping that mourning was leading him to action to say let's rebuild what's been broken because true brokenness leads you to restoration it leads you to say i'm mourning i'm crying i'm broken but i'm going to have faith that god can do something about it that all the ruin that i see i'm going to set my heart to do something about it the bible says in nehemiah chapter 2 verse 10 there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of israel nehemiah says i told no one what my god had put in my heart to do at jerusalem so he goes outside and he's viewing all of this ruin he's viewing all the the hebrew word for uh meaning is his heart was breaking it was breaking it it broke first with anguish and sadness and sorrow and then his heart breaks towards hope to rebuild this is this is what it means to have a truly broken you say i'm signed and crying for the morning for the sins done in jerusalem done in my city what is true brokenness a true brokenness is is is one that sees the ruin and the destruction and the and the and the and the the calamity that satan has brought to god's family and so we grieve over the reproach that's been brought to the lord's name but we don't stop there we look down and say lord i'm going to do something about it i'm not just going to sit and be broken over i'm going to take action i'm going to pick up a hammer and i'm going to start rebuilding i'm going to pick up a brick i'm not just going to stay crying i'm broken so i'm going to do something about it i'm going to pick up a brick i'm going to pick up a hammer i'm going to pick up a shovel a pickaxe whatever it is and i'm going to take action to rebuild what's been ruined in my life i'm going to take action to repair the breach whatever area of my life has been broken down i want to repair it lord can you say that here today i want to repair it lord uh i i want the my brokenness to lead yes it leads through sadness through sorrow but let it spring forth into a confidence to say i can the lord is my helper and i can rebuild whatever's been broken the lord is my the lord is my shepherd the lord is my reward the lord is my victory the lord is my father and i can rebuild whatever satan has broken here with help with strength from the lord i can do all things through christ who gives me strength the lord is my shepherd i shall not want david says in psalms 23 he says the lord is my shepherd now notice this psalm here if you want to put it on the screen this is a psalm that david writes not not as a not as a shepherd he doesn't write this as a shepherd this is david is a king and so david's looking back in his life you know god is going god you very carefully you'll notice in the bible god very carefully he doesn't use every vocation of man he doesn't use every trade he doesn't speak of he doesn't attribute himself to everything in the earth but there's certain things that god uses uh and and and he uses to relate his relationship creator to creation you remember he uses a potter and he says and he uses a potter as an example and ken of ken that paul says can the thing form say the thing that forms it god uses a carpenter what's he doing he's using it's it's he he says this in he says the hand of the lord was upon elijah that doesn't literally mean that god's hand was upon elijah but it was speaking of something it was meaning something that his his spirit his presence was heavy upon elijah and so the lord is using this example and david says the lord is my shepherd he's going to use a a shepherd and he and he begins to recall no doubt david's recalling in his mind his days as a shepherd over sheep i love this so much this what this i'm going to read you i wish i had it to put on the screen that don't but i'm going to read it here from charles spurgeon about psalms 23 because psalms 23 so many times has been used for funerals it's been sometimes as the last dying breath the last things that someone says before they die i don't think david had any idea when he wrote psalms 23 how profound it would become in time in history the lord is my shepherd i shall not want psalms 23 verse 1 the lord is my shepherd i shall not want i shall not need spurgeon says this psalm has charmed more griefs to rest than all the philosophy of the world it is remanded to their dungeon more felon thoughts more black doubts more thieving sorrows than there are sands on the seashore it is comforted the noble host of the poor it has sung courage to the army of the disappointed it is poor bomb and consolation into the heart of the sick of captives in dungeons of widows and their pinching griefs of orphans in their loneliness dying soldiers have died easier as it was read to them ghastly hospitals have been illuminated it has visited the prisoner and broken his chains and like peter's angel led him forth in imagination and sung him back to his home again it has made the dying christian slave freer than his master and consoled those whom dying he left behind mourning not so much that he was gone is because they were left behind and could not go to so millions of people have memorized this psalm even some people who don't even know the bible at all never been in church can quote psalms 23. of your very ministers have used it to confront people you're going through severe trial or even death or suffering or illness and so david writes this without any idea the the impact it would have upon the world the lord is my shepherd i shall not want this is this is all throughout the bible he's called this shepherd in genesis chapter 49 verse the bible says i'm just going to read it to you here if you get it good if not it's fine it says the lord is the shepherd the stone the lord is my the lord is the shepherd the stone of israel so long before david attributes him as this shepherd genesis you find it all the way at the beginning of the bible in psalms david says in psalms 28 verse 9 he speaks of of the lord as his shepherd i want you to turn to john chapter 10 just very quickly if you could we're going to close here i'm not going to be much longer i know it's already 12 45 here so give me about 10 more minutes john chapter 10 verily verily i say unto you he that entereth not by the door and to the sheepfold verily i said he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climath up some other way the same is a thief and a robber but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep and so here's jesus now related himself beyond david who would say he's my shepherd i could have read you 30 more scriptures of god being referenced as shepherd but now we come to jesus himself and he says he that entereth through the window or some other way that's the thief that's the robber who's he identifying the enemy he's identifying the devil but with the devil there's also a god with a thief and a robber there's also a shepherd with the thief who comes to steal kill and destroy there also came a protector a shepherd who would watch over his family notice jesus says that the one who entereth by the door is the shepherd of the sheep to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out so jesus now relates even himself this is amazing here david knows this the lord is my shepherd and so so let me let me just read you some notes here from spurgeon he says a sheep is an object of property not a wild animal its owner sets great store by it and frequently it is bought with a great price it is well to know as certainly as david did that we belonged to the lord amen you'll never understand the lord is your shepherd until you understand i am his sheep until we realize that we've been purchased we've been bought and we're sheep we all like sheep have gone astray so god says he that jesus says he that entereth by the door is the shepherd the thief comes the robber comes he climbs up some other way but heated under by the door is the shepherd of the sheep verse 4 and when he put forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice and a stranger they will not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of the stranger and so jesus says there's a there's a a a the thief cometh uh verse 10. let me back up here verse verse 8. verse 7 back up one more he says then said jesus unto them verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheep you know brother branham says he struggled over this and didn't understand what did that mean i am the door i am the door of the sheep and the prophet says i always struggled trying to understand you know david refers to refers to god as king many more times than he does shepherd it refers to god as king he refers to god as ruler he refers to god as lord and brother adam says i didn't understand this what does it mean shepherd what does it mean he's the door and he says i always struggle with that till i went over in the east and he says and i seen how that the shepherds over there he says when they would when they would take all of the sheep into the pen and he says the shepherd would then lay down where the two walls of the pen met there was no door he said the shepherd literally would lay his body down there and he was the door and brother branham says then i understood when jesus when he says i am the door of the sheep what's he saying you're not going to get to my sheep unless you come through me first you ought to rejoice in that my brother my sister you're not going to get to my children unless you come through me first i'm not going to send a prophet i'm not going to send an angel i'm not going to send a bible verse i'm coming myself to protect my children and not the devil can't get to your children your sons your daughters your family your mind unless he first comes through the lord because i am the good shepherd and he says and i lay my life down notice what he says here in verse 8 and he says all verse 8 all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them verse 9 i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture he's referencing here's david and david says the lord is my shepherd i shall not want to turn that psalm 23 says i shall not want that means that means all my needs are supplied by the shepherd a sheep all of their needs are supplied by the shepherd he'll he makes me to lie dale notice this the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me he maketh me to lie down you know we don't sometimes know when to lie down so god says i'm going to make you lie down sometimes god does that very physically and sometimes he has to cut us down to make us lie down because sometimes we can get so go go go go go go and god says hold on a minute little sheep hold on before you get going and you think you're in control of your life i'm the shepherd and it grabs that sheep by front and back legs and puts them down this is what david says the relationship he had with the lord he says the lord he maketh me to lie down so david god says david david says god knows exactly when i need rest he knows exactly what i need to lay down and he says here to lie down notice he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he leadeth me into green pastures i didn't lead me into green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters you know you don't know how to lead yourself to still waters and any time we try to lead ourselves to green pastures and still waters we go to we go to the wrong thing we end up in the bushes we end up in the thorns in the briar patch of hollywood so we say i need rest so i'm going to go and find green pastures and we look to money we look to success we look to disney world hello somebody and we we try to get rest we try to get vacation we try to get uh we try to lead ourselves but god david says but the lord leads me to green pastures he leads me beside still waters because a sheep has to have still waters it's it's nose and mouth are so close together that if it was to have rushing water it could drown itself so god says i'm going to lead it a shepherd leads it beside the still waters uh he says he restores my soul leads me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake so this is the tender care this is the loving care of the shepherd he says he restores my soul this is this is uh david's soul is being restored how by leading me to green pastures by leading me besides still waters by leading me to start up food by leading me to mata to pastures green pastures that have life in them by feeding me the right things and not the wrong things because when you feed on what god gives you it restores your soul when you feed on the word its purpose is to restore your soul it says you restore my soul it could also mean that hebrew word means reas can mean bring me to repentance that's what it could also mean he restoreth my purity he restoreth my my david says that in psalms 51 created me a clean heart uh and and cast me not away from that presence restore unto me the joy of my salvation so he says he restores my soul he cleans me he washes me because i need wash there's a sheep i need washed as a sheep i become dirty as a sheep i can become stinky the world can get its stench on me so he cleans me he washes me he restores my thank soul he leads me i love that for the the the he restores my soul he leadeth me what a what a what a picture of what brother adam says he says the bible says it's not of the man to lead himself and brother brandon preaches the message called a guide and he says you don't know how to lead yourself you've got to have a god you've got to have a leader and david says he leads me he's a shepherd who guides me i don't know how to get to green pastures in my life i don't know how to find the still waters but here's what i know here's all i need all i need is is a shepherd because a shepherd will lead me to the right water a shepherd will lead me to the right place a shepherd will lead me to a secret place a shepherd will lead me to good food to good things i only lead myself to chaos i only need myself to wreck i only lead myself to the briar patch but he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake for his name's sake clark says to display the glory of his grace this is why god leads you to display the glory of his grace and not on account of any merit in me god's motive of conduct towards the children of men are derived from the perfections and goodness of his own nature david says yeah though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death verse 4 yea though i walk through the shadow through the valley of the shadow of death so what's david saying here it's a it's a now that the picture has changed from green pastures and still waters now there's the shadow of death and he says though he lead me through that valley though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they do comfort me let's keep going here verse 5 thou preparest the table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over notice what god is saying here thou david says thou preparest the table before me in the presence of my enemies you're going to set a table you're going to prepare a banquet you're going to put an apron there you're going to put out plates you're going to put out forks you're going to put out drink you're going to put out food and you're going to feed me this is what david's saying amen thou preparest a table before me a spread and then what's god going to do david says then god puts on a waiter's apron and you serve me in the presence of my enemies that would notice my head with oil my cup ran it over do you know this is what david is saying in verse 5 that in the midst of the valley of the shadow of death in the midst of all of my enemies who are those enemies demonic forces he says thou preparest a table you know that if you click on that word if you have the table uh software and you click on that word table you're going to get this word spread spread you know what we know what that means spread now talk about spread and butter and this is what god david said thou preparest a spread i want you to catch this because today it's something important for you as a believer he's not just speaking of just a little portion he's not speaking i'm going to feed you some rations like a soldier who's shaking and and in fear from the enemy and so he takes just a little food with eyes wide open he's watching but david says no in the middle of all of my calamity in the middle of when the devil's attacking my family attacking uh everything around me you're gonna sit me down at a table you're going to put a spread out before me and you're going to whisper in my ear they can't touch you don't worry about anything they can't touch a hair on your head unless i let them touch you they can't bother you they can't destroy you they can't kill you here drink just a little drink right here in the presence of my enemies hallelujah he says you prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies you set down a feast before me oh what a thought here and then god says i'm going to make your enemies stay on the outer fringe i'm going to keep them away i'm going to shield you and i'm also going to make them watch notice david doesn't say you you prepare a table and then you rebuke the enemy and you get them out of there no david says in the presence of my enemies in the same room in the same place in the same house in the same body thou preparest the table before me he says you're you're you're you're you make my enemy watch you make my enemy watch what are they watching they're watching the lord the shepherd feed his sheep they they watch as you fill up as he sustains you as he supplies for you as he encourages you as he washes you as he begins to breathe put faith inside of your your heart as it begins to give strength to your weakness as it begins to give encouragement to your discouragement god begins to as a shepherd feed you what you need say what's the lord doing the lord's feeding me exactly what i need he's giving me the right vitamins he's giving me the right food he's given me the right drink it's giving me exactly what i need luke chapter 12 verse 37 jesus speaks of the same exact thing in luke believe it or not in luke all the way in the new testament verse chapter 12 verse 37 luke 12 37 he says blessed are those servants whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching i want to be watching verily i say unto you that he shall gird himself and make them to sit down to meet which means to eat and will come forth and serve them amen what's god saying that with those that are watching for my appearing those that are watching for my coming verily verily i say unto you i shall serve them in the presence of their enemies in the middle of trouble in the middle of all who are your enemies who is your enemy the devil is not your brother it's not your sister now god may anoint people the satan may anoint someone to bother you but your enemy who david is speaking of is a demonic force he says he says he says thou in the presence of my enemies psalms 18 david speaks of this enemy and he's talking about demon spirits he says he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them which hated me for they were too strong for me he says in psalms 143 verse 9 deliver me o lord from my enemies i flee unto thee to hide me i'm going to close here you've got an enemy and you need to realize that you've got you've got an enemy and it's not any person necessarily you've got an enemy my brother my sister you've you ever felt you ever had someone or maybe maybe you can't relate to this at all but have you ever through your entire life have you ever had anybody who didn't like you and maybe you didn't mind them but they didn't like you that bothers you why don't they like me and so what do you do you do everything you can to make them like you but they don't like you and and and you ever had someone who let me let me go further you have had someone who despises you you ever have someone who hates you think about it right now someone they can't stand me that doesn't make me i don't know about you but i don't like that i'd rather not have any enemies i'd rather not have anybody that hates me and i'd rather believe no one hates me you know why because that's natural but let me snap you out of that here this morning and i need you i need this truth to sink down on your mind there's somebody who hates you and he's the enemy of your soul and he wants to not just hurt you or harm you or bully you he wants to kill you he wants to take your life and you are his prime target you are his adversary he is your adversary he is your accuser and he will attack you mentally he will attack you physically he will attack you spiritually he will attack you emotionally this is your enemy he hates you he wants to destroy you amen he wants to take your life he hates everything about you he hates your anything that you have good he hates it and he wants it and he wants to take it oh david this is what this is what david is meaning here he's saying in this the in this supernatural feast the god in the presence of my enemies the lord is going to serve me on one side here's the devil here's all of his hordes here's all of his demons here's all of his enemies here and and and this is this is exactly why jesus says and he types himself to shepherd and he says behold he'll leave the ninety and nine and go after the one but did you ever catch something he never had to go after the 90-9 he only had to go after one because only one strayed and at the other 99 they were safe from the enemy because they were with the shepherd it was when the sheep decided to leave the fold and become isolated that now god has to go on a rescue mission and go and rescue them you know what your enemy wants to do i'm closing i don't have time to finish let me just stop here and say the devil wants more than anything to isolate you and he will use anything he can to isolate a sheep to get that one separated from the 90-9 because he knows if he can single you out you ever watch predators go after their prey they'll always go to the pack and they'll try to get that one who maybe lags behind as is singled out and then they'll go all their attention will go after him because their safety in the pack there's safety with the shepherd but when we stray away and satan isolates us and satan gets us over to an island all by by ourself isn't it amazing you know we're we're dealing with a virus here today that isolates people it's isolated churches it's isolated families it's isolated people from the from the house of god you think this isn't the do you think this is just the devil attacking the world this is the devil attacking the family of god to isolate you to pull you away i don't know let me just say this don't isolate yourself don't pull away from the pack don't get off over by yourself stay together stay together in unity in harmony stay with the shepherd stay with the shepherd now more than ever before don't get off by yourself why do you think the bible speaks of the last days and says assemble yourselves more as you see the day approaching come together more have confidence in your shepherd he leads me beside the still waters yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow death i will fear no evil for thy rod and thy staff come from become musicians if you could stand to your feet with me clock has expired so we're going to close buy your heads with me play something if you could brother andrew just something lord i've poured my heart out with what you placed upon it means so much to me lord the lord is my shepherd my watcher he takes care of me he feeds me supplies all of my needs i only get in trouble when i leave his sheep i only get in trouble when i leave his fold lord the sheep only gets in trouble when he leaves the fold when he leaves the care and the nurture and the comfort and the safety lord i will never understand as i even read psalms 23 lord it begin to deal with my heart i'll never understand you as shepherd until i understand my place as sheep that i'm needy lord that i'm dependent upon you jesus people read this psalm at the very end of their life the lord is my but in life were you their shepherd you'll never be our shepherd in death if you weren't our shepherd in life people want to live their own life go their own way make their own way and then try to claim oh the lord is my shepherd but lord that that's a that's a that's a relationship that david was speaking of that it wasn't that you come to the end of your life and then suddenly cry out for a shepherd but you've you're you are a sheep and he's your shepherd david said the lord is my shepherd throughout all my life throughout every decision throughout every heartache throughout every trial throughout every sickness every pain the lord has been my shepherd he's he's my strong tower he's my righteousness he's my savior lord we want to have confidence in you this morning as we've preached lord what does it mean for our hearts to be perfect before you it's not outside okay it's not not not outward character or not outward appearance lord it's it's a heart that that's perfect
