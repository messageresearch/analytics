========================================

gracious father we come before you now Lord and we ask that your Holy Spirit would be amongst us this morning Lord that you would take your word and speak it into our hearts Lord we ask you to be Sovereign and in total control of our thoughts and our hearts Lord and just just move in the way that you choose to do so Lord we commit ourselves to you we ask these things in Jesus name amen I want to look at the subject seeking a life of holiness and the first scripture I want to look at is Hebrews 12 verse 14. follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord amen may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word he could be seated follow peace with all men so this is Paul's instruction follow peace with all men now Jesus says similar the blessed are the peacemakers Paul says live at peace with all men in so much as it is possible so right there you see immediately Paul puts a caveat on living at peace there are some people they will not live at peace with you there's no con there's no compromise on their part to live to live in a Peaceable way you know if you read that in uh Rome I forget what chapter of Romans but I think it's Romans 12. Paul says that and then he gives instructions uh if someone does evil to you don't repay evil for good but repay good for evil you know if you have an enemy feed them you know clothe them etc etc this is how we live at peace with all men because those are things that pursue peace like if somebody has a need and you go to meet it you're pursuing you're going after peace you know you could just say follow peace with all men and you'd be a good politician because all you did was compromise on everything you didn't care about what was true what was right you're just seeking after compromise compromise compromise by no means is that what Jesus or Paul are trying to encourage us to follow after and and I love that he puts right there follow peace with all men and Holiness many times uh seeking a life of Holiness is in conflict with being at peace with everyone think about that just in your own family when you're seeking to live a set apart life and the drinks are coming out and the pool parties you're being invited to and these different things you love them you you love your family and then you go to the party and they say oh here why aren't you why aren't your kids going in the pool with everybody why aren't you doing this well peace doesn't pursue with an answer of Truth well we that's that's not something that we engage in what in the world you guys are nuts and so we don't follow peace sacrificing holiness and again it's it's sad where we've come to but in our in our day and age even the word Holiness many times we go we are almost we have a reaction inside of us like oh that's fanaticism and that's crazy and that's the that's the devil that's absolutely the devil Paul says follow peace with all men and Holiness so he's follow peace and Holiness follow so follow what does he mean does it mean that Holiness is going and you're following in one sense sure but actually what that word follow means is to pursue or press towards holiness so this isn't pressing towards self-righteousness it's not pressing towards spiritual Pride it's not pressing towards your achievement to get right with God you know we spoke on I spoke on Wednesday night so much about the sovereignty of God everything that you go through everything God has ordained that there even even the mistakes and the sins that you make God has purposed them for an eternal purpose their mistakes their sins they go against God's word and there's there there are consequences for those things and yet God has ordained those things as such however you can take that and you can go a million miles in the wrong direction brother Jason's encouraging us to sin and do just live any kind of sinful lifestyle and that's a huge mistake that people that believe in predestination have made historically um living Living the Life of Christ I mean that's what it means to be elect means that you have the life of God inside of you quickened by the Holy Ghost so what is going to follow a sinful life is God's sinful no so what's going to follow a life of Holiness be holy for I am Holy and many times we we look at that word and so many thoughts can pop into our head and depending on maybe you were raised in the message maybe you were raised in a church that uh was out of balance was was seeking after self-righteousness was was uh harming people with their with their zeal uh foolish Zeal for God not a Zeal according to knowledge but Azeal in ignorance and and foolishness and perhaps you hear the word Holiness then you shudder in fear like what is he you're telling us to seek a life of Holiness yeah work if you have Christ Living in you you will pursue you will press towards a life of Holiness because there is a life inside of you pressing towards a life of holiness and we don't want to be guilty in our understanding of election and predestination and the sovereignty of God that we're looking at it that it doesn't matter what mistakes that I make it doesn't matter what sins I make now you can you can understand that scripturally because by the blood we've never even sinned in the first place that's what the blood was shed for us to bring us to that condition and yet that doesn't give us a license to sin Paul said shall we sin that Grace May abound God forbid God forbid Grace comes to bring a change to bring a transformation so you know you you take the opposite if you're not seeking a life of holiness then there's a question mark on is the life of God dwelling in you right so if you're if you're just living ungodly sinful you might be really good at hiding it and and concealing it if you're living in that way it's not the life of Christ inside of you and so this is this is critical and important to get these things in Balance because on the one hand you have self-righteousness and achieving your salvation on the other hand you you have the life of God transforming you bringing you to that this is this is what we're talking about when we're talking about seeking a life of holiness also with a remembrance and an understanding of where you came from who you are what you what condition you were born in what you can achieve on your own do you have an understanding do you have a good understanding of what you've achieved on your own Isaiah 64 6 tells us but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousness are as filthy rags and we all do Fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away we are all we are all that's everyone every single one of us are born in this condition and therefore what are we worthy of death and Hell so you and your own self-achievement even religious self-achievement you're impure and you're filthy and you're worthy of death and hell that's the condition that you're born in so it takes God's work in you not your own work not your own achievement you can't take a filthy Rag and wipe something clean with it you just it might look clean you think oh that looks clean it's full of bacteria and viruses and so forth and you're wiping it down and he's man I got such a clean clean house oh I didn't clean it you're going to kill somebody with that that's got a sickness on it and so we we have to guard against that super religious message fig leaf that we can put over ourselves and say hey I got it figured out I'm I'm doing well my life is this my life is that no it's not about you it's about what Christ has done Romans 8 13. for if you live after the flesh you shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall live I love how Paul does this he does this so many different times and you read it and if you just read that out of the entire context of Romans 8 you would have this idea okay if I want to have eternal life I've got to put to death The Works of my body I have to do it well number one is that's not what it says it says through the spirit there is no therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit this is the foundation of Romans 8 13. you're not living your own life you don't live by the faith of Jason Demars you live by the faith of the son of God right so then that life his life is inside of you so what's taking what's then taking place is the spirit inside of you is putting to death mortify means to kill to kill or to become dead or put to death so you're putting to death the Deeds of the body and in other words what is he saying if you're elect if you have the holy spirit inside of you the holy spirit is doing a work in you to put to death The Works of the body again this is perfect scriptural balance the perfect balance because you can say well I have the spirit I believe well the Devils believe also and tremble and tremble many of us don't even tremble sad sad to say we're so lackadaisical with our understanding of God's grace and mercy we have no understanding of his his judgment and his Wrath so that's the question that's the question you say I'm elect is the holy spirit working in me to kill The Works of the flesh the Deeds of the body okay if the holy spirit is doing that work in you you'll live but if that's not what's happening you're living your if your life can be described as a life In the Flesh you're dead you're dead while you're living Colossians 1 3 1-5 Colossians 3 1-5 if ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above right so this is this is the CR this is to the Christian if if Paul puts it as if again why did you put it as if because it's it's continually bringing that scriptural balance is if you say you have faith you profess Faith okay if you're risen with Christ then seek those things that are above where Christ sits on the right hand of God verse 2 set your affections on things above not on things on the earth when we're talking about seeking a life of Holiness it has to go into this level what is your affection or desire let's talk about it in that sense what is your desire your the Holy Spirit brings a nature change right so then what then that change when the nature changes the desire and the affection changes so what do you Delight in what what are you what is if someone saw your life they didn't know you from anything and they started examining what's happening what would they say his affections are on things above or his affections are on things on the earth his desire and his passion is here on Earth or is it on Christ is in is it in the place where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God all right four again Paul is so good for these types of types of words verse three four you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God if you're if you're a real Christian baptized in the Holy Spirit then you're dead and your life is hid with Christ and God and these other things follow your affections are on things above you're seeking the things where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God verse 4 when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory amen this is a promise if you're in Christ you will appear with him in glory mortify therefore your members which are upon the Earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscience covetousness which is idolatry mortify in this version of the Greek word means to deaden or to subdue so a Christian is in the process as long as you're here on the Earth you're in the process whether you're young middle-aged or old you're in the process of putting to death your flesh your members which are upon the earth that is what Christians do look at it look at it that way that is what Christians do they seek pursue they press towards that life of holiness in the sermon 1961 perfect strength by Perfect weakness brother Branham says every person that professes to be a Christian will forget his own ability and yield himself to God then God can achieve his purpose by sending not a Revival but brother what he needs to do first is send a killing that's right so we can revive you have to die before you're born again and you have to he needs this a killing of ourselves this Tabernacle needs a killing and me with it all of us we need a killing so that we can be revived in a new life a new hold a New Hope a new experience we need first a day of mourning morning like sorrow we need a place of yielding to the spirit instead of so much depending upon schooling and Upon Our programs and our campaigns and all that we have we rely upon cooperation with so many different ministers to cooperate if we can't get so many why we won't do it we won't go to the cities without that and then when we do that we're making it in a great big machine that's got a carbon knock in it we've got to get away from that that human ability we got to get to a place where we can surrender our souls and lives even to the housewife to the farmer to the mechanic or whoever you are we got to surrender completely to God and know that we are nothing then let God start from there then he starts moving working and that includes all of us everyone amen do you ever find yourself in a place where you feel like uh your your faith is weak and and you're not on fire for God and you wonder what happened brother Branham just gave you the formula of where to start and then where to go to where do we start you've got to die to yourself and then you've got to surrender everything to the Lord completely to him and know that you are nothing then let God start from there it's like a clean slate okay all of this has happened in my Christian Life up to this point so what all my righteousness is as filthy rags Lord I'm nothing I'm I'm laying aside my thoughts my desires and everything that's where God starts to move from and when we say God knows if we've laid aside everything and put everything in front of him and said Lord everything's on the table whatever you whatever you need to correct me on whatever you need to deal with me on it's not as though we say deal with me on everything but my video games are uh over outside of that my my TV never mind what I watch on the TV that's up to me and this and no we just say Lord everything it's on the table if something's coming between me and you let me not be attached to that at all and just let go of that and give it to the Lord that's what I'm talking about when we're talking about a start many times we've you've heard it preached over and over again that the devil will corrupt you little by little he doesn't offer you uh a filthy movie to start with when you're what when you're walking closely with Christ and you're surrendered to him because he knows you'll just be repelled so he offers you a little thing it's oh it's it's not too bad that show's not too bad that's that movie's not so bad and step by step you're Galloping down poison little by little and that's the danger and so that's that's what we're talking about here let's get to a place where we surrender all of our lives to him and sometimes we have to re-surrender daily we got to re-surrender all that we are to him and know that we're nothing and then let God start from there First Peter 1 15. but as he which called you hath called you is Holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation speaking of your conduct God is Holy we never really Define this to start up and I was purposeful what does it mean to be holy ultimately mean it means to be set aside we understand though it carries even more than that means cleansed and set aside for God's service apart sacred these are some of the different things is you're you could switch it around and say you're not normal you're you're different that's what we're called we're not called to be normal we're not called to be like everybody else we're called to be like God be holy for I am Holy right that's the next verse verse 16. God is Holy so we should be holy why why is that God is different than us right sure you're called to be imitators of God you're you're called to be the expression of His Image if God is Holy you're his image what is his image going to be holy set apart for him not a set apart for partially for God partially for my own purposes partially for the devil no completely set apart for God completely laid us aside for him this doesn't give us room to justify ourselves in our own sight we we can come up with very the devil speaking to us can come up with elaborate logical reasonings to approve ourselves in our own eyes that's not what we're talking about we're called over and over again it says called to be Saints what does saint mean what does saint mean anybody sanctified a holy one that's what it's called to be called to be holy ones or Sanctified ones holy ones holy and sanctify is the same word same root word one just speaks of a person one speaks of a thing you're a Holy One so this should lead us to a life of self-examination Before the Throne of God then when it leads us to that kind of life we're talking about a life of Holiness we're not talking about religious Works religious Behavior you guys can can look the part of the message you all know what to do and what not to do you all know how to put push the envelope a little bit we're not we're not stupid we're not dummies we know we know and that that's looking at life through the lens of what do other people think what what is so-and-so going to think what is so-and-so going to think I can't do this because of this this and this that's not what we live our lives for we live our lives to be pleasing to the Lord and that starts with a life we don't you're not justifying yourself in your own eyes and for sure not trying to justify yourself to everybody else and we live that life of self-examination Before the Throne of God which then leads us to live a life of humility and Brokenness before the Lord that that that is that uh Earnest desire and Earnest passion that we're seeking god with I believe every Christian should have an earnest passion and desire that they're seeking after God not just well we go to church we do this I do my devotions check it off the list I got my checklist and I finished the checklist no it's a love affair with Christ and it's a passion that you have for Christ and this passion is birth in I want to be like him I want to live like him I don't care what other people are doing around me I'm seeking and following after him and I'm you know that right there will humble us because we know we can achieve it on our own we can't follow that in our own efforts it's a life that follows hard after the word and a life that is pursuing Lord cleanse me from all worldliness ungodliness and anything contrary to the word take that out of me it's not trying to live I'm trying to live up to an image so everybody thinks I'm okay and I'm a good guy it can easily become that and it does world over in churches that's not what we need to be about it needs to be a personal walk with him that bursts itself in a humility and an Earnest passion and desire for more of him and living more like him not just talking about that not just living that Lord give us that passion and that fire because it has to come from him I'm not telling you this so you go out and achieve it you can't you can ask the Lord that's what I'm telling you to do ask the Lord to give you that heart if your desires aren't right if your passion isn't right say Lord my desire My Passion my Pursuits are not right correct me cleanse me make my desires right make my passions right make my burdens right and he'll do it that's what this is about recognize don't be afraid to recognize your own weakness Don't Be Afraid Don't Be Afraid don't be so proud of yourself that you have to put an image I'm strong I'm this I'm super me I'm the super messaging believer come on man God sees right through all that God is looking directly to your heart don't see don't say how close can I skirt it to the world how close can I get to the heart of the father what can I allow myself to do and still be considered a good message believer come on don't train your kids to think like that and if you're thinking like that repent at the altar don't leave the service today without coming to the Altar and getting on your knees and repenting it's not about appearances it's about your heart being connected to the father amen let's stand and pray Heavenly Father we just come before you now Lord and that we ask a cleansing and as the prophet said a killing a dying to ourselves Lord may we come and we start and know that we are nothing and that our on our own self not only can we achieve nothing Lord but we achieve the op the opposite of goodness and righteousness Lord we need we need you we need you to cleanse and move and our in our desires and change our desires and passions and fill us with your Holy Spirit Lord that we would be seeking the things which are above where Christ sits on your right hand Lord ask your blessing upon the service upon the the worship the preaching oh you'd be with us in all these things and move in a mighty way we ask these things in Jesus name amen God bless you
