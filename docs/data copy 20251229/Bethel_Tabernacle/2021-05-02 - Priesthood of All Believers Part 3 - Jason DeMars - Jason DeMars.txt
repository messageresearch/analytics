========================================

good morning everyone god bless you let's stand heavenly father we just come to you and we ask that your holy spirit would come and be the teacher in our hearts today lord just pour your spirit out upon us and teach us of thy word and draw us closer to you we ask you jesus we're going to continue on part 3 of the priesthood of all believers and i'm going to start with the scripture first peter 2 verse 5. he also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ amen and then verse nine but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation of peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who have called you out of darkness into his marvelous light lord finishing up this series on the priesthood of all believers i want to answer the question why we are all priests and then secondly what are we to accomplish as priests amen so obviously it's clear from the scriptures we've just read it's there's not a there's not a holy priesthood order and then a lay of people order we're all spiritual priests amen we're all called to opera spiritual sacrifices we're all called to be in the priestly order so why are we priests under the new covenant number one the blood of christ was shed once for all we don't we don't have any need of a continual sacrifice over and over again every year throughout the year anytime we sin we don't have any need for that continual sacrifice that's all been finished and accomplished by jesus christ two under the new covenant it's not an outward teacher under the old covenant we have the two distinctions on the old covenant there's an outer teacher an outer mediatorship an outer intercessor saying know the lord under the new covenant there's an inside teacher amen that comes inside of you that teaches you personally to know the lord apart from any uh amen amen we'll talk more about that in detail in a moment three we are all called to ministry the priesthood is a ministry yeah so we're all called to ministry through the spirit dwelling within us four the true church is an invisible mystical body of christ we'll talk about that later there's a visible church amen us gathering here in this place is a visible church to other people around the world there's a catholic church a baptist church a methodist church a pentecostal church that's a visible church but that's not the same thing as the true church the true church is invisible it's mystical why because it's only made up of those who are filled with the spirit who are part of the body of christ amen number five is we are all equal in christ so let's get looking at us we've already covered the blood of christ was shed once for all in that aspect of the priesthood so let's look at jeremiah 31 31-34 we're gonna have to you're gonna have to go old school we don't have the scriptures up yet just had some technical difficulties this morning so jeremiah 31 verse 31 behold the days come saith the lord that i will make a new covenant in the house of israel and the house of judah not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers and the day that i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt which my covenant they break although i was a husband unto them save the lord but this shall be the covenant i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their god and they shall be my people and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the lord for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the lord for i will forgive their iniquity and i will remember their sin no more of course we remember we understand through reading the book of hebrews that in hebrews we see that if there's a new covenant there's a new priesthood there's a new sacrifice for sin and that high priest is jesus christ and we have one mediator between us and god and that's jesus christ all right amen but there's something else different going on here there is now an inward work they shall teach no more every man his neighbor now this is not meaning that there's not an office of teacher pastor prophet et cetera that is necessary however that isn't the primary means of god getting to you under the new covenant that is no longer the primary means under the old covenant that was the only means the bible said they told they were told you circumcise your heart someone came read the bible to them they listened to it they became convicted under the new covenant it's different it's diff it's completely different now god himself is coming to you and teaching you let's break that down for a second what does that mean revelation what is the foundation that the church is built upon revelation what is the church and expression of the new covenant so put those two things together the teacher now is inward he says i'll send the spirit of truth who will lead you into all truth brother branham picks that scripture out and says you see that's the evidence of the holy spirit receiving the word for your day right so what is the evidence of being a partaker of the new covenant god is writing his word in your heart not just the word for another age but the word for today that portion of the word which is allotted for today which is the full word the full restoration of the word so he's taking his by the spirit and writing that word in our hearts is there teachers yeah i'd be out of a job if we took this scripture incorrectly right and and if if we took it if that's what it meant there's no more teachers then we all just sit down we don't we don't have a five-fold ministry we don't even play tapes right so we don't we wouldn't do any of that those things so the reality is yes there is teachers there is a there is a ministry but we are all part of it it's one body and all gifts differ again we i've said this before and we all do this and it's not necessarily completely wrong but we talk about the ministry and the lay people however however we are all called to ministry we've talked about that in ephesians 4 ministry for the equipping of the saints for the work of the ministry that's the job of the preachers is to equip or dress the saints for what the work of the ministry so all saints are called to be ministers of jesus christ all right so i'm skipping around here but every man we won't we have an inner teacher under the new covenant god himself is to come and teach us personally he's writing the word directly in our hearts not not through mediators not through a holy priesthood but in your soul directly personally if you don't have that the spirit of god dwelling in your soul writing the word right there then you're not a part of the new covenant you have to have the inward teacher something that god is doing personally directly in your heart it's not enough to send sit under a good minister you're under the old covenant still you've got to come under the new covenant so that god himself in the secret place is writing the word in your heart amen that's why it's not enough to have a relationship with a church or a pastor they had that under the old covenant and we found what what what did we find under the old covenant that wasn't good enough the old covenant proved we were sinners that we were all sold out completely under sin so it's not going to be good enough just to have an outward person standing behind a pulpit teaching you the word of god that's not going to be effective under the new covenant the new covenant is god himself comes down from heaven takes a portion of himself enters into the soul of man takes over the control tower and begins to write that word in your heart personally otherwise you're dead i'm dead apart from that you say i go to brother donnie's church i go to brother i listen to brother donnie every week i listen to brother paul lafontaine every week sorry that doesn't that's not going to get it done now of course these brothers are point pointing you to the baptism of the holy ghost but it isn't just enough to look at the sign you've got to go to the destination you have to have the holy spirit yourself that's leading you teaching you guiding you correcting you not just someone going to someone else and say hey what should i do about this situation oh do this and this and this no you have to have something on the inside i'm not speaking against getting getting people's opinions and thoughts but that's what it is opinions and thoughts we are we need to have the mind of christ and be personally led by him first corinthians 12 7 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all the word profit with all it simply means the common good or the common benefit so think about this the manifestation of the spirit is given to every single person every member of the body of christ to do what for the common benefit of everyone in other words it's not just for your benefit you've been given the spirit of god to benefit other people and he wants to manifest himself through your life and the gift that he's placed in your life for his glory now again we understand gifts can get the gifts of the spirit when we're talking about the nine gifts of the spirit you can operate one one time and then never operate it again in your life then you might operate another one goes that's not the same that's not a uh the gift when i first ran into missions work that was one thing misunderstanding now what give what of the which one of the nine gifts of he uh do you have do you have the gift of healing do you have the gift of this i said i have access to the spirit of god which means i have access to every gift whenever he wants to operate them the way he desires to he can amen and each of us each of us it's the same that's not just for the preacher the missionary that's for every single believer man woman young person that has been filled with the spirit of god now if you haven't been filled with the spirit of god then you're not subject to the gifts of the spirit then you don't have the manifestation of the spirit in your life so get it get that inside teacher then you'll have the manifestation of the spirit for for the common good so again it's a spiritual priesthood ministry to represent god before a dying world amen that's the reality of what we are called to so let's look at this ministry brother branham speaks of this ministry of worship to god this is from the ephesian church age in the church ages book paul saw it coming but he warned them about this subtle priesthood that would come and take over with false doctrines he knew they would implement a way of worship that excluded the people from any part in a holy spirit ministry wow and even right today among those who claim to be free and full of the spirit there is not too much freedom in the laity and the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flock just sits there and tries to absorb that does that that hits home a little bit right there this is a far cry from paul who said that when all came together all had the leading of the spirit and all participated in spiritual worship i want you to look at that all participated in spiritual worship as the spirit gave utterance and the church corporate has never learned this lesson from the scripture nor from history every time god gives a visitation of the holy spirit and people get free after a while they bind themselves right back to the very thing they came out of when luther came out of catholicism the people stayed free for a while but when he died the people simply organized what they thought he believed and set up their own creeds and ideas and repudiated anyone who said opposite to what they said they went right back to catholicism with a little different form and right today many lutherans are ready to go all the way back oh yes in revelation 17 that old had many daughters these daughters are just like mother they set the word aside deny the work of the spirit of god subjugate the laity and make it possible for the laity to worship god make it impossible for the laity to worship god unless they come through them or through their pattern which is nothing but a blueprint of unbelief from satan himself i want to go back to that quote it just really struck me that portion of the quote he knew that they would implement a way of worship that excluded the people from any part in a holy spirit ministry and even right today among those who claim to be free and full of the spirit there is not too much freedom in the laity and the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flock just sits there and tries to absorb it this is a far cry from paul who said that when all came together all had the leading of the spirit and all participated in spiritual worship when we come together what is our expectation what is in our heart is our expectation that we just bought tickets to the football game only this is a sanctified version we're coming to be see what happens instead of participate in the spirit there's a big difference there's a big difference we're not called to be spectators on a seat we're called to operate in the spirit of god but we come expecting what to sit not to not we're not even listening for god to guide us we're not even asking lead us and direct me give me a word that would be an encouragement that doesn't mean you have to come up and say it here it might be you say it afterwards but don't come to church as a spectator this isn't a sanctified version of a basketball game you are to participate and be a part of this why because the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man and that means mankind not just males every man to profit with all it's for the common good we would see jesus brother branham 1958 says then the church is in this building the church is not a building anyhow it's a people a called out the word church means called out and so we are the people of god by the grace of god the called out tonight that's assembled ourselves together in this place in five definite identifications of the true church of the living god in 1960 he says the messianic empire therefore the church is not an organization the church is not a gathering of people the church is the people of god that's been called out of the world to serve in another kingdom amen to serve in another kingdom in the pergamon church age brother branham says you will recall that i brought out in the ephesian age that the word nicolaitan comes from the two greek words nikao which means to conquer and lao which means the laity nicolaitan means to conquer the laity now why is this such a terrible thing it is terrible because god has never placed his church in the hands of an elected leadership which moves with political mindedness amen he has placed his church in the care of god ordained spirit-filled word living men who lead the people through feeding them the word did you did you hear that how are we to lead the p how is the the preachers of the word to lead the people by force by manipulation by saying uh brother mark you can't go on vacation unless you ask me okay we laugh but that's a reality in so-called message churches but they're not message churches they're they're they're from another direction so how are we to lead the people through feeding them the word he's not separated the people into classes so that the masses are led by a holy priesthood that that's something we got to be careful about because that's the com that is the comfort of people we want to merely be led by some people that we can put confidence in that is not the new covenant that is not the gospel of christ that's organization that's the great and it's a spirit and even if you're not formally a denomination you can be under that same kind of spirit and that's why you see this nicolaitanism and it's it's frankly in in a way it's quite rampant around the message movement i i don't like saying the around the message because the message is jesus christ but around the message the people that have congregated around this message but yet have not learned it yet let's put it that way he's not separated the people into classes so that the masses are led by a holy priesthood it is true that the leadership must be holy but then so must be the whole congregation further there's no place in the word where priests or ministers or such mediate between god and the people nor is there a place where they are separated in their worship of the lord god wants all to love and serve him together nicolaitanism destroys those precepts and instead separates the ministers from the people and makes the leaders overlords instead of servants now this doctrine actually started as a deed in the first age we understand that is the white horse rider that's how it started in the beginning and this is such this is a danger for every believer that they they take the leadership that they should have from the holy spirit and place it on to someone else god uses people right he uses people he uses gifts of the spirit in my in my personal calling the lord used three different people in three different ways to speak to me about leaving my job and going into missions full-time but they didn't even know what they were doing they had no clue they were just being obedient to the lord and it was god's personal leadership to me and god can use and one of them was a minister and the other two were not our preacher i should say they were all ministers but only one of them was a preacher and so each of you god wants to use god wants to speak through god wants to use you to in in a different way that he's made you in order to accomplish his purpose right and it's not it's not that you've got to go through so and so to get your leadership of the holy spirit no you don't you go to god personally he can speak to you as easily as he can speak to me he can guide you as easily as he can speak guide your pastor that is a great difference between nicolaitanism and the true bride of christ now that doesn't mean that the lord doesn't call ministers to give you counsel but again you have to be led by the spirit of god we're all called to be in connection directly with him not in not not in connection through again that's this concept the priesthood of all believers you're all called to a ministry i'm just going to skip ahead because i've got to close i've got a ton more scriptures but i've covered the concepts so how are we priests we all have the spirit of god equally and personally equally and personally which empowers us to a ministry to the world in finding the lost sheep and edifying the body of christ it isn't just the preacher's job to go after the lost sheep it's each one of us do you have the spirit of christ the spirit of christ goes after the lost and the broken and the edifying of the body of christ the whole body every portion of the body is to build itself up in love not just a few holy priests to build you up holy five-fold ministry men put it that way in message terms to build up the people everybody is called to edify and build up the body of christ it's not a mediatorship for affecting a sacrifice for sins that's finished that's accomplished that's done there's only one mediator between god and men but you've heard of the term intercessory prayer that comes there from romans 8 i think 26 and and 27 speaking about that but the spirit speaks with words that cannot be uttered to who to us it's to us so that we know how to pray the spirit is interceding right through who you every believer every part of the body of christ all of us are participants of this interceding by the spirit because ultimately what is it it's the spirit of god working in a body of people to build itself up in love and to find those lost sheep those pre those last predestinated seed that need to come in and that is not for a holy priesthood a holy ministry it's for the priesthood of all believers everyone has the spirit of god and everyone is called to affect ministry unto others let's stand and pray heavenly father we're so thankful for this high and holy calling which you've called every single spirit-filled believer to help us lord to see particularly what you would want us to do lord not not as though we have to have some great title or great position there's nothing to do with that it has everything to do with having a heart for the the lost the broken the hurting for our friends for those around us that we can truly by the holy spirit minister the word to them so that they themselves can enter into this priesthood lord thank you thank you for your love thank you for your leadership in our lives lord we commit the worship and the preaching of the word to you today lord we ask that your spirit would have full control and that you would speak deep to our hearts we ask these things in jesus name amen god bless you you
