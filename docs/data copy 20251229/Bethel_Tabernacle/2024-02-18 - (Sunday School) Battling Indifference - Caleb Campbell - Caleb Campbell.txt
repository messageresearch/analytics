========================================

for e e all most heart morning uh just pray this can Inspire our hearts to go and study it for ourselves um but it's just kind of how the Lord was impressing on my heart so if we turn to the Book of Matthew the 16th chapter we're going to read a few verses there and then turn over in the Book of Revelations so Matthew 16 and we'll start at verse 13 and and it says when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of men am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some say Elias others jeremias or one of the prophets he saith unto them but who say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it amen and let's turn over in the Book of Revelation just the first chapter there Revelation chapter 1 we're just going to read three verses Revelation 1 and 1 says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand God bless you this morning as you take your seats um brother renom says in the church age book I'll be quoting some some quotes from that book this morning the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize and now I'm not talking about the Book of Revelations and you I am talking about all Revelation it is tremendously important to the church Church brother random breaks that scripture down in Matthew 16 you know Jesus told Simon Peter I say unto thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I'm going to build my church you know the Rock brother Brandon breaks down it wasn't Peter and it wasn't just a natural rock it was upon the Revelation that God gave to Peter that Jesus was the Christ he says now you might take what the pastor says or what the Seminary said teaches and though it might be taught to you with eloquence until God reveals to you that Jesus is the Christ and that it is the blood that cleanses you and that God is your savior you will never have eternal life it is the spiritual Revelation that does it and so until God reveals something to you as an individual personally that Jesus is the Christ and he is your savior and his blood cleanses and washes away your sins you can't ever have eternal life he says and he goes on to say in this Revelation he tells us what the end of the devil is he tells us how he's going to deal with the devil and cast him into the Lake of Fire he reveals the end of the wicked ones who follow Satan and Satan hates that and that is why he attacks them speaking of the books of Genesis and the Book of Revelation he hates to be exposed and in those books he is exposed for exactly what he is Jesus said that about Satan he has no part in him and I have he has no part in me and I have no part in him the Bible says the devil would like to prove that different but he cannot so he does all he can to destroy confidence in the word so he does everything he can to destroy confidence and we're going to dive into that in just a few minutes but he uses specific Pathways to destroy that confidence but then he goes on to say but when the church disbelieves Satan and believes the spiritual revelation of the word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against her now remember this he says I know there's a couple quotes but just to set a foundation this morning Christ is the true church in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his works the attempt and destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he's cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that and he can't stand it that passage in the church age book is so important you know we can often look at that first sentence where brother brandom says Christ is a continuation of the book of Acts and that you know that makes us so happy and we are a continuation of that book but then we have to realize that the Antichrist Spirit fights us so hard to come to that revelation of who we are and the the title that I I was going to take today a church age study but it's battling the spirit of indifference and um there's something that you know something that we have to fight constantly in our lives and that's the spirit of lukewarmness you know the Bible says that it makes the church formal and Powerless second Timothy 3 says it like this 31 says know this that in the last days per time shall come for men shall be lovers of their own self Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truce breaker truce Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God and having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away so there's a form of godliness there that the Bible talks about going to church and and living a life but it denies that the power of God Revelation three says and unto the Church of the lead Deans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot and I would thatou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind and naked so if we're not careful we can fall into that Spirit of deception even Believers you can live you know we can live in a halfin half out life you know maybe maybe we go to church maybe we read our Bible maybe we listen to a tape once a week but then it can become more of a ritual than an actual experience in your life you know there's no fire in it brother Jason's been preaching about the fire in our lives there's no expression of God's life in it and he says in verse 18 of that same chapter I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich in white rnment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isab that thou mayest see and in verse 19 I wanted to pick this up in Revelation 3:19 he says as many as I love I rebuke and I chasen be jealous therefore and repent now I wanted to stop on this verse for just a minute and dive into to a power there's a power in confession the Lord knows that the spirit of lukewarmness was going to be so strong in the last day so he knew that that was going to he gave us the word he he he says he he's the god of everything so he knew that was going to happen so what did he do he provided us with the ultimate remedy to combat the devil in his tactics amen and that was to give us the anointed word word for our hour amen through Revelation and just to break that down more simply I'm just a you know simple guy that's what a lot of the the particular message of the church age book does and deals with some things that over the course of history that had gotten confused like how people were supposed to be baptized and how the Lord Jesus Christ was God and human flesh and how on the day of Pentecost he had divided himself into the church but he was all still in the same he was all still one one portion he was still one all being the same God just three offices or three manifestations brother Brandon breaks that down simply as we move into this but he says be zealous therefore and repent so the life of a True Believer isn't just one experience of repentance and filling of the Holy Ghost it's a continual Fountain of repenting and and being refilled amen we have a a born again experience of God but then there's a continual fountain that God wants to give you more maturity in your walk with Christ amen there's a solid experience there's a time in your life where you can look back on and say from this time you know I I I serve the Lord God called me and he brought me out of where I was living at but then each each portion in your life you know each time that God gives you another step that you go through you come to deeper revelations in your life which which that shows you that you know God is always giving you something to repent of and a lot of it's not it's not a lot of sometimes it's not a lot of outward things it's it's some things that in our mind that we just have to repent Lord I need to take that thought captive I need to I need to humble myself more in this area because God is showing us who we are because a couple verses later we show that God wants us to sit on his throne with him but there takes a character development to do that amen and whom the Lord loves he rebukes and he chastens um you know when he puts that that new nature in you and and you repent of your sins and you're filled with the go Holy Ghost your desires change but as you mature and you grow and you walk closer with him you know there's things in our life that we stumble at we all have weaknesses we all have things that we that we stumble at we you know we could go down a long list I'm not going to go down a long list of you know this morning but each of us stumble with certain things and that's because there's an old nature that we're fighting against and that's that Fallen condition that you left behind you know when you started walking with God it's always trying to fight its way back into your nature it's a sticky nature and you know brother Brenham gives that illustration of the Indian chief talking about the two dogs fighting within you know the black and the white and someone asked him you know which one is the strongest in your life and the chief just said simply it's whichever one you feed the most and something like that that's just so simple but it's just exactly the truth whatever you feed the most in your life that is what's going to have the strongest influence the where you go what you do what you listen to if you're constantly feeding on the wrong thing or feeding on entertainment or feeding on social media or feeding on you know shows or movies what do you think is going to have Supremacy in your life the things that you're feeding on Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15:31 I Die daily you know and that dying out daily applies to every facet of our of our walk with the Lord you know the devil isn't stupid he knows that he isn't going to get you to go down the stre street and and get drunk or or live a filthy life so he has to be more cunning in his tactics so he places certain distractions in your life you know he gives us a phone and he gives us different 300 things to do on that phone and he sneaks into your thought life and maybe he'll slip something in there something that edges on compromise but then if you don't take that thought captive if you don't cast down that imagination then it begins to grow and grow and grow that's why why living the Christian Life that's why it's a dying out daily and it's a dying out not daily anymore it's a dying out hourly it's a dying out every minute um we're going to get to this in just a minute but you know the average person the average human being has 50 to 70,000 thoughts every single day and so imagine if you have 50 to 70 thoughts every single day how many of those thoughts are are are are about the word how many of those thoughts are about the message and how many thoughts are about carnal things that aren't going to grow you in your spiritual walk that's why it takes a continual dying out a repentant heart you know God doesn't want to just have a bunch of robots doing the same thing saying the right thing you know looking the right way dress in the right way you know because that's what we're supposed to do he's trying to mold our character and I love Pastor sermon uh from Wednesday night you know Judas didn't just make one great great choice in his life to betray Jesus it must have been a series of choices a series of thoughts that the devil would flood into his mind thoughts that he didn't take captive and and cast down right the eventual you know eventually that overtook him and it led him to make a final choice to betray Jesus and you know in our life are we're constantly being bombarded with thoughts from the enemy you know we know that the Battleground in The Believer is in the mind and the that's the greatest battle ever fought so in studying the tactics of War you know that you have to study how your enemy attacks so that when it does come time for him to attack that you're prepared to not only to defend his T attacks but prepare to defeat him when he's on your ground because nobody no no no Army wants to just be a continual uh continually in defense you know we want to we want to offend we want to I want to take what the ground I want to I want to fight the enemy I want to get on his ter I want to fight on my territory that God has given me I want to win back what he's tried to take from me I want to be an overcomer the Bible says to him that overcometh will sit on that throne with him I don't want to just be in a constant state of Defense always having to take this thought and take that you know we're having to do that defense is always at the you know at the back of our heads but we have to always remember that God gave us everything we need to overcome in this age in order to to win that battle we have to search out the scriptures so we study the message we constantly look for things in our life that we need to repent of that that's why the Bible says be zealous therefore and repent you know and constantly looking at things in your life to repent of in the life of a Believer you should we should wake up in the morning and you should think of that scripture I want to be jealous I want to I want to be anxious I want to be I want to strive Lord God to to further my walk with you today so if there's something that isn't right in my life then I want to make it right amen I want to I want to cast down those imaginations I you know there's many things in my life that and I'm going to get to this in just a second but trials and things that you go through testings how many times in our life do you go through something in your mind that people around you never even know you go through because it's a battle that's taking place in your mind you have 50 you know I probably on the smaller end of that so maybe I have 40,000 thoughts every day but you have 40 to 50,000 thoughts every day how many of those thoughts are the enemy trying to come in and trying to play something in your life that's going to hinder you that's going to cause you to stumble so the life of a Victorious believer is constantly being fought in our life every day you're constantly having to cast down an imagination you realize that that thought isn't my thought you know and I'll just give everybody in here give a little bit of a of a tactic if the thought that you're having doesn't align up with this then it's not your thought so you cast down that thought and then you have a victory so a victory in your life doesn't have to just be you know I went through this great trial I went to this great circumstance you fight trials in your life every single day and many times the trial you fight in your life I'll never know about it maybe maybe even your husband your wife will never know about it your brother your sister may never know about it because you fought it in your mind you fought it in your spirit and you cast down that thing and then you became an overcomer because you were obedient to God's word when you said be zealous therefore and repent because you were zealous about it and you you you were active in that process amen you were you you know you were you were fighting you weren't just defending you know I want to take out you have a shield in your hand but then you've got a weapon you've got a SW sword of the spirit so you wield that sword and you wield that that Shield of Faith but you always move forward you don't let the enemy you know draw you back amen especially when it comes to something like lukewarm living you know that is something that can happen so quickly in your life especially in the society that we live in we live in a fast-paced society you know we have the everything that you need of at the touch of your of a finger you know it's it's sometimes it's just getting back to the basics where's your prayer life at what you know do you spend longer than 7 minutes a day praying maybe 3 minutes of that praying for your food and I'm I'm just being honest because i' I've had those times in my life where you know you get you get so moving so quickly and then you you've gone all day and you haven't communed with your father you haven't communed with the one who's going to give you overcoming power so the getting back to the basics in your life you know and I I don't want that to sound condemning I'm just just just as guilty the entire day can just get away from you a a whether it's praying or whether it's listening to a tape whether it's reading your you know reading the word I just want this to be something for us to to be zealous about you know recognize that that's something in my life that I struggle with and cast it down and then move forward don't let the enemy one of the tactics of the enemy in our mind is is he he gets you so distraught about about Casual Living and then you start to feel bad about yourself you start to feel bad I'm not a Victorious believer I'm not I'm not living in the victory that I supposed to be living in you just cast that thing down and you move forward you you you go forward from the point that you're at now and you remember that everything else is in the past and I'm moving forward I live in a future I live in a future life right now you know God sees me in the future there's to there's an end to the devil and there's an end to his tactics but there's no end to you because you are in Christ amen so we are to be enthusiastic in our pursuit to repent and and you know it shows that the lord loves you because he's trying to call you up higher than where you are now you know if you if you're rebuked or if you're chastened you know that's actually an expression of God's love to you because he wants to get you more mature he wants to bring you into a further an of of of him in your life amen and um the next verse says behold verse 20 I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will Su with him and he with me to him that overcometh I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches you know and just to break this down a little bit more simply you know the Revelation the Revelation that God gives you in your life it's an unveiling it's it's a it's a it's an understanding that God wants you to have you know it's it's simply it's a simple thing God wants to reveal himself in Simplicity to each one of you there isn't there isn't a you can you can make things complicated but it's as simple as laying out before God and asking him to come into your heart and to show him show show you who you are show you where you need to be show you that you're an overcomer and God is going to give you that Revelation and he is going to take you to where you need to be Amen brother Venom says it like this he knows that if people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works and she will be an invincible Army if they can get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be definitely thed today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it and with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it against us but we will prevail over them you know looking at that by God's spirit Discerning and not only Discerning but withstanding the Antichrist spirit that tries to creep into our lives you know and every time that the devil you know in that experience in the desert with Jesus every time that the devil came to him all Jesus said was it is written it is written in my word and so when the the Devil comes in your mind and he tries to throw a reasoning down he tries to say you're you're nothing he tries to do those things you just say it's written in the word that I'm I'm an overcomer because he wants me to sit on his throne with him I I'm an overcomer I have to cast down that reasoning I have to cast down that imagination I have to take that thought captive and the the the small victories that you have in your mind taking a thought captive those things com Compound on each other it's a comp pounding Victory so that when a trial does come and it may be an outward trial or it may be an outward testing you have you have overcome so many times in the territory in your mind that when it comes to a territory that's on his Battleground now you're ready to fight because you've won it here so once you've won it here you'll be able to W it there amen every time that the devil came and tried to tempt him Jesus would just quote his word it is written Thou shalt not tempt the Lord your God and so when something happens in our our our life just remember the weapon that you have is the word and it's as simple as looking at the word it's as simple as laying out yourself to to to read the message to understand it to to study it to live it to breathe it amen getting back to some of the distraction just a few more minutes here getting back to some of those distractions that you know that we have um the thoughts some how many thoughts in your mind of those 50 to 70,000 how many thoughts in your mind on a daily basis are you giving to allow greater Revelation in the word now just think about that how many thoughts are you allowing in your mind to allow maturing and growth to manifest in your life getting back to that black dog versus the white dog what are are you feeding the most I know I keep going back to the simple things but that's that's what the church age book is about it's about the simple revelation of who Jesus is to you and once you realize who you are and who Jesus is to you the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it amen so whatever you're feeding Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God you know and if you're not aligning the majority of those thoughts of of the 60 let's just say 60,000 Thoughts with the word of God a process actually begins to take place and your walk with the Lord starts to deteriorate and what happens is an indifference starts to settle in and that lukewarmness starts to starts to major in your life before you can even realize it you know and I mean it when I say that the devil is deceptive and he hates us he hates the word and he going to he's going to do everything he can to keep you away from a fiery experience in with the Lord Jesus brother renom says you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message uh uh that we are studying it's the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages then I mention that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't just take ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it is going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic Insight we have prophetic Insight amen we've got prophetic Insight it will require the ability to hear from God it will require Supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear and look at the simple instructions from the prophet how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know so just studying the book won't be enough but it does start with that the Mysteries that lay within it require an inspiration from the spirit of the Lord and there's such an importance in hearing the word there's such an importance of reading the word and studying the message Things Are opened up to us in many different ways and they're revealed when you come to church and you know when you're in prayer and you know but it says when you lay yourself open and yield yourself to God and allow yielding that word yielding speaks of meekness it speaks of being submissive to his Spirit to come in and allow things now sometimes it takes a lot of humility to come and allow something to come in your life and in your mind and say I was wrong in that way but Lord I Want to Be Right amen it takes humility to say that but one of the things that every one of us battle is that pride in our minds to say well that's all right no everything that is not in alignment with God is not all right so we need to get it back into alignment with God Amen um just a minute here uh as I've already said this book is the consummation of the Scriptures it is even placed exactly right in the Canon of scriptures now you know why it says that Anyone who reads or hears it is even hears it is blessed it is a revelation that God gives you authority over the devil and you can see why they who would add or take from it would be cursed it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy it is that simple the prophet says there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word and just some closing thoughts there's so much Simplicity to the book and the prophet says that several times if you go read the read and study the church age book how how simple don't get tripped up with language maybe that you don't understand or terminology just lay yourself open and allow God to come into your heart and to reveal things to you because that's exactly what he's looking for just simply lay yourself open and pray about those things that are not plain and God can open it up to you he hides those things from the wise and prent prudent and reveals them to babes such as we learn amen I'm so thankful for that aren't we now there's just I I'm I should be done but I have this one more thought five minutes I think it'll be okay brother bam says let me just put in a word here from my own Ministry if you don't mind you all know that the gift in my life is Supernatural it is a gift by where the holy spirit is able to discern diseases and the thoughts of men heart and other hidden things that only God would know and then reveal to me I wish you could stand here with me and see the faces of people when Satan knows he's going to be exposed now it isn't the people that I'm talking about it is Satan that has got a hold of their life lives through three things and I want
