invite you to stand and i'm going to go right to the word of god sure appreciate all of that wonderful singing and worship and praise and uh i hope the devil was listening amen i've got a number of prayer requests i want to cover that i don't think made it into the main one couple of them came in to me just a few minutes ago sister gene asked prayer for my friend in cherokee north carolina she asked prayer for her great niece anna it's a two-year-old baby and her dad anna's dad kenny both have coveted 19 so that's the father and the two-year-old baby also pray for my sister jewel our own you remember sister jewel she also is afflicted with coveted 19 trusting the lord and uh sister jewel what uh sister mom what is she like 84 maybe something like that so want to be praying uh for sister joel and for these needs in cherokee my sister-in-law karen wrote this morning to say pray for mom the sister debbie's mother this morning her back's hurting and she was nervous and emotional when i called this morning just pray god will calm her nerves amen the doctors have uh you know really figured out that uh that's a lot of uh what's going on with her uh his nerves they found out conclusively by her scans that uh the the the fear lied the devil was trying to tell that it was parkinson's that's been put to rest the doctor said it's just old age creeping in and no parkinson's at all but uh want to pray that the lord of strengthener amen praise the lord um brother bruce had turned in and we prayed i want to pray again about it today for sister rachel sweeney we all know sister rachel and her son joshua and the marines there with covet and i guess some of his friends also their 29 palms where he's stationed so then brother george had requested prayer and i don't remember if we prayed for this here or if we okay brother george i remember putting it in the minister's morning thing that i was that i do every morning but um there was a request that came in to us asking all the saints of bethel tabernacle so apparently this is somebody that streams or catches archives and says asking all the saints at bethel tabernacle to join us in prayer for a very serious situation long time friends of our family tj looks like bubbax bubotch okay very good is the son of my sister's friend from childhood so tj was born with cystic fibrosis he's defied statistics he's turned had his 30th birthday i know that that's a miracle in and of itself last couple of years he's also been in kidney failure and on dialysis up to 18 hours a day he is on the list for a transplant for both lung and kidneys at duke university so they've contacted uh they've been contacted by duke they'd like him to come there for six to eight week period of tests and studies and praying that they will come to know jesus christ as their savior then secondly that the lord would move on their behalf for healing through a transplant through the doctors at duke or by a miracle amen there are many questions still about what is involved in many challenges with trying to relocate to be near hospitals logistics and expenses would also like to suggest and he's asking us to pass it around so we got a follow-up from brother george this morning urgent prayer requests for this same young man in addition to all the issues that this ready has covered so um we're asking the the the to pray and and uh and again the most important thing is the salvation of souls amen but let's pray also i heard uh brother luther i think mentioned sister chastity this morning so we're just trusting the lord for that amen brother richie glad to have uh him and sister regina still here with us amen brother andy and sister joy also happy to have them and all the different ones of you here we had a wonderful service last night my goodness amen and what's up with you not singing again yet so we got to fix that amen so amen we appreciate brother allen on the base and um i had no idea he's so multi-talented amen so um we we want to get them singing and we sure enjoyed that last time that they sung amen it's overdue already overdue already already it's overdue already okay so every extra service you wait it's even more overdue praise the lord so we're happy to be a christian today and we want to go to the lord in prayer before we turn to the scriptures let's bow our heads we thank you most kindly lord this morning for your great love to us lord what a what a banner weekend this has been we started out lord with such a wonderful time of fellowship around your word with the saturday morning men's bible study and the breakfast and the fellowship we came in last night for uh another thrilling thrilling there's know the word for it thrilling time in your word a thrilling time of rejoicing and to have the lord supper and oh mine i come back this morning and now we've had such instruction already this morning out of the sunday school class and lord of the sunday school classes and and the singing and the worship and no doubt lord angels are singing and rejoicing along but now lord we come to that important task of the day once more now to approach your word but father before we read we have these sick requests we're presenting to you they were read out loud you already knew what they were before we read them but we read them lord so that the people can enter in father and we join our faith to these these suffering lord people and we ask you to join your faith our faith as the prophet described it push the promise through lord may they be well may everything that we prayed for the request brother luther took we're looking to you father such a testimony of faith from brother douglas this morning that they absolutely are believing for a complete deliverance lord father and so we're believing it with them now i pray for these needs lord and i pray for this service i pray that you will bless both speaker and hearer as you have already may you continue to do so lead us and guide us lord lead me be with my mind this morning so much on my heart i want to say and limited time to say it so we want to be very efficient lord and say exactly what you once said i've learned over the years to this let you be in charge wow how just just a step back lord and realize my position just your assistant lord they sang a song they were ready to go to the word i walked up here and i just followed you up here that's all i've done lord and i i'm just your assistant standing here to help you and i'm grateful my jesus i'm so grateful this morning for the privilege to believe the word of god i'm so grateful for that ability that i've not fell for the deception of the age that the holy spirit has kept his word to me lord when you said that his main purpose would be to lead you and guide you into all truth so i thank you for the opportunity to believe your word that was unmerited favor lord but now it's up to me what i do with that opportunity lord so i pray you will help us now today commit myself all that i know to do lord we've waited on you and we've prayed and studied and the people have waited and prayed and when there's expectation and lord i know after all these years you'll come you always come you're faithful lord so we relax we relax in the hands of jehovah today we commit ourselves into your hands for service just now in jesus name amen amen and amen god bless you do you love him well i tell you i sure do love and appreciate the lord this morning i want to ask you to turn with me uh to matthew chapter 24 this morning amen i guess we're going to start reading um boy there's so much here in this chapter to read my let's just catch from verse 32 my matthew chapter 24 and verse 32. so many places i could start this morning but we'll just start here amen i want to by the help of the lord continue today with the greatest sign part 2 verse 32 of matthew 24. now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves you know that summer is nigh so likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away amen may the lord bless the reading of his word as you're seated so we're straight up noon now we've had just a little bit of extended worship and prayer and and uh announcements and what more and so uh if you give me your undivided attention i'll try to take about 55 or 60 minutes amen and we will uh we'll pull the chute and stand on the brakes see if we can get her stopped amen but this dragster is going to go down the runway today praise the lord amen amen so uh i want to be very studious and very i really want to follow close to my notes today because there's so much i have to there's so much on my heart i'll just blow up amen and go in all directions but i have a direc a definite burden on my heart and it's been difficult for me uh if you that might surprise you but it's been difficult for me to try to construct and separate out what we'll save for next time and what we want to cover today now you know it's as we were saying last night it's an amazing hour that we live in and i'm sure you all have seen it by now i started to put it up on the screen and really spend some time with it but it's already history now you know things are prophecy until their history and here we are today friends and we've had the prophecy for many years thanks sir we've had the prophecy for many years concerning and we weren't sure how it was all going to work out we you know we've speculated and talked about it and you know and and and it's not that what we concluded was wrong you know brother branham indicated a powerful woman or the catholic church and we see that both things are true that's why in fact as it was so remarkable to me brother branham you you have to include that because brother branham would talk about a catholic president elected in the 1960s and we find that that there hasn't then been a catholic president uh and and now we come to this time where we've got another catholic president and in fact is his entire cabinet is made up and this is not an accident first of all half of his cabinet is made up of women whose place is at home raising children amen and and so i don't care that that's uh not politically correct i couldn't possibly care less about being politically correct i i mean i couldn't i'm not even sure how to say that in proper english i couldn't care less than i don't already whatever i couldn't possibly care less and if uh and and if they want to take our website down and ban us whatever but we're going to preach the gospel the lord will get his word out amen i don't need i don't need the permission of these big tech to preach the gospel and so we realize that that half of them are women because it's a woman's nation and because it's a it's a woman's age a woman's nation and a woman and and and the age of the woman and so we realize that women have a high and lofty place in the family of god they have a very special place it was a woman who brought forth the son of god it was women who brought life back into the earth and it's a tremendous tremendous honor on the other side for all of those sisters who kept their place in life and honored god and in an age where they're where they're they're looked on with disdain for their hair and their modest apparel and their clean face and their their their meek and quiet spirit but i'm going to tell you something sisters uh when william branham went to the other side it was the women who got to greet him first it was million brother branham said women were coming the men were behind them so don't worry sister if you if you stand here in this age as the weaker vessel and keep your place in the word of god god is watching there's a record being kept of that and so i you know there it's it's a wonderful privilege but she certainly got out of her place and that's the backbone of the nation was motherhood once that was broken it was downhill from there now they can argue about that's right or wrong but what they can't argue with is what a prophet said it would produce in society and it has so i don't you know you you're pretty dumb to argue in the face of absolute results that were foretold ahead and now they're here and you still don't think somehow it's true well i i'm sorry i'm i'm glad for a revelation of this hour i'm glad for grace unmerited grace that gave me an opportunity to be a believer see grace p the world has the the deception that's in the world today is that grace you can just be anything that it's unmerited favor so it doesn't matter how you live but the bible says that grace teaches us to deny ungodliness so i'm going to tell you something friends it's not that you know grace to just live in a sinner's life and think that god's unmerited favor covers that it doesn't the unmerited favor let me read it to you like this it's un it's an unmerited opportunity that's right you understand it's grace it's an unmerited you couldn't do anything to deserve it it's god rich in mercy but now it becomes incumbent upon you and i to put on the whole armor of god to march forward in righteousness and holiness to give honor to the word of god in our lives to make christ the center amen they the world has that such a notion brother josh if you'll find revelation 19 for me we're going to catch verses 13 we're going to start at 13 but before you put it up let me make this comment you just find it for me brother josh revelation 19 and 13 have it ready you know this idea that that of what christianity is called today and it really modern christianity today it is not in any way uh real christianity right that's exactly right brother it it because i mean first of all it doesn't even have an appearance different from the world amen it basically is just a good neighbor policy and you know you know they they harp on the golden rule and brother branham said there's no there's no salvation in the golden rule so so we find that christianity is not and it never really has been you know uh a rule rulebook of ways that you can you can dress or act or talk and that qualifies you to be a christian what qualifies you to be a christian is the life of christ lives inside you and you don't actually need a book of rules your life just mirrors the person living inside you which is jesus so it's never been about that people who live under bondage and you know this message is somehow bondage to you you just need a new birth it would take away that bondage it would freedom friend as brother jason demars has taught us freedom is not you know people say i need out of this message i need to be free freedom is not living how you want freedom is actually being able to finally live according to the image of your maker you've been released from sin and now you can live like you were designed to live that's freedom if you don't have that you're in bondage you're the one in bondage not the believer the believer is free i can finally be the real me i don't have to be a prisoner and a slave to my evil wicked heart any longer [Music] what an upside down thinking the world has about real freedom and so you know we we find that here in revelation 19 13 all right he comes now riding out on a white horse and the bible says in verse 13 he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood now look and his name is called the word of god now that's interesting because that is exactly the message that the last messenger tried to tell him he's his word christ is not a creed christ is the word brother branham more than any other um principle that he tried to teach the world is he's his word jesus is his word and you can't separate him from his word and it doesn't matter if you have some idea of a historical jesus but you deny his word today if you don't believe him now you wouldn't have believed him then to believe him historically is pretty convenient it's pretty easy to do it's it's you know it's easy to to make every kind of brag and say oh if i'd have been back there well you've got an opportunity to prove what you would have done back there because that same jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and a prophet brother branham warned them for all those years of his ministry that he was the word that he was not a denomination he's not a man-made creed he's not any kind of organized religion and then the very next verse proves it verse 14 brother josh watch this very next verse and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean everybody who believed the prophet's message proves it wait i'm gonna tell you something friends your life is proving what a prophet [Applause] taught it's it's literally as vindicated i i had a i had a one of these defectors recently try to you know try to threaten me try to say you know uh the rods are laid and god's gonna prove you know who's with him i just got one answer for him it's already been proven it's already been proven god's family's already here we're already dressed in the robes of righteousness i mean tell you something friends revelation 19 is mount zion's showdown is who's going into rapture and you say well how do you know that you're going in the rapture because it's already started in me i'm already in process hallelujah amen it's already been accomplished see so brother branham says in in perseverance and i may have read this in part one if i did you're going to hear it again he says christ when he was on earth was the was the body of god god created this body it was a different body yet it was a human body see solomon built him a house but stephen said howbeit the most high dwelleth not in houses made with hands but a body has now prepared me so he says god prepared himself a body in the form of the lord jesus which was christ meaning the anointed one all right and now all that god was was in christ he was the fullness of the godhead bodily that's what scripture says now all that god was he poured out in christ he was emmanuel god with us and all that christ was he poured into the church what is it anointed one amen i i've read you the quotes i'm pretty sure already where brother branham identifies the body of christ in god's godhead you understand you're in god's godhead and now you say well why did he do it that way brother branham gives us the answer all that was christ was he poured into the church what is it anointed one to continue his work that his word might live constantly that if i if i don't ever get anything else from god or man for the rest of my life if i had to just brother branham said you know he talked about if i just had to lay on my stomach and eat soda crackers and drink branch water well i don't care whatever kind of misery you want as long as my life can bring forth him constantly i don't need riches i don't need fortune and glory i don't need accolades i don't need anything the world has to offer i don't even need for god to heal me or do anything else for me if he'll just let me live in a way that his word lives through me really i will tell you something friends i i find myself every day more and more and we are vexed by this world but i'm here to tell you something there is no vexation like when we look in the mirror of god's word as i was showing you last time and we don't see in the mirror of god's word we don't see his reflection perfectly that's vexation that's what drives me to prayer when i go over here and i look at a certain verse and i go oh man i don't exactly look like that wow i need to get to praying i need to i need to get a hold of god i need to have some more of the lord in my life i need some fresh anointing i need a revival there's nothing in your life worth anything up against that there's nothing i don't care what you would ever accomplish what you would ever become in life whatever station you would arrive at your life is zero unless you uh look like this unless christ has his way and his will and his wills his word if he doesn't have that in your life i don't care what you accomplish you're zero you have no value even to mankind unless you're living in the image of your maker hallelujah so he says it's to continue his work god the father which which is the father of jesus christ the great spirit dwelt in the fullness of his power and jesus christ which was the tabernacle of god made flesh and dwelt on earth representing the word jesus was the word and the bi watch this the bible said so saint john first chapter and the word watch and the word watch how brother branham gives uh meaning to john 1 and the word was invisible now listen close the word was invisible until it was made flesh and then the word become visible and through his sacrificial death at calvary and his resurrection positionally placed his church in that realm that the same invisible god could end could come into the individual and make the word visible see i wish my church could get that i'd say that today i hope my church can get that if you could see friends the invisible god made visible what's my life about brother jason making god visible what decision should i make i'm facing a situation what should be my decision whatever will make him the most visible in your life see it's not rocket science see and i and and and that's god's plan now and i remember distinctly talking about this prior but that is god's plan you know that's that's what's up with god right now making himself visible in you and and i said to you last time you might be here today and you might be living in the biggest question mark of your life amen but but but but that's what's happening that that this is the why this is what's behind that trial this principle of god invisible making himself visible to a world that's what's going on in your persecution or in your trial or in your calamity i'm here to tell you something friends joy comes in the morning endure the cross press on keep moving hallelujah oh my the end of suffering is at hand you realize that when that sixth vision was fulfilled i it rolls through my soul the end of suffering the end of suffering is at hand hallelujah oh when you know when we'll all come to the end of all suffering a time when man can be free at last and a time when we can let go of all grudges and all hurts and all unpaid debts where we're at it here you've arrived at that time friends you know why it's it's a it's a dark and wicked world and so many questions and there's so much going on and such unsettling times and you know i i get that it can cause anxiety and fear i totally get that you know it's it's interesting brother branham in a number of different places and i i thought i would just try to relate it to you but i'm going to have to read it a little bit because nobody can tell a story like brother branham he's such a master storyteller you know because you know he's got he's well he's got an advantage he's got prophetic eyes to see it and so you know he can read between the lines better than anybody and so you know he had it was brother branham who argued with dr davis over john baptizing jesus and brother brother davis said you know then jesus turned and baptized john brother i said no i can't that didn't happen brother brother roy no no no oh yeah billy it did you just don't you know you're wrong no it didn't and he said we used to go back and forth he said he might even be in the service here tonight he said i want to hurt his feelings he said he said but i know it didn't he said because he said i stood there he said i watched him he come right up out of the water went right up the bank he said i saw that that spirit come down on him said he went right up the bank and went right into the wilderness i'm here to tell you something friends we have an advantage of a prophet in this hour so he comes to the wonderful bible story that we've learned since our days as children of the three hebrew boys in the fiery furnace oh my what a thrilling story i remember as a kid hearing that story for the first time my eyes were bulging wow and brother branham now watch now let me let me give you let me give you a prophet's rendition of it gonna add a little bit of clarity because he's going to describe some things going on in heaven while that's going on in earth that the story in the bible doesn't cover see now the prophets do that all time isaiah did that ezekiel did that moses did that amen so don't think that that's odd for a prophet to look at something in the earth and start describing and go oh and by the way in heaven this is what's going on so brother branham says you know here they are now he sets the scene such such drama so he sets the scene you know aaron the king is just flaming mad wow you know and uh you know i'll give you one more chance boys we don't we don't need another chance you know i'm going to give you three minutes we don't need one i'll give you 10 seconds i don't need half a second i'm here to tell you king we're never going to bow to you period end of story case closed so we we well well i'm going to heat the furnace seven times hotter well we we might burn alive but we're still not going to bow down we know our god can deliver us and that's all that matters what come what may come what may come what may doesn't matter my whole heart is to serve him i don't care about the outcome i know what the outcome is the armies of heaven followed him on white horses and i'm going to be part of that army hallelujah but my can you imagine now there's there's quite a lot of anxiety and stress going on on the earth i mean this wasn't no joke this wasn't just a story this wasn't from homer this was this was real this was happening in real time okay it's not mythology and so here here's these young hebrew lads and they're taking a stand on the word of god and you'd think the king would have had enough sense he'd done seen god come on the scene so many times but i'll tell you something friends the world don't understand when they get under the power of the devil they do things that don't make sense and they do things and they think why did i do that i'm going to tell you something on the day of reckoning people are going to have the bible says there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth you gnash your teeth when the bitterness is too great to bear the bitterness of the opportunity of what could have been that you had a chance and that bitterness is so the finality of it is going to be so horrible they'll just gnash their teeth together but there's also something going on in heaven and brother branham he wants to turn the attention of the audience in the hours come 1951 he says look up this way see now we've been looking at the scene on the ground this is happening in real time but let's turn our vision and let's look up you need to do that a lot of times when you're finding yourself in a situation in life just start looking in this direction say lord i know you've got control of my life i know i know you're the boss of me hallelujah hallelujah he says look up this way you know i can see him oh here's isaiah isaiah did this he said i saw the lord high and lifted up i s that's the first sermon i ever preached brother richie out of isaiah 6 1. i mean i was breathless i thought this description isaiah i saw the lord high and lifted up and his train filled the temple and when he even when he spoke the pillars of the temple were moved at his voice i tell you something when god starts speaking things start moving hallelujah oh my you're the don't forget you are those lively stones that make up that temple where god lives and when god starts speaking i get moving something about it moves me oh my and he says i can see him sitting up there in his majesty his priestly robes draped around him looking down on this scene in babylon and he says i i see i love a prophet site i see coming to his right a great angel his name's gabriel great archangel he comes running up pulls his sword master have you looked down in babylon lord you understand what's going on in laodicea right now do you understand what your bride is going through at this minute master have you looked down in babylon your people's taken a stand for you down there the hour has come for them to stand and they're taking a stand i'm so glad to know the hour has come to stand and i'm standing others are running i'm standing hallelujah i sold my whole life to it hallelujah so he says but that bunch of people there is going to push them into that fiery furnace see the angel don't know the future see gabriel don't know what's about to happen understand right so he's looking at the scene gabriel don't know see and that's why saying master have you looked down in babylon so he says there's a bunch of people down there is going to push them into that fiery furnace let me go down there i'll clean that thing up would not have been a surprise on the royal court if gabriel would have showed up a sword swinging brother branham says he could have done it yes sir he's he he said he'll give his angels charge over these and i believe the angels of god are encamped about those who fear him would you take confidence today hey these angels are encamped about you hallelujah i can hear gabriel say i'll go down there i'll strike babbling off the map if you let me go down there and and he says to god have you considered them lord i can hear the master say yes gabriel you're you're a wonderful angel you've obeyed me and said it my right hand ever since the day i created you but i can't let you go just can't let you go then i see coming this way comes another angel you know god's got angels in heaven at his command i see another one coming up look at him he rushes up he's called wormwood he falls down and he he he controls all of the waters and i can hear him say master down in babylon your children has took a stand and they're going to throw them in the fiery furnace this morning they're almost there hurry i've stood by your side since you created me i have control of the waters in the end of the living destruction i broke up the springs of the deep i swept over the earth and destroyed the whole world with water let me go down there this morning i'll wash her off the face of the earth he says i believe he could have done it don't you i can hear him say can't let you go you've been a good angel but you but i can't let you go have you considered them yes yes all night i've been watching them but jack i'm gonna blow a gasket here oh my yes all night i've been watching them brother his eyes on the sparrow i know he watches me he's watching you he sees how much faith you got how much you got how much you got he wants to see what kind of stand you'll take this is on purpose i want you to know something friends god the invisible is wanting to be visible and i don't care what trial or what circumstance or what calamity you're in god's watching god knows he's wanting to see what you'll do with your faith like brother richie said last night i saw he said that in the ministry and the breakfast how about went through the ceiling and landed in the street he said you ever notice in school which i hated school but he said back in the day is my worst time in the in this in the class and he says whenever they give a test he said that's when the teacher just is quiet the teacher will make a sound you're there under the test a lot of times you're in a test you say man god is awfully quiet i sure wish he would give me some encouragement i sure wish he would help me cheat a little bit on this test give me a few answers you know what he's a loyal teacher he ain't going to do that see yeah well what if i fail it don't worry if you fail it he'll just give it to you again amen thank you lord amen hallelujah what are you going to do he says he says uh he want he says he said i've watched them all night long i heard every prayer they prayed now you angels has been good angels but i can't let you go for i'm going myself i'm going myself amen i can see him rise from his seat his priestly robes drop around him i can see him say come here east wind west wind north and south and he says he says everything obeys him i can hear him say get over here that big white thunder head out yonder where's it at i can see him roll up to his throne he steps over on there reach and get a hold of a zigzag of lightning pass by the tree of life and grab off a palm because he's going to use that to wave off the fire oh it's a it's a palm off the tree of life and he's waving it he's waving it over you and me today hallelujah what's the matter he says what's the matter i'm going to babylon this morning my children has took a stand i'm taking a stand too hallelujah thank you lord god has everything under control friends you understand god is a god is the husbandman he's the he's the farmer he he's looking at his crop he's the one planted you a man he planted this bride you know just like he did in genesis god god knows he'll have a crop god knew when he planted it in genesis that darkness didn't bother him waters covered the face of the deep chaos was everywhere god wasn't nervous he had already put his seed in the earth he already had a son waiting all he had to do was give his command and this and the the sun would obey him the darkness would move back the seed would come to life see he knows he's going to have a crop he already prophesied he promised himself say what if god breaks his promise to me well first he can't but he promised even himself that he would have a bride and so you know he already he already has a heaven built for it he's already got garners he already went to prepare a city and you know i i i'm pretty sure that he's quite sure that he's going to get you in a rapture i'm pretty sure that he's quite sure that he can accomplish everything he has said about you because you have believed his word you know we on the other hand we are the crop and sometimes we wonder if we'll ever come to maturity [Music] don't we come on all you holy people don't we see we're the crop he ain't worried but we get worried do you imagine um that god has feelings i mean you're building his image you have feelings amen so you know we're god does does god get excited does just could would god jump up and down would he just like you know i mean i mean saying gabriel gabriel look at my children down there it's almost over i'm gonna get him i've waited two thousand years and gabriel's standing there because you don't know the future and he's looking but lord the oncoming storm and god's like i got this gabriel i got this i'll get him out before the storm hits it's not even going to come into its fullness satan can't even ride till i get him home hallelujah i'm here to tell you some friend i believe god is jumping up and down today saying you're almost there you're almost there you're almost there hallelujah i believe he sees his word i believe he knows he can keep his word i told brother jack i had to add brother richie to it cause they're two peas in a pod i said i told him i i told brother jack and brother richie i said i said listen a resurrection morning i'm about to find you guys really fast because i'm gonna need somebody to shout and scream and jump up and down with oh my luke 21 brother josh let's look at some scriptures these are some of the counter scriptures or not counter but parallel scriptures to matthew 24 luke 21 oh i'm doing good i've only been 34 minutes all right so here we go give me give me my last 26 will you amen verse 25 luke 21 25 and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity you know and the sea and the waves roaring so i want you to know i don't care how unsettling the times are jesus already knew it would be here and he already knew you'd still be here and you're right in the middle of his big plan i get that it's perplexing i get it's unsettling i get it's fearful i get it's a lot of anxiousness but understand you're in the middle of a controlled experiment amen god is going to prove to the devil once and for all look satan i didn't wait you know i didn't come along you know early and sneak up behind you i just i just went ahead and waited and let you have everything that's right i waited till you had 6 000 years to build your eden i took six gave you six i you know you i had a beautiful garden and i had my children in it now you've got a garden you've got your children in it and then i i gave you the the politics you can have it i gave you the science and education you can have it gave you all the schools of learning you can have them i gave you the pulpits i gave you the theological cemeteries i gave you all of that stuff i gave you i gave you social media so you could use it to to to take hollywood and put it on steroids and pollute the people and poison everybody i gave you everything i i let it in fact is you know you wanted to be worshiped the prophet exposed you on that outed you years ago that you wanted to be worshipped like me okay fine i'll even let you get to the point where you're the god of the age and worshiped as god [Music] and i'll wait till then when you're at your zenith and i'll perfect my bride right under your nose right under your nose i'll give you every influencing controlling element i'll give you all the buttons and levers and gears and you can pull it all but i'll what will you do i'll just send them my word and my word will be sufficient to hang on to my family hallelujah watch he says men's hearts verse 26 men's hearts failing them for fear do we see it and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up lift up your heads for your redemption draweth nigh i've always appreciated that god didn't allow noah to put windows in the side of the ark so he could look out at all the chaos he put one window in the top so he had to look to the sky he could only look up amen and so we find that he says here now watch so now he's gonna bring come to the parable of the fig tree we read in matthew on it's also in mark 13 but here it is in luke 21 29 and he spake to them a parable behold the fig tree and all the trees see because remember brother branham said it wasn't just israel putting forth the nation it was that and all the other things that were to happen all right so he says behold the fig tree and all the trees when they now shoot forth you see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand so likewise when you see these things come to pass know you that the kingdom of god is nigh at hand verily i say unto you truly i say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled amen we're here there can't even be another generation we've already seen the accomplishment of all of these prophecies we've seen the last vision of a prophet come to pass before the annihilation that's now history definitively that is definitively history look up your redemption draws nigh amen now watch heaven and earth verse 33 shall pass away but my words shall not pass away verse 34. it's going to get skinny you ready and take heed to yourselves take heed to yourselves don't just jump up and down with joy take heed perplexing times and distress of nations is coming men's hearts will fail for fear israel will put forth its leaf you'll see all these other trees coming forth when you see that take heed to yourselves lest at any time your heart be overcharged with surfeiting this is gluttony this is overeating see and drunkenness and cares of this life and so that day come upon you unawares so this indulging in the world this overeating on laodicea's delicacies take heed to yourself lest you do that because what can happen to you is the all of these things that i've just said will suddenly come upon you you might even be a child of god and you'll find yourself in a tizzy spinning around in fear you'll find yourself running and trying to hide in a hole in the ground you'll find yourself you know cutting yourself off from everything because these things caught you unaware and you realize wow the world is ending i'm not even prepared [Music] for as a snare it shall come upon it shall come on all them that dwell on the face of the earth watch ye therefore and pray three days a week oh i'm sorry my mistake watch ye therefore and pray always that you may be counted worthy to escape these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of god how many want to escape these things and stand before the son of man hallelujah that's where i want to be i already know these things are coming i already know they're here i know why they're here i know what's going on i know why i'm in a trial i know why i'm a believer i know all about the grace to have an opportunity i know all about the coming of the son of man what am i doing with it the minister of the son of man have control on my life does it have control in my home are my children being raised under the administration of the son of man because that's word made flesh see so it's all about the invisible becoming visible do my children see jesus christ when dad walks in do they see the word made flesh when mom moves through the house let's get a little quieter now take heed to yourselves what what what is what is our like brother matt was saying in the sunday school this morning you know we we have a completely different world view and it's it's shocking if the world doesn't see a different view of the world from you that's different than their view that this is happening and this is how they react but this same thing happened but you react differently here's something that happens in politics and it gives the world a certain attitude the same thing happens in politics and you got a different attitude altogether courts make decisions presidents write executive orders uh legislatures pass this and pass that and and the world gets all up in a tizzy with people's rights [Music] people's rights and everybody wants their right and everybody wants a free load nobody wants to take on the responsibility to take heed to themselves and make sure that the cares of life aren't aren't that you haven't over indulged on the cares of life until it affects your attitude toward god it affects your attitude toward god's people it affects your attitude toward god's word brother branham says here what here here here's the uh here's a piece of the master plan this will put a big piece of the puzzle together for you remember this is christ is the mystery of god revealed he is that tree of life contrary to the serpent seed see he that he's that seed the woman's seed the tree of life in the garden and lest they put forth their hands and move this tree they'd eat to the tree and live forever see they'd eat that tree and live forever in a fallen condition so that can't happen god's got to protect the word you can't understand it theologically because then you would never have to get a new birth and that's upside down to his plan so he hides the word people don't like that but god has to do it because man is forever trying to seek him through knowledge so god just disguises it and covers it up and uses angels to guard it and and causes prophets to say things that make people scratch their head and walk away and go it must be false go ahead go ahead go ahead say well can you answer this can you answer that you know i hear here's what here's my answer that was never a question when he was alive that was never and now you want to come along more more than half a century more than half a century later when he's gone can't defend himself can't clarify why he said this or did that when all the witnesses who didn't have any problem with what he was saying back there and now you come here and you can't find an evidence of this and just somehow you think lack of evidence is somehow evidence which is stupid and and and you can't answer this you can't answer that here's one thing i can answer you say do you have the answer here's my answer i know it changed me i know it made me look like this i know it made me love him i know it doesn't i know i don't i'm not wanting to leave this so i can backslide and go live like the rest of the world hallelujah say the rods are laid and god's going to show god's already showing it he's not waiting anymore the time of the delay is over he's now manifesting his life to a people hallelujah answer the question it wasn't a question a half century ago i was listening just yesterday here's brother branham on perseverance preach that message like eight or nine what are we thinking brother rich eight or nine times that was an important theme to god perseverance because you're gonna need it you're gonna have to be persevering he started preaching that back way back before the seals through the seals and after the seals because it's going to be one of the most fundamental pieces of equipment you're going to need hallelujah come on david you got it you better have some stones in that little bag you better be ready to take on a giant and he's there in new york city new york city and he's they they want to question the finnish boy oh because his story here doesn't match what was written in in in the magazine the editor of the magazine sitting there they just had a full gospel businessman meeting give me a break he's sitting right there and william branham starts telling about the finnish boy brought to life you don't hear demons going uh billy uh that's not right no you got that wrong he starts telling about the the little girl who took her braces off right there in those finland meetings he starts telling he goes down the list and telling all these things here's all these living witnesses who know it's true nobody he's not telling it in timbuktu this is new york city this is a global platform [Applause] brother jason why don't you just take and give us again and just take one sermon take a podcast give a definitive answer here's my problem here's my problem i'm gonna try to do that but here's my problem and i say this sincerely and i mean this it sounds humorous to me i chuckle at it but i mean it their questions are so dumb that i have a hard time having patience to even answer it why don't you just swallow a camel and strain at a gnat my goodness so he says here watch he says so the tree of life contrary to serpent seed i've got to hurry you see he's that seed the woman's seed the tree of life in the garden lest they put forth their hands move this tree they'd eat and live forever and and he's the only tree that can be taken that you can live forever his word is life his word is life you want to live his word is life and that be the word then the word of god which eve turned down in the garden of eden then here is christ the word made manifest it's interesting because not only could he say that then he could call for that pillar of fire and then prove what he's saying amen and when he come on earth he was the tree of life do you believe that and rome what did they do he had to be chopped down he had to be that's right he had to be chopped down and he was put on a tree of disgrace cursed is he that hangeth on a tree become a curse for the human race and now okay i told you i'm going to give you a big piece of the puzzle of your life you want to understand your life and now through that through him becoming the word in a man and through that man suffering the death on the cross through that tree of life being cut down now through that he brings forth a brag tree which will be the tree of life restored back to him as husband and wife in the garden of eden oh glory to god by the same word and the same god made manifest in husband and wife the same bride tree back again i understand my life a lot more today when i read that i just went wow so that's what's up with this no wonder no wonder he keeps driving me on because i'm part of something this thing's bigger than you friends and he's doing more in you than you are even aware of i appreciated brother ritchie last night in jeremiah 29 11. give me that brother josh jeremiah 29 11. brother richie read this for us last night for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord see thoughts of peace see that's why so my brother richie was talking about you know we don't need a plan god's got a plan he's already got a plan lord i you know uh i i need to know what to do here god already knows everything you need just let him lead he's already got i already know the thoughts that i think toward you i already know what i want to do with your life just let me take your hand brother richie said these people run around with a sign on their car god is my co-pilot brother rich said if he ain't driving i ain't riding amen for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord now catch it thoughts of peace not of evil to give you an expected end i i might can't explain every facet what's happening in your life or what's happened or how you were born or your family or you're raising or why you had to i don't know i but i do know this he knows you by name hallelujah i do know this he's got a plan for you and he's he's working hallelujah don't be discouraged friends he's busy hallelujah it might look like chaos but his thoughts of your peace it might look like you know it's all evil evil like like job got thinking that all this evil has befallen me but his thoughts were not of evil his thoughts were to bring that whatever he had to bring on your life that might look like chaos it might look like that it's uh that it's not that it's not peace you know it might look evil it might look bad but i'm i've got an expected end i'm coming to something if you'll just trust me if you'll just keep going forward if you'll just press if you'll just be aware if you'll just pray always just keep moving on keep moving on i got this it's like he said to gabriel i got this gabriel but the oncoming storm i got this gabriel i'll get him out before the full ride comes we were part of him before the foundation of the world we came from his spiritual genes so he he already has a thought of you and i said this last time i think it bears repeating again today we were in his thoughts but sometimes we need to stop and ask ourselves is how i'm living what he was thinking because i don't have thoughts of evil i don't have thoughts of you being a failure i i'm working on you to bring you out of that thing i'm not left you here just for you to keep lingering in that stuff i've already sent a power in the holy ghost and a word that can wash you and a power that can deliver you don't stay bound get free hallelujah be willing to be freed hallelujah i love that promise i'm going to close i'm going to stop today i've got more to say but we'll bring it to a stop i thought about this for a while ruth 3 18. in ruth 3 18. then she said sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he have finished the thing this day i'll tell you something friends no matter what is happening in the world today no matter how hopeless it may look i'm here to tell you he's not resting i want you to know that it looks like chaos it looks like fear it looks like darkness it looks like the the dark side is winning i'm here to tell you something he's not resting i don't care what your symptom is i don't care how you feel in your mind he's not resting he's working and he won't rest say when will he finally rest when i'm in a rapture when i've got a body change we'll rest in the millennium he said i'll no more eat this bread or drink this wine until i eat it and drink it anew with you in my father's kingdom he must already have a vision of you sitting there he already has a vision of me sitting there he won't rest this is the time i'll make this last comment this is probably where i'll go launch from when i pick up part three i want to say this and i touched on this previously but there's a lot more to say on it brother branham said that he was told on the other side i got your attention five minutes we're done he was told on the other side nothing will come in here but perfect love glory perfect love now that's a broader term than you might believe because while it is what you think about your brothers and sisters and how you act toward them it's also what you think about god's word it's also how you act towards god's word you see and so so when when we say perfect love the one of the things that the bible warns about in the last days is that men would love themselves more and lovers of of ungodliness lovers of sin lovers of pleasure more than they would love god see so you know what perfect love in its greatest sense is friends is you you love his word more than you love you and you stop gratifying your fallen flesh and you stop letting the devil take you down those dis disgraceful avenues of sin say yeah i can but i repent he forgives me you do and he does thank god we have an advocate with the father but perfect love is that bride who finally rises up and says though my flesh might be tempted to do that i love him more than i love my desire i want to have perfect love perfect love i want to say when the devil comes at me i want to i want to love the word i want to love god i want to say lord i yes i'm not my fallen stinking flesh it's tempted by that but i'm tired of loving me i'm tired of loving me i want to love you i want to love your word i want to have the right mental attitude toward every promise of god then you know what that does that produces the kind of love you need one toward another [Music] because this is the hour you're going to need it this is the hour where we're going to need perfect unbiased unfettered uncontaminated love one toward another man we gotta stop loving ourselves love one another above your own self love god above everything that's the greatest commandment to love of the lord your god with all your heart your mind and your soul but we spend a lot of time loving us we love that man in the mirror instead of that man on the cross we love our own desires we love our own needs we we pet our own pettiness when our brothers and sisters around us sometimes our children and our family are suffering because of it so stop loving you and start loving them more than you start loving god's people more than you start loving god's word more than you amen amen perfect love let's stand amen i said 60 minutes and i did it 59 and a half come brother bradley bring your team amen praise the lord there's more to say on it and i i am thankful to the lord today that i was i stand here perfectly happy in the way it went and everything that was said and my name is jason watkins and i agree with this message amen amen amen amen i support this message i stand by it amen amen i've sponsored it with my soul hallelujah give my whole life to it ain't turning back now no way what would it go back to what to go back to the the world are you kidding me i hate the world go back to sinfulness i hate that i didn't used to i do now what happened to you somebody changed your mind no somebody changed my nature somebody changed my whole nature i'm a brand new creation i i can't tolerate sin i can't tolerate it i can't tolerate it in you i can't tolerate it in me i i i want to be holy i want to be righteous say do you make mistakes i do but that only increases my desire more for it there's nothing about a failure that causes me to think i should just give up give up are you kidding me i just need to run harder i just need to press harder i need to fight harder amen oh i i thought i could have that little thing in my life and still be okay i see now that i can't gotta go sorry gotta go i thought i could have this friend i thought maybe this friend i could influence them and bring them to christ all they've done is get worse and become more sinful amen and it might come to a time where i have to go sorry but i i have a hard time loving someone who doesn't love him amen not trying to put anybody out the mercy of god can reach the deepest darkest sinner at any time any time of the day or night but i'm here to tell you something friends you gotta have to watch jesus said watch be careful pray don't get caught up in surfeiting over the world because what what that'll do to you is that'll that'll kill your spirituality and the things in the world to creep up on you and next thing you know you'll be in the grips of something heavy i have a really hard time getting out of it and even when you do young people young people even when you do and you finally come to your senses and come back to the word the deep wounds and scars you will bear i promise you you will never consider them worth it they weren't worth it every scar of failure i have was never worth it i wish i didn't have them and i i it just makes me that more much more determined to press the battle and see god the invisible god made visible in my life let's bow our heads oh great exalted one thou invisible god who desires to be visible [Music] lord i i'm i'm not desiring right now just just now i'm not standing here desiring to instruct anyone anymore i've spent an hour instructing people in your word enough has been said they should know now what the answer is and what to do and what the course you've already plotted a course and all they've got to do is take it i could look out over this audience and i could see the various needs lord as a shepherd and pastor that i'm aware of and i could say sister brother brother dear sister dear why don't you quit loving you more than you love him why don't you just lay that down and let that go and let let the god of love and peace the one who has pleasant thoughts of you why don't you let him rule and reign in your life lord i could spend another hours just preaching on that but i'm standing here right now and i'm saying it about me i'm asking everyone in this audience visible and invisible say right now lord me me what shall i do with jesus called the christ that's a very personal statement that was a message a prophet preached went to the whole world but it's an individual question like pilate said what shall i do brother branham said everybody's got to answer that for himself [Music] what shall i do with jesus called the christ and he's looking in my life he sees that entertainment i need to lay aside he sees that friend i need to walk away from he sees that attitude i need to let go he sees that fear that i need to step up and walk toward faith with [Music] he sees [Music] lord let every individual every man woman boy and girl let me let the people let this church let us stand in your presence this morning and say what shall i do i can't worry about brother so and so what is he going to do or what's he doing what about sister so-and-so what about that teenager i'll tell you i've never seen like what shall i do with jesus called the christ what is my decision today am i willing to give him my whole heart my whole mind all my actions all my reactions all my plans all my attitudes all my fears all my lusts am i willing to give all of that over to him and say lord come today be the lord and master over all of me be the boss of me lord give me that perfect love that is necessary to be pleasing to you i commit this audience today into your hands to that end in jesus name amen what's going to sing buddy [Music] sing it friends sing [Music] that's a prayer song that's a prayer [Music] song [Music] within me cast me not away ask me presents lord oh and take not thy holy spirit from me [Music] of thy salvation oh let's raise our hands all up over the building and sing it now create in me [Music] granted lord granted lord and renewed spirit within me within me within me lord [Music] oh [Music] all your hands up now lift those eagle wings oh [Music] [Music] is me not away from thy presence is [Music] salvation and renewables [Music] hallelujah hallelujah oh i wonder if we just give him a wave offering this morning lord why don't you wave at him and say lord i love you today i love you lord i love you i love you love your word i love your spirit i love your family hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen i want to sing blessed be sister dead blessed be and we're going to let you go and be dismissed and remind you today that we're yesterday we reopened the fellowship hall and so we'll have brother richie there for those of you who want to ask him a gazillion questions amen i promise you brother richie can talk so just feel free to get moved amen praise the lord and uh brother andy and sister joy they're going to hang out with us a little while so uh we're gonna go get some grub come back and feed them when they when they leave here they'll be fed up [Music] and full of love and full of the spirit of god full of kentucky fried chicken amen praise the lord we've been looking forward to reopening it and it presents its own conundrum i mean you know brother jason wow you know we're gonna wear mask in there no we're not but fellowship poison isn't a mandate coming to church is a mandate so you know we we we're commanded to come and gather in church so we try to keep try to keep safety standards as best we can there's no perfect answer to it friends i promise you there's flaws in my methodology there's flaws in yours if i let you be in charge of it it's it's unsettling times what do all we can do is the best we can do so uh but hey that's voluntary if you don't if you don't feel safe then then that's okay god bless you we're gonna have some fellowship if you want to come you're welcome to come and fellowship with us so that's kind of the difference because i had that question in my mind jesus what's the diff i said well you know as soon as i asked the lord that he said well to gather in church you're commanded to do that so you're not commanded to come to a fellowship hall and just sit around and eat and talk but it's a good thing to do a lot of strength in it hey man so amen we're you know you know what we don't want you know this is what the world's turning into we don't want a police state here i want this church to be a police state we don't want to it's not about that you know this is all just about love and and respect one for another that's all it is it's really all it is we need to we're going to need perfect love ain't we hallelujah amen so god bless you what'd i say i want to sing to heaven [Music] oh blessed be your name your name blessed god bless your friend blessing you dismissed in jesus blessed me oh blessed be your name blessed me blessed me [Music] [Applause] [Music] blessed [Music] [Music] glory glory to you oh blessing me blessed me your name [Music] [Applause] me [Applause] [Music] me [Music] glory to your name [Music] bless me [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] hey [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] flat i think [Music] peace [Music] an only new life [Music] and only in you i am secured [Music] and [Music] [Music] me cover me when i am hurting cover me when i'm not strong cover me when i am going [Music] cover me when my faith is gone let the peace that passes on i understand [Music] god [Music] god [Music] [Applause] through the storm [Music] and only in your eyes [Music] i [Music] me [Music] when i am going through the storm
