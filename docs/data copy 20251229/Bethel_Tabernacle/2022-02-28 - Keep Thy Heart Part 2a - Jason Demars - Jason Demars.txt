========================================

and gracious heavenly father we come before you lord and we want to dedicate this time to you and ask that your presence would come and speak to our hearts lord that you'd help me to step out of the way and let your spirit just flow through to your people to their hearts father we ask these things in jesus name amen we're going to continue on speaking on the subject keeping keep thy heart and scripture we're going to read to start is proverbs 4 23 keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life amen you can be seated the word keep there means to protect or to maintain and the word diligence there means to guard or to keep the post so to keep thy heart it's speaking of maintenance right so when you have a vehicle what happens if you don't change the oil ever right it it's going to explode here you're going to destroy your engine and nothing's going to function right and you have put in the junkyard so what happens to a christian that doesn't do regular maintenance on their heart well it doesn't mean you stop being a christian because once you have the holy ghost you're sealed until the day of your redemption but you can become an extremely ineffective weak christian that is unable to really function the way that god has designed for you to function so there has to be regular maintenance not just of the outward things why go to church and i look the part no on the inside your heart because you can look the part i mean look at the pharisees professionals professionals at being fakers they they follow up paul paul speaks you know in a sense quite glowingly of his devotion to the law and in regards to the law he said he was blameless and you know he said i was a pharisee of the pharisees and yet his heart caused him to persecute jesus christ and so it's not about outward obedience it's about the condition of your heart that's what jesus emphasis was that's what the emphasis of the gospel altogether is and in fact even the old testament speaks clearly up there's something that we need to watch over our heart we need to do regular maintenance and we need to do it with diligence so maintain thy heart as keeping the post anybody knows what keeping the post beans is your your job in the military is a guard and you're guarding a station and you're saying this one it has to be protected we can't let any enemies come in this direction only authorized personnel and so this is the same thing that the the lord is speaking to us through this proverb is that we need to be guarding our hearts like it's like our life depends on it because it actually does and then that next part for out of it are the issues of life in other words it determines the course of your life think about that for a minute it can be religious you can be a quote unquote message believer but unless you're guarding your heart unless your heart is in the right condition you'll be doing it for the wrong reasons your religious pride and it's a stink in god's nostrils god doesn't it's not pleasing to the lord just to follow the outward motions if your motive is wrong if your motive is to be seen by people and to be politically correct in the message i'm not saying politically correct for the world none of us want to be that but politically correct for the message and fit in and follow a certain order and we've got to be this your heart is probably a million miles from god it's not about looking the part and fitting in with everybody else it's about being who god made you to be otherwise we're all useless if we're just here to fit the part to sit in a pew and say amen to the preacher and make the preacher feel good and and sound good and look good no that's not what god's after he's after a body that works and functions all together in unity and isn't isn't it amazing the only way it'll work together in unity is each of us get our eyes off of each other and get our eyes on christ and say i want to be pleasing to him no matter what even if the whole world abandons me even if i'm the all alone even if i have to make a stand and it causes people to hate me and continually speak out against me i'm going to take a stand because i want my heart to be right before anything else it's not about politics message politics it's not about being pleasing to the great pastors and the quote-unquote senior pastors of the message that's not what we exist for we exist to please god that's what the message teaches us time and time again our heart has to be right and when our heart is right that will that will determine the correct course of your life but if your heart isn't right i don't care how many times you go to church how many times you do outwardly the things that you're supposed to do you're not even saved yet salvation is something where your heart is changed now we can all go through times and seasons as born-again believers where we're not thinking right we're not acting right we've done the wrong thing god will correct that god will deal with that but the thing is you've got to get your eyes off of outward appearances and onto the heart because that what that's what god is dealing with and when your heart is right then the rest of it will be right but if your heart is not right and you're just following it on the outside that's fine that's the best the best way to live is the christian life but that's not spiritual that's not salvation that's just mimicking other people our brother branham says that's just being able to read and come to a logical conclusion no you have to have the token dwelling in your heart not on your flesh not on your spirit brother branham says that over and over again you can be anointed on the flesh you can be anointed in your spirit i don't mean you're that saved that just means there's an anointing no it's something that comes in your soul changes you and directs your life and corrects you and convicts you of sin and leads you in the issues of life in the direction of your life this is from a puritan writer john flavel a book that he wrote on proverbs 4 23 actually he says god rejects all duties how glorious so ever in other respects which are offered him without the heart he that performs duty without the heart that is heedlessly is no more accepted with with god than he that performs it with a double heart that is hypocritically in other words just what i was saying outward obedience for the sake of being seen by others is not pleasing to the lord it's not what god wants from us he wants our heart to be on fire he wants our heart to be in the midst of it so that what we're doing is coming from that transformed nature god is not pleased with just mere duty he wants your heart jesus teaching i'm just going to go quickly over these in the sermon on the mount i mentioned it last week motivation matters in god's sight if the motive of your heart is wrong you can you no matter what you do it's not pleasing to the lord take heed that you do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise you have no reward of your father which is in heaven your reward when your motivation is to be seen by people and you're seen by people you have your reward but if your motive is to be obedient to the lord to glorify him and to help others and you do it discreetly you have a reward in heaven amen and when you pray don't be don't be like the hypocrites they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets nothing wrong with that you should do that why not you should pray in church you should pray on the street paul says lift up hands everywhere right without wrath or doubting so it isn't condemning praying in church and praying in public no but it's the motive of the heart doing it to be seen by people doing it to sound intelligent and spiritual that's you're going to receive your reward right there which is everyone's going to think he's intelligent and spiritual that's we want answered prayer we don't want to just big heads we want answered prayer we want god to move through our prayers and if our heart isn't right he's not going to do it when you fast be not as the hypocrites of a sad countenance for they disfigure their faces that they may appear unto men to fast verily i say unto you they have their reward but thou will now fastest anoint thine head and wash thy face that thou appear not unto men to fast but unto thy father which is in secret and thy father which sees in secret shall reward you openly again the motive of the heart jesus is looking at this he's not saying what they're do what they're doing is wrong in fact in in this scripture about fasting it says repent in sackcloth and ashes in the old testament it it commands them to do that on the day of atonement they are supposed if they're going to be obedient they're supposed to do that what is jesus saying he's not saying don't ever do that what he's saying let your mot what is your motive what is your objective okay on the day of atonement do that but you're doing that all twice a week just so people see that you're a good good in good standing as a member of the pharisees that's not that's not why we do it that's not why we come to church that's not why we we we pray that's not why we seek the lord we don't do it because we want to want to look good we want to have our position and place in church we do it whether anybody sees it or not amen amen this is from the amplified version psalm 4 verse 3 and 4 we're going to read but know that the lord has set apart for himself and dealt wondrously with the godly man the one of honorable character and moral moral courage the one who does right the lord hears and responds when i call to him tremble with the anger of fear and do not sin meditate in your heart upon your bed and be still and they add there reflect upon reflect on your sin and repent of your rebellion so this this verse is is telling us we need to cons we need to consider watch over our lives and check our hearts check our motives check the reason why we're doing things and and just look at our lives did i speak something on a place that would have hurt somebody that would have heard somebody did i do something and we we need to we need to examine our hearts we can't just live and go on and say oh well we need we need to have hearts that are repentant sorrowful for the the things that we've done wrong and then we we confess our sin to the lord and then we get up and we move forward but but we can't live in such a heedless life just hurdling ourselves forward and not considering our ways and our in our doings this is andrew murray in one of his books on prayer he says shut the world out withdraw from all worldly thoughts and occupation and shut yourself in alone with god to pray to him in secret let this be your chief object in prayer i love this to realize the presence of your heavenly father let that be our heart and our motivation when we go in prayer you know we want to keep our heart you can't do that without being a person of prayer if you just whisper a five-minute prayer on the way to work that's good but you need you need to take time alone with god you need to dedicate yourself to this art of praying from the blind bartimaeus 1957 brother branham says and it's there that when the greatest revelation and inspiration comes is say he he didn't say the greatest time where revelation and inspiration comes is at the church service sorry guys the greatest place where there is inspiration and revelation is you alone with god god works through the ministry god works for the preaching of the word i'm not not saying that he doesn't i'm saying that in order for that word to get in you you need to get alone with god and meditate on those things so that the spirit of god comes and permeates your very being not just i come to church i go to church i hear it and then it's just out of your head from then on it should be something that we're meditating on praying over seeking the lord over this is
