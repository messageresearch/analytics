========================================

good morning good morning do we have do we have sound this morning amen God bless you let's all stand to our feet amen praise the Lord let's just uh let's just open with the word of prayer this morning amen Heavenly Father we thank you for this day Lord we thank you for the another opportunity to gather in your house Lord Jesus and hear your word father we pray that it would bring you glory father Lord I pray that it could just edify the people Lord be with the entirety of the service today Lord we love you and we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen let us turn in our Bibles we're going to start with a scripture in Proverbs we're going to just do two verses so we're going to go to proverbs 4 and vers s and then we're going to move over into James 1 and verse 5 so this is um a part two from several weeks ago angles part two and this this morning I'd like to take uh like a subtitle if you will on perspective amen just give you a second to turn so proverbs 4 and verse 7 says wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding amen and let's turn into our Bibles to James 1 and verse 5 it's after [Music] Hebrews right before Peter James 1 and verse 5 and it says if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and abrath not and it shall be given to him amen God bless you as you take your seats this morning so in that previous lesson uh several weeks ago just a quick recap this morning um the inspiration had come from a story in a sermon where brother Brenham talks about a a sculptor a sculpture and there was this couple that was on a tour and and they began gazing at this sculpture and now these folks were were Christians but the tour guide began to notice that they were gazing at this particular um uh sculpture and and in a in a particular way and the couple recognized that this was a piece of art and that this piece of art was somehow supposed to represent Jesus on the cross and represent his sufferings but they were almost disappointed because of how it it seemed that the artist had portrayed Jesus it was it seemed like he just didn't he didn't put as much into it as they thought he should it was it was such little detail you know they felt like it didn't really portray the sufferings that Christ had gone through and the man that they were with it was some kind of a tour guide said that they weren't the first to say that or to say something like that but he drew them closer to the work of art and he said if you want to fully appreciate the entirety of it of the vision that the artist had you have to go directly in front of it and you'll notice that there's a place to kneel down amen and and they so they went there and there was a place to kneel down and they and they knelt down and this T this couple they took his advice and went in front of this artwork and as The Story Goes that they were both brought to tears to see at what depth the artist went into articulating the sufferings of Christ but it could only be appreciated at a certain angle amen it wasn't just by Pastor passing by that they could appreciate the entirety of it and and what the depth of what the artist was trying to articulate amen and so what the what the couple realized that just by passing by and people that would pass by and weren't willing to kneel down they would never see the sculpture and what the artist created in its entirety amen and it was all about perspective and and that was the whole point to get you a little bit closer to the image amen it was all about the angle of view and so we had went down a certain path last time with wisdom and with humility today we're going to deal with perspective so the simple the Oxford definition in the dictionary of perspective is a particular attitude toward or a way of regarding something a point of view you know sometimes I believe that if we can change our perspective on a matter then we're able to see a better outcome we're able to get out of our own mental headp space and and move into a realm of of possibility a realm of Faith you know pastors been preaching on that Faith amen and today and next next week's lesson um because I get Sunday school next week too am me and we're going to look into those two elements and how they blend together you know so in art perspective is actually a technique that artists use to create depth or the illusion of depth on a flat surface they they create what looks like At first is two-dimensional and they add a dimension to make it a 3dimensional object so in other words in order to have a certain amount of depth to the image the work of art it takes perspective amen that's a good concept in our in our life and in order to fully operate as a as a Christian in maturity and take your walk with Christ past just being surf surface level religion and add some depth to it I believe it takes some perspective amen and it takes seeing things from the lens that God sees it from God's perspective on it amen and I want to go through uh a few examples this morning morning um but I want to I want to drive that point down rather than staying in the natural realm all the time that's what Pastor trying to to drive down what rather than staying in the natural all the time to look in this in the Supernatural in the spiritual through the lens of of how God is looking at it amen because what what happens often times with myself maybe I'm the only one but we often times we get ourselves trapped into seeing things that are happening in happening in our life from a certain angle or or a very narrow perspective amen I hope I'm not the only one um sometimes it's just as simple as as we're living in a faithless society amen and we're just constantly bombarded with distractions that's just the way that it is and that's why it's so crucial to separate yourself from the things of the world to get alone with God and let God minister to your heart and allow him to see things with greater depth amen and I believe we all want greater depth in our life uh and you know that's the importance of coming to church that's the importance of hearing the word go forth of reading your Bible of hearing the tapes those things matter and you know I can't tell you how many times especially lately that I've come to these junctures in my life even recently you know where I I've felt like such a failure in some of those Avenues oh yeah anybody anybody there with me I I can look back at times in my life where I felt like I had really good habits in of reading my Bible of of listening to these tapes and my prayer life seemed like it was in a better place and my Faith seemed like it was better then or greater then than it is now I don't know if anybody else gets to thinking like that but then I started to think about you know then I started to think about if I could get myself you know back in that place somehow you know and and say Lord forgive me about the place that I'm in now let me get back to that place where maybe I felt so elevated but as I began thinking on this subject and the Lord began dealing with me on this subject you know I believe that we ought to strive for greater depths than what we used to be in amen because that was fine and good for that time in our life amen we were dealing and battling with things at our life at that point and that's where we needed to be and I know maybe sometimes we're not exactly where we should [Music] be amen amen pardon this Interruption here praise the Lord don't know what that meant amen God is good all the time but a song of Praise In This Heart of Mine amen we're just going to press on right now cuz I don't have sound but that's okay um but you know we get to being in this place where we want to get back to where we used to be amen and I sometimes I I I want to I I do that I I look back and I'm saying Lord I want to be there but we're not supposed to Look Backwards amen we're supposed to look forwards we're supposed to look at what God wants us to be in now because now we're dealing deal with different things than we were dealing with then so we're in a different battle than we are than we were at that point so God needs us to have greater depth in our Christian walk he needs us to have a a different you know having a prayer life those things are fundamental and you got to have those things so you know if you need to get back to that part of it then definitely get back to that part of it but he wants you to to go further in your further than you were amen he wants you to have a prayer life where it's where it's just a constant an intercession you're constantly in fellowship with him maybe maybe you don't have time to get on your knees you know two hours a day like you wish you could I don't I I I wish I did I don't have the time but if I'm constantly praying the Bible says without ceasing throughout my day then you're able to be in prayer you're able to be in fellowship with God the way that he intends it to be and he knows he knows that you're constantly inundated with society and inundated with things but if you can just set yourself set your mind mind decide even when you're doing things even when you're driving down the road even even whatever you're doing you can be in fellowship with the Creator amen and I believe that's that's a a place that we ought to strive for um you know as we Face new challenges in our life right and and as even as spiritually strong as you felt like you were at that point God wants you to to to push forward um you know because it's no longer the reality of of you right now that back then is no longer the reality of what you're facing now amen and God wants us to press towards the mark meaning looking forward looking ahead amen and and that's that's such a huge tactic that the enemy uses in your life is to keep you looking behind even in past Victory you're supposed to look at your past Victory and allow it to help you grow but if you only are looking at your past you're not being able to focus on your future and I was just thinking about about you know that scripture where it says remember Lot's wife you know she had this message of Deliverance she had this this this this opportunity to be delivered from something but she was so focused on her heart was some so far back in in in Sodom that she couldn't look forward amen she she didn't have that that ability in her heart um amen so the devil getting back to the tactics he knows you know he he knows how it works he knows if there's no life behind your testimony then he's keeping you at a standstill you know maybe maybe yesterday was a failure maybe you haven't done things the way that you felt you ought to you know this is just a reminder that you don't have to let those things condemn you amen you take a little half step and just and realign yourself right now and then you can use the devil's tactic on him and say look those things there's no condemnation in me I you're right I was a failure yesterday you're right I didn't pray enough yesterday but today a new day and I'm going to strive and press toward the mark because I I don't need to look in the past I need to look forward amen and remind him that he's that he's defeated and that every failure you have you know every failure you have is Washed by the blood of the Lamb amen and it's accounted on his behalf not on yours um and that you're living in Victory so with this concept of what artists call perspective um this is a definition that that I began to look at over the last several days and the definition in the world of art is the art of drawing solid objects on a two-dimensional surface so as to give the right impression of their height width depth and position in related to each other when viewed from a particular point so in other words it creates a realistic sense to the image amen and it it allows you to to see the image from the Viewpoint that the artist intended from it so it creates depth on the on a flat surface it's an added it's an added Dimension and so you know just in simple terms you you know it it takes a picture that you're looking at and it adds it adds almost if I could put it like this it adds a reality to it amen and so they can't trace it back exactly to where it was invented One Source I I came across they they thought maybe that it was in the fifth fifth century uh another source noted that it was around the 15th century that this concept came about called linear perspective am me and linear perspective it was an artist and architect named filipo and he added this dimensional concept to his architecture that allowed him to draw a building to look exactly as it did in real life amen it so it was it was beforehand and I was looking at some pictures this morning if you look at a at uh nonprospective pictures before this point they would draw people it was almost like they were above the other people to make it look like they were behind them but then he added this this perspective Ive Point these geometrical angles to make it look as if you were looking at the real image of it to make it look like it was a reality amen and I'm probably butcher butchering this with some with some artists but just um concept of the spiritual types that it that it came about just really struck me and what I like to think about is this that around the time that the Holy Ghost came that's the time that real perspective was born into the life of a believer amen you know it was always the Holy Ghost always would come and anoint even in the Old Testament would come and anoint but it was the Holy Ghost that did that right but now when the Holy Ghost came he was able to indwell within us and give us a perspective that God you know and we're going to get to this in just a minute if I have if we have time but when God was training the disciples he would even and we're going to get to that specific story about the fishes and the loaves I'm getting ahead of myself but he he said go I I have these people that I want to be fed and he said what food do you have and so the disciples said well I found this you know we're all familiar with that story you know we have this this this boy and he's got fishes and Loaves but how are we ever GNA I mean we're how we going to feed 5,000 people without with that amount of food you know so what they were doing is they were they had a human perspective a human side to it this doesn't make any sense but God's perspective showed that it didn't matter the the physical materials of or the or the the the sustenance that they were looking at then God had a different perspective on it amen and he was trying to show them he was trying to bring out look there is a reality behind this and he was trying to bring it out because he knew that eventually amen he was trying to know because eventually they would have to have a Ministry without him without without the physical aspect of Jesus they were going to have a Ministry of of the son of man without the son of man physically being there amen and that's what he was trying to get them to to to realize look you're G to you're going to go and Peter and and brother Jason kind of touched on this a lot better than I will but he he said you know when when Peter came to that gate beautiful you know and he started they started having these Miracles and they he started all these things started following his life there was a a a perspective because he was able to look back and remember that Jesus performed these things it didn't make sense but it doesn't have to make sense with the senses that we feel and see and hear and taste and smell there's a different sense there's something that that is that is over top of the senses that we have amen and it and it indwells within you today as a Believer sitting in these pews amen so this concept of of linear perspective is that it takes these these pieces of art these drawings and it adds a sense of of depth to it amen and we kind of touched touched on that um you know and so the disciples when they had this and they watched and perform those miracles Jesus said and I wanted to read this quote from Brother brandham In 1953 he said in prep the sermon preparation he said one time there was this little boy that came to Jesus the whole 5,000 and this is just to help you help you realize the point of view that we're coming from the whole 5,000 people that were hungry the little boy had five biscuits and two and three fishes wasn't very much in his hands but when it once got into Jesus's hands it f thousands see while it was in his hands it was just a few biscuits so while it was in while it's in our hands it may not seem like very much and it could hardly even feed the boy himself but in the hands of Christ it fed thousands amen so that little faith this is this is a direct quote brother brandom says 1953 in preparation 1111 that little faith that you've got tonight just enough to get you out to the church turn it loose amen you turn that thing that you have that faith that that that faith that you have you turn it loose you let God take a hold of it you let God have his perspective in your life and he takes those few loaves those few fishes when he creates these things that you didn't even you didn't even know were possible amen it's it's in so in the operation of of Faith you've got to take your sight on the matter and you place place it into the hands of Jesus the the great artist amen and just like a great artist will do he's the one that adds the depth to it amen you know um just in a just thinking about this if you've ever had you know a friend or maybe just an acquaintance rather and you just feel like you couldn't you could never maybe connect with them anybody have that you know you just you just felt like you just couldn't maybe you didn't know them very long or whatever it was you couldn't get maybe past the small talk there wasn't really any depth to your to your relationship amen and you know maybe there was just no relationship there you know maybe it's because you haven't spent enough time together or you haven't really gone through anything together but regardless it's just um it's just a two-dimensional friendship right it God wants more than that with us amen he wants he wants he wants something with greater depth and that that's why he allows trials to come that's why they're more precious to us than gold amen because it brings us to an elevated depth of of fellowship with him and that's what Jesus was was trying to teach his disciples in his ministry one day he wasn't going to be with them anymore and brother Jason is probably tired of me stealing his material but um one day he wouldn't physically be with them anymore but he wanted to show them how to operate the way that he would operate amen and to see things from his perspective and I wanted to touch on this if I could I just have a few minutes now and this is what I wanted to get to this morning this is kind of the core of my my heart is looking at Paul in 2 Corinthians which is a familiar reading we're just going to pick it up today 2 Corinthians chap 12 we're going to read um verses 1 1 through eight and it says it is not expedient for me doubtless to Glory I will come to visions and Revelations of the Lord I knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago whether in the body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth such as one caught up to the third heaven and I knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable Words which it is not even lawful for a man to utter of such un will I Glory yet of myself I will not Glory but in mine infirmities for though I would desire to Glory I should not be I shall not be a fool for I will say the truth but now I forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me and lest I should be exalted above the measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure and this is the this is the part I want to focus on for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me amen and we're all familiar with that Paul had this infirmity this aspect of his natural body that was clearly causing him grief and and travail and I want to point out here that it caused him so much grief that this wasn't just your run-of-the-mill trial he was so vexed for this thing that he actually felt to bring it up to the creator of the universe three times amen he sought the Lord three times on this matter and when God went to go answer his prayer he answered it was something that was going to be more powerful than a natural healing he said my strength is made perfect in weakness in verses 9 he said my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakless most gladly therefore will I rather glory in mine infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me therefore I take pleasure in mine infirmities in reproaches in Necessities in persecutions in distresses for Christ's sake for when I am weak then I am I strong so Paul had this revelation of this situation that he was in from his trial that would give more glory to God than if it were if he were to physically heal me and looking at that at that scripture to be able to actually have that kind of testimony it takes a real witness a real presence of Christ in your life to have an infirmity is one thing but to be able to take pleasure in it is a whole another thing Paul was able to add this whole new layer of perspective to his situation you know because what happens when when we're going through things sometimes physically or or mind battles we often pray for instant relief amen who who else does that I me and that's not a bad thing we all we want that it's instant relief because it's something that we're physically dealing with right here and right now and I know that's the that's sometimes the very first thing that I that I've done and that have and probably will do but we read that the trying of your faith worketh patience right and that we're supposed to let patience have her per work so that we can be perfect and entire wanting nothing direct quote out of James 1: 3 and 4 amen so in order for us to have this layer of faith into our lives we ought to seek the Lord's will for this infirmity or anything that we go through as a Believer because it's not just happen stce that you're going through this thing amen it's for our perfecting and if the first thing the and I don't want I don't want you to get caught up in in this in shackles here cuz you don't need to live with that forever amen he's going to he is the he is the Lord that Health our diseases amen he is faithful and he's true and he will deliver you of that thing but my my objective from this morning and this is how the Lord dealt with me is that we ought to approach that from a different perspective and be able to say before we pray for immediate relief or if that's the first thing that we get to let's say Lord I I know that this is obviously something that you knew I was going to have to go through before I even went through it you saw this it went across your desk so there's something that you want me to learn from it maybe there's something that you want somebody else to learn from it I don't know Lord help me get whatever it is out of this situation that you need me to get from it amen that's the prayer that I want to pray from now on that when I'm going through something it doesn't it doesn't matter if it's physical mental whatever Lord help me to learn from this and then because I know you have always delivered me I know you're going to deliver me Lord that that should be a clear expectation he's going to deliver you of whatever it is that is a solid expectation that God is the Healer of your diseases mentally physically spiritually and every way amen but Lord help me to have a different layer a different depth a different perspective and say Lord help me learn from this thing help me help me understand what it is that you want me to grow how you want me to grow from this situation amen who else wants that I want to have that let to let patience if we wouldn't if we wouldn't ever do that then if we always pray for immediate relief and then if that's how how it ends up happening if we get that we would never be able to reach that level of maturity that we're ordained for amen patience would never have her perfect work that God intended for in our lives because we would never be going through anything you know if I had you know if I had a headache right then and then two minutes later you know I prayed instant relief i' have no headache well where's the trial there amen and I I don't want that to again I don't want that to get you caught up in that you don't have to live in that I'm just trying to get you to have a different perspective on what we're going through in life amen we all desire relief from our hardships amen and we all we all we that's a normal thing we know that God is is faithful but there is also something greater that he wants from us amen and that's for us to live and walk as adopted Sons and Daughters of Christ with maturity with true faith and with the true attributes of his divine nature amen and the Lord has just been dealing with me heavy on this for the past several days amen I want the Lord to just add layers of depth in my Christian walk so before I could just go right into praying for just a certain Deliverance that I can let my desire first to be Lord bring me bring out the lesson in which you want me to learn from this circumstance amen help me have if I have the wrong attitude if I've if I've grown to have bitterness in it Lord change my heart maybe it's as simple as the Lord is trying to to activate your faith in a certain area so that you can you can take that thing and you can make it a reality because God placed within you of Faith amen he'll shape it amen say Lord help me Lord Lord help me Heavenly Father we thank you for this day we ask that you would just Lord bring this word alive into our hearts I pray you'd be with the minist ministry Lord Jesus be with brother Jason as he brings the word into our hearts Lord Jesus Through Your Holy Spirit father we love you and we commit our ways to you in Jesus name amen God bless you
