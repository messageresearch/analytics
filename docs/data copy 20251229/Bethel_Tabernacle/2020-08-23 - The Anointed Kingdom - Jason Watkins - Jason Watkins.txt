everybody that can sing get a song together yes i'm gonna start mixing this up a little bit calling on the family of guarding man let's get brother travis knows the hand again [Music] [Applause] i'd like to give a quick testimony about these special when i was on a job i had a little little boy's name came up named cody and it was this little boy's grandson who was i was working with him doing ac work and the little boy had brain cancer and they had to go in and take out a big mass in his brain and his he didn't respond to it very well and so i began to put in prayer requests for this little boy and so brad yance from up in tennessee heard about it and next time he came down he actually brought me what a brother brand's prayer cloth so um next chance i got i went over there and uh i was able to sit with him so his mother the back story is his mother abandoned him before he had this brain cancer his mother abandoned him his grandparents were just the not the best people they were they smoked in the house i mean here's this boy with cancer and they're just it's a pretty awful situation the boys probably never heard about the lord never went to church never probably heard gospel songs so i began to i went over there to pray for him and uh and so i had these this songs on my heart and uh so the boy is completely you know he's uh you know he's not conscious he's he's on the bed he has bald head he's about 10 years old and so i went in there and began to talk with him even though maybe he couldn't hear me i began to talk with them and so i put this the prayer cloth in his hand and i began to talk with him and i began to sing these songs to him and then i felt his little hand like squeeze that prayer cloth and it was just a and and it was wonderful because several months later i asked how the boy was and so the doctors basically gave him up uh just um as brain dead you know and so several months later i talked to his granddad again he said he's up he's running around he's on his computer playing and he's he's miraculously healed so so this is the two specials that i sing for him but but i need help if you could sing with [Music] me [Music] yes [Music] all things are possible [Music] me all things are possible oh [Music] jesus is amen praise the lord [Applause] [Music] how many's ready for the word amen unless then let's sing a little bit his strength is perfect when our strength is gone i'll just sing a few of the courses of this song his strength is perfect when our strength is gone he'll carry us when we can't [Music] become strong strength is perfect his strength is purpose his strength is burned when our strength is gone he'll carry us when we can't [Music] if strength is perfect [Music] history is safe i can do all things through christ that gives me friends times i wonder what he can do no glory of my own yet my weakness there to let me know his strength is gone he'll carry us when we can carry on raising his power [Music] his strength is perfect his strength is strength is perfect when our strength is gone he'll carry us when we can't carry on raising his power that we become strong strength is perfect his strength is purple his strength is perfect [Music] when we can carry on in his power though we become strong aren't you glad his strength is perfect his strength is perfect amen praise the lord i'm glad for perfect strength and perfect weakness amen i'm glad that it's really all on the lord today you know it's unsettling times that we're in but yet god is in a hundred percent control of it all and i rejoice in that i truly mean that with all of my heart amen we're going to invite you in the scripture this morning the second timothy chapter 3. amen 2 timothy chapter 3. [Music] i wish to by the help of the lord begin what will likely be a two-part sermon i feel quite certain i can't get to it all today and so we're we're not really going to try to do that amen okay so that's not going to work that's fine ii timothy chapter 3 verse 1 by the help of the lord i want to speak today on the anointed kingdom the anointed kingdom a few verses here we'll catch verses one through four amen this know also that in the last days you believe we're there perilous times shall come here's a prophecy for men or mankind humanity for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god amen let's pray father we thank you for your word that's been read this morning thank you for the singing and the worship and the people in attendance father i pray your great blessing be upon speaker and hearer hearers both here live and hearers across the stream father we commit ourselves into your hands today if we're if there was ever an hour where we need you to be in 100 percent control of every aspect of our lives it's this day this hour this moment lord we need you more than ever before so we commit ourselves to you now for service lord to assist you to bring the word in jesus name amen god bless your friends you can be seated now for some reason on my remote app um brother kevin i don't see the connection so it's okay i'll let you guys run it uh from the back amen we're not going to worry about technology today amen this is an hour where we just want to have our minds constant concentrated on the word you believe that amen and allow the lord to bring it to us in the way that he chooses the anointed kingdom amen um if you will just give me my first title slide um brother gideon god bless you i'm happy to see that handsome face back there today amen i mean all y'all they're handsome too so i'm just amen amen praise the lord the anointed kingdom colossians 1 27 this is a just a quick reference because i want to take that as a subtitle christ in you and brother branham is going to make a statement here um first next slide for the gideon he says in the message called out 1958 now i want you to to be aware of how he's going to word this because he's talking about the time um at belted chasers feast at the end of the babylonian kingdom and they bring in daniel to interpret writing on the wall me name taco you farsen and it means you've been weighed in the balance and found wanting now don't read ahead of me just pay attention right here first um that is a direct direct correlation to this hour that's where we are all right so now let's look at brother branham in this statement here he says i pray eternal blessed god that just at this moment that you'll send your spirit in such a blast that it'll shake the sin shackles of unbelief away from this audience wouldn't that be a wonderful thing today amen can you say lord this audience and may they be filled just now with faith say amen and power right that they may be healed now watch him address the devil satan your days are numbered your kingdom now that's an important point uh and don't switch to latia g man your kingdom has been numbered you're weighed in the balance and found wanting so now he's literally going to take this passage from a true story in the old testament as it relates to the time where israel was in captivity to the babylonians they were about to be overrun by the medo-persian empire they didn't realize it that while they're there in their drunken festival disrespecting the articles from the temple of the lord using the very cups and using the very instruments that had been dedicated to god by solomon and they're making a mockery of god's vessels amen that's an important point and and they're they're they're the the interpretation is that your weight in the balance this kingdom belted chaser your kingdom has been weighed in the balance and is found wanting and even now while the prophecy is going forward to you right while the interpretation of the word is being declared to you by a prophet the enemy has already gone under your defenses and has breached your defenses and you don't realize it you're already under invasion and in a matter of no time you're all going to be dead now that hour has repeat has repeated so so we find then that the sign and this is an important point as i get started that the sign in the days of daniel was a pronouncement on this age at the end time he says your kingdom your kingdom has been numbered not people this is not god coming down at the end time and just saying oh you know you've got a bad person in this position there's a bad politician or a bad preacher or a bad school teacher or you know somebody with social influence this isn't individuals this is now an entire kingdom is about to crumble and we're living in the days of the kingdom of the devil but i want to introduce to you today that there's an anointed kingdom anointed and anointed of god who is here today right now in satan's eden to resist that kingdom of the enemy it is our job as it was in daniel's day to interpret the word to the people say but i'm not daniel i'm not a prophet i can't interpret unknown writings don't worry it's been done for you the unknown writing the cryptic passages the mystery the prophecies have been made known by a prophet and given to you and now now the ministry not the office the office of son of man and william branham went home but the ministry of the son of man which is christ in you living in flesh that's here now and that makes this a son of man ministry and that's a prophetic ministry so don't ever think that you're less empowered because brother branham has gone home i'm here to tell you his homegoing more empowered you because it just as john was an anointed word for his day john the baptist standing in the water was christ just like jeremiah in his day was christ because christ means the anointed word and when the anointed word is made manifest then you then then that's a christ that's an anointed word that's a living representative of god now living in a human being amen so then when john i'll ask you this question was it was it did god get overran by the devil when john was executed in prison not at all god wasn't overran god didn't have to go back to the drawing board when john perished had his head taken off of him prophets have suffered that kind of grizzly ends you know time immemorial and we find that but it was a perfect transition because the anointed word had to go from the prophet to christ jesus the word now alive and there was a prophet in our day but i'm here to tell you something friends that same anointing didn't leave the bride it empowers the bride to be the final voice we understand that amen so now we find that there is a kingdom of christ and there is a kingdom of antichrist and the kingdom of christ is to oppose the kingdom of the antichrist and to declare the hidden mystery that's what daniel did he declared a hidden mystery amen so we declare what a prophet has said but more importantly than that we declare the prophet's words made alive in us listen if all your if all you can do is declare what god did in the life of william branham and you don't have that same declaration in your life then all you're doing is declaring history you're just you're just recounting a historical event you know that you you you don't move devils that way the sons of skeva tried that because they had they had been to church they had heard paul preach they believed it and they came against a man possessed of devils and said we adjure you by by the by jesus whom paul preaches and the devil wasn't bothered by that and engaged them back since they decided to engage him he engaged them back jesus i know know him quite well paul yep know him too i don't really know you guys there's nothing about you that worries me there's nothing in your life that resembles paul there's nothing happening in your ministry that resembles jesus so i'm not really afraid of you you understand so the the message of the hour cannot must not and cannot be limited to just a historical reference that you can tell somebody about and even quote quotes to them it's got to be a living quote it's got to come from the voice of your life that is the voice that is the anointed kingdom that is here to confront the enemy so i say again the sign in the days of daniel was a pronouncement on this age of the end time the world let me say it like this the world is largely unaware that they are being led by a spiritual kingdom amen you can talk to them about it and you can see right away people's like they don't even want to talk about spiritual things you can't even get them they'll talk about politics they'll talk about they'll talk about who their favorite sports team is they'll talk about great education and you can get the right kind of person and who's a scientist and get them talking about quantum mechanics man they'll talk all day long but when you immediately begin to turn and say you know there's another kingdom we need to talk about it's not a kingdom of education it's not a kingdom of politics not a kingdom of social issues we're going to talk about a god that is in control and another enemy that's in control who's also a supernatural being and right away they don't want to talk about that but what is what is tragic what is tragic is they don't want to talk about the most important point that is the most important point that satan has become the controlling god of this entire age which it takes in politics and education and social issues it takes in everything satan is the ruling spiritual force or energy our fuel our characteristics are anointing behind everything that we see in the world today and the sad reality is that just as belted shazer was unaware of that this age is largely unaware of that and even in denial it's a kingdom of darkness i'm here to tell you friends the age i'm not here to preach doom and gloom i'm actually here to say you know look up your redemption draweth nigh but the bottom line is for us the reality is that that this is a kingdom of darkness and in fact is it is the greatest darkness the world has ever experienced they were disrespecting the articles from the house of the lord you know it's incredible that so much is made on the political front today and social issues of injustice and social justice and marches and and and demonstrations and riotings and different things like that and even even good and noble ideologies being hijacked being hijacked by lucifer being hijacked by a fallen agenda actually and that's not new that was that was happening you know it's been it's been happening you know for decades that you can rise up with a very valid and noble to say hey this is something we need to pay attention and if you gain any traction in that right away forces of evil go there's an opportunity and they'll jump right on it and write it into pinnacle political notoriety until they've taken the movement and completely adulterated it from what it was and it's beginning we're seeing it happen come on friends let's not be let's not be awkward i mean this is the reality hey come on we're not we're not political we're christians do i need to go all that down that again i'm not a i'm not a democrat or a republican amen i i'm not white or black i'm a son of god come on and then paul said there's there's no there's neither jew nor greek male or female it's not about that in the kingdom of god we're christians i don't even this isn't even my country i'm an ambassador from another country to come to this country to say hey you guys got a serious problem and i got a good answer for you if you'll take it amen so we start you know preachers in the message certainly shouldn't feel awkward to talk about social issues and to say you know that the devil's in control of it all if you're a believer you believe that because the bible said it would be and you see it amen so we find that the things that they're even even the things that they are legitimately and rightfully protesting those things don't even exist in the family of god there's no need for you to protest about racial equality if you're a christian because christians it doesn't matter what race you are there's no need to protest it for gender inequality if you're a christian it doesn't matter because there's no we don't treat our women like that amen come on loosen up come on amen come on let's throw that awkwardness out the door where it's supposed to be we have a right to talk about what prophecy said would be here and we have a right to identify it modern events are made clear by prophecy all right all right so in the name of social justice they felt the need to burn bibles in portland next slide g that's from a news source that's a bible burning next one there's a whole stack of them burning so why would they burn bibles that doesn't even make sense if anything gives equality and justice to all mankind it's the bible why would they burn the book that stands for all people that this is you know what this book declares that god so loved the whole world he gave his son to die for it this is the book that tells husbands love your wives as christ loved the church this is the this is the book that says there is no jew or greek there is no there is no male or female that in christ we're all one this is the book that that tells you to be honest and decent and loyal and and humble this is the book that tells you to love your neighbor this is the book that tells you to obey governments and and don't be righteous this is the book that teaches families how to be in sync and in harmony this is the book that that that they use to join men and women in marriage and this is the book that instructs parents how to raise a decent moral honest upstanding people and that's the book they burn i've said it often before you can tell when you're being anointed by an evil spirit because you'll do things that don't even make sense why would they burn bibles and if if i that's that's a scaled down picture if i expanded that picture you'd see people sitting on the ground around it watching it holding up their signs holding up their signs justice equality blm women's rights equal pay and they're holding up their signs while they're watching the bibles burn say explain that madness to me brother jason it's easy go back to daniel standing there and the king def defiling the articles of the lord's house and def why would they need to go and get articles why did about the shazer feel the need he had plenty of wine goblets and had plenty of articles why did he feel the need to go and get the ones that had been dedicated to jehovah it doesn't make sense but what what makes it makes sense is when you realize that a demon power was anointing him and a demon powers anointing that amen so we find next slide brother gideon watch brother branham come here and take up take up this statement does god ever change his mind about his word and now we find always that when these natural and spiritual spirits of churches and organizations meet there is always a clash it's never failed to be so it always clashes notice abel by faith in god offered a more excellent sacrifice and the carnal believer thought that it was the works of his own hands that and his fruits and his beautiful offering that he brought that god would recognize and it made a clash now it's interesting that that there it's the only place that i've found there might be others it's the only place that i found where they were burning bibles they've been burning flags but portland seems to be the only place i can find not that that's a big point they might be burning them in other cities as well but but it seems to be as far as i can track on the news feeds it seems to be that portland was where it first started now that's interesting to me because we realize that that it was it was exactly uh portland where the maniac jumped on the platform to strike brother branham i'm going to tell you something that man is probably long gone but those demons are still there and it's not and it has nothing to do with inequalities because first of all in portland the main ones rioting are white people i i heard a i heard a a a very well informed man referencing he lives in detroit he says he says you know we don't even have that in detroit where we really are oppressed and he says he says the average income he says we're we're in detroit looking at portland going what is your problem our our average income is 40 000. your average income is 140 000 portland our average homes are about 80 grand your average homes are four hundred thousand what what are you writing about and you got people in detroit people of color who don't get it and want to say good grief portland what are you also up in the air about you you've got riches you've got wealth you're upwardly mobile you see friends it doesn't make sense it proves that it's a kingdom of darkness don't be fooled don't think it's religious don't think that it's social liberty and social justice has nothing to do with that if they really wanted true equality they wouldn't burn this i'm trying to say why you keep hammering this because i'm trying to show you that the world is being controlled there's a kingdom of darkness and control and there has to be a contrast to that and that's the kingdom of light the kingdom of sons and daughters of god and i happen to believe we're it if they're going to demonstrate why am i not demonstrating i'm not talking about carrying signs in the street i'm talking about when i go into walmart or target when i go into the grocery store when you go into the schools where you go wherever you are your life ought to be a sign you ought to be a demonstration hey there's a kingdom of light we find that this man in portland this maniac that he could not be delivered of that spirit now he got bound by a prophet's words you'll fall at my feet because for no other reason not because you're a bad guy not because of something you did but so because of something you're doing right at this minute you're challenging the servant of the most high god and that that don't work for the holy ghost so brother branham said satan made a challenge and the holy ghost accepted the challenge and said because you've done this you'll fall at my feet and that's exactly what happened and he fell across brother brown's feet and the the police had to come then and pry him off and uh and one of the head policemen asked the question brother branham says is he dead and brother branham says no he says is he delivered and he says no he worships that thing and he won't give it up so i want you to fully absorb the scene this is in a city of portland where a maniac could not be delivered because of his love for the spirit of the world he loved the kingdom of darkness more than lovers of god did not we read that in our text traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god and here comes god ready to deliver him and god even can't deliver him because he's in love with the spirit of the world people don't see themselves becoming maniac when they are lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god they don't see that happening they they discount paul's warning of what the consequences of loving the world more than you love god paul lists some some very striking definitive and definite consequences that happen to you when you follow that path of loving the pleasures of the world more than you love god's word when you're more when you're when you see say how do i know if i'm if i'm doing that what's your life displaying if your life is displaying more of the comforts of this laodicean age more than it's displaying the separateness of the holy ghost in your life then you've got a love problem come on see you can't i mean you can deny it in your mind all day long but i'm looking at the fruit that's growing you know man can come to me and say hey come to my backyard i want to show you a great apple tree i planted and it's growing nice apples and i get there and it's growing bananas and i have to say to the guy i'm sorry you didn't plant apple seed oh yes i did no you didn't i know i did i read the label i don't care what you read i got a scripture i got a quote i don't care what quote you got i don't care what scriptures daisy chain all the scriptures and quotes you want but i'm here to tell you i know you didn't plant apple seed because had you planted apple seed the laws of nature would have produced apples and it's not it's growing bananas you planted a seed of discrepancy is what you planted thinking you were planting apple seeds so you know you you can claim all day long but when the evidence is in your life that that that that that your life predominantly chases after the pleasures of this world more than say when i love god i believe the word i'm not talking about that you do or you don't i'm saying paul said lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god and there were very dire consequences just like side effects you take a certain medication and it'll they'll tell you right on the label this could happen this could happen this could happen this could happen they've happened to people clinical trials we know that blindness can occur deafness numbness nausea fainting dizziness all these different things can happen you could it could cause you to become anemic and wow i don't know if i want to take this medicine that's always a gamble it's always a risk that you might be one of the unlucky ones the problem that when people are feeding off seeds of discrepancy of the world is is it's not going to be a roll of the dice everybody's going to get the side effects and you're not going to get one of them you're going to get all of them and that's what paul is is saying here people they don't feel they they they don't see themselves becoming maniac when they start loving the pleasures of the world more than lovers of god they don't you know what happens they don't feel paul warned them of this but they don't feel their natural affection leaving they don't sense it but paul says that's going to be one of the consequences you'll lose natural affection as strange as as a as their natural affection goes a strange fierceness settles in its place this is paul's warning in second timothy fierce traitor heady high minded without natural affection truth spreaders false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good people don't see themselves getting to there but paul is simply saying hey those are the side effects every time you love the world more than you love god they don't see themselves becoming maniac they don't they don't detect the their natural affection is leaving they don't sense that it's being replaced by a fierceness that it begins to take over their mind and they become more heady and more heady and more high-minded and more high-minded they don't realize that that's happening to them there was only one power that could subdue that maniac in portland oregon and i first want to tell you what could not subdue it civilized law had failed to subdue that maniac the courts had failed the police had failed he had been arrested he had been in court he had been in jail civilized law had failed he's jumping on the platform to strike brother branham the police were there they had failed the courts had failed both republican and democratic parties had failed amen psychiatrists had failed social workers had failed that man had had all of that no they had all failed this man was put under control of the word speaking through a dedicated vessel and that's the only thing that could bring him under subjection because he confronted a dedicated vessel it was not brother branham just being a prophet of the age that did it i'm here to tell you that if if the same christ that lived in brother branham lives in you as a son and daughter of god you also have authority over the powers of the enemy do you believe that so we find that it was a that it was a vessel who was familiar with the power of god and the power of the holy ghost it was a word catch this now what did that maniac hear that sent him to the floor he heard a word spoken from a word life on display and it stopped him in his tracks what in politics wasn't the cops wasn't social workers a psychiatrist what medication wasn't politics it was a spoken word there was a vessel standing there that was a reflector of the word there was a vessel standing there that had the word on display in his life and spoke a word to that maniac and dropped him when no other power could drop him as brother branham says there's there is always a clash notice again in our quote abel by faith in god offered a more excellent sacrifice and the carnal believer thought that it was the works of his own hands and his fruits and his beautiful offering that he that he brought and that would that god would recognize and it made a clash next slide we find that abraham and lot had a clash we find that moses and nathan and cara had the same clash see there was a clash when the carnal and the spiritual meets there's always a clash do you know one of the biggest clash flash moments that happen in a church service is when the word comes forth spiritual and somebody carnal resists it there comes a clash in the atmosphere see see there was a clash when the carnal and the spiritual meets there is always a clash when judas and jesus met there was a clash one the son of god the other one the son of satan just like cain and abel there was a clash when they met next slide with job one of them was the treasurer of the church the other one a pastor and as now we come in this day to the same thing again the carnal denomination to the spiritual bride of christ see the spiritual bride of christ is so much different from the carnal organizations till there's no comparison in them that at all go to that blank slide next and just hover right there so the spiritual bride of christ is so much different i'm you know let me i you know i think i could say it this way we're supposed to be where there should be so much separation uh between the spiritual and the carnal and and i'm gonna here to tell you friends when if and when we don't see the power of god like it ought to be and i'm talking about power over darkness power over sin power over the devil power over sickness when we don't see that at the level that we believe we should see it say what should be our level it should be over the top at this point this is the return of the ministry of jesus christ it should be complete authority over every devil in our homes and in our lives and in our families and we don't see it why because there's not enough separation come on and on it what's on it there's no i don't have another bible answer for you that's a you that's a great question that mankind needs to ask why do we not see if if god before us where's all the miracles that's a common question and the answer that the bible gives is it will be if there's enough separation between spiritual and carnal because i'm here to tell you the devil ain't worried about your intellect he's worried about the word being on display and the word cannot be on display in your lives when you choose the world and you love it more than you love the things of god you know i was thinking the other day about the word of god being on display and i just said lord let your word come to pass in my life i study the word constantly intellectually you know sometimes i shock my own self i get i know that might sound arrogant let me let me let me clarify that real quick sometimes i get asked a question i i it happened this recently i was on a call in bible study that i'm on every morning and a brother asked me a question off off the cuff i wasn't expecting it i didn't have any notes prepared for it and and he he said he said i got a question for you brother jason you know why does the bible say this this this and this and suddenly i realized wow i remember studying that very question and it was in my memory and i was able just to spit it right out and to that brother it sounded amazing to me it wasn't amazing at all and i realized goodness gracious i study all the time i ought to have a quick answer i ought to be able don't you agree i ought to be able to have a good answer for a good bible question i read it day and night i study it day and night what brother brown i remember saying about this i ought to have some kind of an answer i've been listening to tapes multiple tapes you know in a week i would hate to count how many quotes and tapes and scriptures that i'm looking at and commentary my whole life is a life of quiet contemplation oh life is that all through the day from early morning hours and all through the day and and into the evening but you know as i sit there and think about that i when i look in the mirror and i'm not talking about the mirror i looked at in the back office to make sure my hair was combed right my tie was straight i'm talking about that mirror talking about this mirror when i look in this mirror i go wow my my intellect is way outpacing my demonstration and i don't like that i don't like that because i know there's a kingdom of darkness and it's not being outpaced i'm here to tell you it's on display everywhere and i say lord god let your word don't fill me with more knowledge let your word come to pass in my life let it live let my life be a living testimony of the written word that's what i desire today that's what the anointed kingdom is all about i thought to myself and this was just my own musing my own thought bubbles as i've been studying this thought for this these notes here are weeks old as i've just been pondering them and i thought if i don't have a word life what do i have and i thought wow that's a good question i need to think on that and i've spent two weeks thinking about it and i thought if i don't have a word life then what kind of life do i have i'm here to tell you something friends here can i give you some of my answers that i answered myself i asked myself the question and i gave myself some answers if you don't have the person of truth not the doctrine not the not the data if you don't have the person of truth then you're left with the great liar there's only two there's truth and truth isn't data jesus called himself the truth so truth is a person a lie is a person you understand jesus not jesus didn't just stop with calling the pharisees liars he pressed his case to say you're of your father the devil because he was a liar from the beginning and i see your chip off the old block i see that the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree you pharisees you're a liar you're trying to kill me a man who has told you the truth you claim abraham but you know what abraham never did that you're of your father the devil and his works you do see he says why why can you not understand my speech why do my words have no place in you see because of the origin he was aiming back at their origin so if you don't have the person of truth so if i don't have a word life what do i have if i don't have the person of truth then you're just left with the great liar everything he tells you everywhere he leads you everything he gives you is a lie everything he tells you everywhere he leads you everything he gives you everything you acquire that doesn't come from god comes from him and it's based on a lie and and and he's he has numerous ways of lying he'll either ha it'll either be a lie of him of commission where he's just simply lying to you or it'll be a lie of omission where he'll entice you with something that's kind of partial truth but he won't tell you the backside of what's going to happen to you if you take that a poisonous apple tastes great at first tastes great at first snow white loved that apple until it put her down see the father of lies hear me now especially young people listen up the father of lies will lead you down a path that ends in a disappointment so bitter i want you to think for a moment today i'm not here to say better be careful you'll end up at the great judgment bar i'm not even preaching about that today but we do know that the bible teaches us that there's going to be people who stand at the great white throne judgment and who are condemned to a lake of fire that's a true story that's that's history before it's history that's prophecy that's going to be history that's a real event it's actually going to happen say oh i don't that's terrible i don't want to talk about that well and neither does the devil want you to talk about it the devil doesn't want me to talk about it but i'm here to talk about it the house of god is a house of correction i'm here to give you the word of god as he gave it to me how many want it today i'm here to tell you there's going to be millions tens of billions of people who are turned away to the lake of fire why are they because they followed the liar and they didn't take the person of truth who came to give him eternal life and if you stand there hear me planet earth today if you stand there and you're convicted of that we're talking about a disappointment so bitter a loss listen up if the devil is enticing you into the world you hear me now because we've had we've had you know i'm glad we've got children raised up in godly homes but we've had children raised up in godly homes before who when they got teenagers went out into the world blew their life to pieces and today are still in the world i'm glad for decent raising but unless you unless you get the person of truth unless you have your own personal experience with the word which is a person then then then what ends up happening is it becomes a disappointment at the judgment bar so bitter in the end say why is it so bitter i i i think because it's a it's it's a loss of what could have been that that is so painful the bible says they will wail and gnash their teeth together because i i believe that standing there it's going to be bad enough that they're about to endure the flames of the lake of fire which are very real but to me to me the the the finality of what i've missed out on and i see perhaps in the background a glorious kingdom in a millennial world that i could have had and that one on the throne tried to deal with my life and i see a bride from 2000 years and and and old testament and new testament and i and i see her gathered and they made it why did i not make it was god prejudice was god biased no i was prejudiced i loved the world more than i loved him the bias was in me a loss of what could have been so painful a soul-crushing agony in your mind so great that the mercies of god will finally commute your sentence from the lake of fire to a plane of non-existence so that no part of you will ever ever exist again so you know my message to you today is why not take the person of truth why follow the great liar why follow the madness of the world why would you do that take the truth take the person of truth why not follow why would you not follow this gentle shepherd to a new world oh one who can give you life here now and and and you know something you can believe everything he tells you isn't that wonderful i'm here to tell you that there's a being you can believe everything he tells you you can know confidently that everything you're told is true everywhere you're led is safe and everything you're given from the lord is for keeps hallelujah so that i'm not wasting my life i'm living for eternal life and an eternal purpose and everywhere he leads me safe everything he tells me is true everything he gives me no one can ever take from me that means everything you've ever loved you have forever all your life lived for him here will be a life of unending reward there ceaseless ages of perfect joy perfect peace complete satisfaction in everything can you imagine that kind of a life where you literally have a complete satisfaction in everything yeah but you know what's the catch there's always a catch not in this one there's no catch oh that's too good to be true yeah i kind of accept it is no you tell me what it's going to cost me it's going to it's you know what it's gonna cost you your heart that god just says if you'll just give me your heart i'll take it from there i'll i'll mold you into a new creation i'll change your desires i'll make you love holiness and righteousness and you'll live forever in a beautiful world and you won't be following the lie there is no catch next slide i gotta hurry brother branham here and i know my redeemer liveth watch what makes it dark before day now you agree we're in a darkened age it's the darkest before day we are told by scientists that it's the it's the light pressing coming on moving down the sun is coming up around the world it's it's light is pre pressing the darkness she is so so he says um she is making her last strike she can't stand no more darkness can never stand love this quote darkness can never stand in the presence of light it cannot do it love this light is 10 million times stronger than darkness i thought about that in a in a reality sense in just a very simple reality sense walk into a dark room and light a candle you'll see it dark i don't care how dark it is in that room light a candle turn on a flashlight strike a match darkness moves back because darkness has no power to stop light light cannot fail to drive darkness away it's 10 million times more powerful than stronger than darkness so light and darkness cannot dwell together and when light begins to rise darkness settles and gets dense it's pressing it together so if if i had a demonstration here we'd have the you'd have the earth and you have the sun and then you have you have you know you have the moon and the sun comes up over the earth and reflects and that's why sometimes you look at the moon and it's a quarter moon or a half moon or if it clears the earth then you see a full moon because it's getting the full reflection and then that reflection is bouncing back to the earth so as the light comes up over the horizon the darkness that is ahead of it over the horizon begins to be pushed back pushed back and it gets thick and gets condensed so when the when the opening of the seals came and god brought a message of light arise shine thy light has come you understand say why is the world so dark that's why so what does it mean to me does it mean does does it mean to say oh here's a here's a much better understanding of the word i think i'll believe the message nonsense that's not even why it came you don't even have to understand all the teaching of the message you got to understand the messages and books and tapes and quotes it's a person it's christ you can listen to tapes all day long but if you don't know the author if you don't know the spirit that lived in that prophet there's lots of people got the doctrines of william branham not a lot god the spirit of william branham who loved the lord with all of his heart and strived to be pleasing to god who had a spirit of love and compassion for his fellow man next slide here in shalom what does it mean god has begun to separate the light from the darkness see pressing it behind like he did in the beginning to show the dawn of a new day of a new day the church ages are fading out the church ages are fading out he repeats it god is pressing the darkness into a place it has to do it to fade out the church organizations fade out the world next slide the world is covering the thing over and worldlyism has took the whole thing then isn't god right he asked a question by worldly things and worldly dressing and worldly acting and worldly living are you uncomfortable not making you feel awkward am i are we christians by worldly things what is this doing making the darkness darker worldly acting worldly living it's the world you know people say don't judge me yeah you know what i i you remember brother diggs last time he was here and he mentioned it just at the beginning of his sermon he's coming again next month and he mentioned at the beginning of his sermon i just about went for a jubilee march and he starts talking about that somebody says hey you want to go to the zoo and see a lion man yeah i want to go see a lion i've i've been into in into into game game places in overseas and they they took me in in south africa to see to see live lions and brother diggs says you know when you're when you're told you're going to go see a lion he said your expectation is not to go where's he at oh there he is and it's a little bitty lion cub and he's a little bitty guy prancing around barely has a doesn't have a roar at all this little wow and here you are expecting to see a full main lion and you see a little cub it's disconcerting so oh where's the lion uh right there no i mean i know he will be but i mean aren't we going to get to see you told me you told me we're going to see lions well there he is that's not i just know what i'm thinking trust me friend when you tell me i'm coming to see a lion i'm not expecting to see that if you're going to go see the eagle cage we we i i've taken my family numerous of times up to tennessee and we uh they go into the dollywood park there and they've got an eagle sanctuary and it's beautiful it's sad but it's beautiful to see those big majestic birds and they the cages are oh wow what guys 50 feet high and 100 feet deep and 100 feet long and and there's trees and you see these great majestic birds flying across there it's mind-blowing you're not looking if somebody says hey let's go see the eagle display you're not looking to see i mean an eagle when it's born a little eagle it's quite ugly has no feathers looks like an alien nothing to see in an eaglet trust me it's like oh wow that guy needs to get some feathers but to see that big majestic beautiful eagle someone tells me i'm going to see an eagle and i have an expectation that i'm going to see a mature bird who can fly who has that stare who's got that aura about him and so you know what when i when i when when i when i if i seem disappointed if you show me a little lion cub and you show me a little eaglet in the nest just born and if i seem disappointed to you and you say to me you know what is your problem you know you know it's going to be my answer you said i was going to see an eagle i'm sorry i'm disappointed but you said i would see an eagle you said i would see a lion and so i'm sorry that i'm disappointed so i get it i get it you know that guy who took me there and says hey listen man i didn't tell you what kind it would be i just told you what it would be and so you know so so i get it when people when i when as a preacher when i start coming and start reading quotes like brother branham talks about here the world is covering the thing over and worldlyism has took the whole thing then isn't god right by worldly things and worldly dressing and worldly acting and worldly living it's the world and you say don't judge me well you said you were christian you told me you were a christian christians don't dress like that sister christians don't christian ladies don't wear those skin-tight clothes that hang on every curve of your body and parts of your body naked that only your husband should see christian men don't corrals and hang out in the world and and have that kind of a carnal lifestyle young people who are full of the holy ghost their world isn't isn't this world their world is this world so i'm sorry you say don't judge me well you told me you were christian i'm gonna expect to see a christian say we've got a holy ghost field church then you know what i'm gonna expect i'm gonna expect to hear i'm gonna expect to hear the preaching of the word i'm gonna expect to hear people pull on the word i'm going to expect the holy ghost in power say we got the holy ghost then i'm going to expect demons to be cast out and sicknesses to be driven out and people to be overcomers because you say you're a christian you say you have the truth you say we're a church then let's see a church let's see the original church let's see god and demonstration in the people's lives oh my otherwise friends why are you and coming to this church ain't going to insulate you why do you come if you're not going to be a christian why do we gather why do we have a building why do we pay the power bill why do we pay this and pay that and have men who labor what's the point if we're just going to be a social club i'm not interested in that kind of thing i want to see a church with the power and the demonstration of the holy spirit i want to know that when god speaks demons scream and faint as brother bradham said they would how'd you like to make a demon howl and faint see so we say it's a church we say we have the truth a lot of times a lot of fancy preaching and great mysteries but where's the living reality of the word made flesh in the people i'm talking today on the anointed kingdom the kingdom of christ that ought to be alive among us so i'm sorry but the holy ghost don't produce women who dress sexy and expose themselves the holy ghost don't produce men who run along in the carnalities of the world i'm looking to see men and women who are like christ i'm looking to see young people on fire full of the zeal of the holy spirit amen and hey i'm not talking about working something up i don't care that much about a workup there's plenty of places for i mean there's plenty of places where workup is fine you want to go to a pep rally you're there for a reason to get pepped it's a rally we're gonna we're gonna get our team spirit up so so we can rah-rah for our team there's a value in that the team although on the field appreciates the fans they appreciate the people screaming for them go you can do it it builds courage in you they they go to when they go to war they have singers and people who play what does it do brother branham said it puts courage you know there's something about it man that music starts going and i i'm not talking about pentecostal nonsense in this day and hour but i'm talking about a real a real feeling of worship and in the spirit of god and i'm here to tell you he's worth you lifting your voices too he's worth you lifting your hands to he's worth saying amen to he's worth your allegiance he's the king of the whole universe he only comes to do good so i'm not talking about you know i love an enthusiasm for christ in a pulling on the word you know but but i'm not talking about enthusiasm for the sake of enthusiasm i'm not talking about i mean they ha but but at the same time i see an enthusiasm at ball games i'm not condemning it i see it brother brahm said you got to get into the spirit of it and brother branham starts talking about man he said if you're a real baseball fiend and your favorite player comes up to the plate and he cracks one deep over the center field wall he said man you'll throw your popcorn up in the air you'll grab your hat and smack your friend beside you and you'll scream and holler and jump up and down and you're not that man's not writing you a check he's not going to give you any of his money he won't even give you a selfie with him and then we come to the house of god and it's like oh i got to go to church oh my goodness my goodness friends how about how about a thanksgiving to almighty god i'm not i'm not talking about something i'm not up here today trying to work something up you know you know you know what i can tell you the difference there is a natural excitement i get naturally excited you don't you know i i don't have to get worked up you know over the years watching my grandsons grow up and and seeing them excel on a baseball diamond or on a basketball court and you know something i i i get worked up but you know what nobody has to convince me to it comes naturally comes naturally i'm just being honest is that okay it comes naturally i i fill up my icloud and my phone with videos i'll probably never watch again but i can't resist filming it and then every once in a while i'll go back and watch one of them crack one or somebody get a shot or somebody uh some some kind of a goal and it thrills me as a grandpa in fact is it can't be squelched if you ever want to see brother jason get excited follow me to a a ballgame where my grandson is in it i'm here to tell you you'll you'll see a man who's excited and i'm not going to apologize for that i'm proud of them i love it i i love the fact that they can they can have a participation in that and still love the lord and be raised in a godly home come on friends don't clam up on me let's be real humans i mean you don't have to you don't have to pump me up you know if if i see gideon or see uriah and i've seen him step to a plate and take a fastball on the inside and crack that thing to the warning track and run and they're running and and i'm screaming run uriah go gideon you think i don't do that you think you did you think i didn't come out of my almost come out of my shoes see noah come out of the backfield carrying a inflated oblong piece of leather talking about something silly and he comes out of a backfield and he rounds the corner and the whole enemy team i call them the enemy the whole enemy team trying to catch him and nobody can catch him no their little short legs just go down the sidelines and i'm screaming my hat's in the air go no i'll go no i run you let me tell you something friends you think i wouldn't be excited standing in the bleachers and see um ethan in a swim and he's gonna go for a record on the thousand meter swim he can do it you know i never could do that when i was a teenager and i thought i was a good swimmer i see noah i see ethan in the pool and i'm like wow that kid is more fish than human you think i wouldn't be standing there see him go for a thousand meter record some kind of endurance record i'm here to tell you you'd see brother jason going come on ethan come on ethan and here's some critic going you know he could drown come on ethan come on ethan oh friends let me tell you something i'm a grandpa i see any one of my granddaughters come in this church or come in my house all decked out and beautiful lovely in the beauty of godliness i'm not talking about little hollywood divas i'm glad their mothers don't allow that i'm glad their fathers raise them different than that and they come in here dressed in the beauty of holiness i almost can't take it i have felt dizzy just observing their beauty you don't have to pump me up you don't have to try to get me going you don't have to do any of that state you know why because it comes natural you know why because i love them i love them and it comes naturally when i come to the word of god you don't have to pump brother jason up i love it you know now i come to the house of god sometimes i yeah maybe maybe you know sometimes i wonder wow what will we do if we didn't have brother luther and brother jason pulling on the word of god come on you men you ought to be pulling on the word of god you ought to let your family see an excitement in the word of god amen i appreciate it and there's others of you men brother jack i hear him all the time there's other of you brothers who who i do here and sisters too i'm here to tell you something friends we got something to be proud of we got something to live for you got something to die for you got something worth demonstrating you want a demonstration let me demonstrate the lord jesus christ that's the desire i want to be part of the anointed kingdom of god i want to be part of that you don't have to pump me up i don't need pumped up i'll stop here for today i don't remember if this point it's in my notes i'm going to make it regardless i might have said it or tapped into it before here i i preach too often i every morning i'm on a call-in bible show that i'm teaching the word of god and so if i've said it before good you'll hear it again i will never stop fighting the devil i will never stop fighting the devil he cannot have my ground because it's my inheritance and i ain't giving it up if he takes it say has he ever took yeah he drove me off the hill before and i had to get on i had to get on my knees and go take it back see is he ever is he ever or you know overthrew your defensive lines he ever got inside your perimeter yeah i had to retreat and i found an altar somewhere and got down on my knees and took it back i will never cede my inheritance to him i don't care i will not surrender any of my inheritance without a fight it astonishes me how many people i see surrender god-given inheritance and god-given grounds and their and the power of god that they're entitled to is missing out of their lives and and they need it they come up on situations and they need it they need the blessing of god in their finances but they never tithe in at all never give god his tithe they keep god's portion and live as thieves and and even though he gives them everything they never give it any any part of it back and then they need god in a financial crisis i i've seen i've seen people who just their their mind was so full of hollywood that that somebody loved one gets sick they prayer faith what's that so i've seen people and i'm talking about godly christian believers who live and they've allowed the devil to occupy so much territory that they don't have any authority any enthusiasm any victory any peace there are marriages get struggled young people get struggled they don't know where the power of god is where's the healing where's the deliverance where's the authority it's all around you it's all around you you're a son of god so so what what's what's happened to you my brother or my sister come on let's ask ourselves this legitimately i've had to ask myself that lord sure i see power i see authority but hey maybe i've got some territory that the devil is occupying and it's supposed to be mine but because of my lack of zeal i won't go claim it i'm here to tell you today i'm coming to claim all that's mine i'm coming to claim i'm laying a claim and saying i will not give up the devil i will not give up my land if my family gets sick i'm going to prepare faith if i've got a financial need i'm gonna pray to for the blessing of joseph if i've gotta if i'm bound in some kind of a thing i'm gonna go to the deliverer who said he looses the prisoners and he opens the prison doors hallelujah if my children need the power of prayer and a token laid over their life when i pray for my kids my grandkids i tell you something friends i pray effectually i pray because i believe god will answer my prayer how many have that kind of confidence why because i long ago rejected the liar and i accepted the person of truth yeah i may lose battles even driven off my land but i will not concede god given land to the devil i will take back my rightful inheritance every time all the time i have one purpose to nullify the victories of the devil every day in my life his mercies are new every morning i have decided that i want to be part of an anointed kingdom how many how many you want to be part of an anointed kingdom you don't you don't how many yeah okay good 100 that's good god gets to see that but now remember he takes you at your word he takes you at your word see come brother anthony bring your team amen let's stand back to our feet ah it's so much more i wanted to say but i'm just not going to go because it's i can see that we're going to oversponge you and you'll you'll lose some of the the main parts that i want you to to get to get down deep you know whatever's you're choosing brother tony i want to ask you a couple questions we're getting ready to sing what does the word mean to you what what has it meant to you that's a better question because preaching casts out devils and drives back spirits of unbelief so right now you might have a really open mind and an open heart to say i love the word but that might be the preaching doing that so go back now go back a little bit when you weren't here under the preaching and and consider where you where you've lived where you've been living and and how much of the enemy is holding of your god-given territory and and from that vantage point everybody got that in your mind you see that in your mind's eye now ask yourself what has the word meant to me [Music] what do you you young people what do you want your life to be you got to make a choice you know one of the things that's been kind of amusing to me and i've kind of you know had little private giggles with the parents as as the as my grandkids are are going from they're not they're finding out they're not little kids anymore and they're having to face some responsibilities and you know they're they're just are not all of them but the the upper two or three have begun to realize and begun to taste a little bit of life and go wow wish i was 10 years old playing with my toys again [Music] what do you want your life to be you know i'm here to tell you that that the beauty of me asking that question is i have a wonderful answer if you want it you want it your life can be and even if it hasn't been it still can be everything that god has ordained for you to be and have in his word god saw you god saw a vision of you before the foundation of the world [Music] before the foundation of the world you know what my prayer is oftentimes [Music] i get a certain family in my mind and i say lord today today bring them mom dad and kids i put the whole family in my image in my mind's eye and i say lord bring them today to the vision you had of them before the foundation of the world bring them a little closer and if i praying for them the next day lord okay that was them but this is now bring them a little closer bring them a little closer bring them a little closer and because i know that his vision of them before the foundation of the world is far more far more than i could ever envision for them far more than i could ever ever ever give any man even my own family christ can do far more for my family than i could ever do and that's why i've spent my lifetime teaching my family about jesus because i know what he can do for them how many want to be the family of god and say lord i want every every inheritance every position everything you saw of me before the foundation of the world i pray that for me i pray that for you you want to raise a hand and say lord everything you saw of me in your vision before the foundation of the world lord today this day this before this 24 hour cycle has ended may you bring me a little closer to that image and if you're if you if you're going to bring me up 10 yards then i want the whole 10 yards if you're only going to bring me one yard then well i want my whole yard i want whatever if you've only got six inches for me well then let me get that i'm not gonna give the devil an inch i want everything that he has for me and i'm willing to say lord whatever it takes and even in areas where i'm weak just just roll right over the top of me with a steamroller if you have to by whatever means necessary bring me into that image that you saw i want to be the anointed kingdom of god in the earth amen amen well you can see i just keep preaching keep preaching as brother gerald says till the cows come home and the calves cry for buttermilk [Music] let's sing brother anthony amen before we go now let's give the lord some worship that will be when my jesus jesus i shall see think about [Music] [Applause] and when he takes oh what a day what a day what a day [Music] shall [Music] all is [Music] [Music] why don't we raise up our hands and sing it as an anthem what a day that will be i thank you for it lord [Music] i shall see when i look upon his face the one who saved me by his grace by the hand and leads me through the promised land oh what a day glorious day i love that what an oldie goatee that is over there and forever [Music] a glorious day [Music] i shall see when i look upon his faith [Music] glorious day by your head's with me all over the building we're going to let you be dismissed with this prayer father we thank you today for your great mercy thank you for your kindness to come among us thank you for the word that you've delivered lord i feel somewhat unburdened there's still more that i i know you want to say constraints of humanity and constraints of being a human compel us to stop lord and so we stopped and we'll hit a pause button we'll pick it back up again but i pray today lord that enough was said enough was said that it lodged down in the hearts of people not to make anyone feel bad but to challenge them lord to challenge them to somehow reach down and open the eyes of their understanding that they might see greater heights that they're entitled to fly in greater lord possession of the love of god greater possession of the authority and the power that comes with being a son and daughter of god lord help us to be the
