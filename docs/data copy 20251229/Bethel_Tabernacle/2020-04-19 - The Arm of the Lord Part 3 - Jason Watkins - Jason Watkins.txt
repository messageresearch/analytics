whole assembly and Marion brother Lynn Gibbs former well brother the late brother Lynn Gibbs that was he was the pastor that church they haven't had a pastor and quite some time and apparently there was a decision made to continue gathering in the pandemic and so now they're having some real issues let's pray because as you as I sent out to you last night some have already passed away some are just hanging by a thread sister princess also sent in last night and I got it and and just begin praying for it I I didn't send it out with the other one I'd sent out to the whole church but she had sent out an urgent prayer request for sister iili that's a sister and nurse at brother Anderson's Church in Columbia where brother Diggs goes and her dad who lives in Michigan has the virus and he was reported non-responsive and so she's writing a praise report this morning sister I Ellie's dad's vitals are back up thanks to prayers of the saints he's being monitored you'd prayer is appreciated I certainly want to pray a man that the Lord continued to rescue his children amen praise the Lord we know that God is a healer and we know the Lord allows his children sometimes to come through death through accidents through sickness I I know this that he heals many millions for every one that he allows to come home I know this for sure we which are alive and remain and there will be some we will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and I know that that the Lord you know as I even said you know was talking about last service that precious in the sight of the Lord the devil in thinking brother Branham said death is I said I am NOT his slave meaning death speaking of death brother Bram said I am NOT his slave he is my slave all he can do is he's under orders that when when my body can no longer sustain the life Spirit within me and my spirit departs death is under strict orders from my father to bring me straight into the presence of God he cannot deviate he cannot do anything else he is my slave brother Branham said to take me to my reward Amen so you know friends I tell you we where there's power in the name of Jesus so we want to pray over these requests let's stand back to our feet and we'll get ready to turn in to first Peter chapter 4 wanna thank you sister mom for that song today that was so beautiful that no you was going to do that thank you happy to

one over the limit today but it'll be okay amen praise the Lord let's let's pray for these needs father we thank you today Lord Jesus that you still reign supreme thank you that we can call upon you Lord and and that that you gave us a promise that whatsoever that we would ask in your name and not doubt it but believe that we would receive what we've asked and we would have it you said in your

Lord under this attack of an abscessed tooth Lord Jesus for our brother Richard for his mother Lord we're thanking you and praising you today because you always hear us you always move Lord you always enter so we're peas ran at Lord bring urgent care that is quickly needed Lord father some of these cases your Saints are suffering terribly and right now we're asking for you to reach out Lord and father drive away these symptoms Lord and let divine healing take its path granite Lord I pray that you will remove all obstacles of doubt or anything the enemy's trying to do may it be so today we speak victory for them bless us now today in our service thank you for the word we've heard in the worship in the singing and we ask you now to break the bread of life to us Lord we stand here humbly in your presence unable Lord ah unequal to the task laid before me I have no ability Lord I could there's lots of things I could say I could put it in such a way Lord using using the tricks of psychology and and and and and speaking and and using it as a craft and tickle the ears Lord and and and even excite the senses but father what good would that do Lord what good would it be what we need the area we need our help in is in the soul and I can't reach that Lord by any by any means at my disposal it takes you all I can do is preach your word and ask you to take it Lord and water that seed let it grow in the hearts and minds of your family we commit it all to you now today I relax in the hands of Jehovah this is all on you Lord and it's all about you and I'm just your servant unworthy as I am inadequate as I am I'm reporting for duty now Lord used your own gift Lord to speak to your people we commit it to you in Jesus name Amen and amen and double amen amen god bless you first Peter chapter 4 amen verses one looks like we'll go down through at least maybe verse six or seven let's go through verse seven for as much then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of God for the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness lust excess of wine revellings banqueting zou Bominable idolatries wherein they think it's strange that you run not with them to the same excess of riot speaking evil of you who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead for for for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according to God in the spirit but the end of all things is at hand be you therefore sober and watch unto prayer may the Lord add blessings to the reading of his word as you're seated so much meaning in that sixth verse will come to it shortly let's let's just move in now so we're trying we're gonna take today our third installment of the arm of the Lord this will be the arm of the Lord part three now just want to say that we're monitoring closely governor McMasters announcements we're hoping to be able to be back to regular assembly with some social distancing not sure how that's all going to work so don't bother asking me I don't know so we're just gonna see we'll see we'll see how it goes we'll see what's allowed and there's no way we could have everybody and then everybody stay six feet apart the building's not big enough so we may have to do kind of a phased reentry I'm not sure don't know don't ask me because I don't know but it might be that you know in the in the coming short couple of weeks or so that we might find that this thing is gone and there's no more really legitimate threat and we could all just come back all together I sure do miss everybody being here amen so when we closed out part two we were speaking about the confirmation visit that Abraham received and you just bear with me let me lead back in and recapture our minds get us back to where we were we were talking about the visitation that of Melchizedek when he met Abraham in Genesis chapter 18 Abraham looked and saw three men bowed before them speaking to the one and said my lord and he enticed him to come in and you know Abraham was very zealous over that God was going to be in his presence or that he got to be in the presence of God I hope that we're zealous I hope that you out there I realized that wherever to three are gathered Christ promised to be there but but we miss all being together amen and I hope that you're not sitting at home getting fat and comfortable a man you know in pajamas and cup of coffee you know watching the preaching and I'm just joking around if you're if you're that way fine whatever that's that's you but praise God I don't come to church like that amen amen so we're looking for the time I you know I I I sent out a request to see you know who would like to maybe be included who hasn't got to come and I got maybe a grand total of two maybe three requests and out of the whole church and I thought boy I hope everybody's not getting comfortable not coming to church but then I also know I get it I understand that many of you didn't because you were preferring your brother and waiting to see if somebody else brother Jack sends me the most courteous text you know brother Jason we'd we'd love to be there anytime but not if it's gonna interfere not if it's gonna block somebody but we'd like to be there but it's just up to you ha ha hey man I sure love having brother Jack and sister Cathy here service or two ago amen so we'll get them back on the rotation again if this goes much further amen but you know Abraham was excited to be in the presence of God and you know if it's not really in my notes today I was thinking about it as I was studying but but you know earlier this morning but how that you know if you find and I'm not gonna go back there today and look at it again but Abraham you know he he he says a few things just off top my head you know come in and and refresh yourselves and let me get a morsel of bread and some water and and that's what he promised that that's what I'll do come in you know come come to come in and rest yourselves and let me you know wait on you and I'll get you some bread and some water but you know what he was so excited that he did more than he promised he went you know and and had Sarah quickly make all this bread and then he ran and got a choice kid and then ran and took it to a servant said quickly urgently dress up this kid and he brings back and they have a nice meal with proteins and bread and water and fellowship and you know I thought about how that Abraham you know I that's a good business model I've always recommended that you know all my sons are in business a lot of you men are in business them the majority of our church thank God we haven't suffered a great deal not overwhelmingly from the from the pandemic because most of our brothers are actually working more especially in our mechanical trades and so we're thankful for that but I've always said to them listen guys here's a good business model and let me just say to you church here's a good spiritual model when it comes to your dealings with Christ or you businessmen or ladies when you're dealing with the public never promise more than you can do and always do more than you promised and if you follow that simple rule and don't never promise more than you can do and always do more than you promised and you will have success and this is what Abraham did Abraham promised the Lord if you come in and rest I'll get you some bread and water but he ends up bringing a feast he did it with enthusiasm with excitement and I I would just say today that you know wherever you are you're sitting in your living room or you're here in the sanctuary let us be thrilled to be in the presence of God because there there's you you don't Iams we lose sight of just what this being can do for you this being in your life this being in your home this person of God when he comes something good always happens and and so I I don't know about you friends I think I know that you're like me I want him in my life I want to make my lifestyle conducive to his presence I want to make my activities to where he could come right in and go hey what's going on as if he doesn't know whoa he likes to talk to you like a man and I can say Oh Lord where it weirdest this this this this and you know to see him be pleased I wanted we sing the song pleasing let me be pleased see we those can't be just words friends those that has to be a reality that has to be as brother Kenny sings that song that has to be your heart song your heart should sing praises amen so Abraham was thrilled and we were closing out last time showing how that this visitation was a confirmation to a visit that he had he had been having God had been promising these things all the way back from Genesis 12 and on and in fact his God had just met him in Genesis 17 and and made promises to him who I don't want to get ahead of myself but we realized that not that visitation in chapter 18 and it's so significant because the chapter 17 visit only included the Prophet it only included Abraham and he had an instruction that he that his name wouldn't be Abram anymore but it would be Abraham and his wife wouldn't be suraíh it would be Sarah and so so we find that that H meaning deity that God was going to add a representation of deity into his name and that would be necessary because when when Melchizedek came God in a human flesh to give an example to you and I today of the message of the hour when a prophet could duplicate that sign to know the secret in people's heart even people behind him and brother Brandon would even turn his back to the audience and begin to point to people and then turned around and said now receive your sign I'm here to tell you something friends I have received the sign of Melchizedek the Word made flesh and it's not just in a prophet but now but now Sarah is there and H is added to her name because now there had to be God had to have his prophet and there had to be the representation of that there had to be the representation of a bride there had to be the representation of deity infused in our very name and that's why the brother Branham said I don't call you church anymore no no I going to add an agent here we're gonna get Diddy and I'm gonna call you mrs. Jesus Christ the bride I call you bride she's mrs. Jesus Christ and this was an announcement you know we talked about we talked about Sarah and you know and I am getting ahead of myself but I can't I don't get to choose it but but but you know Sarah and brother branham talks about it that she laughed up her sleeve see now you say my what a terrible thing just read the previous chapter Abraham did that did it before she did it God comes to Abraham and says the same thing and the bible says abraham laughed and said just like sarah me being a hundred are you you know my wife is 90 i'm a hundred and he holds up ishmael all that is smell Lord and know no need to make me struggle over the impossible just take his mail and the Lord says look I I've heard your prayer I'm gonna bless Ishmael he is your seed I'm gonna bring 12 princes I'm gonna bring nations from him but my but my covenant is going to be with Isaac who's Sarah shall bear to you at ninety at ninety yes and God said you shall indeed in other words God heard that laughs let me taste some friends the Prophet wasn't the only one in Chapter 17 who had to come to that and get over it and start believing and in chapter 18 it wasn't just a prophet doubting there had to be a bride who heard and saw it and became a believer so that all doubt left her mind as well I'm here to tell you doubt has left my mind doubt left the prophets mind doubt has left my mind has doubt left your mind say what is it I'm believing in that God is going to do the impossible God said what's impossible he's gonna make you perfect quite impossible oh I know believe me I'm the pastor here for more than 25 years God you're gonna make me and these people perfect okay I'm not laughing Oh after 25 years of preaching and and and even I'm not where I need to be and they're not where they need to be because the requirement is perfection it's like oh we're pretty good people it's pretty good people and getting in it takes perfect people there's lots of good people that are gonna miss it it takes perfect jesus said be thou for perfect how perfect as your father in heaven is perfect say that's impossible exactly that's why there has to take faith in the atonement of Christ and what God has done in this last day by returning to us the visitation of confirmation and that's what the seals were and that's what he came down and had a meal with Abraham and he had a seven-course meal with you and I hallelujah and we have had it confirmed to us the world can think what they want the world can choose to call it a cult I call it a confirmation the world can choose to call us nuts I say fine but I'm screwed to the right bolt I'm happy to be and not leave me alone I'm happy this way I wasn't happy when I wasn't a nut when I was normal according to the world I couldn't sleep good I walked in fear and anxiety of what happens if the rapture comes tomorrow I don't have that anxiety anymore if I say what if it comes tomorrow what if it comes in the next five minutes I start jumping up and down saying yeah yeah yeah let it come Lord so we have the climax there in Revelation 10 that was not just some set of sermons the opening of the seven seals was the most monumental event that the church had waited for 2,000 years to have that book reopened to them as it had been in Paul's day and it had been closed because that church back slid and Christ sets back down to intercede for the church but he promised that at the end time he would step forward again and take the book and loose the seals and open it to us and today we're feasting not on a not on a man but on the body word of the Son of Man hallelujah so it was a divine declaration to Abraham and his bride Genesis 18 was a divine declaration to Abraham and his bride of a human humanly impossible birth it was humanly impossible in the natural fray brahim and Sarah not to mention you know how old they were but even when they were young they had not been able the cruelty of sin had kept them childless and and and Melchizedek was coming to say the cruelty of sin shall keep you childless no longer the time had arrived he called it the time of life the mighty angel Melchizedek was descending to confirm that the impossible was going to take place you know it's just like us in the spiritual ranks brother Brandon said denominations had held us denominations had held Christ they had held him for years but a naked thought but those denominational tombs couldn't hold him just like the tomb in Jerusalem couldn't hold him he oh he came out of that tomb and the stone was rolled away and he he was resurrected that's my brother Brandon would say what a resurrection that was right historically but what a resurrection this is is what resurrection out of cold formal denominations out of manmade system and theories of men good men dedicated sincere men but couldn't get the picture right and we had to have the picture right we had to know what it is we're coming to because your faith can't be established on nothing you've got to have something to ground your faith on you've got to have a word brother Branham said that if I said to you go out there and touch that tree and you can be healed brother Branson you can't put faith in that because there's no word for that there's no where the word says go touch a tree and be healed but the word does say they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover now I have a basis for my faith and people wanted to take a rapture how were you ever gonna take a rapture with a closed book sealed up under seven seals and you couldn't even fully understand the rapture mystery you'd only understand the bride couldn't even understand her position in Christ and we were trapped but the time of Jubilee that was what Melchizedek was coming to announce to Abraham that's what the seals were announcing to us that it was he had come to two commits a Jubilee that the word will be born in the flesh of his family and that's what's happening to us our lives are being transformed into the body of the word just like a mother a transformation takes place inside her starts out just microscopically small but it grows and grows and what's it doing it's becoming a human see and that's just the spiritual side of it that that that he was coming to announce he's not saying you're gonna have the the baby by this time tonight he that Genesis 18 the seals weren't saying never were saying to us the raptures tomorrow morning that could have been but when when we look back now in hindsight we see the type in the scripture how that how that it was that it was the announcement that it's begun no the catching away of the rapture is not yet but the rapture has begun no you're not perfect yet you're an infant bride you've got to lay in the presence of the Sun and ripen but I'm here to tell you it's underway the cycle is underway and it has an end date and an end game and this thing ain't gonna stop and I just say I believe that we're right on the moment friends we call it the time of life he said I'll return this time next year according to the time of life and I'm not gonna come to promise you again you shall embrace a son I'm here to taste something friends I'm going to embrace a new body I'm gonna embrace those loved ones who've gone before I'm gonna embrace a whole new mind and a whole new spirit hallelujah that's what it came to do the visitation was to announce it see the word will be born in the flesh of his family that's what God was coming to promise Abraham there would be plenty of run-up to that birth see so she wasn't even pregnant yet she wasn't even turned back to where she could get pretty she's still 90 so God literally had to visit her with a temporary resurrection a type of what's gonna happen to us on a permanent basis and he literally turned her body back young again and that's what's gonna happen to us now she started from that point aging again it's just and she died an old lady so did Abraham died well stricken in years but took but for the purposes of the word God reversed nature an impossibility say it's impossible brother Jason I've done too many things wrong I can't get right I got too many weaknesses I'm here to tell you the seals were open for you people with impossible problems I mean and I'm not here to tell you that it's happy it's gonna happen if you're a believer of this word today I'm here to tell you it's already happening your body is already changing from the inside it starts in the soul that can believe every word and say a man and then a daily surrendering just like an unexpected mother has to daily surrender I'm pregnant it's not going to stop now the world wants to stop it and that's why you have abortion and the denomination wants to stop it they don't want brother Brennan said they don't want Holy Ghost babies but that's the only kind that will ever be in heaven hallelujah see so the birth itself the long-awaited promise to be fulfilled so throughout the passage when we read about Abraham laughing Sarah laughing throughout the passage you know we continue to marvel and it's a marvel to me when I read Genesis from Genesis 12 and now when I go over into the book of Hebrews to the Hall of Fame to the to the Hall of faith and he pin in the book of Hebrews the Bible and and not only there but in in so many places as stoles the life of Abraham is perfect he never never waivered never doubted see now that shows you what the blood of Jesus Christ when it's finished you're perfect because when I go to in Genesis I read all kinds of things Abraham did Abraham stumbled a lot Abraham was dilatory and obeying Abraham was slow Abraham didn't always do it the right way brother Matt was just preaching Wednesday night about how Jacob and brother Branham says you know you're really gonna have to believe in the grace of God to believe for Jacob because Jacob was constantly constantly doing things that you'd have thought he's the last one in the planet to be qualified that God's gonna carry a covenant through but God did see God did and and and you know what you know here's what it was friends Jacob literally couldn't lie his way out of being a child of God Jacob couldn't fail his way out of being a child of God goodness Jacob couldn't couldn't disappoint his family and disappoint his self enough to be taken out of the role that God had already ordained for him in that beautiful hallelujah and Abraham couldn't do that either abraham lied and got caught lying and did it twice and and you know and and rebelled and goes to Egypt and his back slid and and then and then and and then and I think in Chapter off an inch I believe it's chapter fourteen I haven't read it in a while but Abraham and it may be thirteen or fourteen or fifteen somewhere near Abraham goes to God after God's made him this promise and he says you know I know you may I'm paraphrasing scripture I know you made me this promise but you know there I still don't have any seed and I ain't getting younger you know the seals were preached all those years ago and we're still here you know prophets been gone now it's with fifty seven years since the opening seals and we're still here neighbor him said I I know what you promised I but I still don't have it and I I got this child you know this Eliezer who's a servant and it looks like if you don't keep your promise he's gonna inherit everything I had now you'd think God would just say Abraham I am sick of you challenging me and doubting me and failing I'm glad God didn't throw him out because that means he can't throw me out when I doubt him and when I fail and he would and he could be tempted to throw me out I can say remember Abraham thy servant hallelujah o mine I don't this remind him of Abraham I remind him of Jesus I say Lord I'm weak but he was strong I'm imperfect but he was perfect and you told me it would be his life for my life hallelujah and my life for his life now I saw him go to Calvary and die so I know that the first part of it worked my life got put on him because I saw him die I saw him judge and he had never done anything wrong so the only way he could be dying your hand is if you judged him and since he never did anything wrong the only way he could be judged is if he took my sin now if I'm gonna believe that then I have to believe his life came on me hallelujah Oh let us not doubted friends let us press on and say I'm in that number I'm part of that body change I am going to be raised up at the end there's no way I can miss it one thing I've never been able to accomplish in all my sinful deeds I've never been able to commit the worst sin and that is to disbelieve his word I can say to the Lord that's perfect faith the devil can't even challenge me on it he's it's you you say oh brother I'm said perfect faith it's getting perfect this right now I have this imperfect faith I can say before God Lord I never have disbelieved your word failed at it yes stumble trip iniquity things I knew I shouldn't undid anyway and things I knew I should do you word wanting me to and I wouldn't do it and and and I've been a terrible failure but here's one thing Lord my heart is open to you today I've always said a man to every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God hallelujah oh what a promise and I can say that in perfect unfettered uncolored undefiled faith that's why the devil can't knock me off of it because it's perfect faith see and I know it's true and the devil knows it's true and he's even got all the replay footage it's inadmissible in court but he keeps a record of it but it doesn't matter he doesn't have a file search my record there's no file don't I don't want him to let you search my record does there be things that embarrass me but you would never find me doubting God's Word amen come on all you holy people a man Oh hallelujah and God said to him there this shall not be the air miss Eliezer out of thy own loins in other words Abraham it's going to be the seed gene of you that inherits the promise not something I'm not a servant that came into your house not no matter how he got there he's never going to be more than your servant now it's a great privilege fairly easier to be your servant and I've got a place and a reward for him but he's not out of your loins he's not a gene of your seed out of your own loins out of your own seed I'm going to bring forth the kingdom of God and that's exactly what the Lord has done and so through those kinds of failures of Abraham through the doubting through the back sliding through the lying through the in God's face laughing go read 1772 chapter 17 God was there personally this wasn't even a dream like Jacob had God was literally standing there talking to him and Abraham is laughing at him laughing at the idea of what he's saying and in and and then he comes to Sarah and then Sarah is laughing and then not only is she laughing then she tried to lie your way out of it you know when you tell a line you get caught you get busted you'd have to think of three more lies to cover the first one and then later on you need nine more to cover those three which covered the first one that's my brother Brendan said always just tell the truth and that way you can tell it the same way every time and so we find that even when she's Abraham's doubting and he's sinning and she's doubting and she's sinning and he's lying and she's lying and and throughout all of this story in Genesis we continue to marvel at the insistence the insistence of God's grace against all odds in spite of Abraham's laughter in spite of Sara's laughter God remains determined to bless Sara he said that in Genesis 17 17 and 21 give me that brother Travis Genesis 17 sorry to jump you I should've gave you a warning Genesis 17 verse 7 chapter 17 verse 17 and then we'll go from there and we'll hit verse 21 Genesis 17 then Abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old and shall Sarah that is 90 years old verse 21 but my covenant will I establish with Isaac which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this time in the next year hallelujah and and then it comes in the next chapter and she's laughing and Abraham is laughing but but God is determined to bless her that blows fuses on this boy God will not take no for an answer you're gonna serve me no oh yes you are no I'm not we'll see I'm here to tell your friends I'm glad he runs faster than me jumps higher hallelujah I'm plan I hide in a hole he knows how to dig me out I'm glad if I run into a house he'll burn me out smoke me out do what I gotta do he's not leaving me here understand and I've said it to you before if you're the elected child of God you're going in the rapture and there's nothing you can do to stop it hallelujah see so God's purpose of grace listen friends this is an amazing statement because God is determined to bless Sarah and Abraham and you know as well as me for you to beyond anything they are we ever deserved God's purpose and grace his purposes in grace absorb this now God's purposes in grace are not held captive to human sin or circumstances in your life even if you created the circumstances many times they're thrust on to us I don't know I've heard horror stories just beyond imagination I'm a world traveler I've set and counseled and you don't even sometimes the the situation is so bad and you know hardly know where to you don't you understand the question much less the answer and here's a gallant person and the situation is so horrible of no fault of their own yeah sure the atheist uses stuff like that to say see there is no God well I got a problem and my problem is I got faith and so I look at the circumstances and even if I can't understand it all I still know he is I still know that God is I still know that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him and many times my only answer to a problem it's so convoluted and twisted such a Gordian knot there's no way that to untie it I just have to take say look stand back I'm going to take the Word of God and I'm gonna take it as a sword on there like Alexander and I'm gonna chop this knot in half there's no sense trying to untangle it just let the word cut it asunder and go free you can't go back and fix it just go forward and be happy amen because none of that I promise you I don't care what's happening say but I can't get over I can't let it go I promise you in 10,000 years it won't matter and won't it so won't matter in 10,000 years so why go 10,000 years worried just let it go let God take control of your life I promise you faith and happiness and joy are just in front of you so he is that he's the God who works out his purposes through weak and very very very ordinary beings that's what he's doing to Abraham that's what he's doing to Sarah he's working out his purpose through very ordinary sometimes weak got a lot of hang-ups through weak ordinary vulnerable people see so god he needs to take Abraham he needs to take his prophet beyond human limitations and a lot of times friends I'll to say that life is really just singularly about that sometimes you can come upon a thing in your life and you're dealing with it and it's so egregious to you or so bitter so embarrassing or so you you hate it so bad and you you want you want freedom you want past it you want over it it is so completely impossible that that you say well what is God doing in my life for crying out loud why can't this just get fixed because brother branham shows us you know about an overcomer that he's not just pushing you through a pipe and pulling you out the other side and have you molded into the I want you to look like a pipe so I'm gonna jam you in and pull you out and when you come out you look just like the pipe you know he doesn't want you you know forced by a mold he wants you to put on the whole armor of God and march forward and gain some victory swing your sword get on your knees go to church more read your Bible more hear tapes more cut off some of the things out of your life that you know good and well are poisoning you this thing works I'm here to tell you the gospel works and God knows what he's doing and so you know God takes his prophet and sometimes he takes us beyond our human limitations to believe it he did Abraham that way he did Sarah that way you know she she couldn't disbelieve when the very secrets of her heart were being revealed you can't disbelieve when that's happening so so we find then that you know here no no let me let me change gears or go turn a corner all right let me hit a practical side of this so we're talking about what the seals meant to us and what Genesis 18 means to us and we're seeing the correlations and say wow that's what happened in our day we had a we had a 20th century version of Genesis 18 okay well Sarah had the real event not any less not any greater real than ours but she had the natural she actually was there she actually saw Melchizedek she actually is talking to God in a human body she's actually laughing on God and God is actually giving her the promise and confirming it and then you know what she does she believes it but you know what comes next Monday morning Tuesday Wednesday guess what happens next week Monday morning guess what happens a month from then Monday morning Tuesday morning Wednesday morning guess what happens see so so what happens when the sign was gone what happened when he left you know you saw the faith of many who believed that sign who don't walk this way anymore why a prophet left the sign left and people just quit moving Sarah after the sign left after it was gone all she had was the promise she still had to get up the next day and believe it she had to get up the next day and believe it and the next week and believe it she had to wake up and go to work the next day you have to wake up and go to work she had to get back to her life still in progress the seals were great I'm here to tell you something my mom and dad were in a lot of those meetings guess what happened when the when that Sunday services were over Monday you know how many mondays my mom has faced since the day the seals were open since the day she was sitting there hearing the masterpiece since the day she's sitting there seeing that gift work you know how many mondays she's had hallelujah I'm here to tell you like Sarah we got it as keep believing our life is still in progress the rapture wasn't happening in 1963 but the rapture was happening in 1963 it's a process and God is interweaving his word in your life on an everyday basis I want to say press the battle that's what Paul knew press the battle lay aside you're on a journey you're going somewhere your life's in progress let aside things that are gonna be sent you you don't want to do you don't want to have those things because the order is to run the race see so she had to get back to her life which was still in progress and no way you never convinced me she lived and moved flawlessly the Bible says even Elijah was a man of like passion his brother Graham said in Kentucky English brother em said that many had his ups and downs see the only one who ever got a promise and lived flawlessly to the end was Jesus so the Bible says of everybody except him there's none good no not one see and so so she had to get back to her life still in progress there's no way she lived and moved flawlessly but she still got pregnant she still had a child why friends because the promise was given the word was already spoken hallelujah it would indeed come to pass though though though though on Monday morning it was still just as impossible as it had always been you're gonna leave this service today hopefully this word will give you some charge up your batteries and you'll be ready to go but tomorrow you might round the corner and the devil might crack you with a Louisville Slugger you didn't see come and hit you right between the eyes you know what you're gonna have to do you got to get up yank it out of his hands and bash him in the head with it life doesn't stop hallelujah we're not at the dock sitting on luggage this is life in the in progress this is life in HD this is happening right now hallelujah it comes down to believing and moving because the word has already been declared and I will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye it is God's grace it is God's grace it is God's grace not human merit it is God's Word that determines the course and the blessing of our lives the beautiful part is that though she woke up the next day and it was still just as impossible as it always had been now she had a promise that God would do the impossible part you know what when I read that and I look at this story in Genesis I'm compelled to believe it because I look at my own life and I and I realize which you know for me you know has seemed to be be pretty much there every kind of weakness and failure and shortcoming but but somehow I've managed to believe it still and Endon and I believe it now more than ever I believe it now more than ever oh my you know the devil what a dingdong thought that he would you know raise up a movement to discourage us and you know because you know oh there's something about a bridge I don't couldn't care less I'm not being raptured by jumping off a bridge I don't care about a bridge I don't care about what a child saw at five years old in a vision that that's not what saved me what saved me was I could see Jesus Christ come into the ministry and I could correlate it back there's so much we don't know you don't know they talk like they know and and we've talked like we know a lot of times I just simply say God knows and say what you want to but I've been in Washington DC I've seen the picture the only one that they declares a supernatural photograph I've seen the effect of this word on people's lives who I love people who I preach to parents that I've had I see what this message has done you come too late to tell me it's wrong I already know it's true I already see the changes made in me and I'm here to tell you if it can take an old Sassafrass boy like me and bring me out of the world and then keep me out of the world and even when I stumble pick me back up just jerk me up dust me off and go forward again I'm here to tell you something friends I know whom I have believed and the devil instead of discouraging us has made us more encouraged my greatest attempts have been feeble at the feeble at the very least as I've carved out a life of service to him these many years and I've already been to I remember one time I don't I I at the time I was young I didn't fully analyze what it meant years have taught me more what it meant now I remember years ago we were Oh mom we were down in Ansan her scene for Nate and Margaret's wedding and my dad was taking a picture with with Homer Brown and they were buddies from way back in the 60s and and they're standing there with her arm around each other and they're waiting you know and somebody's got to get the hell and get the focus this was before phones could do it for you and they're standing there my dad just smiling and he says to brother Homer and he's looking at the camera he says well brother Homer we've been through the fire have been through the blood and at the time I was young man I thought I wonder what that even means been through the fire been through the blood boy do I know how he's here later oh we've been through the fire we've been through the blood oh my the walk of faith listen friends this walk of faith sometimes involves you just digging your heels in and looking you're difficult circumstances in the face and say this too shall pass and I too shall have victory over this in my life taking the promises of the of God defying discouragement defying disappointments defying frustrations that would pay to quit quit nothin doin I'm marching for Zion hallelujah is anything as we were saying and I don't remember part 1 or part 2 we were emphasizing so strong is anything too hard for God is anything too marvelous brother Branham says and seen him discrepancy God gave his children his word for their defence that is your and must be your defence on a daily basis in real time you will constantly be beset by circumstances and challenges you won't always make the grade your only - if you try to defend yourself by just saying I'm a pretty good guy I'll try to do better next time here that'll never get you out of the doldrums of doubt and despair what you've got to do is say the word is my defense and the word has said greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world the world has said there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness all those who love his appearing and I sure know I've loved his appearing he said we have no other defense than the Word of God I'm glad it's that way because the Word of God is the only thing unchanging even the Rock of Gibraltar is not unchanging the Word of God is the only unchanging thing in the universe the Rock of Gibraltar was not always there the word was always there and so the time of life I shall visit thee according to the time of life and we don't know you know brother Branham talks about it I'm not here to go down this this vain to too deeply today just want to touch it maybe it seemed like it might be cooking for a later sermon but you know the time of life because he she wasn't pregnant immediately she didn't I mean she didn't wasn't it pregnant and have a baby immediately but the promise was confirmed see and he said I what I returned according to the time of life you shall embrace his son and you know brother Branham gives us these examples in the third poll we've we've talked about him for years creating squirrels actually did that twice saying you know to a woman who's burden over her children I give you your children see and and from that moment those boys fell across her knee gave their heart to the Lord later back slid then came back again see you can't you can't you cannot defeat the Word of God it's gonna come to pass not nothing can fort his purposes God had made a promise ask anything I don't care what it is just ask it and when she asked it God said done signed sealed and delivered for all eternity that's it case closed were finished you understand whatever God would have to do you might even have to take him by the grave if they had not repented who can say but God wouldn't lose them and spoke a squirrel I'm sorry spoke a storm out of existence you know where brother Kevin was sending me bulletins today that it's starting up now we've got severe storms rolling in all the afternoon through the night and into tomorrow serious threats as soon as church is over we're going to need to just disband quickly and and get to our places of refuge but there's times that that we could say man I if I get to speak the storm out of existence there's times we've been threatened by hurricanes say well why didn't we well God didn't but God still protected us see and so and then he his wife's got a tumor the Lord and he prayed a long time earnestly sincerely and he and listened to his argument you talking about an argument that should move the heart of any judge Your Honor she's been a good wife never raised a voice to me never in all the years we've been married Lord he was talking about Mita III go out I'm gone two or three months I come in she washes my clothes gives me my rifle packs me up and I head back out the door to go hunting for I've never been home one time on our anniversary I'm not always preaching sometimes I'm hunting large she's been a good woman she's never complained she's never this is one little time she just raised her voice a little bit uns close the door in my face a little too hard she didn't mean it lord she's in menopause and what I said I you know I was partly my fault lord help her and you know what she went days and turned into weeks and the tumor kept growing and turned into months and the tumor kept growing she had uncomfortable it got sore she couldn't touch it she couldn't to go to the doctor she couldn't hardly get on the table for an exam it was swelled out and brother branham is pleading here's a prophet of God see see you you don't always know that may have did that knock us off for the gorge I noticed this TV went out here okay so maybe we're still rolling I didn't do the failover so if we're if we get knocked out of this be friends if we go out we'll just keep recording you'll get it on the archive so we're getting some lightning here so those of you at home to speed be praying for us so you know here she is suffering and brother Branham you remember when brother Steve was here yeah that's coming back online now for the gorge when brother Steve was here and he talks about how long he went you know this problem with his father and and the answer and he couldn't understand why God had let this happen and then later he goes in meets him and then he comes and meets the family and and then brother Steve gets clarity years later and the Lord spoke to him you see when you I couldn't give you the answer when you were first asking because you couldn't have handled the answer you weren't ready remember I'm the heavenly father father knows best he knows your life best and he's waiting because God's got a better plan dr. prophet how many millions of people had been healed under a prophet just talking on the phone just just brother Brendan said sometimes a call come in on the phone and he said somebody dying right then and he said I go to my knees and he said the only thing I can do he said I'm not there with him to lay hands on him he said so I just start praying and I point at that telephone and start praying and I don't know you know don't go get go get go get some physicist to tell me how that works I don't know here's a prophet all I know is the prophets on his knees and he's pointing out a telephone and healing is happening thousands of miles away and somebody dying suddenly is not and here he is praying for his wife the same sincerity it's the love of his life they can't lose its second one has already suffered immeasurably and then but God is waiting on a better solution and finally one day he's praying and he's one more time after he's prayed so many times he's right down she's going to the doctor she's and and her friend is helping him cause brother Branham at the time when she's got a death-defying tumour ain't even home he's not even with her he's out serving the Lord Jesus and he's just committing her to the hands of God and the Lord comes says stand up stands up and the Lord now doesn't say pray a prayer ask he says say what it'll be and brother Branham understood he'd had this happened before and he said I say I say that before the doctors and touches her the I said the hand of God will dissolve the tumor before the doctors hand can touch it his unfailing words of promise January 64 I say that before the hand of God will dissolve the tumor before the doctors hand can touch it and she gets up waddles up onto the table and the doctor comes in and he moves around and he goes - and and there she is can't even get on the table it's so bulging and he goes to lay his hand and he unwraps and feels around miss Branham that was on this side wasn't it yes and it's not on the other side and it's suddenly there and then it's suddenly not there it suddenly fully formed a demon a tumor house for a demon to live in and in an instant both house and demon are gone now you tell me friends we it is this the time of life we've had the seals we see the world shaking and falling apart is this the time of life that is ready to arrive back and say oh we've heard that for four years well you're hearing it again I'm here to tell you something friends this thing can't just keep going on and on and on and on forever I already see the third pole I'm not waiting on the third pole the third pole is wide open the seals

tell you that power is at your disposal if God should so choose your part is not to figure that out your part is to serve Him your part is to go forward your part is to don't disbelieve no matter what the situation is I don't care what's happening believe keep believing keep believing whatever happens is in God's care leave it there let God decide your life your job is to trusting your job is to go into the hedges in the highways and tell everybody you can before it's too late this is being the hand of God this is you remember I've showed you how that that to whom is the arm of the Lord we preached it in part one and and we realized that the heart the arm is the bridge between the body and the hand it's the hand that does the work but the arm has to reach it out there the hand can't go crawl and do it itself it needs an arm and the arm can't do it it needs a body and the body can't do it it needs a life inside of it hallelujah and God jesus said I am the vine you are the branches my father's the husband in other words my father is the life I am the body I'm the arm you're the hand I'm doing it through you it is the I'm the vine the branches bring forth the fruit this is our
