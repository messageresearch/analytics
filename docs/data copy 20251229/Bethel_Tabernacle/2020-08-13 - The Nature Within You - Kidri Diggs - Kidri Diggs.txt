say lord i want to touch you with my need amen i'm reminded of a little woman who touched him just the hem of your garment yeah amen and she was made whole brother branham said that god he said the father had shown jesus everything except that do you know brother adam said that he said jesus was just going about his business and he said but a little woman by her faith had a need she needed something and he said and she reached out in faith he said now the rest of those miracles that was god doing that he said but that little woman he said that was her faith doing that and he said and jesus said who touched me virtue went out from me and brother branham said it and if you'll take your need whatever it is raise it up say lord here it is and he said you with that same faith you can touch jesus take a preacher off of his notes take him off of his inspiration off of his path whatever's on his heart and god will meet your need amen we want to we've we believe that we've sang these

the house of the lord tonight amen we thank god for his mercy and grace and just traveling mercy you know it was raining so hard coming down here you know and um the closer i got the dryer it got so i thank god for making it hey man thank god for all you pressing out and we certainly appreciate with jason brother man all the different brothers and sisters you know let's just bow our heads have a word of prayer if you haven't spoken with questions to the lord by uplifting hand let's pray lord jesus father here we are again lord at our prospective places of duty lord and lord we're leaning on you lord lord for we know that the thoughts of a man is no good to your people so lord we pray not our thoughts but your thoughts lord not our will but your will lord not our mind but your mind father and lord we just ask you take full control of the service lord lord you see the hands lifted to you lord you know the needs of every lifting of the hands lord you know every thought and every every intent lord in our lives and we pray lord that the power of god will be among us lord jesus lord not just uh a a power of authority law but a power to surrender lord lord just to yield to you and just be thankful for the grace of god in our lives lord and lord we pray for all those that may be sick lord through the hearing of the word let it drive our evil spirits lord lord if there's anyone who don't know you father reveal yourself in a special way in the wonderful name of jesus christ we pray we thank you we love you that church amen amen hallelujah if you have your bibles say man let's turn to ezekiel 36 chapter ezekiel 36 for me a verse of scripture i was um thinking on this as i was driving and as i drove it turned and it turned and it turned so i don't know what the lord gonna do tonight amen we just learned how to lean on him amen ezekiel 36 let's start reading that verse 20 25 ezekiel 36 and verse 25 the bible says then i will sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your your idols will i cleanse you a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of you out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them you notice you can't do that with just a new spirit he said after you get the new spirit he's going to put his spirit in you it's his spirit that allows us to keep his statues amen let's go to second peter chapter one second peter chapter one let's start at verse three the bible says ii peter chapter 1 verse 3. it says according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding and great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust amen may the lord have a blessing to reading of his word you can have your seats amen tonight by the grace of god i want to use for a subject of nature within you the nature within you and you know you know uh as a christian i i hear that so much you know you see certain things or certain things happen in church and it's a lot of times people say well it's just my nature you know that's just the way i am it's just my nature and you know we we say that kind of casually and you know especially doing service you know and you know the word of god may be coming and you may not be reacting and then you say well that's just my nature think about that would you want the kind of nature that doesn't react to the word of god so you need to get rid of that kind of nature amen and you need the nature of god amen you know when we think about the word nature nature deals with the basic the basic inheriting of characteristics and you know we have been uh called to inherit the nature of god [Music] but there's more to it than what we think there's more to the nature of god than just coming to church or just having enough ability to come to church because anybody can do that that doesn't mean the nature of god lies within you you know so we want to look at we want to look at the nature and the characteristics of things before we get into this thought good you know when i was thinking about a lion hallelujah and how a lion uh when we think about a lion we doesn't we don't think about the lion in his baby stages we always think about the power of the lion the power the roar the strength and the king of beasts we think about all those things but you know when that lion was a little cub it still had the nature of a full-grown lion hallelujah but it had to grow into all those characteristics it was lying there but as it grew hallelujah what it was began to come out amen and it didn't have to make itself be a lion it just was a lion it just is a lion hallelujah in troubled times it's a lion in hot times it's a lion when it's raining outside it's a lion when the sun is up it's a lion where the sun is going down it's a lion when it's being hunted it is a lion it is what it is by nature and nothing can change that hallelujah nothing can change that and you know as i look it i begin to think you know we don't see the different characteristics or the nature of a lion how many of you have ever seen a lion being keep be killed never seen a lion be killed you know i never see a lion die either amen only by the hands of another lion think about that hallelujah the lane is so powerful so strong the only thing that can kill it is one of the same nature and you know when you think about believers and and church and atmospheres hallelujah only you can stop the service from being something great in your own lives you have the power to make this a good powerful service or by your own nature you can jump into your same routine and you can do what you've always done and you'll get the same results like you've always had but to get something greater sometimes you got to do something different sometimes you got to break away from your nature you know like we say we talk about the lion being the king of the beasts hope y'all man i'ma take this off we talk about the lion being the king of the beast is not the fastest cat no he's not the fastest cat hallelujah by nature the cheater he is and you know the cheetah he could he could he could he could he could he could him and a lion can be chasing some prey and he'll outrun that lion every time he might even get there first but he can't stop the lion from taking his prey you know why because by its nature the lion is stronger it may be slower in that moment but that doesn't change what it is in church i want you to realize your trials and tribulation doesn't change who you are if god made you a child of god that's what's in you and normally your trials and your tribulation is trying to bring out the nature of the one that's inside of you and if the holy ghost is inside of you in those times the holy ghost will come out but if the devil is inside of you the nature of the devil will come out you know there's a man named uh kenneth kenneth copeland and there's a story where there was a man working with him he was a painter and you know he told kenneth you know he said man i so appreciate your ministry i just love you and i'm with you to the end you know you're just such a good man and i'm with you to the end and god is good and i'm with you to the end and that man seemed like he was a good christian but you know that same man went up the ladder and he started to fall and on his way down he said everything that didn't reflect what he was telling kenneth everything came out of his mouth showed that he didn't have the nature of a christian inside although he talked a good talk he walked a good walk but when he was put under pressure the real hymn began to come out you know we we look at that lion and we say man the king of the beasts you know when a lion roars just by its nature when it roars you hear that roar for over five miles a tiger's road is just as loud but it's not as loud as a lion why it's it's nature do you all know lions they sleep over 18 hours a day and if they hunt and they get they get really really full they can sleep up to 24 hours and you know you may like some of these crazy people i've been to a lion um jungle thing whatever you call it a safari yeah i said jungle thing i've been to safari and you know as you're going through that safari they're telling you stories of the characteristics of the lion and you know you you ride through and you see the lions just laying down and doing this they're not really really active or doing nothing and you know one day this man and his wife they came and the lions will sleep so he said you know what i'm gonna come back again and the lions will sleep and i believe it's the third time he got so sick of the lions being asleep he got out his car that was completely against what the people told you when you go to the safari they say never leave your car but you know what this man didn't understand the nature of a lion so he got his car you know i believe he was from china somewhere he got out of his car and he thought the lion was asleep and he began to pull out his polaroid or whatever it was and he began to take pictures and that lion which was supposed to be sleep lifted his head and this man is not in the comfort of his car anymore sad to say that man became lion meat because he did not understand the nature of the animal he had stepped to he was in his presence he saw it he even got close to it but he didn't understand the nature of the thing that he was coming in contact with in church i want to say don't play with the devil because you may think uh i can do this and i can do that but that nature will cause you to get destroyed he died and his wife died in the hospital trying to save him so church when you think about the nature of something the nature of it tells what it really is now i say all that to say so i can get into my thoughts i want you to understand the nature of something you know cause we could say uh a man is a man and he's identified by his nature so you have men walking around and they say well you know what i think i'm a woman they have to live a falsified life because his nature is the nature of a man so he has to put on nails and and dresses and and boots and change his hair and do all these things to suppress the nature of what he really is and vice versa and you know they say well i'm born this way yeah you are born a man hell yeah but they have to change themselves because the dna inside will come out of what you really are hallelujah and no matter you can take that lion and you can try to raise him as a pit bull he'll still come out to be a lion you can try to feed it some kimbles and bits it'll still be a lion you can put a chain on it put it in a dog house it'll still be a lion by nature and if you rub it the wrong way it'll roar just like it would if it was in the jungle why because it's a lion we're going somewhere now i'm talking about a lion because i want you to realize you're a child of god hallelujah and your nature hallelujah that's why we must be born again and i don't plan on being alone tonight that's why we must be born again because the nature you were born with doesn't reflect the promise of god being born in flesh came into the world speaking lies that is the wrong nature and if you don't get changed you don't get born again you will reflect the nature of the enemy and you can come to church you can sit here you can sing souls you can clap your hands but without the holy ghost you can only become what that nature is inside of you amen and we've seen people do that for years they come to church they clap their hands and they sing and they do all these things you know what that is that's called a routine but when it really is who you are that doesn't just happen in church i don't know about y'all but i sing in my car i sing in my house i've seen when i'm in walmart hallelujah why because i got the nature of a worshiper i got the nature of thanksgiving the nature of redemption the nature of grace the nature of joy the nature of faith all these things i'm talking about makes up the divine nature of god so who's inside of you what kind of nature is inside of you what's making you say amen tonight i mean a friend of mine we was talking about this covert 19 stuff in church don't be surprised there are some people who are not coming back to church when they made it where you could stream stream i'm trying to say the word right screen stream there it is thank you brother stream because it's in their nature they're happy to sit home they're happy to miss church and stay home and all these things streaming gave them the the right and the ability now to produce what's really inside of them and you may not understand this but you take brother jason brother matt mead or any other brother we'll tell you that service is good hello but you know that there are some people it's hard for them to get back into it why because they'd rather stream service is tight service is starchy for them hallelujah you know what i said one time at my church i said i said uh that we're in revival but then i stopped hallelujah i take that back there is no we i'm in revival hallelujah a lot of times we want to try to try to make one another feel how we feel and then we say we i'm we mad at the preacher we mad at us only we we no you are hallelujah so let's take away the we and what are you tonight what is your nature tonight hallelujah now i'm gonna move a little bit quicker hallelujah but you know church if we could go back to the beginning let's look at the nature we should really have her you know what god created everything he said it was good when he created man he created man in his likeness and his image so man had the nature of god in i want you to catch this where was that nature that nature was in his spirit hallelujah when adam walked around he thought like god in his spirit holy he walked like god where in his spirit hallelujah everything he saw he saw it through the eyes of god in his spirit he had the nature of god so much to sow god came and say i want you to name creation i want you to name this i want you to do this i want you to do that he could never be a god if he didn't have the nature of a god amen hallelujah and you will never be bribed if you don't have the nature of bride because remember in this climate we're in our promises holy in this time in this day that the bride his wife have made herself god had made us he laid it all out for us but the words say his wife have made herself ready that's the nature of the bride that's the nature of this end time believer hallelujah you are doing everything you can do to make sure you don't get left behind now we know it's by grace but god left something up for us to do yes sir you say brothers why would we say that because you know we like to say by nature if they bride they gonna make it holy if it's meant to be they gonna make it well you don't know that hallelujah if we just take that thought right there alone it looks like without a shadow of a doubt judas should have made it because you just look at him on the outside and you take the characteristics of his nature for that time he healed the sick he raised the dead he did all the things that the other men do holy but then when it was time for him to do something when it was time for him to press into a new life hallelujah he rejected it so the real hymn came out hallelujah where did that come from that came from the fall when adam fell already bible says we have become partakers of his divine nature think about that that should make you shout partakers of the divine nature of god how can i be a partaker of his divine nature without being a part of him but we've heard these things so much by nature it's gotten common to us yeah i've heard that i heard that plenty of times i heard i heard quotes i heard these things so much you know what i could preach this right here in the nomination and they'll jump and shout and turn the place upside down you know why because they never heard it before but they believe it we believe it and heard it before yeah i know that's how your face look behind your mask what is it about us that we don't even react to the word what is it about us that the power of god the nature of god has become common words to us i'm about to drop something on you heavy if you ever experience that level of god it'll change your life if you ever experience the supernatural divine nature of god it will change your life holy i guarantee you you will come to church different holy if you ever if you ever receive and experience hallelujah the unmerited blessings of god you can't just be a normal christian hallelujah glory oh my mama listen he said adam when adam hallelujah fell into sin his spirit got contaminated therefore his nature got contaminated church he was once walking with god he was once in the presence of god having communion and fellowship with god but when sin came in his nature changed so much to that the same god came down and he was afraid of him look god didn't do anything to make him afraid where did it come from the fallen nature if you are afraid to give your life to god you have a fallen nature if you are afraid to fully surrender to god and come in his presence you are operating under a fallen nature it's the fallen nature that makes us run from god is the fallen nature that makes us hide behind religion i'm in the message i go to a message church you'd be surprised how many people in the message but the message ain't in them they sitting in truth they shout when you shout sing the same songs you saying but by nature they don't love it it's just a routine oh my what you look he says look at adam's spirit before and after the fall before he had the nature of god what was that nature dominion hallelujah multiply subdue the earth church that's what's restored to us when we receive the holy ghost dominion subdue and multiply hallelujah he was naming creation and speaking to it but after he saw himself shameful he got scared what was he scared of he was scared of what he had become but who told him that god never told him that god never told him he was wicked you're silly now you diss you that nothing as soon as he stepped in god's presence he knew he was unworthy that's one thing about the devil the devil will will help you to see all of your flaws the devil will help you to see everything you're not doing right you say where's god how can it be god when god don't see it amen hallelujah am i right or wrong the prophet of god say god don't see your mistakes god don't see your flaws so who's showing it to us [Music] the enemy and if you succumb to it and you be beginning to believe that is what you are you will begin to produce the very lies that the devil are trying to get you to believe you say well brother jesus i made a mistake let's look at the nature of god of a person that makes mistakes look remember david tuck bathsheba uh uh and did nathan i believe was nathan nathan kingdom say david you know there's a man who had one sheep this other man had hundreds and he came and took the one sheep and david said where are you at i'm gonna kill him by nature david was a man who stood for what was right and in that moment he didn't even know he was hating himself oh my that's just like the devil he'll make you do something then come back and turn around and accuse you of what you did just like judas hallelujah so do you realize after he gave up the lord after he betrayed the lord he felt bad about it because any man in his right mind would never betray god oh my church listen from there the enemy what he does is hallelujah he'll push things in your mind and push things for you to think like he thinks when god doesn't even see it all he sees his blood hardly all he's think about this night you say when we sinners in god's eyes all he sees is holiness all he sees the righteousness of god all he sees is his nature he's like brother i did wrong last night who told you that god he's the accuser of the brothering but let's look at it with david when nathan told david don't get nervous i'm about to close and if you watch me and it's a little too much you take me off pause but you know church from there hallelujah you look at david he he he he realized they just say david that man is you look at the nature of god a man that did wrong a man that knew he was wrong what did he do he instantly repented he didn't try to reason with it he didn't try to say you know brother branham said honey brother brandon said that bathsheba knew david would come that time and she took a bath like that on purpose but david didn't david didn't make excuses david didn't say she knew i was down and she tempted me the nature of god was i'm wrong lord forgive me that's right lord created me a clean heart lord take not that holy spirit for me psalms 51 came out of that trouble holy son 51 came out of all that sin huh what was it in times of adversity in times of trouble what came out of david not more hate what was really inside of him began to come out think about the church what do you do when you're persecuted what do you do when you talked about hollywood do you look for a scripture to seek revenge god said he gonna make my enemies my footstool what do you say like moses said he told moses hold your peace and let the lord fight your battles think about it i love talking about david because you think about a man like david who had all the problems he had he reflected more and more of the nature of god through all of his trials hallelujah look he got a man trying to kill him for no reason just because he's been anointed my how often have we tried to kill one another just because god is using somebody we talk about when we see all these things and we don't know what's going on in their life a bunch of javelin through us but i'd rather be like david than saul a man who experienced the same anointing but he couldn't move into the nature of it that's the difference church a lot of people can experience the anointing of this end time word but they can't move into the nature of it you take balaam hallelujah and moses hallelujah both of them prophets but balaam couldn't reflect the nature of god like moses could amen you take hallelujah vashtine esther both of them queens but vast i couldn't reflect the nature of a queen when esther could she was a queen but she couldn't reflect the nature of a queen y'all getting me with this nature right but i want you to see if i can read this when the prophet talked about um ezekiel 36 he said let's turn to it right quick ezekiel 36. verse 26 he says and a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit he said that new spirit is a new nature he said because you need a new spirit so that you can even get along with your own self because y'all knowing that the holy ghost or without the right kind of spirit people get on your nerves and you tell them about it so god has to bring in a governor hallelujah god has to bring in some controlling power when you're old man let me tell you this that old man he's still in you way down in you don't think for one bit oh i got the holy ghost i'm good i'll never be able to react like that oh no oh no hallelujah i was preaching on inspiration like i preached here and i would say look hallelujah god will do things in your life to bring up things and swipe it off that nobody else knew was in you and i probably you know i probably don't get no cool points or message points for those but i use the profit holy do we know that the prophet had a lying spirit inside of him that takes away that that takes away your deity spirit that takes away your godhead that even takes away hallelujah oh my this is gonna be just gonna be something that look church god couldn't use him because he knew he'd get in a place where he'd have a tendency to tell a lie so god allowed his taxes to get backed up for years and years and years years and years why because he had to raise that lying spirit up hallelujah nobody knew holy church and i want to tell you this with the holy ghost [Music] that spirit was inside of him at the same time he had healing lines same time he was doing miracles and signing wonders that little lying spirit was in him oh i got your attention i don't know they got all our self-righteousness going out the window if any man reflected the nature of god we could say it was that prophet all the 10 up million dollar checks and doing all that stuff still had a lion spirit inside but god said no that's not who he really is so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna put him in a position where i can deal with that lying spirit hallelujah and then he goes and tell him tell him i'm not here and then he walks out the back joe and the immediate has to come and check him minnie comes and say bill you know that wasn't quite right he said what you mean you know listen he says what you mean i wasn't in there right then still lying trying to justify it he was trying to say no i did really lie with his wife was telling him bill you lied and you know what stopped him he went off and he went off to his regular routine he went up to his regular routine you're gonna pray for somebody who needed prayer and he went to lay his hands with that person and god said get your hands on that person get your lying hands off of them i ain't badgering the prophet i'm just showing when the real nature of god is inside of you look church through a lying spirit hollya god used them even mighty amen holy when god showed him his mistake mistaking his way after god dealt with him he said oh lord i'm sorry he called the man up and he said you know i told a lot whatever blah blah blah and the man says hey bill i always have respect for you now i got more respect holy the man huh saw the nature of god through the prophet getting caught in a lie wow but we look at one another we'll say that was serpenty no that was god making his prophet perfect amen and it's the same thing with us we fall down hollywood but those things are for our good church from there you never heard of the prophet telling the lie again same thing with abraham hallelujah god knew he told abraham walk before me and be thou perfect the only way he could have the perfect nature of god is for god to get all those things that don't reflect him out of him so god how does he do it by walking holly first thing he does he walks into a trial and abraham says hey you my sister lying what is up with the seed of abraham everybody just telling lies is that what we're supposed to do is that how we get abraham faith let's lie first do you realize isaac did the same thing and then you come down nowaday prophet tells a lie but once god dealt with that spirit look look somebody was blessed off of the purging of god saint god making us whole god giving us his nature hallelujah church look holy god goes to the king and say look you better get that man back his wife and he says look he told me that was a sister you know the integrity of my heart god said that's why i'm keeping you from sinning against me but if you don't give him back you're as good as a dead man and what i want you to do i want you to go let that liar pray for you god knew after that abraham would never tell another lie am i in the book do you ever hear abraham lying again but it was still in the seat because we got to joseph remember he told don't tell them what kind of work y'all do don't tell them y'all hurt us and so forth or whatever but what this bro what's wrong with this bride you say brothers why are you going down this rock cause some of y'all telling lies that spirit in here but be quick to repent and get it right and reflect the nature of god because that's the true nature of god when you do wrong hollywood when you get caught up it's god doing it for your benefit hallelujah i know one brother hallelujah hey man he was and mind you when the prophet did this he was filled with the holy ghost but you know there were things before he got filled with the holy ghost that was in his nature god had to take out hallelujah he had premeditated murder in his nature we didn't read it we didn't heard all these stories but i want to zero in on it real quick you know hurling them boys beat him up and you know he went and got a shotgun on you boy you got to be oh you got have a rough spear you're gonna kill somebody with shock you're gonna shoot somebody with a shotgun that's somebody who ain't making no joke for y'all who brothers who dear hunt when you hit that deal with that shotgun like and the problem's gonna shoot some guys with it man but you know what because god knew one day he was really gonna reflect the real nature inside of him god just brought that up and swept it off hallelujah when he tried to go through it hallelujah he had he tried to go through it god jammed the gun every time church he had a spirit inside of him of suicide somebody talked to me all these things are recorded out of the prophet's mouth he had a spirit of suicide in him that was not the nature of god so god let all these things arise before he started using him so these things will never get into him again took his wife took his daughter he wanted to commit suicide sure but then church once he got into his commission hallelujah he'd be lost out of his mind but he never thought about killing himself he said he'd be in the field walking around saying i want to go home i want to go home now i want to kill myself the nature of god where was that coming from see church we need to look at our life a little bit and try to see what is god doing he says he give you a new spirit a new heart put he said he says i'll give you a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of you out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you see it ain't until we get hallelujah that nature change hallelujah that identifies that the holy ghost is now living in you holy there are certain things that we'll do or you will do on your own and you know it ain't god amen what is it it's that fallen nature but the real power is not being able to succumb to it the problem of god said you can't stop a bird from flying over your head but you can stop it from building a nest you can't stop yourself from having bad thoughts but you can stop yourself from going through those thoughts it's all about a trial it's all about growing and so forth he says look he said god has put has put us each in a body to do certain things and i watch every little move every objective every motive because everything is governed by a spirit oh my this church was put here for a purpose there's a spirit behind this church certainly spear behind your home behind every building behind everything is a spirit motive and objective hallelujah what's your objective for coming to church tonight is it just a routine listen he says you know that's what's the matter with the church today it don't get in the spirit enough we're too much in ourselves well brothers you like jumping shouting and running that just ain't my nature that's just you know i'm just a calm person i'm just quiet we had a brother come to our church one time and he said you know you know y'all know there's a rumor there's a rumor in the south you know i'm sure but matt didn't hurt some of y'all some of y'all heard it too and some of y'all succumbed to it you know but there's a rumor running around the message you know that's that's it haven't been out here a good little while it's some false doctrine you know it hadn't been out here a while but you know it's it's a doctrine going around that only black people shout amen brad hallelujah that's a big doctrine going around he's been going around for some years only black people shout only black people in the south only black people just it's as hard as i'm preaching bro jason doing everything he can do not to jump up and say he from minnesota hallelujah you know i say that to say this i can feel your spirits but too many of you suppress it cause you worried about that rumor if i do that they don't think i'm out of character no they might think it's the nature of something david the one who lied and cheated and committed adultery and all these things when he saw the ark of the covenant coming back what's the nature of joy what's the nature of victory it is to dance ask yourself where was the last time your holy ghost your holy ghost your divine nature of god got so stirred up to you stood on your feet and shouted amen praise god for two nights but that should be every night every time you wake up you ought to be on fire for god you have to be thanking the lord holly because he didn't have to choose any of us but he did and against all our faults and failures god keep coming back giving us grace we get caught in live we get caught in loose we get caught in that god still come back with a hand of grace i heard this old this old saint praying one time and his prayer was so powerful man he was praying and he said lord when you come to me will you approach me one more time with mercy in one hand and grace in the other wow think about that church god has always given us mercy and grace and we can't get out of our own way no i ain't trying to make everybody be like me no what we want is the nature of god that's what we want we want the nature of god before i close what do we do you know the prophet i'ma give you some stuff at the prophet god the prophet of god said that this is the quietest place we'll ever be oh you gonna shout one day you better believe it you gonna shout one day and you're gonna look crazy you might wanna be all sophisticated and everything right now and you know i got an office job and you know and i nobody knows me and all that stuff that might be all right right now but one day you're gonna have to shout either gonna be because you made it a rapture or it's gonna be because hell's fire is burning you but one way or the other you go shout out and it ain't no matter what color the room is it ain't gonna be by black lives matter all lives matter only life they're gonna be madder in that moment is yours listen i'm i'm i'm trying to close because i think y'all got to adjust to my thought we're talking about the nature of god and we can look at let's look at david a little bit more you know saul was trying to kill him throwing javelins at him and all this stuff and david was just ducking david wasn't even seeking retaliation they were just ducking moving out the way how many of us we know somebody trying to kill us we'll keep going around that person david kept coming david kept coming around i'm not a man trying to kill him and david had so much of the nature of god god let an evil spirit come on saul and who drove the spirit off of him the nature of david was so compatible with god that when david played he drove off the spirit that god allowed to come that's when you got something inside but what i want to show you about the nature of god when you truly got the nature of god holy what does it produce it produces character power with characters fit to rule power with that character is satanic and you look church hallelujah sometimes what god will do is test your nature so you can see who you really are he'll let all the people that done you wrong all the stuff that got on your nerves put it right back in your hand and see what you're going to do with it now saul walks into the cave he's right in david's hands david could have followed him and david david david was a little angry you know david cut his skirt and then he repented that man just couldn't stop repenting every time you turn around david lord forgive me lord i'm sorry lord i'm just lord lord i ain't mean to do it oh lord i know he trying to kill me he didn't even say that david he said lord he trying to kill me david just said lord i'm sorry every opportunity he got and the man was trying to kill him he put him right back in his hands son tried to take the kingdom from him david said don't kill him please don't kill him you see the nature of god the nature of god doesn't seek out revenge the nature of god presses into a character that can't be explained hallelujah as i close listen church now when you're reborn you don't get a new spirit you get a new nature of that spirit it's the same spirit but a new nature of it hallelujah see and i use that to say hallelujah to combat the two soul doctrine yeah when they talk we got two souls and all these things you know adam had a soul here and then we got born again he got another soul uh uh um because the soul is the very essence and the presence of the man and when adam fell god never had to recreate another atom he didn't have to create another soul hallelujah all he had to do was take that soul of adam and put it back in the right atmosphere and it would reflect what it was when it was first created [Music] not another soul but a redeemed soul so we'll have two we have one glory to god because he never through the fall he never created another man can you imagine hallelujah it was already a wild radical cadre digs and when i got the holy ghost it's two of us now y'all couldn't handle it y'all couldn't handle it we have two of us one on this side of the pulpit and one on this side of the puppy y'all couldn't handle it y'all wouldn't know what to do with it y'all couldn't handle it it'll be so much annoying again y'all masters will be doing this y'all know i'm just enjoying jesus right in my closing come on musicians when you reflect the character of god as you're living as you're going through you will have trial and tribulation but what is it doing is god purifying that nature joseph fought against lying he fought against jealousy you know like i was saying you you look at the jealousy joseph had to fight with his brothers am i right church let's look at it you know joseph has a dream he has a dream and his brothers get mad because he told him y'all gonna bow down right he said he has another dream he's like mom and dad are gonna bow down with y'all boy they hot now everybody in the house hot everybody mad but you know what the turning point was this was the tipping point see that what the brothers had he had to go from from jealousy to hatred and you know where the hatred came from one day i'm gonna take you brothers back holly you young guys i'm learning about this i'm gonna take your brothers back you one day joseph received a coat of many colors from his daddy and i want y'all to imagine what it was like he got that coat of many colors and he put that coat on he probably spit around like he was rick flair [Music] dad and all these brothers and sisters look at that they make me sick i knew i'd get y'all loosened up on that one if you ain't laughing you're probably saying it's my nature it's my nature to be me it's my nature to be mad it's my nature to me mug you and everybody else is laughing but church it went from jealousy to hatred because he come out there with a big old rick flair robe on like he in space mountain and he said you know what we're gonna throw him in the pit they threw him in the pit what was god doing god was perfecting his nature right he had to come through jealousy hallelujah then he went down he had to overcome slavery didn't get into potiphar's house he had to overcome a lust demon then from there he went to jail he had to overcome a lie and bondage oh and then one of one of the most hurting things hallelujah dealing with his nature he had to overcome being felt and feeling forgotten cause all that he did he was still forgotten but god was working on his nature amen in church from there joseph he begins to interpret his dreams and then i believe it was the butler got restored and the pharaoh has a dream everybody we know the story pharaoh has a dream and the butler says i remember my mistake there's a man in your jail who can interpret dreams harley so they go get him joseph look at joseph got cleaned up he got washed up put a robe on him and they dressed him up why to come into the presence of a king and we know the story joseph was restored joseph was put in position but what i want y'all to see is the nature of joseph now think about this everybody that ever did joseph wrong was not in his hands everybody from his brothers to the caravan that picked him up particle and part of his wife the the the the the lead jailer in the jailhouse even the butler forgot about him everybody was in his hands now but all joseph can say is what y'all meant for evil god did it to preserve life see that's the nature of god and i close with the scripture paul said for glory i glory in the things i've suffered not in my triumphs you hear palsy boy i shook off a viper i'm annoying it i preach all night somebody fell out and died and i went down and laid my hands on them and they came back up i know you hear paul testifying like that it's not the nature of god to boast right but he says if i glory i glory in all the things i've suffered that's the place i want to be now you can't fake that and be careful about saying amen because your trials can start tonight that's why we hear people praying about oh lord lord please give me perfect love we'll be praying about perfect faith oh lord give me perfect give me perfect why won't pray oh lord give your perfect love cause you got to experience perfect hatred it's the only way you'll love them get perfect if you experience the opposite hardly the prophet called the law of contrast amen so church let's reflect the nature of god what actions you know tonight i don't have to call a prayer line i don't have to ask you what's on your wall or what kind of movies you watch or what's at your house you know what you're doing you know which nature is dominating you you know so i don't have to do all that you know it's up to you to get it right let's pray let's pray let's pray let's buy these i love you lord [Music] oh [Music] you [Music] lord jesus fathers we come before your throne lord lord we pray there was something said to help your people lord hello we know that we very animated tonight lord but lord we do these things at your leading father and lord our desires to be a blessing lord to your people lord that they may see how you deal with us lord and everything is is is not for our bad but it's for our good lord i pray to you just continue to help us to develop more and more of the character of jesus christ so we can get out of here and lord we know that it'll be nothing but you nothing but you on display that'll be in that rapture it won't be none of us but it'll be all you and your character lord lord we pray that you just move upon your people right now and only the way that you can in the name of jesus christ we pray church amen two words [Music] in what you hear could we raise our hands now let it be a sweet sweet sound in your ears i love you lord raise those hands now tell him and i live my voice to worship you o my soul yes lord take joy take joy my king in what you hear may it be a sweet sweet sound in your ears amen do you appreciate the word tonight you have the lord a handclap of praise amen i know i did i mean that was so good brother diggs appreciate that amen the nature and i i just began to think i was actually trying to find this quote and i think i found that i loved it so much you know when brother diggs was talking about that uh that lion that brother branham told her lies that god was just trying to get something out of him and he said you know bring that out of him and i thought of elijah i thought you know brother adam said the same thing he said elijah under the juniper tree and he said and there he was one day you know elijah just wanted to wanted to die much like jonah said lord i you took my father's you know what about me lord you know was so under assault from jezebel and brother branham says that there was elijah laying underneath the juniper tree and he said but god had to get his servant to that spot had to get him into such a low spot to where he just didn't value his life at all and he was so controlled so brother adam said what did he do he took him to the cave and he said and then there came a took him to the mountain in that cave and he said there came a fire and he says the bible says but god wasn't in the fire and he said then comes a wind and he said a great rushing mighty wind and he said but god wasn't in the wind then an earthquake came and you know what god was doing god was taking him through all those human emotions the fire you could feel it you could you could you could feel the heat the wind you could feel it the earthquake you could feel it and and the bible says but then came a still small voice and he said god was in that voice and brother branham said god was trying to get elijah past human emotions because he said human emotions is what got you underneath the juniper tree wanting to kill yourself elijah and little did brother elijah know it just be just a few chapters later he'd be raptured he'd be out of there he'd take it up in a cherry to fire amen and god said i got to get you past human emotion elijah amen to serve me i thought of this quote brother branham speaks about gold but it existed was what i thought about when you were preaching there and brother branham says i know you've heard this many times he said they beat the gold until the beater seeing his own reflection in the gold they beat all the iron pyrite the dross the dirt he said they'd beat it they'd pound it he said till they seen the reflection they just keep beating the dirt and he says till he till the till that goldsmith could see his own reflection he said it was like in a mirror beating it out now that's what the gospel does so many people don't like to be turned over and beat out well what the church needs tonight is a good old-fashioned holy ghost beating out amen beating out of the world and the things of the world that's what pentecost needs that's what our movement needs is a good old-fashioned gold turning beating until all the world is beat out of us and jesus christ is reflected you desire that tonight he says let me have just this handful of people here tonight fully considered the christ their lives dedicated to christ i could do more with that handful or god can do more rather with this handful of people here than you could do with the whole world council of churches toward the kingdom of god one man fully surrendered into his hands fully that's all god needs then he says but you see we're not willing to lay still and let him beat this side that side knock this out knock that out knock this idea out knock that idea and let jesus christ be reflected of us we see too many movies we got too many televisions we got too many other worldly amusements until the church has lost its taste to the people he says it's because the holy spirit moves out and something else moves in that's right friends i read that i said lord don't let me be named among that group let me say lord if you've got to beat it out of me amen how many could raise their hands and say lord no matter what you got to do turn me over lord amen let your image be reflected amen in me brother diggs my goodness you don't even have a clue and i've witnessed this in brother diggs ministry multiple times you know and i'm not even going to say what it is but uh you don't realize some of the things brother dick said tonight how discerning and supernatural they were i mean just like a laser beam that's all i'm gonna say i'm just gonna say you have no idea the word was on point was on spot tonight that's the holy spirit the bible says the word is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart now the word is spoken it's up to us to respond to say lord i want to respond to your word i don't let my nature be this lord let me respond and say yes lord change my heart oh god amen make it ever true we we got a lot of prayer requests we want to remember amen here tonight i'm just going to read them brother diggs if you'd come amen we're going to take these i want you to pray over these brother john phelan has an urgent unspoken need for his family remember john there in phoenix we want to remember him in that urgent need brother george buckman writes in a prayer request for our aunt emma cox has cancer in her lung and pneumonia that is set in she started chemo

done it in our family many times we've had testimony sister sarah many times here no matter what god the bible says that god loves the beast amen loves i know we do he's like a part of our family amen
