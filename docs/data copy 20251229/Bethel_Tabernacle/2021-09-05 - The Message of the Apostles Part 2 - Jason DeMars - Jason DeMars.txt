========================================

good morning everyone let's stand and pray gracious heavenly father we come before you now lord and we ask that your spirit would be present with us lord take your word make it alive in our hearts lord fill us with your spirit with your light with your love we want more of you lord we ask in jesus name amen all right you can go ahead and be seated this is part two of the message of the apostles last time i don't even really know exactly what happened but i uh opened my notes and then proceeded to ignore them for 30 minutes so it loosely had something to do with the message of the apostles but i guess the lord had a message he wanted to get across and and so we're going to do part two but really it's the beginning of the message of the apostles so let's pull that powerpoint up again we got it all right wonderful so what is the apostolic message so first of all the message of the apostles is the authoritative teaching of the church that means it's the foundation of the church but more than just the foundation it's the building it's the whole thing we don't have the right to make our own message our own theology built on some foundation of the apostles the original message of the apostles is the pure gospel it's the final word now that doesn't mean god doesn't god stops revealing himself throughout the ages that's not true he continues to reveal himself that's not but everything that he reveals himself is through that message of the apostles in every age we have to return back to the message of the apostles what do we got going on here no powerpoint for a minute okay so again every age we have to return to the apostolic message that is the call to the church and even even more in every age every every local church has to continually judge itself not based on what we think is the right thing to do but judge itself based on the apostles message and teaching salvation is found in one thing that's in the message that the apostles brought it's not merely in calvary you can't stop there you have to continue on calvary will do nothing for you unless you receive the holy ghost how in the world are you going to get the blood applied to you without the holy ghost the life is in the blood there's no chemical blood we don't need to go on a crusade and find the holy grail in hopes that we can get some of the dna of jesus somehow or some there's we don't need even if we found it it would be totally useless to us because the thing that's useful to us to bring forgiveness and salvation is the holy ghost you're not walking in the new testament message without being baptized in the holy ghost all right so second corinthians 5 17 looking at the essential reality of the new testament of the message of the apostles it's not an inherited faith religious confessions statements of faith the core reality is what an experience with god that transforms a person's heart and restores them to the image and likeness of god and that all comes through the historical work of god through who not a prophet not a priest not a king a prophet a priest and a king jesus christ the prophet the priest the king jesus christ through his death burial resurrection and ascension we see this shed forth upon us that's what the apostle peter said on the day of pentecost through his death burial resurrection and ascension he jesus has shed forth this upon us what did they shed what was shed forth the holy ghost so that what is the essential reality of the new testament well what is the new testament there's a promise of a new covenant in through jeremiah i will make a new covenant not after the old covenant not laws written on tables of stone but the word written on our heart so if there's a new covenant there's bloodshed and there's a word written in our heart that's what the baptism of the holy ghost is all about that's the core reality of the message of the apostles there is this transforming power in christ to restore us back to what we were created to be in the first place second corinthians 5 17 says therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creature a new creation old things are passed away behold all things are become new his sins are washed away they're cast in the sea of forgetfulness and he himself has a completely different nature that's the message of the apostles it brings healing and wholeness shalom peace to the entire human being all right so what is salvation salvation in the greek new testament is a word that essentially your desires are new your attitudes are transformed forever your pain your spiritual pain is healed your spiritual scars your spiritual wounds are healed this is the message of the apostles so how do we how do we receive it well it starts with faith matthew 16 16-18 says simon peter replied you are the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered him blessed are you simon barjona for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father who is in heaven and i tell you you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it peter is not the rock his name means little stone even jesus himself is not directly the rock the rock is that revelation that peter received of who jesus christ is that's this is the foundation it's not the whole building you can't stop there say i be all i can do is all i've done is believe that's all you do then when you have when you have received this revelation you will receive the holy ghost but this is the foundation we god bridges the gap for us and in us by giving us the revelation of who jesus is it's not a matter of we figured it out we heard a message we decided to make a decision for jesus we prayed the sinner's prayer all these things are additives to the word they're not they're not scriptural you can't find praying the sinner's prayer in the new testament you can't find going through new believers classes in the new testament catechism all those things they're added to the word what does the word say i'm getting way ahead of myself but this is the conclusion of this message is what does the word say it says rep believe believe on the lord jesus christ you'll be saved it doesn't stop there they ask what men and brethren what should we do pray the sinner's prayer go to catechism classes no he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost so what is it faith repentance that water baptism and then holy ghost baptism this is ultimately the message that the apostles brought to us so that we can have what jesus did for us applied to us romans 10 9 says because if you confess with your mouth that jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved again this is speaking about a true confession a true repentance it's not just limiting this well if i just confess jesus jesus is lord i'm going to heaven i live anyway no it's this there's there's a whole rest of the new testament there's not just romans 10 verse 9 there's other things in the new testament which we just mentioned in the book of acts faith repentance water baptism holy ghost baptism those those steps and then how do i know that i've went through those steps the very same life that was in jesus lives itself through you not because you're pushing it forcing it because he's doing it so that niche the teachings of the new testament form around these this foundational experience that we have with god so there's things like who god is who jesus is who we are in god the work of the you can grow can grow more into the image of jesus christ romans 8 14 says for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god to be a son of god means to have a relationship a connection with god it's not a mere title without meaning sonship means there's a close connection even even more than that there's kinship there's a similar nature between the two they share genetics they share a home they share they there's an upbringing there there's a background there it's not a mere title you're i'm a son of god what does it mean means you are led by him it means you hear from him means you follow him what did jesus say follow me as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god some of these simple things that we hear we want to be a disciple of jesus that's following him not following men not even following men that are called by him but it's following him but the church changed that message over time the church fell away and that's why i say it's a danger to us you say oh we're protected we're in the message if you've looked around a little bit you realize that we're not safe or protected because we're in the message we have to examine ourself pastors need to examine themselves deacons need to examine themselves each of us as believers have to examine what are we accepting what are we receiving are we is our lives is the church i'm going to is the people i'm around are we conforming to what the apostles taught councils were formed in order to decide which doctrines were correct instead of relying on god they formed a political association between those who some who agreed and others who disagreed so after the apostles died you know you understand that we have a certain worldview we look as americans we look at things in a certain way and when other people you know even even to different regions when other people talk in a certain way we understand it differently just a little example is in the north when you say bless your heart it means you're a blessing thank you so much but try to say that to someone down here bless your heart and be like why are you insulting me i did something nice for you and you're calling you're calling me an idiot but that's different what the different parts of the world different places look at things differently and think differently and so when you go from the apostles who are all jewish they have a whole background and of course many things that they held to and held on to even even long past god since since god moved past that they were still struggling with peter struggled uh because not because of himself but because of those looking at him from the outside with eating with gentiles just being around gentiles even after god showed him a vision says don't call what's what i've made clean unclean sends them to them preaches the word he goes on a missions trip with paul sits down and eats bacon and pork chops and then james sends some people to look in on the church there in in galatia and peter says oops i'm going to get in trouble better back away this this is a whole mindset that's taken on for thousands of years right so some things are good about it some things are bad about it but the basic foundation of the jewish understanding is we are in a relationship to obey god and god is who he says he is who he declares himself to be in the in the greek in in roman world philosophy is king and reason is king it's part of why john as as an apostle wrote what he did in john chapter 1 in order to bridge the gap to say you know that that logos that you think created everything and his reason and logic actually god that's god and that god came down and was made flesh and of course they took that and brought a misunderstanding of what that meant as time went on so you look sh there's a shift from a biblical way of thinking to a greek philosophical way of thinking so around the year 150 justin martyr a writer they call him an apologist defender of the faith writes in his letter that john in that the word of john 1 1 is a second god right then around the year 2 200 never used before but the writer tertullian uses the word trinitas in latin first time it's ever used in connection with the god of israel so even at this time though there's no doctrine of three co-equal co-eternal persons it wasn't until 30 years later origen who was who was a theologian and actually his but his main job was he was the president of a philosophical university so get understand the backgrounds of some of these men so here is a theologian slash philosophy professor so i have a major in philosophy so i can understand how absurd this is he's going to he's going to bring his philosophy that he's developed which is that the son is actually eternally begotten the eternal generation that's the doctrine the eternal generation of the sun the sun is in the trinitarian thinking the sun is generated from the father but it's any it's eternal it can't have any beginning or end so the sun is just eternally going forth from god so origen in the year 230 is the first person who puts this idea forward that there is an eternal sonship there is an eternal son before this every apologist every theologian believed in the two stages of the logos so first you have the logos is in god as his thought or plan then it comes forth just prior to creation it comes forth as a thought as a spoken word and becomes his god's body or theophany his visible representation towards his creation so the two stages of the logos first it's in god as a thought then it's out of god just how brother branham explains it that's the logos which went out of god in the beginning so that that was the common understanding origin developed the philosopher developed a thought that changed that from being a time where the sun began just prior to creation to having an eternal son so then you fast forward 100 years just about a hundred years later and there is a division in the church the next 50 to 100 years there's division and there's two different viewpoints going on i'm sorry i'm giving you a history lesson but hopefully hopefully it's a blessing there's two different ideas and that one is called the aryan viewpoint of the godhead and one is futuristically called the trinitarian viewpoint you could say it it's an argument over one letter one letter it's the word the letter i the the trinitarian viewpoint said the son is of the same substance as the father homo usias the aryan viewpoint was the son is of a different substance he's cr he's a created being again both of this is a false dichotomy both of them have a wrong understanding but these are the two major understandings that led to the council of nicaea so these two sides are warring against each other so at the council of nicaea you know that santa claus punched somebody in the face at the council [Music] so arius who is the main defender of this they're not this that the sun had a beginning let's put it that way because the the person that wins the victory writes the history right so the trinitarians won the victory they write the history so i don't believe that arius actually held to the viewpoint that the trinitarians said he held to i i strongly believe he held to the earlier viewpoint which tertullian irenaeus all these men that there was two stages of the logos first it's in god as a thought then it comes out of god as a word expressed two stages it's not eternal there's a birth process there it's eternal in god but then it comes forth an expression at a time just before creation so i think that's the viewpoint that arius held to so saint nicholas saint nicholas was a mem was a part of the trinitarian faction at the nicene council so arius got up gave his viewpoint and santa claus came up and punched him in the face for real that's not that's not a joke that's not fake fake news it's a true story and he was he was actually rebuked by constantine for his bad behavior so again this is a political thing the council of nicaea it wasn't a holy ghost anointed event it was the the emperor says i have a division there's christianity is going like wildfire through my empire their empire is getting weakened lots of political intrigue going on emperor's getting assassinated constantine moving his capital now having a two different capitals one in one in what we call turkey and one what in rome italy and all this is taking place so near his uh his winter capital uh in constantinople he has a a council in the city of nicaea it's just if you take it by a car i've driven by it it's it's a now defunct city in icia but it's about an hour car ride from istanbul which was constantinople so this they hold this council because the emperor says not only are we having political divisions military divisions now we have religious divisions and this is going to pull my empire apart so in order to solve this problem what does he do he calls a church council and gets two factions together to speak about what what what is the right doctrine it's a political affair it's not there's there's no one that can say oh my goodness this is how the holy spirit led the church it's all about politics political connections and i've run out of time so let's stand we'll continue this at the end of the month i'll be go i'll be leaving this evening for egypt on a missions trip so please remember me in prayer let's pray father we come to you lord we ask that your holy spirit would be upon us today lord anointing the uh anointing us all as we worship lord be with uh worship team be with brother jason as he brings the word lord be sovereign over our hearts and minds and thoughts we ask these things in jesus name amen god bless you for those who are visiting service we'll start up again in about five minutes
