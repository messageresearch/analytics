guest speaker tonight actually i was scheduled a schedule myself to preach tonight and just felt like i would like to earlier in the week but i don't know i was just kind of mostly going on faith and uh there's something turning inside me and i couldn't put my finger on it until today and uh went and met with the brother had a lengthy conversation not the first one we've had mind you concerning it so what you're about to see hasn't just happened this has been building for probably um really a couple years and uh tonight uh it's finally arrived so i'm looking forward to it and uh you're gonna get a wonderful journey tonight in the scripture i got a little bit of insight my goodness as soon as he started talking about it i got anointed felt like i said if you don't preach that tonight i'm gonna go preach it amen wonderful story of the book of first kings and an analogy that i've personally myself never caught in the scripture and and it means a lot to this young man and so we're going to invite him a man to make his way at this hour want to have you stand back up to your feet again and for those on the streaming audience and who are here in the service with us tonight we want you to just amen open your hearts and open your minds and be ready to receive from the lord today i asked him i said brother caleb do you have a certain song you'd like to come to the sacred desk i stood at this desk today knowing that the brother would be standing here tonight and i knew that we would need jesus to stand here and i stood right here like i am now and for a little while bowed my head later you know earlier today in the afternoon spent several hours here saying lord i want your anointing to flow from this place brother branham said the anointing flows off the platform and down across the people amen that's why people sit near the front get a better service [Music] but he said brother jason all day long i've been singing the song hallelujah i said what an epic song to come for your first pulpit sermon i remember vividly when i preached my first one amen so let's sing it up your hands now [Music] oh blessed be the name of the lord [Music] lift it up to him saints [Music] yes [Music] thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus you jesus [Music] thank you jesus [Music] [Music] man friends it's it's an honor to be up here standing in front of you guys tonight uh as pastor was saying you know i felt the call on the lord in the past few months it just has been every single day it's all that i can think about and so last week i asked for a meeting with our pastor and i just said you know i just would like to talk to you and get your spiritual guidance on it and we were in the meeting and i had absolutely no idea that he would ask me to preach tonight and um he was like you know i was just feeling the spirit of the lord and he said he just the events were lining up and and he said he said what do you want to do i said i want to go home and i want to study so i went home and first thing i did is i got in my car and i just wept like a little baby and the lord just moved upon me so i just want to share this thought that i have with you guys tonight and if you just want to open up your bibles to first kings chapter 20. the thought tonight we're gonna take is uh about king ahab um in the syrian army say amen when you're there man awesome verse 1 and it says we're going to read down to verse 12 and it says and benedad the king of syria gathered all his hosts together and there were 30 and two kings with him and horses and chariots and he went up and besieged samaria and ward against it and he sent messengers to ahab king of israel into the city and he said unto him thus saith benidad thy silver and thy gold is mine thy wives also and thy children even the goodliest are mine and the king of israel answered and said my king or my lord o king according to thy saying i am thine and all that i have and the messengers came again and said thus speaketh been a dad saying although i have sent unto thee saying thou shalt deliver me thy silver and thy gold and thy wives and thy children yet i will send my servants unto thee tomorrow about this time and they shall search thine house and the house of thy servants and it shall be that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes they shall put it at their hand and take it away then the king of israel called all the elders of the land and said mark i pray you and see how this man seeketh mischief for he sent unto me my wives and for my children and for my silver and my gold and i denied him not and all the elders and all the people said unto him hearken not unto him nor consent wherefore he sent unto the messengers of benedad tell my lord the king all that thou did send for me to thy servant at the first and i will do but this but this thing i may not do and the messengers departed and brought him word again and bennet had said unto him the gods do so unto me and more also if the dust of samaria shall suffice for handfuls of all the people that follow me and the king of israel answered and said tell him let him not that girdeth on his harness boasts himself as that putteth it off and it came to pass when benedict heard this message as he was drinking he and the kings and the pavilion said unto his servant set yourselves in a ray and they set themselves in a ray against the city amen let's let's bow our heads dear precious heavenly father lord god we're gathered here tonight father god lord just to receive a message from you jesus you see the thought that you've just put upon my heart father god lord you see the desire that you put upon my heart father lord it's just it's a privilege to be up here to be able to lord pour my heart out to these people tonight lord i pray that you can bless the reading of your word i pray that you can just anoint this reading lord and i just pray that you can help me get out of the way father god lord i leave me and all my spirit at home lord and i just pray that the spirit of jesus christ can come and have preeminence in the service tonight father god lord i love you and i appreciate you and i ask all these things in the mighty precious name of jesus christ amen you can have your seats so tonight we're talking about king ahab in the syrian army so at that at this time um the the king of israel was king ahab and the king of syria was king binadad um now king ahab so i want to just lay some background now to what happened in previous chapters in in previous chapters in chapter 18 um elijah goes to ahab and i'm just going to start in verse 1. it says it came to pass after many days the word of the lord came unto elijah the third year saying go and show thyself unto hahab and i will send rain upon the earth and elijah showed himself unto ahab and there was famine in samaria and ahab called obadiah which was the governor of his house now obadiah feared the lord greatly so ahab was in his house um and you'll see here in the next few verses we're going to talk about uh in verse three and verse four well let's go ahead and read it and ahab called obadiah which was the governor of his house and obadiah feared the lord greatly and for it was so when jezebel cut off the prophets of the lord that obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by 50 in a cave and fed them with bread and water so what happened was is jezebel cut off the the prophets they they were sinning against the lord and um and ahab took the prophets of jesus christ and he they they sent him out and oh but since obadiah even though he was the governor of ahab's house he he feared the lord greatly thank you he feared the lord greatly and so he he hid them in their house and it goes on to say that it goes on to say that as obadiah was in the way in verse 7 elijah met him and he knew and he fell on his face and said art thou my lord elijah so uh since since the prophets were sent out from the the kingdom of ahab obadiah saw elijah and saw what was going on and he was he was so afraid and he said why are you here what's going on and and at this time jezebel actually had the servants or the the prophets of baal in her house around her table so she was sinning greatly against the lord and so elijah uses a crafty technique here and he says in verse in verse 8 and he said i i am tell thy lord behold elijah is here and he said what have i sinned that thou would just deliver thy servant into the hand of ahab to slay me so what's going on here is ahab or is elijah wants obadiah to go into ahab and say hey you're not doing good with the lord basically he wants to set up a meeting with him okay he wants to he wants to set up a meeting but he knows that if he goes into that house that he's not going to be able to have that meeting because jezebel kicked them out and they were and they were hated in that house so he was crafty in his ways and like the lord is always crafty in his ways and he sent obadiah which in in earlier verses says i fee that he feared the lord greatly and obadiah was he was still afraid he said he said as the lord lie liveth um he said in verse sign i am to go in verse eight behold elijah is here and he said what have i sinned that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into ahab to slay me so he was afraid and verse 11 and now says go and tell the lord behold elijah is here and it came to pass as soon as i am gone from thee that the spirit of the lord carry thee whether i know and so when i come to tell ahab that he cannot find thee he shall slay me and that thy servant but i thy servant fear the lord from thy youth and was it not told the lord that when jezebel slew the prophet to the lord how i hid a hundred men of the lord's prophets by 50 in a cave and fed them with bread and with water and so he's explaining you know like i i know that i know that the jezebel sinned and i know that jezebel hates the prophets uh so why would you why would you go into to have me killed and elijah said basically saying you're not going to be killed you're you're the governor of his house so and and he promises him here he said elijah's here and he shall slay me and elijah said as the lord of the host liveth whom before whom i stand i will surely show myself unto him today so obadiah went to meet ahab and told him and ahab went to meet elijah so he successfully set up the meeting with between between elijah and ahab which which which was a difficult task okay so we move on and in the next verses uh elijah in verse 17 and it came to pass when ahab saw elijah abs said unto him art thou that he that troubles israel and he answered i have not troubled israel but thou and thy father's house in the ea have forsaken the commandments of the lord and and thou has followed balaam so he's saying that was forsaken the lord that was forsaken what the lord has said to do and and your wife jezebel kicked out all of all of the servants of the lord and and you're and you're you're sitting against the lord and he and now followed balaam a false prophet now therefore sinned in verse 19 sinned and gathered to me all israel unto mount carmel and all the prophets of baal 450 and the prophets of the grove 400. so th this next this next little excerpt we're really familiar with it's it's uh it's a sunday school sunday school story that we're all really familiar with when ahab said on the children of israel and gathered up all the prophets into mount carmel and elijah challenged the prophets of baal and he came unto all the people verse 21 how long hath thou shalt be in two opinions if if if the lord be god follow him but of baal then follow him amen and the people answered him not a word and then elijah said unto the people i even i remain a prophet of the lord but baal's prophets are 450 men against one man and it was and it was elijah and let them therefore give us two bullets and let them choose one bullock for themselves and cut into pieces and lay it on the wood and put no fire under so so he has them and he hasn't we're gonna we're gonna paraphrase here he has him go down in and he has them do whatever they need to do to call on their name on their lord on their god on their prophet bail to to come and bring fire upon upon and they started danting and they started doing all kinds of things and they started sacrificing and cutting themselves and and the prophets of baal they couldn't do it they they could not call on the name of baal to send fire upon us so afterwards he said elijah said he has such faith in his god he said well take the wood that was supposed to be burned and soak it three times i mean we're all familiar with the story amen right so he said soak it three times so that so that there's no misunderstanding that the lord my god that will come and will consume this is it is fire they will the lord will consume and it is there is no shadow of a doubt in anybody's mind that it was the lord so they did this thing and it came to pass let's uh let's go on down um they they cried so in verse 28 and 29 they were crying unto their lord till the blood gushed out upon them and it came to pass when the midday was passed all day and all night there was no voice nothing to answer none that regarded amen and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar that was broken so they had broken the altar and elijah took the 12 stones and he built it and upon two measures of seed and we're just going to keep moving on hear me oh lord so in verse 36 and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said to the lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art the god in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all of these things at thy word amen that's such an awesome hear me o lord that this people may know that thou art the lord god that thou has turned their heart back again then the fire fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice imagine what it felt like to be elijah and to to see he knew he knows we know he that the lord is the most high god but to have him to have him come down and consume a sacrifice it's it takes faith they they he saw that baal wouldn't do it and it bales a false god and that they saw that and but it takes such faith for elijah to do it he does it and the lord consumes it with fire when all the people saw amen in verse 38 and the fire fell the the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their face and said that the lord he is god amen the lord he is god and elijah said unto them take unto the prophets of baal and not one of them escaped so he ended up killing all of the prophets of baal and he went on he goes on to mount carmel and let's um let's go on into into chapter 19. we're just trying to lay a foundation here friends so just just stick with me in chapter 19 um jehovah's tender hand um ahab so in the very first verse ahab goes and tells jezebel what had happened he goes and says to what elijah had done and with all and how he had slain all the prophets of the sword well can you imagine how enraged that that made jezebel because jezebel was the one who kicked out the prophets of the lord and he's the one who or and she's the one who wanted the prophets of baal to be around their house and around their kingdom in their kingdom and then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah saying and i just can imagine the rage that she's saying this with senate messenger so let the gods do to me and moreover if i make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow at this time so she said if you stay in this kingdom if you be anywhere where i know you can be then i'm going to take and i'm going to do what you did to those prophets and i'm going to do it to you i'm going to kill you and this is when elijah this is when elijah has uh you know he goes into the wilderness and he's scared for his life because you know he did this for the lord and then let's just put ourselves in elijah's shoes for just a second and and just see the lord called him to do this thing and he did this thing and the lord he came down and he consumed it with fire and just imagine just the glory that he was feeling that night oh man it was such an exciting thing for it to be right and then he comes in the very next day or week or however long it was and jezebel said how he had sent this message unto him saying well it's what exactly what you did to those prophets well i'm going to do exactly that thing to you so i'm going to kill you so he was scared he was afraid and we all get in that place i mean everybody gets afraid amen and so we so we're going to move on down so he goes in the wilderness and elijah at horror but he rose and he did eat and he'd drink so he he was this is this is a a whole nother topic in and of itself but they'll but the angel of the lord when he was in his weakness he said that that you need to that you need to rise up and you need to go back and you need to do this thing and i eat and because the journey is great for him for you and in verse eight he goes and he eats and he drinks and he goes and spends 40 days and nights into whoreb the mount of god and he comes hither into a cave and he lodged there and he says what dust out here and we're going to move on down and and i'm not skipping these verses because they're not important because this these are awesome verses in verse 11 it's because god wasn't in god wasn't in an earthquake god wasn't in he wasn't in um he wasn't in a fire he wasn't in the wind um but he was in the still small voice amen that's such an awesome scripture that is but we're but we're moving on and when it was when elijah heard he wrapped his face on his mantle and he stood out and entered the cave um in verse 14 and said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts because of the children has forsaken thy covenant and thrown down thy altars and slain thy prophets with the sword so so elijah was was enraged for the lord because of all these things that that what that had happened in the kingdom so he was he was afraid he was he was jealous for the lord as it says he was enraged for the lord he was he was upset that the the the kingdom of israel the lord's people had done this thing so he goes on and the lord said unto him go and return under the wilderness of damascus and in verse 15 16 17 and 18 um um he calls he calls on uh calls on a lie elisha which is going to be his successor right so in chapter 20 which which was the text that we started with we now have so now we kind of see a little backstory to what was going on so we so now we're at verse 20 and benedict the king of syria gathered all of his hosts together so we have the syrian army so let's paint a picture of this friends the the syrian army was huge in number it doesn't have a number exactly but it was huge in number later on in the scriptures it says it it it was as if it was as if the israelite army in comparison to the syrian army was like two children it was just it was so small and so so the syrian army so so ahab king ahab was he was afraid for this so what happened was is he there was basically like a treaty between the king of syria and the king of ahab and he said and but the treaty was it was an unfair treaty and it was disrespectful to the lord god and it and the treaty was basically saying that thy silver and thy gold is mine thy wives and also thy children are mine and even the goodliest are mine so that was the treaty so the the treaty is i'm gonna take anything that you anything that you have that is good and you know that's it because i'm greater than you so that's disrespectful to the lord he wasn't going to have that so we move on let's move on down into the verses and all the so and he moves down and finally in verse 5 and the messengers came again and said and speak thus speaketh benedict saying although i have sent unto thee saying that thou shalt deliver me the silver and thy gold and thy wives and thy children yet i will send my servants unto thee tomorrow about this time and they shall search thine house and the houses of thy servants and it shall be that whatsoever is pleasant in mine eyes they shall put in their hand and take away so here let me go ahead and change the treaty a little bit more and now not only am i going to take your wives and your children and your silver and your gold and whatever i want i'm going to go into any of your houses and i'm going to take whatever i want whatever i see fit so that's now that treaty has completely changed and finally ahab which ahab is already a sinful king he already has allowed a um he already has allowed jezebel to to uh let the prophets of baal into the house and kick the prophets of jehovah out okay so there's already that mark on him and now he's he's kind of being a pushover king israel doesn't need a pushover king that's that's they need a king that'll stand up for for what what's right and finally he says he finally had enough finally he was says then the king of israel called all the elders of the land and said mark i pray you and see how this man seeketh mischief for he sent unto me for he sent unto me for my wives and my children and for my silver and for my gold and i denied him not he denied him not not one time he denied him he said okay yeah i'll take this treaty because he knew the syrian army was great so he was slightly afraid okay sometimes we get afraid friends like i'm sometimes we you know there's something at trial in our life or something happening and we get afraid because you know the enemy seems so big well the lord is greater he is he is greater he we don't we don't need big armies and and flashy armies but all the elders and all the people said unto him hearken not unto him nor consent so i want to just paint this picture for a second okay so i was thinking about this and i don't know how you guys are when you read the scriptures but i like to just kind of just take my time and just look at it and elders and all the people so all imagine these are these are the elders where you know those wives and those children they're probably their wives and their children can you imagine people coming into your home and taking your wives and your children everything that you've worked for and and and then the israel and the king of israel just says yeah they can take it and then they finally go to him and they say well they finally come to him and say listen this has got to stop they have i have recognizes it and the and the elders were i i would imagine it would be enraged i would be enraged amen would you be amen i would be and all the elders said i am hearken not unto him nor consent amen so he said wherefore he sent unto the messengers of benadab and tell the lord my king all that thou didst to thy servant at the first will i do but this thing may not do and the messengers departed and brought him word again amen and the we're going to skip this verse and um and verse 11 and the king of israel answered and tell him let him not gird thy harness and boast itself and it came to pass when benad heard this message that he was drinking and he and the kings and the pavilions and he said unto his servants set yourselves in a ray and they set themselves in a ray against the city friends i looked up just the definition of array and it's in a large group or quantity so basically what happened was is the king of syria saw that okay so there's there's the king of ahab is finally kind of seeing where this is going so go ahead and you know kind of bulk up those muscles a little bit and and set them in a large group just to scare them a little bit does it does it happen is that ever happening anybody does the devil have symptoms in your life or have send something your way and and he scares you a little bit because it seems so great at that time well we have a lord that is it is greater than that which is it's awesome so this next verse i i really want you i really want you to to to think about this next verse and ponder it upon your hearts because this it's been on my heart it i you know after i was had the um the meeting with brother jason today and you know by the way you know i'm just i'm so excited to be up here i am this is uh i feel the lord called upon my heart just so many years ago and i just felt um the last you know year or two that this is what the lord wanted me to do so you know friends just be praying for me and i just want to be led of the lord in all things and i want to make sure that everything that i do is in the perfect will of the lord um amen so the next verse and it says and behold there came a prophet so i was this is what i was talking about i had left brother jason and i was like preaching myself in the car today and for just like an hour and a half just just behold there came a prophet of unto ahab king of israel saying thus saith the lord hast thou seen all this great multitude so they saw this great multitude so they set themselves back right and they saw what it what the assyrian army it was it is so great and we're going to read in in this next in a few scriptures about how how great the syrian army was and how big it was right and and he says you see with all this great multitude behold listen to this friends behold i will deliver into thine hand this day and they and i and thou shalt know that i am the lord amen thou shalt know that i am the lord amen that that scripture when i read that scripture i like about jumped out of my seat and i was like oh man that's oh i'm the lord praise the name of the lord he he will he will his name will be heard above all names amen and when i read that scripture i had i was i've been i've been uh studying a little bit into 1951 messages uh brother bannon was preaching and um i actually want to get this out a little bit uh just i'm going to share a little personal testimony with you guys uh the past and my wife going to test in my family the the past couple years uh over two years now i've been struggling with um with a stomach ailment um and it's just been some days it's just debilitating it's just i i went to i went to see a doctor about it and and i went through the steps and the motions and and the doctor told me you know what it could be and they did a biopsy and and they you know they he put me on medication and and i went through all the steps and i just i accepted that and for the past two years i've just been kind of living in in this in this this state of pain all the time and um it's something that the lord has really i just i wasn't i wasn't sure i came up for prayer and i you know i was really just believing in the lord but at the same time that i was doing all that at that same time that i was praying and believing i was i was accepting it i was you know oh i ha you know i have this ailment and i'm probably gonna have it the rest of my life and i did a bunch of research on it and you know yeah it's you know it's nothing too crazy but you know you're probably going to be in pain for a long time and and you have to change your diet and you have to change this and and i just i just wasn't having it anymore i was tired of having it i was done having it and when i after i read that scripture uh a testimony came came to me and brother brother branham it was in his sermon um what was the name of the sermon the second miracle speech 1951 in july 29th if you guys want to go and listen to it and he said remember when everything i put in my stomach regurgitate i weighed less than 100 pounds every time i swallowed anything go and go out i went down i grabbed my wife i hugged her and i kissed her and i said honey the lord healed me she said i said the lord healed me said are you sure i said i know it well how do you know it said well the word said so see she said he's the high priest of my confession and i've confessed him as my healer amen i've confessed him as my healer said can you eat i said sure every time i've seen i take a drink of water it spurt through my nose she settled back there looking at me and know what what the truth she said what do you want i said send over the store so so it's gotten to a point in my life where you know i've i've tried to change my diet and to i i've just you know i just wanted you know i'm just going to eat oatmeal that's that doesn't seem to hurt my stomach let me just eat oatmeal and when just a little precursor the the devil tried to lie to me when he when he cooked that bioxy the biopsy the devil told me he said and the doctor said you know this this is technically a pre-cancerous condition and that word when it when it comes up it's so precancerous oh that kind of stirs a little something inside you're like oh i don't want to kind of say i don't i don't like that you know but that's what what's that what is that that's the devil's tactic he said he sends a greater ray in verse in verses 12. he sends a great array that's a great array amen he said he sent it that he sent that unto me and i was like you know what oh man i'm just going to pray and believe that the lord jesus christ is going to heal me and you know but i'm still going to i'm still going to just keep on eating just the oatmeal and i'm still going to not be able to lie flat at night and i'm still going to have pain every day every morning every night i'm still going to not be able to go and enjoy things with my family because because of this ailment no in the name of jesus christ i am healed it says where do you want i said send over the store and get a can of pork and beans open it up get a loaf of bread and cut off the big texas white skinned onion i want some she cooked a big piece of ham and i took this pork and beans and sit down and ask the blessing said thank you lord put it in a big bite full and the doctor said one mouthful of food solid food would send you to the grave he said now this is brother branham's testimony who's talking about remember don't you let no solid food hit your stomach that's what he said and the lord said i am the lord that healeth thee amen and when i'm going to believe i chewed up that big onion and oh and just how good it tasted i swallowed it down just as good as it hit there like a like a coal of fire went right down and it can come right back up i held my hand over my mouth swallowed it again come back down i swallowed again no sir had a bouncing party for there for a while i swallowed it back it came down i swallowed it again came back swallowed it again got me another one held my mouth poked that one in swallowed again called the doctor said it'll sure it'll kill him sure is the world i said hallelujah i'll die happy i went on down through there amen i'll die happy right i i was just i was rejoicing i started listening to this and i started getting a little step in me and i was like oh praise the name of the lord i was like you know what oh i'm not going to accept this anymore i'm going to just believe i'm oh praise the name of the lord let's keep on reading and he says what anything for eats what do you want what do you want to eat for supper honey i said open another can of beans and slice some more onion i said yes sir i know god's word is the truth that's all and i poured out some more on top of that and it laid right there till breakfast had me two fried eggs some more ham the morning of breakfast and i kept on like that week and come out i was so nervous looked like trees running together and how are you feeling and and friends this is positive everybody's nervous in today's age right amen everybody has a sense of nervousness i'm nervous all the time the the lord it's because of the laodicean age that we're living in everything everything that we do you know all the brother jason's been talking about it you know the where you know we're constantly in social media and believe me i'm i'm more guilty than you i'm sure i'm in constantly in social media constantly doing these things and and taking my time away from the lord and it and it causes an anxiousness it causes an anxiety because we need to we need to get things done that's the society we live in we need to get things done now uh you know if we can't if we can't order food and it's in our house in 10 minutes then we're just we're not happy or if you know if we can't if we can't order amazon and have it to our house you know the very next day we're like man that's not going to be okay so that's just the that's just the day that we live in all right amen so i know god's worth is word is the truth and how you feeling brother random i said wonderful so i saw i was thinking about this and i was just thinking you know lord well how have i been how have i been approaching this i've been taking about the wrong way you know i've just you know i've accepted it i've accepted the pain and accepted the ailment and accepted that this is just kind of going to be my lifestyle from now on well well no it doesn't have to be like that friends whatever it is that whatever it is that you're suffering with i have you know the the men's um uh text the other day you know some of the brothers were talking about you know how how you know sometimes you just feel or that the lord is just or sometimes we just feel on this day that we're just you know we just have a you know a great cloud over us and and i feel that way ever all the time you just sometimes feel like just so oh man i just i can't go we're just i don't have the spirit of the lord with me and you know and and we can't even brother jason was saying we can't even you know spend an hour in prayer and i'm guilty of it friends i i am i'm the most guilty i lift my hands up right now i'm the most guilty but we can't even spend our spend our time in the word and you know over the past few weeks as i've been as i've been feeling this call in my life and as i've been studying and as i've been allowing the lord to lead me i just sometimes i just i just get on my knees and i just will i'll just praise the lord i'll just lift up my hands and and there's that song i think i don't know we've never seen it in our church but it's just don't you think you ought to worship me don't you think it's time to give me praise amen is it sometimes it doesn't even take that it doesn't take us you know doing these great things and you know and and going out it just takes us allowing us to break through that that just that layout is seeing dark just oh just we just got to break through we just got to praise the name of the lord right i mean i was i was rejoicing today i was in my i was all day long i was preaching to myself i was like you're nervous when you get up here amen and and i was just preaching to myself and i was like i was so excited and i was like lord whatever you have in store for me tonight whatever you have in store for these people lord i just pray that it's your will and amen let's move on and the lord healed me he said um are you sure he said sure i'm fine um how does it happen the lord healed me and he said brother branham you lied no no i never lied when i accepted him as my healer he healed me 1900 years ago it was settled in my soul no matter what this was here it was my soul it was settled i was testifying not on how the body felt or what the old soul thought about it my spirit said christ is your healer amen my spirit said that christ is the healer and i said i believe you lord i stayed right with it one day i kept poking it down and poking it down and all that i had left i ate anything i want to i went on and gained 35 40 pounds amen i texted my wife and my mom that as soon as i read that i was like i'm healed go get me my onion i want to i want to keep it down amen i want to keep it down and right now right friends i'm testifying to you i don't feel an ounce of pain right at all amen praise the name of the lord and even if those symptoms try to come back i'm going to look back and i'm just going to say well no i don't have to accept it anymore for amen we don't have to accept it you know everything you know medicines are good you know doctors are good they do so much great but sometimes the lord will say that i will deliver thee into thine hand amen he said that thou shalt know that i am the lord what did i have to do i had to know that he was the lord for two years i've been struggling with this but what did i have to do i didn't have to oh i didn't have to say oh you know it's gonna be okay oh you know i'm just gonna have to live with this for the rest of my life no i don't have to say that behold it says behold amen i will deliver into thine hand this day and thou shalt know that i am the lord it was like when those scriptures and that message came to me was the same day it was the same night and i got up and i was like oh man i oh i got to preach now that lord eve i always talked to brother jason i was like man i really don't think i'm supposed to be a preacher i really don't i don't you know the lord is i i feel like i call in my life you know but i'm so unworthy and i there's no way you know that i can do this and and and he was like well do you want to preach tonight oh man i don't know brother jason i just was like oh lord i don't know but he put this thought upon my heart amen friends and let's keep going and ahab said in uh in verse 14 he said by whom and he said thus saith the lord even by the young men so who did he do it by so this is a mind battle that i was having in my own heart so what are you going to do for the kingdom of god what are you going to do you're you're you're a young man you know i'm a young man i'm a youth amen and what what am i going to do what am i going to get up there and preach that's going to or that's going to i'm going to talk to you guys about that's going to bless you guys what like what what do i have to say all of you know the scriptures more than i am me that i'm sure i'm sure of it and he said but who ahab said by whom and he said oh and one more thing amen was they have worthy to be be able to do this ahab said by whom and he said thus saith the lord he said was ahab worthy to be delivered out of the hands of the syrians was he absolutely not he was not worthy are we worthy no amen but guess what god's still going to do it because guess what who who who was he delivering he was delivering israel who is israel god's people amen who are we god's people right amen and he said ahead by whom and he said by thus saith the lord even by the young men of the princes of the provinces and he said who shall order the battle and he said thou can you imagine just thou thou shall order the battle you know you kicked me out you kicked me out of your kingdom you you've done terrible things you don't believe me you've you've allowed jezebel to kill my to kill my prophets but thou shalt order the battle because i love my people enough to deliver them amen amen he loves us enough to deliver us amen so let's talk about some victories because i love talking about victories amen so this victory this first victory we have so actually let's take a step back so when i was when i was studying on on verse 14 the lord really he put it upon my heart to to um to to kind of do a little google search on it and and do some research on it and he brought me to this verse actually it was by accident because because of something that i'll go on in in into detail about later but he brought me to by accident and in jeremiah 1 you can turn that turn there if you want um jeremiah 1 we're going to read jeremiah verse 1. i'm actually i'm actually going to read it out of the rsv which is some other translation just that i thought and then i'll read it out of the king james version um and it says the words so back on the thought of how is the lord gonna use me as a young man how is he gonna use me and i know that i know the young people you know i have i'm sure you guys have that thought all the time like how how is the lord going to use me like you know am i supposed to what am i supposed to do how am i supposed to be a blessing to the lord and jeremiah had that same he had that same inkling he had that same desire how am i going to be used so let's read it and he said in the words we're just going to read one through nine it says the words of jeremiah the son of hilkiah of the priests who were in enough in the land of benjamin to whom the lord of the lord so this is the rsv so it might be a little different as as it's up there and it came to pass in the seventh day of uh jehoiakim the son of josiah the king of judah and until the end of the eleventh year of zedekiah the son of josiah king of judah until the captivity of jerusalem in the fifth month and now the word of the lord came unto me saying before so so i'm having these mind battles you shouldn't get up there you you know you don't need to be getting up there well you know lord i i i really i feel like this is what you're calling me to do you know and i just i i want to make sure that i'm in the perfect world of the lord and you know so read listen to this friends before i formed you in the womb i knew you before he formed us in the womb before we were alive before we had breath he knew us he knew each and every one of us amen and before you were born i consecrated you and i appointed you as a prophet to the nations and i said oh lord god behold i do not know how to speak for i am only a youth amen i got up there i was like oh i am only a youth amen amen i am only a youth i don't know how to speak i don't know how to get up and and preach to your people i don't i mean this is this is a sacred this is this is sacred you're the people that god chose to be the bride of christ you're gonna you're kings and rulers sitting among you guys how am i gonna get up here and and speak to you well the lord said before i formed you in the womb i knew you and before you were born i consecrated you and before you were a a messenger sent to the nations he was a prophet but were messengers sent to the nations amen and then i said oh lord god behold i do not know how to speak for i am only a youth but the lord said to me do not say that i am only a youth amen for to all to whom i send you shall go amen and but whatever i command you shall speak be not afraid of them for i will i am with you to deliver you says the lord now i would just i was just holding that scripture close to my heart today because i was afraid that i was going to come out here and my wife was you know just giving me encouragement but i was afraid i was going to come out here and just not have anything to say and just i didn't know what you know but all day i've just been and i've been put pondering these words that i i that that i will where was i then the lord put forth his hand and said unto me i will put the words in your mouth amen i will put the words in your mouth praise the name of the lord he puts the words in our mouth so young people just just a side note for the young people the lord whatever it is that you're supposed to do the lord will the lord will lead you he consecrated you he appointed you to be a messenger to the nations each one of you you're a messenger to the nations so behold don't have to worry about it amen all right so let's move on um then he numbered the young men the princes of the provinces and they were 32 and he numbered all the people even all the children of israel being seven thousand amen so this is this is the this is going to be the very first victory that ahab wins over the syrian army so you have this great army of the syrians and you have um you have the the israelite army which is small in number and they were working out at noon but benadab was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions he and the kings the thirty and two kings that helped him and the young men of the princes the provinces went out first and binidad sent out and they told him saying these are the men of samaria and he said whether they be come out for peace take them alive amen what do they come out for peace take them alive or whether they come out for war take them alive for these young men of the princes are come out of the city and the army which followed them and they slew every one of his men and the syrians fled amen amen they were they were standing around him in greater ray but guess what they slew every one of them amen and the syrians fled and israel pursued them and benedict the king of syria escaped on a horse that's what happens you know sometimes the devil will come and he'll have these you know these great big you know muscular things that just just seem so scary in our lives pre-cancerous condition no it's absolutely not i don't accept that you're gonna flee devil you're under my feet amen he's under our feet right so when the king went out and and then he then he runs then he runs away that's what the devil does he's because he's scared and he's a chicken and he runs and he says israel pursued them and benedict the king of syria escaped on a horse with horsemen and the king of israel went out and smote the horses and chariots and slew the syrians with a great slaughter amen they were victorious that day praise the name of the lord and the prophet came to the king of israel and they said unto him go strengthen thyselves and mark for the return of the year of syria will come up against thee so i don't exactly know the time frame friends how long it take it took for this to happen um so just bear with me on that but amen they he it says that that they were going to come back and and do the same thing over again and then next the next verse and the servants of the king of syria said unto him their gods are the gods of the hills therefore they were stronger than we but let us fight against them in the plane and surely we shall go uh oh oh they they just they did something the servant said their gods are gods of the hills you don't you don't disrespect god like that they're gods of the hills they're not they're not they're not going to be gods in the valleys god my god is the god of the hills and the valleys amen he's the god of everything amen praise the name of the lord and they were stronger than we but we let we let us fight against them in the plane and they sure and that's exactly what the devil does in our lives amen he comes and and you know he he the lord's victorious amen he was victorious right before and then then he circles back around sometimes it'll take him a month it'll take him it'll take him a year praise the name of the lord i know that the symptoms will probably come back again but praise the name of the lord i'm healed so it doesn't matter if those symptoms come back amen for each one of you it doesn't matter if something comes back if an ailment or if or if something happens in your life it doesn't matter if those things circle around because then then he tries to talk himself up the devil will say oh you know you know oh he's he's just the god of the he got the hills if we if we put him in our territory if you know if he brings it down to the valleys then oh we're going to be able to defeat the army and he said oh no and do this thing in verse 24 take the kings away every man out of his place and put the captains in their room and we shall fight against them we're going to move on um in verse 26. let's see fight against them in the plane in verse 26 it came to pass at the return of the year that benedict numbered the syrians and went out to effect to fight against israel and the israel were numbered so this is what i was talking about earlier how the israel israelites were numbered and they were all present and they went against them and the children of israel pitched them like two little flocks of kids but the syrians filled the filled the country so you know the king james version i haven't i wasn't able to ponder on any other versions but the king james version says that they in in comparison to the syrian army which filled the country okay you have the israelite army that looked like two little flocks of kids okay amen so and the children of israel were numbered and there came a man of god that spake unto israel and said thus saith the lord because the syrians have said the lord is god of the hills but he is not god of the valleys therefore i will deliver out all this great multitude into thine hand and ye shall know that i in the lord blessed be the name of the lord ye shall know that i am the lord amen that's what it says in verse 13 it says it twice now he says i will deliver thee into thine hand and thou shalt know that i am the lord the lord will have his glory it says every knee will bow and every tongue will come flesh well i was i know that i've confessed with my tongue and i've bowed my knee already amen but some will some will some will need to bow amen and it said they pitched over and there was he says that there ye shall know that i am the lord and they pitched over against verse 29 and they pitched over against the other seven days and it was so in the seventh day of battle was joined and the children the children of israel slew of the syrians a hundred thousand foot men in one day amen i feel like i i feel like i was going around today as just slaying syrians i'm not i'm serious amen i was so excited i got i got i got that scripture and it just was in my heart and i was so excited about it i was jumping for joy and i was saying lord lord if if it's what you're supposed to do in my life then then then have your way and if this ailment is supposed to go away then it is supposed to go away because 2000 years ago he died on a cross so that we could be saved and we could be healed amen so that's what he did and they slew 100 000 footmen we're slaying sometimes friends it feels like you know a pastor or or the or you know a minister or even even you know a man of god is is standing in one corner just like an mma fight he's standing in one corner just fighting and then you have you know the devil standing in the other corner and i'm just i'm like i'm like in the corner man and i'm like go lord go lord amen does anybody else ever feel like that you just want to oh you just want to be oh lord you just want to jump for joy because you know that he's going to he's going to revelation it says that we will overcome amen we will overcome by the blood of the lamb and by what by the word of our testimony so guess what it was today it was a testimony that i was healed it's a testimony that they oh amen all right let's let's move on amen um children of israel flew uh of a slew of the syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day but the rest fled to effect into the city and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand men so uh so i was just picturing and i was going back earlier but i was picturing this so like what happened again is these syrians you know they fled a whole hundred thousand of their buddies just died so 27 000 of them fled and i would imagine that they're in some kind of trench it says that the wall fell on him so they were hiding i'm guessing they were hiding like like what the devil does he was hiding sometimes he cowers away and he hides right amen so they were hiding but guess what the lord still slew him amen they didn't get away the lord was victorious and they shall know that i am the lord and his servant said unto him for behold now we have heard that the king of the house of israel are merciful kings and i pray that he put sackcloth on our up on our loins and god and the kings of israel so amen so we we have these we have these two victories amen in our that happen in this in this chapter and i wanted and i wanted to just take you know you know the huge the big army versus the little army and i wanted to attribute it to our lives and and show that you know that the lord he has a way of overcoming amen and whether or not whether or not you know it takes a month or a year and it may not be a physical ailment amen it may be you know a spiritual something that you're struggling with spiritually amen or it may be something that you're struggling with you know that that nobody else knows about only the lord knows about but it doesn't matter how big the battle is it doesn't matter it you could be fighting with it for a week a month a year two years two more than two years in my case you could be fighting with it for however long but the lord i had to put those scriptures together and what i had what i had to realize is that the name of the lord will be heard and the name of the lord you shall know that i am the lord amen amen amen praise the name of the lord i'm so excited to be up here friends i'm so excited that the lord put this upon my heart i'm so excited to be lord i'm so excited to be a christian it's so it's such an exciting time that we live in to be christians friends we are in the last days i was just sitting i was just sitting in my office and you know i have you know a picture of brother branham up here and then i have a picture of the lord jesus christ over here and i was just i was just i was just bowing down and i just was saying lord lord help me break through that barrier sometimes we get we get in a funk and i was you know we were talking about it in in that chatter we sometimes we get in these in this funk where you know we accept the things that the devil is putting our way or sometimes the the lord has allowed in our lives we i've accepted i was accepting for so long i was accepting that ailment i was so long i was just oh i was just trying i was trying by my own fruition by my own my own strength i was trying to do what i could do to to to to try to be healed or try to try to have some relief i was just what was i doing wrong i wasn't following the leadership of the lord i wasn't putting it completely in his hands he shall know that i am the lord i found out ye shall know that i am the lord i found out that that and i knew this all along but the lord had to really reveal it to me and sometimes friends it takes that time so that he can he can deal with your heart and he can reveal it to you in a special way that whatever it is that you're that you're struggling with friends oh man tonight whatever it is that you're struggling with that he can just full circle around and and as long as you can give him glory because it's not what you do it's not what you can do it's not what what we do is as humans it's what the lord will do in our lives to to to heal us or or to deliver us amen and we're going to be like the israelite army because guess what who are we we're god's people and guess who they were they were god's people so amen we're god's people we're delivered we're sanctified we're healed 2 000 years ago he died on a cross for our sins amen amen so you know friends as i as i start to come down and just looking over my notes i have i have i really even wasn't following notes i was just following the the leadership of the lord with the scriptures um but i felt just something inside of me that brother the the jeremiah that felt just i felt uh something in my bones just burning amen verse turn with me to jeremiah 20. jeremiah 20 and verse verse 8 it says for since i spoke and i cried i cried violence and spoil because the word of the lord has made her approach unto me in a derision daily then i said i will not make mention of him nor speak any more in his name but his word was in my heart amen his word has been in my heart just constantly just dealing with me it's been late nights i've been at work and i've just been oh i've just pacing back and forth oh man lord i don't want to do this ah this is this are you sure lord this is what i need i feel like doubting thomas i feel like i needed to feel the nail scarred hands to to to know for sure that i'm supposed to be up here this is this uh lord just complete i just i was just pacing back and forth day after day week after week month after month just pacing back and forth and the lord put the scripture upon my heart earlier today and it says that his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones amen it was a burning fire shut up in my bones i just wanted to shout oh man i you can call me whatever you want to call me i want to jump and i want to shout and i want to give god glory and praise and honor for the name of the lord jesus christ is the name above all names amen and it was shut up in my bones and it was weary with forbearing and what did it say and i could not stay amen i couldn't just stay seated and i couldn't just oh you know it's uh i just i can't i can't oh you know no amen friends i had i had to get out it take it took everything for me to text brother jason and say hey you know brother jason i really feel lord i want and and i didn't even say anything in the text you know i and and you know last week in brother jd's message i just really felt a call on the lord and he came up for prayer and i just told him i was like you know brother just pray for me i don't want to even speak it because i don't know man i don't know i just want to make sure that this is the this is what the lord has called me to to do hey man and then brother matt sent me a text last week after the service and i just told him i just kind of poured out my heart a little bit and amen and i just wanted to make sure and and he said he said i could hey fire shut up and bind bones and then this word came to me and then brother jason and we had our meeting and then we and then i just was preaching to myself all day it was it was just like oh i felt the nail scars i just felt it and i was just like lord if this is what you have for in store for me amen that i accepted and i believe it and i just i've taken this healing amen do it does anybody have any anything in their lives right now anything that they're struggling with right that may be a physical ailment amen or or or maybe a maybe a spiritual ailment or you just want to draw closer to the lord amen amen just let's just stand up amen brother jason talked about this a little bit and this is something i'm just super familiar with because it's it's now it's what i do uh for work you know i'm a fireman and you know there's there's something that starts a fire there's three things that have that you have a fire you know there's there's fuel then there's oxygen and there's heat and if you take one thing away from that then the fire stops burning hey man it just completely stops you you take the oxygen away it'll burn out if you have oxygen and fuel and there's no heat it won't burn hey man if there's no fuel i'm in it won't burn sometimes i feel like the lord allows things in our lives these ailments or these spiritual struggles to happen in our lives in my life especially whatever you're going through he allows these things so that we can maybe take away maybe one thing is missing in our triangle of fire amen maybe maybe maybe some heat is missing maybe maybe some fuel is missing maybe we're not feeling ourselves with the word or feeling ourselves with a message we have breath in our lungs and you know we have we have this word we have this message and sometimes the lord will allow those things and i think i believe it with all my heart that he allowed me to go through that ailment for so long so that i could i could understand his word and understand it that it doesn't matter what i do it doesn't matter what i say it doesn't matter anything nothing matters except the lord and his glory amen not it doesn't matter and and it's like it's like the heat was missing in my fire and he just started again and i just want to praise the name of the lord i just want to give him glory glory god father god you are the name above all names father oh let's just pray tonight father dear heavenly father lord god we just come before you we're so excited to be here tonight father god lord i just poured out my heart lord jesus and i just pray that whatever it is whatever you have in store for this night lord god that we can just stand here and we can just lord we can just accept your word tonight lord lord i accept it lord i get out of the way father god of lord lord i left caleb at home and i just asked that the lord god the the father of heaven would just come and just use me in a

oh we're just going to be shouting i remember being a young young i'm still young but i'm just remember being younger going to those youth camps and oh man we'd get all excited and we'd jump up and

christ amen thank you friends the name of the lord is a strong tower [Music] the righteous running into me they are saved the name of the lord is [Music] they are safe blessed be the name of the blessed lord the name of the lord bless it be the name of the lord bless it be the name of the lord bless it be the name of the lord [Music] hallelujah they shall know that i am the lord don't you want him to do that in your life i want the enemy to know who my lord is they shall know i tell you you know i've always loved part of that story where they tried to say well you know he's just a god of the mountains and you know we'll whoop him down in the plains we'll put a we'll whoop him because he's not a god of the plains and and the lord decided to just wipe them out just because they said that so you need to be careful what you say because somebody's listening amen praise the lord i was thinking to myself that if god was going to do that if he was going to make sure if he was going to make sure that the enemy knew he was the lord if he was going to do that then i'd imagine that bringing an army up against you that made your army look like two little flocks of kids and their army filled the whole the whole landscape i think that'd be a pretty good way to do it i think the lord would say you know i'm gonna really make this stick and i'm just gonna give you an army just look like two little flocks of kids and and i'm gonna fill i'm gonna fill the whole countryside with their army i think that would be a great way to do it brother caleb was telling me today all right he was in the back office and he said man he said after after i left today and he said i got in my car and he said i started crying he said then i started preaching he said i cried for half an hour i preached for an hour and he said then i got to walmart he said i got out in the parking lot he said i walked around the parking lot preaching for another half an hour i think i think the enemy has figured out who the lord is amen i i had this quote sent to me by my daughter-in-law it was so good i thought i wanted to read it brother caleb this will be good listen to this this is from possessing all things one of the most powerful ways that i've ever heard brother branham talk about spiritual warfare how many got spiritual warfares and you need the devil beat down by the lord i mean it doesn't matter what your need is the lord is here to do that brother branham says the promise is yours already the promise is yours now watch but if you ever get it you ain't gonna get it easy i'm going to tell you that you're going to have to take it away from satan satan captures your health you got a right to go to satan say give it back hand it over amen oh my goodness i come in the name of the lord the possessor of heaven and earth and i'm his heir i thought about you know brother caleb kept pointing out i mean listen when you think about ahab and you think about israel there was plenty of unworthiness to go around more than enough unworthiness to go around a lot of times it's that way in our lives hitting friends more than enough worthiness to go around but the bottom line was this was god's chosen people and he wasn't going to lose them brother branham says i'm his heir give it back you took my child you got her mixed up with the wrong boy you took my boy got him mixed up with the wrong girl i claim them that's right i claim my children i claim my brother i claim my sister yes satan you've took them from god's house coaxed him out there but i'm coming after them i claim them amen and that powerful i am an heir of all things do you have enough courage i tell you if you arrived here with not enough courage say that you should have enough courage now after hearing that sermon you say i am an heir of all things it's given to me i'm an heir i can claim everything that god promised me amen there you are it's mine how do you get it something you've done no sir it's the unmerited gift that god gave us and it's ours it belongs to us see satan cannot hold it listen to this friends satan cannot hold it if you go to him in the scriptural authoritative word with faith to say it's mine amen lay it down lay it down amen glory i like that satan you lay it down you took it from me you give it back because i'm serving notice on you i've got the notice written right here on the word heavens and earth will pass away but this notice shall not pass away wow oh my written right here on the word so i come with this notice to serve on you that jesus christ said whatsoever i ask the father in in his name he'll give it to me if i say this mountain moved and don't doubt it in my heart but believe that what i've said will come to pass i can have what i've said and i'll lay it down listen that gets him started don't get him started gets him running amen lay it down because i have come with the scriptural authority i'm a believer you get it yes sir yes sir how many want to say to the devil drop it lay it down it's mine give it back to me hallelujah i have the authority i'm serving notice on you today i'm not looking for you to walk away i'm looking for you to run oh boy brother branham says no matter what it is now if i just said that you'd you got confidence in me you'd wanted to take that brother caleb would have said it but i'm not telling you i said or brother caleb said this is what a prophet said no matter what it is i just want you to say that no matter what it is say it again no matter what it is just keep saying that in your mind let that roll around in your mind no matter what it is see if you are a believer you're an heir of every promise so lay your faith upon the promise and march forward and tell satan give it back give it back it's mine don't let him bluff you don't let him bluff you stand right there on the line he'll give it back god said he would so he has to do it that's your authority that's right heir of all things blessed be the name of the lord this would be the name of the lord i so thoroughly enjoyed that tonight i i i don't want to embarrass him but you know we we started a kind of a bible reading club and a whole bunch of you have joined up and were you actually some people say what brothers and what's up with all that because i was telling the young people in our last meeting that did you know and i don't bet you didn't know this because even i didn't know it at all i was shocked i heard billy graham say it and he was talking to larry king about reading the whole bible and larry was like well wow you know he said read the new testament well that's still a lot he said listen he said there are fewer words in the entire new testament than in the average edition the average sunday edition of the new york times there are fewer words in the entire new testament from matthew to revelation there are fewer words in the entire new testament than that appear in the average sunday edition of the new york times and there are some people who as a matter of course go on sunday buy the sunday edition and they'll take all week and read in it every day and by that week they'll have read the whole thing and they get the next sunday edition and do you realize we started doing young people now we start doing some counting up and do you do you realize you can you can actually read uh the entire new testament even uh even an average reader could read the entire new testament in under 16 hours and if you just read an hour in the morning and an hour in the evening and you just did that you'd you'd literally read your entire testament in in about seven or eight days and people say i'm going to read the i'm going to read it in a year you could read it 50 times you could read that literally read the new testament and when i said that the young people and and it caught in some of them and and we got an app and everybody got the same app and we're reading it along as we go and and i was reading the other day um i think in mark's gospel yeah and it was so beautiful because it might have been matthew mark and when the when mary and martha came into the tomb i'm not saying this to embarrass you brother when martha and mary came into the tomb and they walked in and the bible says there was an angel in there and it and they saw a young man and he was a young man sitting on the right side and he said you're looking for jesus he's not here go tell his disciples he's gone into galilee and i thought this wasn't some big gleaming winged creature this was just a young man and they saw a young man and he no doubt just smiled at him and i thought to myself man whenever i think of that with that angel as a young man i don't know why i think of caleb something about that smile just like that had to be i think what they saw was like caleb if i walked into the tomb and just saw caleb sitting there and said you're looking for jesus yeah he's not here amen i had a nice kick out of that but it was the truth i was telling you how it struck me but i tell you what i tell you what i think we saw tonight friends i think like in the days of daniel the spirit of god on daniel the characteristic of that spirit of god is that he's a dissolver of all doubts and i believe i think we saw tonight and we're all witnesses the holy spirit is a dissolver of all doubts how many believe you heard from god tonight how many feel fed on the word of god i feel thrilled with what i heard amen i don't have uh i got a couple of prayer requests that came in sister deborah is having a difficulty in her hand she's got a pain in her hand not sure if it's inflammation or something and um she's talking to me about it today and i said uh hey maybe maybe see if with andrew can maybe show up some extra services and he wasn't supposed to be here tonight and then lo and behold he walks in the door and so she said oh i get to take have the night off so she can rest her hand and so how many be praying for our sister we're going to pray for her here just in a minute and um seemed like i had one other that uh um no that was the only prayer request i had haley where are you sis come up here and give your testimony give me some power on this uh i i i got a half a minute to show them the picture though i'll put it in the church so a bit of a praise report as i told brother jason earlier sorry if i start rambling yesterday on the way home from work i drove by a moving sale on basically my street on a well tuesday who does a moving sale on tuesday um drove up parked was a bit nervous getting out they put it inside their garage behind a bunch of trucks so i'm like okay is this the right place they're like yep just go in shop around i did a couple loops around didn't see anything just felt like okay let's just do one more left around just to make sure i didn't miss anything because you never know what you can find and then i hear a big crash an 18 year old young driver gets in his big brother semi and backs over the front of my car the picture is pretty brutal the entire front bumper of my car is on the ground lights hanging and just dangling off my car and everything and thankfully no one was injured the truck only had a little dent and a little piece of plastic hanging off that was it everything else just literally wiped off but yeah my car is smashed i wasn't in it i was a couple yards away just thank the lord that everything turned out all right and we're still waiting to see what the blessing is for the family and for my family coming out of this amen praise the lord sister debbie was telling me the other day she said you need to start our wednesday testimonies at least again and when sister haley sent me that i said here we go i'm gonna get her to testify of that amen lord's been good to you this week friends been good to me my we've got another prayer request that came in um brother jason jackson put this in i happened to i actually remember seeing it now um please remember the savage family in prayer this is from jason jackson in arkansas he's in arkansas i think and um apparently brother harvey senior just passed away and went on uh to be with the lord so brother jason is asking prayer the sudden that's got to be a big shock to them to this whole church there and so let's pray for brother jackson's church and that harvey family i don't know him personally unless i would or the savage family by the harvey savage senior and so i might if i saw a picture of it might remember but want to pray for that i want to pray for sister deborah's hand i don't have any oh that's right i do sister mom sister gene um wrote to me tonight and she's got a lot of pain going on in her neck and her back how many remember our sister amen let's bow our heads

physical need the savage family lord this tremendous loss we're thanking you for all these things but as brother caleb said it might be physical spiritual financial emotional doesn't matter whatever
