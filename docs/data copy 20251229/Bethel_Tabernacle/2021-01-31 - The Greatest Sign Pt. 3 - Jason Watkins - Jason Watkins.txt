to be here today greet you in the name of the lord jesus and counted a privilege and an honor to stand before god's family amen are you god's family praise the lord i tell you there's nothing like it in all the world and so we just want to be ready have our minds ready for the word now i'm gonna invite you to first corinthians chapter 10 this morning amen want to look right into the word i sure appreciated all of that uh singing my so wonderful first corinthians 10 and we are going to catch those first 12 verses moreover brethren i would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea now this is uh paul's gone about to use a teach a lesson by contrast so he's going to make the point first hey we all all our fathers came out all of them went through the red sea all right watch at verse 2 again and we're all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea and did how many all eat the same spiritual meat and did how many all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ but with how many many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness this is not all of them but many of them now these things here it is these things were for our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be ye idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand neither let us now this is the this is the ones who don't fall okay neither let us tempt christ as some of them the ones who fell also tempted and were destroyed of serpents now he's in a whole other example all right neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer now isn't a whole other example i mean he's trying to get the church to understand this is a repeating pattern so three's a witness right paul's saying i'm giving you three clear examples you all know what i'm talking about this is the mistake they made and this is exactly how it all came up came about verse 11. now all these things happened unto them for examples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall let's pray father we thank you for your word today master these divinely revealed truths that we have been given access to by your grace and your mercy alone so now i'm praying lord that you be with both speaker and hearer lord i have lots on my heart and plenty of material probably more than i can get to lord in a reasonable amount of time so i'm going to be looking to you now to make it efficient and ordered father so that it meet so that it hits the target father when we shoot an arrow of deliverance we want to make sure we hit the target father i want to bring this a death blow to the enemy's grip in our lives too often times he lives in our lives a long time lives in our home lives in our family and he just goes unchallenged well today lord we want to shoot at that guy father i want to see if we can put an arrow right in his heart i pray you'll grant it today lord in jesus name you see the great need master you see the need of the hour so we're looking to you father in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated i want to continue by the help of the lord today on the greatest sign this will be part three as i would understand how they're titling it now there's a number of things that i started to put in put up today a number of quotes i decided not to i'm just going to reference them and kind of skip through them and not read them in their entirety perhaps so you just be a tentative and you make a mental note maybe you want to go home and read the whole the whole thing in context or better yet hear the whole sermon amen because you you can't hear you can't feed on too much of the word of god amen so we were thinking today along this line that all of these things happened unto them for our examples they're written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come so now that's us just absorb that that's us we're right here you're the ones he's speaking to and we realize that yeah paul said it to the age he lived in and yeah it was a 2 000 year old statement brother jason that's a 2 000 year old statement you know upon whom the ends of the world have come but that's why i don't often say oftentimes i amend the term we're at the end time and you've heard me amend it and i say we're not merely at the end time because the the last days plural are the last two thousand years brother i'm taught us that over and over that's why it says in the last days and there's an s on there because a day with the lord is a thousand years and so in the last two days or the last 2000 years brother ram says that over and over and over and over again and so we realize that we're not just merely in the last days we're at the end of the last days we're not just merely at the end time we're at the end of the end time all right so now nothing's out of cater the scripture's perfectly in line but just understand this friends that the bride of christ leaves the seventh age and goes in a rapture there's not another age this thing you understand it can't it can't it cannot just keep going on and on and on there's no more margin now there's no more age there's he only had seven stars in his right hand and they've all been expended there's no more stars left the the last thing we see happening is a bride who has taken the book and eaten the book has become the book and is now a living voice not redoing the shout amen see not an eighth messenger but uh the final voice under her messenger and and her voice is a living voice it's a voice of lived life so when the world when the world looks around and they see madness they have another book they can read and that's you and when everything when all the news headlines are nothing but doom and gloom wouldn't it be nice if your neighbor could actually read your headline and go well there's hope yet [Applause] that's what i want to be able to do friends that's the that's the life that's the impact that i want to have because i'm here to tell you you're supposed to have an impact we were so fed this morning on brother jd's sunday school lesson on humility i just hope and trust and i don't need you to fill out a questionnaire we're not about that we're not a denomination i just hope and trust that you're if for those of you who aren't here we started a class with four people and i and thank god many more came in write it write it read it the buzzer and uh we had a nice crowd but and but my trust is that you're all catching the stream or you're going back and get the archive because what he's covering these characteristics of god i ca i could not overstate the the vital importance that they are because what they're teaching you is is how to be the bride of jesus christ because if you're going to be his bride it's not winning a lottery it means that you have become something you didn't just get a mantle put on you you've turned into something you've been created into something you've been recreated you're now being molded according to the image god had and what are you you're a continuation you're part of a plan you're part of god's plans absorb this you ready you're part of god's plans 6 000 years in the making you've arrived amen you are those upon whom the ends of the earth of the world have come and and the and the bride knows what he wants done with his word that is significant two things were so significant for this bride under her messenger as the final voice she has firstly thus saith the lord or she keeps still but also and not necessarily an order of importance but also she knows what he wants done with his word and and you say well how how does she know is is this book learning is this some kind of uh doctrinal education no you know it's you know i i don't need you to put a book in front of my face that tells me i love sister debbie you could stack a thousand of them that say i don't and i would burn them they would mean nothing to me you couldn't disprove it to me i don't care what laboratory i don't care what scientific experiment you couldn't disprove it to me because i say i know it's there how do you know because i do i know it's there you can't put love under a microscope and so the bride knows what he wants done with his word and and and she in humility his brother jd was talking today that's how she finds it that's how she's the final voice that's how she knows what he wants done with his word because she's not trying to go off in her own self-esteem running her own accomplishments she stays humble i thought that was that was quite an image today brother jason was talking about ships of war in perfect battle formation that's a thing lots of things you ever seen the seventh fleet out in the out in the ocean it's quite an amazing thing when they're in battle battle order and you've got the aircraft carriers and they're flanked by by frigates and and missile cruisers and destroyers and the submarines are underneath and the air the aircraft are overhead i mean this is this is this is the united states coming to deal a blow and so you realize that he said that that how that that that here you know when you rise up in your own arrogance and your own self-determination then god just understand that that's that fleet is coming after you and it's going to resist you and all your plans trying to go forward because you're trying to do it in your own self-interest in your own wit instead of being humble and let god and i i met by the gd in the back and we talked about i said don't you think it's also and he agreed that even if you are actually trying to accomplish god's plan for you to accomplish if you do it in self-assurance and arrogance god will even resist that say man i'm only trying to do his will well then be humble about it and let him be in control i'm here to tell you if you're his arrogant child you get how said that you are his child but you're you're determined to keep going your own way he will break you down and it'll all be done in love he will not allow you to have your own way because you are bought with the price you have been purchased you're not your own you don't own you he does he saved you from hell you were going to hell and there was nothing you could do if somebody didn't if somebody didn't throw you a lifeline but he did it today he threw a lifeline and pulled you into his his boat understand the ship of zion is his boat you don't suddenly get to decide your life you're on a ship headed for zion all right so so we realize that this is where the world is stumbling today and you know you know we we have arrived where um you know we we've all seen the the picture and boy are they that thing is hitting the headlines even among charismatic circles evangelicals they're already putting youtube up saying my goodness it looks like william branham was correct and they they seen kamala harris stand up there in her royal purple and they they go back and look at the prophet's words and it's it's and i'm i was getting emails from all over the world today have you seen this brother jason have you seen this and brother donnie had put it in the in the in the minister's chat the other day and they're already starting to talk about it to say wow i mean he he was on the money and they know that the next thing he saw that that was the last thing he saw before total annihilation he had already seen where technology uh crests when the bride is gone and of course mankind is always with his technology he's always still trying to go forward they're talking about a a lunar base they're talking about putting a man on mars but that level of technology is down the road and a prophet didn't see that what he saw was a pilotless car where a family could ride in a car and they wouldn't have to steer it and we're there that was the that was the zenith of technology that he saw before the bride was gone say how you know she was gone because everything got blown up and she's not here for that hallelujah now curiously or maybe that's the wrong word but ironically i should say i should maybe even say predictably i pointed out to my wife here this morning we were i said i want you to watch this 17-minute youtube of i forget the man's name big he's a big name among those charismatics and evangelicals and he was saying that um you know the first vision the second vision third vision he and he's and they all do this you watch they they hit about hitler and mussolini and communism and then they they make a big jump and they go to the pilotless car and then they go to a woman in power and then they say then the world was destroyed a country was destroyed i said you notice the one they always jump she said which one i said the immorality and the fall of women she said why did they do that i said because they can't say that they'll empty their churches overnight and then they'll have to do like us and walk by faith and just believe that if i if i have the carcass you eagles will gather hallelujah i'm so glad it's that way i'm so glad i'm not depending on a program or some denominational headquarters all i got to do is cook you a meal and have the carcass of the word and eagles will gather around that hallelujah and that's why brother branham said brother branham said i feel sorry for them they say brother man if i'd preach that then i i'd lose my status lose my ministry and brother branham said any ministry the word would destroy needs destroying so you know something friends we have more courage than we thought we had don't we faith runs runs deeper than we even realized i think maybe we could say i i know what he wants done with his word hallelujah what does he want done he wants your life to be given over to it he wants to see you here hearing and rejoicing over the word of god he wants to see you as a believer he wants to see you believe on him whom he hath sent you're already doing the works of god and and but but they jumped that part because they dare not touch that one and yet that's one of the ones brother branham talked about the most and so so we realized that that we've come to an hour now i mean that's just that's just recent to where now something that had been somewhat ambiguous is it in prophecy still has it partly is it the catholic church and if that's the case it's kind of already fulfilled kind of sort of in a way but now all of that kind of sort of in a way maybe kind of sort of is done gone that prophecy is history that all six prophecies are now history and you're living just before the seventh and you can't be here when the seventh one unfolds where are we you know where we are we are those upon whom the ends of the world have come you're in the last days you're in the end of the last days you know here's here's a concept that you need to understand all right where would i start to explain this all right let me try to keep it simple so you've heard we talk about it before brother branham taught us how that when you go back and you read the characteristics in the church ages and you read the seals about the white horse rider and the red and the black and the pale and you read the the complaints that he had in every age and i i i acknowledge your works and i know this and i know that but here's what the problem here's another problem here's another problem here's the problem right and brother madam says now remember all of that all of that historical all of those historical characteristics are all piled up and come into full steam in the last day so everything of the white horse deception and everything of the red horse and everything of the black horse is all wound up in the pale horses why it's pale it's grisly sickly see it's just a big conglomeration of colors that you normally wouldn't put together hoping to get something pretty and so so you find that that we have arrived at it so now so now just bear that concept in mind everything that has been will be again as solomon said and it's all heaped upon us now now the beauty of it is is every good thing everything of the lion who was the defender of the faith everything of the ox who gave the people the right kind of humble spirit everything in the man with the cunningness to to to rightly divide the word of truth and resist the uh the you know the theological takeover of the world and and then everything in the flying eagle it's all heaped up in the flying eagle and in fact is you're in the age where the anointing doesn't isn't isn't an earthbound creature so quite naturally it's a heavenly creature just like isaiah 60 says for you to arise just like in revelation chapter 4 the bride is in an order of ascending see of course she leaves the seventh age and goes in the rapture that that's absolutely clear but you can't separate chapter four from chapter five and chapter six and it all runs into chapter ten i mean this is god unfolding one step at a time until now we realize my goodness we've arrived we've got the full measure of everything amen good and bad see now if you think about how that these seals and the trumpets and the vials have all ran concurrently they've all run together and they all have an association especially the viles and trumpets because trump is what god's doing in israel all down just like the seals when you read the seals you're reading about the history of the church and things that went on back there right amen well the trumpets are the same thing only it's not the gentile church it's the jews and while the gentile church was being molded through ages jews were scattered around the world and god was moving in among them as a nation you got that and so so the the the vials then that that's why when you read the sixth trumpet you what do you have you you ha what's the sixth vial the sixth vial is the euphrates is dried up to make ways for the kings of the north all right everybody goes oh that's in a tribulation well i'm quite sure it'll have a magnificent uh application just like everything all down through the ages all through the seals all through the trumpets we'll all wind up in the in the time of of jacob's trouble amen but don't disregard what's happening right now and what has already happened in history because the sixth the sixth trumpet is the river euphrate the sixth vial is the river euphrates drying up the sixth trumpet is the 200 million special demon chargers released at euphrates how they get released because it dried up under the vial you understand now it may it may we you know you say is it going to have an application or is it actually going to dry them kings are going to come across it may happen i don't want to be here i'd rather not be able to answer that question i'd rather be on the other side safe home hallelujah and say oh yeah i did it did have an actual but don't dismiss what it's already unfolding they the vial is simply this here's here's a way to understand the vials the vials are simply god doing something to allow the antichrist to take another step that's what the vials are every time a vial is released it gave the antichrist another opportunity to step forward see so the sixth vial gave the enemy an opportunity under the sixth trumpet to release 200 million chargers against the jews that's easy isn't it you got you got me you're kind of blinking i hope i haven't bogged you down all right let i just want to set that in motion because i'm about to make a point so so now and so now in regards what am i saying that everything that has been in a measure is still being in a greater measure and will be in another greater measure when we're gone that's all okay so now now you can understand when somebody says and they look at some of these diseases and things that are falling on the world and say brother jason and i get this question could that be pre-tribulation and that's that's a thing though it's not a direct statement but we find that brother branham does point to it because remember that the judgments of god that are going to fall in the tribulation period began to fall in 1964 when the earthquake struck alaska that brother branham pitched a rock up in the air and said thus saith the lord and brother rem set up and away it went headed west and he said and when it hit alaska that just switched its tail he said wait until that dragon comes down head and shoulders and sinks hollywood and now you're right in matthew 27 matthew 28 now you've got the word has been crucified an earthquake strikes on good friday come on friends this is real amen and then there's another earthquake comes and you know what it does it brings the sleeping saints back among us oh we're here we're here we're here we're here we're here we're here hallelujah and so you you find that these judgments have already begun and they're they're they they can't go in their full ride while we're still here the the pale horse rider where you say well where is he he's been named he was never named until the last messenger named him his death he had description of him but no one ever named him until brother branham comes on the scene today and says it's death it's it's man-made religion it's denominationalism and he identifies the work of that horse but he says he can't write his full right because there's an injunction and there's no court high enough to undo it there's an injunction on him that you that i'll uh he that letteth christ will let will hold i'll hold him until christ in you has been taken from the earth in a rapture and then the injunction's lifted so understand friends you might feel weak today you might feel not very much like a christian but the devil don't think that of you i know he might tell you that and i know he might be whispering it in your ears right now and you feel like the worst hypocrite in the world but understand the devil don't actually believe that about you he knows he can't even get on his horse because you're in the way this is part of the bride knowing who she is and knows what he wants done with his word why because she's humbled herself to it sometimes i feel like blowing up it just gets so big like brother dale told me one time he was standing across my yard and a fence he said man i got a humdinger for for wednesday night and i said really brother dale he said i i said it's so big it's it's i said how big is it he said it's too big i said what are you gonna do he said i don't know i'm just gonna walk out and just blow up so we we me and him have had that little wink kind of uh did you blow up how'd your service go man i blew up i didn't know what else to do i just come out and blew up and he gets it and i get it amen so okay now watch i'm gonna wake you up watch this i'm talking about i'm gonna make you aware of something in prophecy so now with this idea of partial pre-tribulation and full after the tribulation you're with me in full tribulation you can't buy or sell except you have that mark and brother branham said the bride does not see that she's already in glory see but now in pre-tribulation we've already had the alaska earthquake we've already got viruses and mutations of viruses and there's five more coming behind those and ten more behind those you understand that when they crucified the word that set off a cycle that doesn't end until the bride is in glory and the world goes into self-destruction you understand the rapture's on that that sets up a cycle for you and that also sets up an end game for the world and this thing is moving like a locomotive going down the tracks you can't stop it i don't care who they elect you're not going to stop it doesn't matter what they throw money at you're not going to fix it it's over mankind is now headed toward a certain end and it's rolling down the track and it's headed toward a cliff and i just say hide me in the rock lord jesus because we already see plagues falling we already see earthquakes falling that are going to have fullness we already know there's another one coming like the world hasn't seen and and if it follows matthew 27 and 28 which brother branham talks about the events of matthew 27 repeat at the end time and we've seen it that's why alaska was struck on a good friday you know why because they crucified jesus on a good friday so it was an indication that that matches this was a good friday crucifixion and an earthquake when you killed him on the cross well guess what i'm going to bring another earthquake at the end time and i'm not going to have it on thursday and i'm not going to wait till saturday i'm going to hit it on good friday and my prophet will catch that and warn the people this is that and you're now you're caught in something now we're on the move now christ's been kicked out now he's called a church out now you're out now we're on now we're moving up amen satan's coming down hallelujah this bride in an order of ascending while satan is falling hallelujah revelation 12 sees him completely fallen woe into the earth for satan has come down to you this is happening in real time this is hd this is hd in real time and you're it you say why are you emphasizing that so hard because paul's warning they were in hd they were in real time they all went came out they all went through the sea they all drank of that water and paul says but not all of them pleased the lord many of them fell in the wilderness because they didn't they didn't do anything about the real-time situation they just had this idea we're just we're just here we're just passing time well i need to do this i need to do that i need to do this what you need to do is become this that's all that matters say well well i you know i i got a life to live and i got a family and i got a i got a career and i got education if if you caught the sunday school lesson this morning you'll understand it's not you deciding anything it's you humbling yourself so that he can decide your life because i'll promise you he will give you the best life you can imagine and it doesn't matter what crucibles or trials or afflictions you have to go through just understand father knows best and he makes it all beautiful in his time if you'll just be patient he turns it into something beautiful it's when you run ahead of him that you stumble and get in the way that's probably the last thing in the world i think i would just rather die than be found in the way of god just get out of his way let the holy spirit lead see he'll bring it to pass you don't have anything to worry about jesus said be anxious for nothing be anxious for nothing see your father knows what you have need of he's already got this so now post i mean during the tribulation period you can't buy or sell but did you know that you had i forget the number it was a large number of people conservatives who were making a living buying and selling with their youtube channels with their facebook channels with their instagrams with their social media platforms amen until the beast decides to shut them down for what they were saying say oh here we go into conspiracy conspiracy nothing it's all over the headlines congress is holding hearings over it because these big tech giants have have flexed their muscles and now you've got people who can't buy or sell except they agree with the system this ain't no joke this is happening in real time friends you're already seeing tribulation events happening here in a pre-preliminary way amen now the world is to run in fear but not the bride the bride has a different message lift up your head your redemption draweth nigh rejoice and be glad for you know many many old sages and saints and even angels looked in on and wanting to understand what you're understanding and you're not understanding it by by theology you're becoming it amen amen this is the hour they've all wanted and this is the hour god has called you too so you don't want to be here at this critical junction of time a junction is joining to the next event and we're in the final junction the next the junk the next event is tribulation the next event is vision number seven we're already gone when that unfolds so we find then friends that already the constitution is not going to protect your free speech much longer it's not going to protect you much longer say what's it going to look like i don't know i'm just going to preach the gospel somebody said what if they put you in jail i said then i'll convert the jail amen uh if they if they they threw joseph in jail thinking they did a good thing he converted the jailer and the prisoners and i mean the whole thing i mean wherever i am i'm gonna be casting out devils whatever happens to me i'm going to be keep preaching the word of god until death sets me free or i go on a rapture what about you what about the sermon of your life what are your plans for your life see so yes we plan like it could be another hundred years though i don't it has nothing to do with prophecy i don't see mankind being able to survive another hundred years he's so he's so far gone now i don't see how he could possibly survive another hundred but brother branham says nonetheless that that we do plan like that so you know if you're a farmer go ahead and plant your potatoes if you're in school go ahead and finish your education you need a career get a career fine but but live like he's coming in the morning [Applause] plan like it's a hundred years but live like it's in the morning see so brother branham comes to a point where he he makes um this statement and just be prepared g-man with that uh image just in a moment so brother branham says in the breach he starts telling the testimony you're familiar with it of he was in sabine praying and he said i had my hands up he's wondering about his ministry about his life he heard a great explosion he thought nobody could survive it uh and he's wondering he said but i heard joseph's voice saying daddy he said i thought well if it would have got me it would have got him how so he's all in a confusion you know and the lord is going to show him it's not the end of your life it's your ministry you see now his in the end of his life was going to be a couple more years out but it was a ministry change and a sword he said a sword something struck my hand and he looked and he said it was a sword now it's contrary to his nature because he didn't like knives he didn't like swords he said i was so glad i wasn't alive in that day when they fought with swords some he didn't like the idea of being run through with cold steel somehow getting shot doesn't matter but i don't want to be stabbed with a sword so i think maybe i get it too so so so he he he he's noticing he says now watch now i oh he okay so he first talks about the the guard remember and he says made of pearl so beautiful and the s and the blade he said just not very long but razor-sharp which if you study if you study the history of you know of of war swords you'll find that that short sword that's what the zulus used that's what the romans used they didn't use a big long broadsword the guys who did that were nights and got killed because they wanted a short story a short sword so that you because you're this is going to be almost hand-to-hand combat so that's where we are god hasn't given you a standoff weapon he's given you a weapon for close hand combat i mean the enemy's on you he's trying to get inside your house trying to get inside the heart of your children you're going to need a sword and brother branham said it wasn't too long but glistening and razor sharp just razor sharp and so he said now now he picks up the scene he says now in dueling and he says i don't understand one word of it but are one principle of dueling but the best of my understanding the knife striking across finally the swords if they lock if they lock the enemy and you lock swords then it takes the strength of the man dueling because see his sword is pointed to my heart and mine is pointed at his heart see that they're locked as our knives come together we're trying to kill each other i'm not trying to wound the enemy i'm trying to destroy him and he's not just trying to hinder you or give you a bad day he's trying to kill you he's trying to destroy your influence trying to destroy your children he's trying to kill him see so that's why we say don't flirt with him he's a killer he doesn't just want to give you bad luck he doesn't just want to give you you know a bad day he wants to destroy you and so he says and they strike and then the swords come together and whichever one can shove the other one down the sword is straight to the heart now here is the bombshell you ready say well my sword is the word i gotta i got the word brother brahman said even though the sword be the word it takes the hand of strong faith to hold it there to bring it to the heart of the enemy amen see now that's in the breach this is why brother branham would come along later in the fourth seal because in the breach he doesn't have he doesn't know the first seal yet and he's giving this principle an accurate principle that's going to really have a lot to say later on when the seals actually start to break and in the fourth seal brother branham says now we had him coming last night with a sword and we find out he gets killed by that sword and brother brahm said the sword of the word to put him right down because that's what he's trying to fight with and he's uh he's a trespasser he's got no right to it right and false teaching amen so so that's his sword of influence on the world and he's he's taught them easy believism he's taught them that you don't need the holy ghost he's taught them that it doesn't matter how you live oh it matters that's what paul is trying to get across to the church it matters see and and he says he says wait till that group rises up there that seven thunders group who can hand that sword and brother branham doesn't say handle it he doesn't say handle it understand he says hand it a hand is at the end of an arm and therefore wait till that group rises up who's at the end of god's arm that group who can accomplish his word and accomplish his will it'll slice and cut and of course that has a big application under moses and elijah brother branham makes that clear under the sixth seal that the ones who close the heavens and do all of that that's moses and elijah that's not our ministry as brother matt and brother jason been been teaching on and the article they're writing we've got to keep that separate but there is an application to us for it here that you're that you're literally he has no hands but your hand there's no feet but your feet no mouth but your mouth but it's going to take a strong arm of faith a strong hand uh it takes the hand of strong faith the hand is you it's going to take strong faith and to give you the strength to bring the sword of the word to slay your enemy and i'm here to tell you it's you or him face it either you kill him or he kills you either you he's coming for your children fathers you're the only one who can stop him he's coming for your babies mama you're the one who can stop him hallelujah is coming for your church pastor i have a responsibility to stop him today how am i doing i'm preaching the word and cast out devils takes authority over the enemy we'll tell you something friends we have not followed cunningly devised tales we are not eating the opinions of a man we are feeding on the body word of the son of man it's a living word it's a bleeding word it's a powerful word it'll put the enemy down if it's wielded in a hand of strong faith see the further we go along the more i realized that this has really been one of the biggest letdowns among god's people and preachers is a life that surrenders on a daily basis and lives in the spirit constantly to have the faith to handle the sword to wield the sword of the word against this enemy you know everybody loves rejoicing over the word it thrills us amen indeed it does but we remember that satan is not afraid of how religious you are and he doesn't care this is top secret intel this is insider trading it should be illegal for you to know this but we had a prophet who knows we had a prophet who told us what satan thinks of when he's in his bed chamber amen and he says satan doesn't care how religious you are i'll just go to church more he doesn't care he'll help you you lose your keys he'll find them for you he doesn't care say well we got brother jason we got brother jason watkins we got brother matt watkins we got brother jason demars we got good teachers satan doesn't care how right you are in your teaching he doesn't care how religious you are he doesn't care how right you are in your doctrine because here's his great secret that he didn't want you to know what a prophet out of him he he knows that it's that as long as you miss that life see you won't you won't come up in the resurrection and more than that you won't be able to put the sword to his heart because your hand won't be strong enough and you'll sit back and watch one at a time as your children are sifted by the devil you watch one at a time as your family and your marriage is sifted by the devil you'll just sit back and watch it powerless god got a sword of the word in your home and not enough strength in your hand to use it see listen teenagers this is on you you you reach a point in your life where mama can't do it for you there there was a time when mama or daddy swung the sword for you but hey the sword is in your lap today teenager what are you going to do with jesus called the christ you're going to need a strong hand of faith to put down the enemy amen don't y'all go to get quiet on me now so satan's not afraid of those things see so so then that to me this is what i want god to keep at the front of my mind at all times that that that that rich spiritual life and that is available to us as individuals and and and because i mean listen we get the word for free come on that's just god's grace i get the word for free preaching is the easiest part of pastoring because i get it for free sometimes i don't even sometimes he makes me labor and go through and burn the midnight oil but not all times sometimes i can be driving down the road and in six and a half minutes he'll give me a whole sermon i'll try to drive a not wreck and write a sermon or record my voice and come in here and turn it into an hour and ten minutes sermon to you see but so so so a lot of times you sit here you get all this great preaching you know we get revelation for free because that just comes down from the father of lights that comes down from him who is above all good things come down from the father of lights and so you know and and so so now so now when we when we think about what is incumbent upon us if we get the word for free and we get the revelation for free that comes down from the father of lights but it's that but now there's we got to talk about that spiritual life that re that that requires a willingness to be a prisoner and there's the rub because this guy doesn't like that that's right amen remember when i was preaching wednesday and we we read from david that he talks about his enemies that they just destroyed his soul and and uh and i said to you there's no enemy closer to your soul than your own flesh the man in the mirror is always your greatest enemy see and so it requires that willingness to become a prisoner and that's why brother branham that's why brother branham well you're familiar i'll slow myself down trying to go book to book but you've read your bible enough to know that paul would start one letter and he would say paul an apostle of jesus christ remember that or he might say you know not by the will of god i mean not by the will of man but by the spirit of god see paul an apostle or you might say paul a servant and timothy our brother paul is you know he's got all of these entry introductions establishing his ministry but when he comes to the book of philemon he uses a term that he never uses anywhere else he says paul a prisoner and brother branham now paul talks about being a prisoner in different places in the in his letters that's for sure but this is the only letter he opens it up with that line brother branham talks about this in paul a prisoner and he says paul opened he said now brother and says now to be an apostle that you can't that's just god gotta do that god has to call that to be his servant you don't get to choose that's god calling you to be his servant he said but to be his prisoner you have to decide to do that you have to decide she said god has called me to be a member of his bride but are you a prisoner amen see and so brother branham's imagery then of the two swordsmen in this life and death struggle is so vivid when he's telling this story it's so vivid because it it in this position at at this stage of the duel where we are 20 21. i'm here to tell you something friends at this stage of the duel only two outcomes are possible here at the end time either the enemy is defeated or i'm defeated but compromise somewhere in the middle we're going to sign a treaty that's not possible we've arrived at the end and we've arrived at the locking of swords and i want you to be aware that today that's why i took paul's admonition in first corinthians that's why we talked about you can't buy or sell we already see it happening that's why we talk about the earthquakes that are taking place and they've already started that's why we correlated down through the ages all of those beast writers those powers and anointings of the white horse and red horse and black horse and the and the lion and the ox and the man and now it's knots to the pale horse and through the flying eagle it you understand that you you're on a journey god this whole time god life's not just been happening you're all your part brother branham said to god it's all a great drama and we're all involved in this we're all players in this and i'm here to tell you we've arrived at the locking of the swords that's how overrun the world is with wickedness the days of noah which had already struck the world the days of lot which had already struck the world but now we come to a convergence of those two times that jesus said is coming now that never happened in any age the bible told about how that there would be a time when satan would be the god of thee of the age that had never happened until now and here we are in the convergence of it all the days of noah complete the days of lot complete the next level surely surely is the tribulation period so i'm here to tell you something that friend the fight is ready to be decided in individuals the fight is now being decided by individuals they all went out of egypt we all followed the message they all passed through the red sea they all we all got baptized they all drank from that spiritual rock which was christ you've done that sunday after sunday after sunday but with not all of them was he well pleased some of them were overthrown in the wilderness i'm here to tell you you're in the time of locking swords and it's going to take a life of sincerity before god who's willing to be a prisoner willing to be a prisoner that means you're willing to lay aside the weights and the sins that death so easily beset us you're ready to run this race with patience we've arrived only one person's gonna walk away from this battle alive amen you get me amen the battle you're in at this junction of time six of the seven visions already history tribulation plagues and judgments and power grabs from the beast already happening in pre-tribulation the swords in your hand the enemy comes with his sword the seventh under group is on the scene who's going to win you can't both win that one you're in a duel with you're locked in a life and death struggle and there's not two people going to leave this battle alive only one person this is an epic battle it's a final battle and god is god says and i'm gonna i'm gonna pause with this because if i take another step i'll need more time and i i don't want to do that filling in my spirit just stop right here you've had you've heard enough but i want to give you this last point i still got you god has said to you god has notified you you're in the greatest battle ever ever fought there's never been a day like this day you're facing things your family's facing things humanity and all of its history has never encountered as a convergence the lid there's another one torn off of hell never happened till now demon powers streaming into the earth 200 million demon chargers held at the river euphrates released under the sixth trumpet because a vile has a has a has a correlation and allows the enemy to take another step and he goes after the jews and we have all of that holocaust in first and second woe and these woes have already passed and now there cometh one more woe and you're you're right in that last you're right up against the wall and the next event on the other side of this wall is global tribulation and before we push through that wall the bride takes off that's where we are friends it's an epic final battle and god's word tells me that he has sent a word in this day for you to feed on so you should be feeding on this but i mean come on let's be real humans i don't need a i don't need a show of hands but let the lord see you your heart i mean we have to ask ourselves the question is my diet more his word and his anointing and his fellowship and and or or is my or is more of my life my career my education my entertainments how do you expect to have a hand strong enough to hold this how do you expect to bring it to the heart of the enemy when when hollywood has your attention more than this your career has your attention more than this come on friends come on battle tabernacle what do we want around here we want a church with power and the demonstration of the holy spirit we want to see our lives filled with the holy ghost we want to see the the enemy put down and god says i've given you a word and i've not only sent you a word but i've given you an anointing on that word to make it live and to give you total victory and i hear i hear i don't know what you hear today but i hear his spirit speaking to my heart saying saying to me son or maybe you're a sister you say you hear the voice of god saying daughter or child the only i've sent you a word i've sent you an anointing i've told you the hour you're at now i've showed you what i want to do i've given you everything you're going to need the only decision to be made is yours because you already know mine there's no need to to ask god what he wants for your life he's already given it to you he's already told you in his word what is his will for your life so the only decision to be made is yours because you already know his let's stand have the musicians come back sweep over my soul for the andrew sweep over my soul holy spirit sweep over my soul why don't you bow your heads with me this morning now just be real humble i'm gonna let you go

you to be at ease in this world he simply won't he loves you too much and we we are so close and this epic duel is in its final throes right now and i want to have my sword plunged into his heart i i i i i'm tired of the enemy striking me down and the lord has to lift me up again and you know what if he if he strikes me down the lord must lift me up again and again and again and again that's why i have an advocate i'll i'll need that advocate until i get a body change and get rid of this little stinker i'm gonna need that advocate don't let anybody ever tell you that just because christ stepped forward and claimed the book and and he no longer no longer needs to intercede for ignorance don't ever let anybody tell you that means you don't need an advocate for your daily life you certainly do until this body is changed thank god that i have it thank god see say well but we've got the full word so did john so did paul they had the full word they had the abstract they had the jubilee that was israel's but they rejected it and it came on the gentiles they got it they had the jubilee 50 pentecost they had the abstract they had the token but pete but john says well you're still going to need an advocate because you're still going to make mistakes and we have an advocate and i'm so glad that he said that before he said he that's born of god does not commit sin because then it would think oh my goodness i'm not to be perfect no way this is based on this and he already said when if we sin we have an advocate over here it just means you know once you become a believer you're never going to not be a believer you're never going to turn i could never not be a believer because i've already i know too much i've seen too much i've experienced too much i've loved too much i've been loved too much hallelujah thanks be to god so let us go out of here today with faith assurance in our heart you saints who came to this altar and those of you who stood there because the altar is in your heart anyway i i get that i'm quite positive there were many of you rededicating didn't need to walk up here now go out of here today with assurance put bring your token into the face of the
