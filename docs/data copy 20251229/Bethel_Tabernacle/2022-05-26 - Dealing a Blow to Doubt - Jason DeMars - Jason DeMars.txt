the hearts of your people lord there's many needs lord i i lift my hand and say lord i have many needs lord would you come would you speak into lives and speak into hearts and would you change would you change us would you transform us would you encourage us would you correct us would you convict us lord we need you come and take your word and make it alive to our in our hearts a living reality we ask these things in jesus name amen all right well i stood you up now i'm going to sit you down god bless you thank you musicians i'm not going to go directly into the scripture you can pull my powerpoint up so you know when the i'm kind of looking at my title today and thinking my content doesn't exactly line up with my title so people are going to be like what why the title and i know ministers will do that sometimes and you're like still haven't figured out the connection but dealing a blow to doubt that's my desire tonight and when i look at this at this subject you'll see in the pattern of what i'm going through in the word i'm not working directly at it i'm working indirectly now understand when the devil comes to try to destroy you to try to bring doubt in your life how does he work he never works directly on you just don't believe god's word you say well i do so what does he do he brings circumstances he brings trials he brings emotions he brings things in your life that strike at your heart to elicit the wrong response right he's never his purpose is never to come directly at you he comes indirectly in order to frustrate god's plan so you know looking at the perspective of the world we almost can't get away from it the world is speaking constantly to us and you know we can use wisdom and avoid it as much as possible but really in today's modern world unless you want to go and be amish you can't you can't you can't avoid it there's the news there's billboards there's things in the grocery store there's things on your phone it's it's i'm not almost omnipresent continuously and there's a certain world view a perspective that's behind it and most 99 of it isn't from god whether it's right wing or left wing whether it's close to the truth or far away from the truth it's all and none of it is trying to get it put a bride in the rapture amen right and so more more times than not the faith that we're following the word that we're following people look at it from the perspective of the world and say that's stale that's dry performance that robs you of happiness and replaces it with robotic duty and that's the perspective of the world and that perspective of the world is just kind of continually dropping amen continually pecking at the shell to produce what doubt as believers filled with the holy ghost we we have the power to fight against that and yet even so we can be brought low we can be brought to a place of discouragement fear etc etc doesn't take away the fact that we're believers that we've had an experience with god and yet we can come to a low place where it feels like our faith is almost gone now take that and put that on young people who haven't yet had an experience with god that are just growing under the influence of godly parents a bible believing church and you see that the world is pecking hard at that protection that they have to get them out out from under that and especially if you haven't had yet an experience with christ where you have the holy ghost you can you will look at the joy and obedience of others and say that's just robotic duty that's not that's rules and regulations and you we have to be what mindful as parents as leaders how we're preaching how we're speaking to our children because it's not about it's not about duty and performance and you you lived up to it no it's about a relationship it's about delight it's about joy and in the middle of what the world is speaking to us we can our perspective can go like this and it can go and only be on this area right right around here mostly and i think the younger you are the more prone you are to that but we are all prone to it and we can get to this perspective where we see only the circumstances around us and the things that are going on inside of our own head and we we miss the big picture of what's happening and what what ends up happening is we're robbed of joy amen we're robbed of purpose things become and seem meaningless they seem purposeless they seem pointless and where is your faith then all of a sudden that connection between you and the lord is is broken experientially if you have the holy ghost it's never broken but yet experience we can come to this experience where we say i don't have the joy of my salvation i don't my heart isn't clean my mind isn't isn't pure i'm all messed up and we there thank god we can go to the lord we can repent we can seek his face and he'll heal us but we we can get ourselves in that position where you you miss that you're part of something incredible that's happening amen and you know it's the most epic adventure that has ever been written and you're a part of it and you know there's there's highs there's lows there's times where you feel there's great purpose and there's times where you feel vanity of vanities always meaningless meaningless [Applause] but in the end we have to have this in our hearts that we're part of a grand adventure that god is doing something and we understand by just by just the overview of scripture one life has terrific meaning one life has awesome meaning and i mean that in the real sense of the word incredible meaning we can't look at it and say well my my life doesn't have any meaning in the plan of god nonsense scripture is replete with what we would look and see certain people of who's that but scripture mentions them amen you know we don't know any even hardly anything about them maybe they just served paul or something like that yet it's me yet they're mentioned and it carried a great importance of something that god was doing we have incredible roles to play no i don't i i i can hear satan talk to you no you don't have a big role i'm nobody i'm not important tell the devil to shut up for a little bit and listen your life affects others and because your life affects others it affects the whole body of christ and there's a role in a position for you to play it doesn't matter if it's big or small b if your role is small be grateful there's less there's less pressure and yet you have a role you have a place you have a position and you can't be replaced by anyone if you could be then you wouldn't be then you wouldn't be here right but you're here you have faith you love god it's evidence according to the by if you believe the bible that he has promises for you he has purpose for you he has a plan for you and you're needed amen you're needed by us you're needed by god in in the whole cog of his plan there's roles that no one wants to play right when we look at scripture there's roles that you wouldn't want to play there's other roles that are people are longing to play ev all of it's needed all of it's necessary uh ii timothy 3 verse 12 12 tells us this yea and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution amen okay when he really changed the corner there what in the world is he talking about the word persecution it's the word dioco in greek and it literally means to be pursued so all that live godly in christ jesus will suffer what being pursued by who the devil what is what does that mean he's hunting yeah right first peter 5 8 says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil is a roaring lion walks about seeking whom he may devour satan is hunting satan and his minions both spiritual and natural are hunting god's elect and seeking to neutralize them in this great interdimensional warfare that's taking place all men and women of god from all of history were hunted by the devil to neutralize them so the question is are you being hunted have you had the sense in your life that you're continually being hunted by someone yeah and you're escaping but barely many times with injury amen we're promised that i repeat all men and women of god in all of history have been hunted by the devil in his minions all have been put in desperate circumstances difficult circumstances if you're if you're being hunted lift your hands with me right now say thank you lord i'm being hunted you're counted worthy trials and troubles are continually coming your way we're promised to have that we shouldn't shrink from it we we have been given everything that we have need of to fight this enemy everything pertaining to life and godliness has been put at our disposal the lord's laid it out in front of us so whatever you have need of to defeat the enemy you have it well i i don't think i do i might not think i do sometimes too but what i think and what the word says need to be in line and so the word says everything that pertains to life and godliness is at my disposal i have it and so i can fight the enemy i can be defeat the enemy everybody knows probably hear my testimony sometimes you're laid low to the point where you can't fight and you can't win that is what the body of christ is here for amen it's not here to beat each other down to push each other down it's to lift each other up to encourage one another to believe for someone who doesn't have the faith to believe that feels weak brother branham said what if god can lift me up to a place where i can believe for you and god will do the miracle for you how about we do that for one another let's believe let's believe for each other let's see let's see what god is doing the big the big picture let's believe for good things for one another for victory for one another let's call that out of each other not i didn't say kick it out of each other let's call it out of each other god has victory for you i mean look at look at all history this morning i think it was in what's that devotional that we always read no amy amy i'm asking amy streams in the desert i don't know if it was today or yesterday but job can you imagine how why do we remember job for his mountaintop experiences for the great wonderful things that have happened the lowest portion of his life that's what we remember him for and we thank the lord for that because what revelation god gave to you to me because of what job went through you might just be remembered for that the terrible thing that you went through and how god delivered you would you say amen that's okay i'll be i'll be glad to be remembered for the mighty thing that god did at my lowest point in my life john the baptist oh my let's raise up john the baptist for this great fantastic ministry how long was it just a short period of time introduces the messiah oh i've accomplished my ministry lord what grandeur awaits for me yep a prison and beheading that's not fair perhaps not in this life but in the life to come the reward that john the baptist has he's not going to be regretful of anything why we're trying to deal a blow to the devil because he will get you at your lowest point and he'll get you in a place of doubt doubting what's happened you're being hunted amen give thanks to the lord rejoice you know the bible says to rejoice when you're hunted when you're persecuted that's hard i can't do that humans can't do that but the spirit of god can do that amen you know look at look at isaiah he was born into a the the aristocracy should have been a rich guy with his rings and robes and beautiful home and all that stuff yet god calls him and what does he end up being at the end of his life he's cut in half he's got to hide from being pursued by a wicked king that was that was isaiah esteeming the riches of christ greater than the treasures of being an aristocrat don't have young people don't have this fantasy idea that being a christian means life is going to be easy it's not it isn't if you're going to choose to follow jesus christ you're going to face difficulties and you're going to be victorious and you're going to be happy in the midst of all that and you're going to be sad you're going to be you're going to have all the experiences but deep down on the inside of the inside there will be a strength to get up and keep going no matter what luke 6 26 says woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you for so did their fathers to the false prophets again i i think we think our life should always be filled with ease and things should always be positive or or in the worldly sense happy not in in the biblical sense happiness we'll talk about that later i'll just use that term loosely we just feel like our life should always be happy and always be easy an internal voice keeps telling us that it should be and when it isn't what are we disappointed so many times we set our expectations in a certain direction this is what i want my life to be this is what i want to achieve i do it too we all do it this is where i want to be at at certain certain age and this is where i want to go and this is the things that i want to have and this is what i want to do and then you don't have it and you feel disappointed frustrated upset hurt this that and the other thing people don't live up to our expectations you shouldn't i should i'll just let you know that now it's just don't tell anyone else people don't live up to your expectations because you expect a lot for more from them than they can achieve for you and i'm sorry sometimes it hurts i disappoint people there's no amen praise the lord man brother aaron wasn't here otherwise i had to go brother aaron's here aaron mcgeary that was encouraging thank you but i actually know that i've disappointed some of you i'm sure of that we we do that to each other where are our eyes where's our heart focused who's the one that can satisfy us the most who's the one that will never disappoint us the lord jesus and yet if our expectations are wrong we will have the lord jesus disappointing us right isn't that incredible we will have god as a disappointment because he hasn't met our expectations that's a that's that's a sad truth but he will he always is faithful to his word he cannot lie he always fulfills his promises many times he does it a lot differently than you think he does many times or maybe most of the time yeah god's not a vending machine [Music] it's not just put this in and get this out god has mysterious ways with us because he has he has an end in mind he has a purpose in mind and it's more than our comfort it's more than the easiness of life but it's being a reflection of jesus christ being made ready for a rapture we're living in an important special key hour in the history of the world and that's that we have to there has to be a people on the earth that would be perfect to make even people in past ages perfect isn't that amazing we have to have a faith that ca that can not only bring healing to a toothache but even goes further beyond any of those things to where our bodies can change and be careful not to get ahead of myself yeah i got way three pages ahead of myself so where did i leave off i left off we speak to ourselves and we think in such a way where we are demanding life must be easy for me god life has to be easy otherwise you're not faithful no he promised that it would not be he promised that he'd be hunted he promised that you would face trials he promised that you would suffer sign me up no there's a life there's a land beyond this we're not living for right now we're living for eternity there's a new body a new heaven and a new earth that we're going to too much we're focused right here and now a little too much yes we have the promises of god we know what god is doing today and yet our hearts need to be turning towards home how about this let's expect every promise of god in his word to be true for us put your name there in the promise and hold to that say it's not this this hasn't happened this hasn't come this hasn't come that's normal don't think that's don't think that you're an exception that's normal abraham had to wait 25 years for his promise amen and god allowed many things many things to throw that in abraham's face again and again and again and yet even despite the moments that we would look at the bible and say i think abraham was doubting god doesn't say that god doesn't leave that as the epitaph of abraham he believed god and you know what if he did that for abraham i believe he'll do that for you too we i have moments where i doubt i have moments where i'm struggling and god doesn't look and say there is jason the struggler there is jason who believed me and i have accounted to him for righteousness put your name there amen it's for you not just for abraham we should expect trials and difficulties because we're being hunted because there is a interdimensional battle that's taking place between god and and his angels and demons and it's particularly over god's people god's elect the place that god puts his presence he's fighting them constantly so we should we should expect and understand we will face those things it shouldn't be a reason for doubt it should be oh god's word's true he said i would suffer he said i would struggle he said i'd have trials man god is true i am oh my and i'm still i'm hanging onto his promises and i have victory what if i have struggles the rest of my life what if i suffer from something the rest of my life hold to god's unchanging hand don't lose confess his word i've seen incredible saints of god they they were dying of cancer the world would say they're dying of cancer what did they say the lord's my healer on their sick sick bed they said the lord's my healer i trust him i trust him i'm ready to go home whenever he's ready for me but i believe he's a healer do that do that believe believe to your dying breath in what is that in your hand in 1955 brother branham says notice notice him now he's a new man here he goes and now how the world will criticize you when you do this don't expect a flower bed expectations don't expect a flower bed of ease amen if everybody talked good about me and everything went fine didn't have any troubles and trials i'd go back to the altar and say lord what's the matter here there's something wrong for all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution that's the bible that's what jesus said my ephesians 6 10 this great war we're in finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might don't be discouraged by that if you say i'm i'm weak remember paul said when i'm weak then i'm strong when i'm weak then am i strong so rejoice in being weak that's what god said i can't explain the term when i'm weak that i'm strong but i believe it i believe that's the truth in my it out of weakness the power of god is manifested in my life so be strong in the lord and then the power of his might this is not talking about human strength it's not talking about being hercules or something this spiritual strength that looks very different the guys callus is on the knee put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places so this is where our fighting is it's against spiritual forces different levels and layers of authority in satan's kingdom we are fighting against them we have to remember that we have to be reminded of that this is the if i could say it this way this is the christian life this is the christian walk don't think it's on the mountaintop in the rocking chair with your cup of coffee having devotions in peace and quiet sure that that gives us strength but that's not where we're at every day if you are god bless you it's still not where we're at still not where you're at it's this is the christian life it is wrestling it is fighting not against flesh and blood but against demons demon powers so paul says and again i want to emphasize that point don't look at this while we have uh our our walk christian walk over here and then a small little piece of that is the spiritual warfare the whole thing that's the whole thing from start to finish is spiritual warfare wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins get about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god i want to tell you something that all of these weapons of warfare never fail we might have weapons in our warfare guns get jammed planes crash bombs don't explode not with the lord's armor it's infallible it always works you but you do have to take it you can't let it gather rust in the back room this is what we take every day it's not just well today's a day we're going out to tea i don't need it every day is a battle every day is a battle not you know it's not the the peaceful times and then the times of war the christian walk is always a time of war well i don't like that well get used to it because that's what it is you're not going to change it amen and paul finishes with this praying always praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints i believe that's not a changing of the subject i believe that's a summarization of what he's saying this is how you're going to battle praying always with all prayer isn't that repetitious we would never talk that way in normal conversation what is he trying to he's doing the the old hebrew duplicating a word in order to place a point of emphasis is okay you want to wrestle against the devil then pray always with all prayer in other words this should be a notable feature in your life you want to do battle with the enemy on your knees in prayer that's how you're going to fight you're going to battle him on your knees with the word of god fighting with supplications in the spirit and what and watching observing amen you know it says watch and pray so we're supposed to watch we're supposed to pay attention we're supposed to see what's happening around us in our lives and what's happening in believers lives around us so we can gossip about them so no so we can pray for them so we can stand with them in prayer because they're being beaten up against and your prayer is key to their victory say that again your prayer could actually be the very thing that would unlock victory in another believer's life next door or around the world and so don't treat it lightly when we're when we when we're standing with each other this the best way to stand with each other is to get on our knees let's can we set our vision of our christian life this way paul's trying to do that let's get our vision on the right thing again i think we live in in america and the advertisements and the things around us are you know what brother steve life should be so easy for you here let me offer this thing it should be easy this one this guy has this thing you should have that this this this place offers this oh you're light man see now your life can be easy and these are the thoughts that are being bombarded in our head constantly and so we say oh life should be easy yeah that's true and then we get trials and we say something's wrong no that's remember you're fighting against a hunter a spiritual hunter he's trying to he's trying to neutralize you he's trying to bring destruction to you he's trying to make you useless in in god's economy i don't believe he will no i don't believe he will he might be able to for a season but let's fight let's fight let's battle let's do it together let's come together let's fight that enemy together and let's beat him back for one another and then let's beat him again because he's going to keep coming at you unfortunately when we defeat him he doesn't die he comes back in a different way so what do we do we beat him again might get hurt we might have pain we got my little bloodshed but there's there's a balm in gilead there's healing yeah expect to be in a fight with the enemy if you expect to be in a fight with the enemy you'll be ready to fight you'll be engaged to fight and your your warfare the weapons of your warfare can never fail amen you might get you might get hit a few times but your weapons will never fail remember that isaiah 6 seems like i'm turning a corner a little bit but not completely in the year that king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon the throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly and one cried to another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke so here is an infinitely holy infinitely pure god appearing in his temple to isaiah and this is isaiah's response in verse 5 then said i woe is me this word woe is actually oi if you hear the old the yiddish expression oy vey that's what it's from it's a passionate cry of grief or despair he says woe is me oy oy vey for i am undone it means undone means to cease cause to cease to cut off to destroy to perish because i'm a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts so here we have the holiest man of god in israel he sees a vision of the presence of god and his response to the holiness of god is to say oh i'm ruined i'm a dead man because my lips and my life are unclean and so is everyone else's around me and that is the right response yeah that is this that is the response we should have when we see the presence of the lord romans 3 11 says there's none that understands there's none that seeks after god you probably think he started a whole new sermon what's he doing i'm trying to paint a picture i'll get there i hope no promises with the lord's help amen then flew verse 6 then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said lo this hath touched thy lips and thy iniquity is taken away and i sin purged also i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i send and who will go for us then said i here am i send me amen i think it's beautiful isaiah seeing god his response his response to seeing how holy how infinitely holy and pure god is is i'm falling i'm falling to pieces i'm disintegrating i'm finished that's the right response because what then what is god's response is don't worry there's a there's there's there's a resolution to this problem your sin will be purged he purged away his sin and then what he said now go and go and uh you know figure your life out get your life all figured out and then i'll come back no he purged him he made him holy and what did he say i'm sending you to be a mouthpiece and this is this is god's approach to man he shows his glory he reveals his power it's god seeking after man trying to dispel doubt trying to do a battle against doubt you'll see why god seeking man man's not seeking god is he we say oh i sought the lord i'm seeking god i'm trying to find god well once you are saved and filled with the holy spirit yes you can yeah before that your res the response of scripture is that there no no one is seeking after god there's none good no not one in order for you to even believe god has to open your heart amen to believe the to receive the word that's being spoken otherwise you would reject it you turn against it so god by his grace it's god offering giving working salvation salvation is a gift right amen for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any mention both so even your faith is not of you amen what does paul paul say he says i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me and so this is to me this is critical and understanding god has called you god has chosen you god has brought salvation to you you didn't bring yourself salvation you can't change your life you can't make sanctify yourself you can't fill yourself with the holy ghost that is the work of grace and if we if of course we on our end we have to make a choice we make a choice we make a decision we choose to serve the lord we choose to believe etc etc we have to do that we don't just sit as bumps on the log and doing nothing we are we respond to the grace of god but even our response we understand is god working in us both to will and to do of his good pleasure and so him him working in you you would never seek god unless god himself was drawing you to himself amen you would never you wouldn't do that no that's not in your that's not the nature that you're born with you're born in a nature that sins and rebels against god amen so when we're talking ab about god's work in your life that's between you and the lord we love to see it we love to rejoice over it but there's a secret place in your heart that god has worked i can't tell you if god has done it you but you know amen i can give you my testimony and you can doubt it that's fine go ahead don't bother me any i know what god has done for me you can respond to circumstances and say the message isn't true i don't believe it go ahead god has revealed it to me personally god has changed my life do i have a lot of failings yeah do i need to grow yes but do i keep getting up and keep moving forward by the with with his grace yes i do do i keep seeing him work yes i do do i keep doubting many times i do many times my faith is shaken many times i feel weak i'm just being i'm just being straight up with you because you have you experienced it too but there's something on the inside of the inside that just won't let go and regardless of the circumstances regardless of what i see regardless of how i feel how upset i am how frustrated i might be how whatever it might be i just hold on i just believe really i'll be honest i feel like i couldn't do anything else yeah because it isn't me i didn't call myself i chose myself to smoke marijuana and drink and party and play sports and cuss every other word that was what i chose god had a different plan for me and he started the work he's still working he'll finish it [Applause] salvation is of the lord amen not a man not from man it wasn't my faith that saved me oh what a weird thing to say over the pulpit but i think you understand based on what i said before it was the faith of the son of god that came into me by revelation as a gift from god amen that brought salvation in my life that brought an experience with god that brings his voice into my life sometimes i have to wait sometimes i don't hear anything for a long time and i wonder what's happening why why won't he speak to me why won't i'm trying i'm asking i'm begging you lord tell me what to do what's the next step and it's just and what do i do i keep waiting i keep holding on yeah i get frustrated yeah i say why isn't he speaking i'm i'm i'm i'm listening i'm waiting lord and he says wait a little longer amen amen it's god is approaching you he achieves salvation christ is the author of salvation not you amen every part of salvation even healing is the same yeah brother branham says that's the way this is i have heard but now i see that's the way genuine healing comes when it's revealed to you that he was wounded for your transgressions bruised for your iniquity and with his stripes you were healed listen when it's inspired to you to see his presence here of saint mark 11 or saint luke 17 30 that he's going to reveal himself in the last days among his people and huma human flesh like he did before sodom what is he saying even our healing comes by revelation when i want to ask you a question when brother branham spoke the squirrels into existence was that his idea well god says you have need of squirrels are you you're hunting what do you have need of squirrels so who initiated this thing did brother branham well brother branham was thinking about the scripture you say god told him you speak and then he spoke was it brother branham coming up with an idea and just throwing his voice out to whatever he wanted to no god spoke god dealt god worked he spoke it came the same thing goes for you for our healing i can't heal myself yet brother branham says what's inside of me i already have it inside of me to bring healing to myself and yet can i activate that potentially but god has to quicken it i mean you see that here that's the way genuine healing comes when it's revealed to you that he was wounded for your transgressions when it's inspired to you see amen we can try to work ourselves into that brother branham talks about that they've come to the altar they've had two gallons of oil poured on their heads they've gotten nothing but then they came to brother branham's meeting and the spirit of the lord revealed it to that person and revealed it to his prophet they were healed that was the end of it what was it was it because brother branham was so special well maybe part of it because that spirit of elijah was working in a prophetic office to vindicate the word but i'm going to tell you what it was is they got a revelation and brother branham said what was it your faith made contact with him where did you get your faith from him amen yeah so many stories you know you could go on and on it was god's grace that's when you when you have faith god's grace has been extended to you amen you can pray and believe for healing brother there's examples in brother branham's messages we've prayed for this sister she's just sat there she sat in the wheelchair the lord's decided not to heal her yeah and and there there she is her faith is just as strong so sometimes and he talks about i think there's another family that he talks about that they prayed for and the lord didn't heal him he says sometimes it takes faith to be stronger in those circumstances when you don't get healed in that moment because they're continuing on in faith regardless of what they see they still believe regardless of their circumstances regardless of what strikes their eyes they say i believe lord i'm healed thank you lord all right man i'm i should close but i just can't do that right now if you want to leave just go but if it's something that's valuable to you then stick around psalms 34 7 4 we won't stay till after midnight delight thyself also in the lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart think for a minute about going to the grand canyon why did you go to the grand canyon was it to build your self-esteem no why did you go to the grand canyon because you wanted to see something incredible you wanted to experience that and you know i've been i've been there i could explain to you why it's amazing but until you've gone there personally you really can't grasp the grandeur and and how incredible the grand canyon is so bring that bring that back to the lord why do you go to the lord why do you worship the lord it should be to experience the grander grandeur and the beauty of god right now you should be delighting in how great he is and when you get lost and how great and how beautiful and how awesome god is guess what guess what happens next something amazing happens next you get happy you do you get happy when you see the grand canyon do you see a bunch of depressed people there no they're excited to see the grand canyon no so when you come to the lord when you worship him the grand canyon could disappoint you it's possible i'm not sure how but okay it's possible but coming to the lord in with this delight and desire in our heart it'll never disappoint amen there'll never be any disappointment whatsoever this verse when i when i first got saved i thought this verse if i delight myself in the lord i'll get what i want so and then i i as a philosopher i started thinking and i thought that's a catch-22 isn't it because if i really delight myself in the lord the desires of my heart will change to be reflective of god's desires and then this cycle of happiness will take place this cycle of joy will take place even in the things that god gives us think about this if you if you go and you spend all kinds of time and money to get a present for the person you love and you give it to them and their reaction is i mean uh i don't i just rather have time with you you're like what what i mean i'm glad you want to have time with me but or if you do like amber does when she gets a present screams and shouts and goes crazy cries and tony has the biggest smile on his face ever and he might even be laughing and he's for sure videoing but that's the response i believe that the lord when he gives us good things when he gives us blessings we rejoice but be careful don't get so focused on the gift that you forget the giver but even so the gifts that god gives rejoice give him thanks you know this this uh again we don't major well we just should if you're not rejoicing you should be rejoicing all the time if you're not rejoicing then you must not have the holy ghost no there's ups and downs there's difficulties there's trials there's there's times of being still and knowing that he's god and there's times and shouting and dancing and rejoicing in the lord all those things but a dis what is a desire right delight yourself in the lord he'll give you the desire of your heart there's a desire there's something in us that we're seeking after amen and if we understand this verse correctly we really should be seeking after him and his righteousness and then all these things will be added to you our hearts will be filled and so that delight so where there's a desire for god in our hearts there should be if you have the holy ghost you have a passionate desire for god in your heart you should it goes sometimes we go up and down and usually we when that desire goes down there's something not right and we've got to make it right we've got to get right with the lord but there'll be a great desire and it can be manifested in different ways but a real desire overflow for god overflows in being delighted in him overflows in joy c.s lewis said it like this our desires are not too strong but too weak we are half-hearted creatures fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered to us like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what it means by the offer of a holiday at the sea we're far too easily pleased going after the things of the world the desires of the world we understand the fruit of that it doesn't take long to research and find people that have reached the pinnacle of success what what what is you reach the pinnacle of success in the nba okay what do you want next do it again next year if you don't do it again next year then what you're frustrated look at the ridiculous situation of johnny depp poor guy he's destroyed his life not because he put his desires in the right place or he had too many desires they were so perverted after the things of the world reached the pinnacle of success rich his wealth and what does he have to do in order to survive the day he has to numb himself with drugs and drink okay so if you want to achieve that success of the world just understand what the results are i think it was uh i have this down further but i'm going to bring this here gk chesterton says meaninglessness does not come from being weary of pain meaninglessness comes from being weary of pleasure in other words people have experienced all the pleasures of life everything that the devil has to offer and they come to this realization that doesn't satisfy that is the most soul life mind numbingly painful thing a person in this world could experience don't go there don't seek after those things they can never satisfy the only thing that can satisfy is our lord look at deuteronomy 28 and we're going to read 45-48 i'm mindful of time i'm not going to wear you out too bad i know i'll warn you out but i won't wear you out too bad moreover all these curses shall come upon me and shall pursue thee and overtake thee till thou be destroyed because thou harken us not unto the voice of the lord thy god to keep his commandments and his statues which he commanded thee and they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder and upon thy seed forever because look at this verse because thou service not the lord thy god with joyfulness and with gladness of heart for the abundance of all things therefore it shalt thou serve thine enemies which the lord shall send against thee in hunger and in thirst and in nakedness and in want of all things and he should put a yoke of iron upon thy neck until he have destroyed thee think of these things not in the natural sense think of it in the spiritual sense we're not under a natural thing like the jews were a natural blessing we're thinking of spiritual blessings but look at what the reason he says he was going to bring these curses upon them was because they didn't serve the lord god with joyfulness and with gladness of heart so what does that mean god wanted them to put their delight in him he wanted to see them full of joy he wanted to see them happy rejoicing in his blessings in his strength in his salvation in his presence he didn't want to see them walking around sad broken-hearted upset he wanted them to be happy brother branham says this in the resurrection resurrection of jesus 1956 god don't want you to be frowning god wants you to be happy the human heart was made to be happy worry will cause cancer temper will cause cancer don't never be upset just walk in his love amen knowing that you're walking in him and nothing can harm you there's nothing can harm you there's neither powers things present things future nothing can separate us from him we're in him and we never come in by our own will he by choice elected us and brought us into him amen so it's his business to take care of what he's took himself no man can pluck them from my father's hand because he's the greatest of all of them amen it's the father who takes care of us who's got any more power than god amen musicians if you want to come john piper writes this god is not worshiped where he is not treasured and enjoyed treasure praise is not an alternative to joy but the expression of joy not to enjoy god is to dishonor him to say to him that something else satisfies you more is the op opposite of worship it is sacrilege my set this vision for yourself we talked about three different things i i i wanted to dissolve your doubts i wanted you to see god has a plan for you god has a purpose for you he's working regardless of the trials tribulations that's what you should expect that's what you should understand because you're in a you're in a cosmic battle amen with with the enemy and he's hunting you he's trying to to to neutralize you but the fact that you have faith and god is working you should understand he started it you might be at a high point you might be at a low point he promised he will finish it [Music] how will it come probably with lots of ups and downs probably through lots of trials probably guaranteed victory because he is working and he does he never fails his armor never fails and remember in all of these things make god your delight don't make other things don't make the party the fun with friends that's that's those things are great when they come but what if you're all alone like daniel what if it's just you and god make god your delight remember friends will fail you people will fail you they won't satisfy that thing you're longing for in your heart only god will satisfy that need in your heart don't seek after those things first seek the lord put your delight in him and he'll provide the things you have need of but put him first and remember he wants you to be happy he wants you to be joyful but he wants you to place it put it in the right things [Music] proverbs 3 5 says trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths brother branham says it's because that man was made up in the beginning not to try to shift for himself for do things on his own in other words a man was made to rely completely upon god that's the reason we're likened unto lambs or sheep a sheep cannot lead himself he has to have a leader and the holy spirit is supposed to lead us so man is made that way god wants us to put our delight in him trust him and be led by him surrender yourself to him you have to you have you have to continually that's not just a one-time thing i've surrendered myself to the lord over and over and over again and then i get going on a thing in my mind i think oh i set my mind towards this thing and oh maybe it was a dream i dream a a desire i had or something like that lay it down lay down your plans lay down your dreams and say lord i'm yours lead me guide me i will trust you i will not lean to my own understanding we want that we want to we want our hearts want to be happy that's where you're going to find joy that's where you're going to find peace that's where you're going to find strength amen let's stand heavenly father we just come before you lord
