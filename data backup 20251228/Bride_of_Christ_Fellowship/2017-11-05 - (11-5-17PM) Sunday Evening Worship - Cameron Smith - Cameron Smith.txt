out again this evening or bless you richly for your sacrifices game time the suitor here which way to go speak to us and be gracious unto us but yet so once again to privilege and honor the Saints you know what God's doing and take what for the sisters at work there's many souls of saving we trust the Lord continue and his movement every life direction that Mexican restaurant really kind of a good star your once again the most important eating that we do so if we have your Bibles like stand for the reading of the word God's grace I think I'm gonna work I'm gonna work with our lives again this evening I think that be be favorable I got a lot of things Lord just seems a reveal but I appreciate them for that but I might be trying to squeeze a little bit much into tonight's sermon we don't want to be tremendously long but we do want to just bring your mind to a little bit of settlement who you are in Christ this evening we can and we'll see what the Lord would do with this if we go this direction here not perhaps wanting to bring anything but yeah just wanting to allow the Lord to have his way with us and perhaps he'll he'll continue with that little corn and oil and wine smile from this morning amen so I hope you got a little bit about oil and wine this evening and tonight we want to preach some messages as a I preached this at home just recently and it was it was it was such a blessing to them that they kind of pushed me to keep on preaching on preached several sermons on it here but yet one about Hebrews 10 verse 9 will work with a little title tonight what sin if we can and will try to bridge these things for you here the night and verse he says that says then said he lo I come to do thy will o God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for all amen so how many offerings did it take to set you free just once once today and then keep going there we've got to keep doing this he says once for all amen we'll get to this by the grace of God 11 verse it says in every priest and if daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins alright but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified hallelujah so what'd he say by just one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified nah I don't know how free do you feeling Lord a lot of feel pretty clean like like a clean little lily amen so tonight we're gonna bow our heads for word of Prayer work with this little idea our most precious beloved or Jesus Christ is in order certainly just a little bit of an idea here tonight and we just pray oh god you'd add your inspiration anointing to this sermon once again Lord and order the Saints here have in need of you Lord they fell in love with you they want to serve you Lord they believe o God that they're the called and chosen of this generation or those who are called not just righteous Oh God but they're called holy Lord in order it was you that did all the work so God that it took to get us there we trust tonight Oh God that you just speak to us Oh God just a little simple message but Lord we just pray add your blessing to it Lord and order you help bring some some more victory to our lives Oh God as we look Oh God that are many challenges that we face Oh God so many times Oh God we're just right there with the Prophet he said he said we backslide many times in a day but yet Lord even though there be backslidings we understand Lord that there's a god who's greater than all those things nor we're just asking tonight that you just encourage us and cheer us up O God raised us higher in your word O God that we might be able to be more effective for you in all the places that you send us we just love you and ask you to have your way now named Lord Jesus Christ Church says together a man you may be seated so tonight we're gonna work with this title if we can what sin and I want to start by reading just a little quotation for you and some of it be familiar for you in question and answers here we want to jump down here and question answer is fifty nine and just this will give us a nice little burst a little start here and I asked my church when I was preaching this I said okay how much of you how many of you sin and I had several hands went up and and by the grace of God I said let's read this quotation here so the question is this and I'm so glad that somebody asked this it's the only time I see it brought forth in the message in question answers and so for the very beautiful statement but do Christians sin all right so what does your prophet say absolutely No so how many here are Christians and I let's get to this he says he cannot sin I know there's a resentment to that that's what that's what we do and I know this will sit in a church service and and it'll get some of those things I said you you sinned and when you get the answer absolutely not does something raise up a little bit in you a little resentment maybe little your prophet said he said well we'll just go to first John three and see what the scripture says a Christian does not sin did you ever see a black white bird or a white black bird did you ever see a drunk sober man no you never did see a sinner st. either there's no such a thing brother say sir right now in this room there's no such thing as a sinner Saint here you're either a sinner or a saint since now if this gets a little touchy you just put a lot of balm in you know and it will cure up just in a little bit now and that's the direction we're aiming to go tonight we just want to allow the Word of God and the message to bring a little statement to try to raise us up brother sister we can have confidence in who we are amen I ran into a quote I won't have it tonight but your prophet said I believe in 57 Hebrew sir he said God can only work through that which is perfect if God's going to answer your prayer it's going to be have to be because you're perfect but if you don't believe you're perfect then how is God going to answer your prayer alright now what is it about you that makes you perfect it's the way you dress the way you think all these other things know there's only one thing that will make you perfect and that is the perfect sacrifice remember as we read that scripture he died once and for all the blood of Jesus Christ was so powerful it only took him going on the cross a long time and when he went on that cross and he died for man since in the blood struck the mercy seat and brother/sister the Church of the Living God has been a free entity ever since amen now notice of course this is where we begin to move with this in first John 3:8 it says he that committeth sin is of the devil all right so when we look say oh I'm such a worthless sinner I'm such a miserable sinner well he that committeth sin is of the devil so notice for the devil sinneth from the beginning now I like this for this purpose the Son of God was manifested so because Satan was the one who brought forth and a sin and for what that was that was the whole purpose God allowed him to come forth so on so the purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil so God let all this sin come in the world he let all those rotten days that you serve the devil come in so that one day you could find Jesus Christ and lives the purpose of you finding him was so that he could one destroy the works of the devil in your life hallelujah he led captivity captive and not he gave gifts unto man it was God's desire that what he would destroy captivity to his children and we get a little bit farther and he says whosoever is born of God I commit sin so this is why the devil fights your holy ghost experience so hard this is why he'll sit there and and continually tell you things you're not hallelujah and what I'll tell you what brother sister if we ain't got the Holy Ghost let's get busy hallelujah let's let's labor to enter into his resting in and we see that what if you are born of God you cannot commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God now we're going to take this in a direction tonight because I want you to see how much power this sacrifice of Jesus Christ has made in your life and once again I would like to bring it back in the Old Testament start showing you a few things here but notice so much if you are born of the Spirit of God how many say oh I've got the Holy Ghost there's at some point in time brother sister you have to recognize what you have I mean it ain't a guessing game to get in this rapture you have to what you have to look at what Christ has done see the change in your life thank God for that woman who said he said I'm not what I want to be I'm not what I ought to be but praise God I'm not what I used to be amen because look at the changer life by the blood of Jesus Christ he meant to begin to transform lives you know brother sister most of us in the message we don't even struggle with a lot of those deeper darker sins but what we're finding these little foxes that spoil the vine but you know what I love about God God never allows sin to be anything less than what sin is most of us won't will this be will be in these touchy little things and what you'll actually find that in your experience it condemns you the same way that did well that's beautiful because God made it so you would never have an opportunity outside of fact to hold on to his blood hallelujah now notice this we see in first Corinthians 12:12 it says for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body all right whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into that one spirit for the body is not one member but many amen now let me ask you whose body is that it's the body mythical body of Jesus Christ so let me ask you is the body of Jesus Christ a sinful body it cannot be a sinful body now hold on now let's look so we see in question answers again he says no more sin the sin question settled that's the reason sin looks so dirty to a Christian notice the nature change that comes on you right you'll start looking at sin and it seems so dirty all the time right he said that's why women out here wear these shorts on looks so dirty to a Christian that's why vulgarity there's a lot of dirty things that's why smoking drinking gambling all this on uncensored programs on television all that stuff seems filth wha you of a different Kingdom hallelujah what's got you here on a Sunday night amen because what you're not desiring filth or any of those things you want to hear the word of God amen we start identifying ourselves and say yes there is an mercy seat right here that the Lord's took precedence on amen now notice here he says you're born into the kingdom of God and sealed by the Holy Ghost until the day of your Redemption Amen Satan cannot take you up it's impossible he that's born of God commits no sin for he can't sin the seed of God is in him and he can't sin he cannot sin as long as that Holy Ghost is in there he takes every desire of sin away from you amen you can't sin there's no more desire now this is where the devil begins to fight you because so many times we find ourselves getting into these little things we're where we find ourselves sitting in certain ways right just little habits or other things like that and brother/sister when you see that and then we try to exclude ourselves from this provision we look and say well I'm not perfect I guess I'm not a I guess I'm not I don't have the Holy Ghost well whoever said that the legalism was the Holy Ghost notice he says the desire to sin he doesn't say that you're perfect in your flesh all right we're gonna get some of these things let's continue with this idea in Romans 4:4 says now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt all right so if we're trying to do it legally with legalistic manners what the reward is not grace buts debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as david also described the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works a true child of God will have righteousness imputed on him without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered omok now look at the severity of iniquity iniquity is when you know something's wrong and you do it anyway you know it's wrong and you did it and God's blood is so strong when you desire to do it and you even earlier today even yesterday even the day before that there was a blood brother sister have you been born body that will hold you because the seed remaineth in you hallelujah brother sister when you look at this this is why we were so down so many times it's a constant battle of trying to make this thing serve God hallelujah you don't want to it all want you to praise God you don't want you to say the name of Jesus Christ but the name of Jesus Christ is let's save you to begin with amen no I'm going to take a little turn here because I want this to change your mind completely when you see what the Prophet said and then we're going to jump into some things okay now so notice this there are people I pray that we should be in this room right now and the next time that we do something wicked and we say Oh God I knew I shouldn't have done that but I did it and we could say go God forgive me for and just like that it's in the sea of forgetfulness that's what he died for it's already covered it's gone he never seen anyway but what right now we're supposed to be having dominion over this this this serpent right here you know that God gave you this serpent so you can have Dominion every now and then it's an everyday fight I know there's some times we don't do so well but brother sister we're doing everything in our potential and who we've been called to be to destroy the works of the devil on this thing you know what amen you know what he gives us a headache half the time we ought to be giving him some headache too right so notice blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness it's your faith that will put you in that place hallelujah when you fall brother sister you have an advocate in the father now look at this so he continues here and we're going to jump in F right after this it says once again our last quotation from here I believe it says for by one spirit we are all baptized into one body and are free from sin and we cannot sin there is an atonement waiting for us and if there still a desire in your hearts our sin you have never been baptized into that body because you are dead and your life is hidden Christ or God and sealed by the Holy Ghost Christians don't sin notice they make mistakes hallelujah there's where we come in alright so that changes everything where our idea mentally is I must be perfect in every single little thing I do we have the Prophet even coming forward and saying that Christians will make mistakes I look it up he's still saying that in 65 God forgive me I made some mistakes hallelujah but notice they they make mistakes but they don't sin amen that's the reason they don't for he cannot sin if the Holy Ghost is in you he's looking at the sacrifice he's looking at the Tok in the past when I see the Blood I will pass over you now let's get this somewhere real quick he says how can I if I go down through the city here and the mayor of the city says mr. Branum I know that you've made sick calls there's speed limits the highest speed limit in the city is about 30 miles an hour but I'm giving you permission to run 90 if you want to because I have faith in you that you wouldn't do it unless you had an emergency call or somebody dying yonder in Iraq and I'll give you permission as the mayor of this city that you can run any red light do whatever you want to just go right off how could a little two-bit officer ever arrest me out here making 40 mi of 40 miles an hour in a 30 mile zone he can't I cannot break any speed laws in this city because why I'm above the speed laws amen I hope you see it now this ain't talking about when you drive home tonight brothers sisters but catch the idea of what is stated here if the mayor of the city said that you because of your position because of what he gave you authority to do he said you can go ahead and break all those laws because I know that you don't desire to do it and you wouldn't do it just to do it anybody's sin because it's fun I know it shows that something has taken place in your life brother sister no longer are the filth of the flesh your pleasures but you find that what your pleasure is to do the will of the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah so notice the idea is that you're above the law of the land cuz why you're under the law of the word so think about that and the next time you drive a little fast oh god help me right look at that you can't even break any speed limits anyway but this is the thing we don't do it because it's willfully fun something we love to do we want to be like the book of Romans and obey the laws of the lane only we want to do our best amen but those every little falters that say you're done you're going to help in us now I want to take this with a little bit direction with you because I want you to see the the unlimited potential that you have as a sinless being of God you got the Holy Ghost or maybe coconuts amen notice you I want you to see this and Hebrews 9:11 he said but Christ because being a come a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is a say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us he only did it how many times or God over notice for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the Eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God purge your conscience from dead works to serve the Living God so notice the purpose I have an underline there that Lodge the blood of bulls and goats it was so powerful remember the life was in the blood now it ain't like you're God's blood as we see down here but look at this he could sanctify to the purifying of the flesh think about that once a year coming up on the day of atonement sacrificing those goats and what just by following that law that God gave them they went out free but look at this blood of Jesus Christ cuz how much more the blood of Jesus Christ could purge your conscience from dead works to serve the Living God the purpose of the blood of Christ was what not that he would just take away your flat out your sins but what that it would actually do a makeover on your conscience were you no longer desire to do dead words but while you're home move us to do God himself alright now notice this we're going to get to this year it Redeemer Redemption 55 it says there he died and you feel the pains of Calvary what he did he says brother the reason that man went out with the same thought he had coming in the same desire to sin here's why it was the life is in the blood is that right and the life of an animal when the spirit went out of the life it could not come back and mingle with the human spirit because it was the life of an animal call it who you he says therefore the desire became the same he went back out when we come into the house of God and we go right back out say glory to God another weakest sinan for me we're no different than the denominations and Catholicism and all these things right because it's a Catholicism that mazes on the idea of the Eucharist you eat Christ right so ah now you're all right but you got to come back in the morning eat again because it's transubstantiation it transforms under the literal body of Jesus Christ right that's what they believe but brother sister our sacrifice was made 2,000 years ago hallelujah it was not about the blood of an animal it was the blood of God Himself all the blood of Jesus Christ and the power thereof Oh mom hallelujah so notice it says the desire became the same when he went back how the animal life went away the blood cell was broke up but when a man lays his hands upon the blood of Jesus what did you lay your hand on right that's what people do they lay their hands on the on the head of William Branham and say this is my god and then when they start finding out that brother branham wasn't perfect when they start seeing that he could exaggerate a little bit and do do a few of these things around there then what all of a sudden their confidence is destroyed about what they're worshipping but the purpose of the messenger was to take the people to Christ so notice it says but when a man raised his hands upon the blood of Jesus the head of Jesus confessing his sin when that blood cell was broke it was the Holy Spirit of Christ Jesus comes back upon the man and takes all sin and desire away from his heart that's what we're looking for with the baptism of the Holy Ghost God take away the desire he meant and he's perfectly redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ and all the sin question is settled hallelujah Navy brother sister Rita slow hands right back on Christ amen I had said that sacrifice desire the world that's here because there's some there's a flavor for everybody now they're making hundreds and hundreds of new sports all the time hallelujah they're making every entertainment you can think of what because brothers just the only it's gonna make it out of here as bride because the seed cannot be entertained by anything else it wants to be entertained by the world but it don't matter they say how do you do it cam I don't you I like I said I told the story we're at church already and then at work I went there and the biggest anomaly of the year was the fact that they found out I didn't have a TV in my house and my boss came up and he's like is there's a huge spectacle I was sure in the job trailer it was crazy everybody's just like the father I didn't have a TV so anyway he comes with me he's like you're joking weren't you I said no no I wasn't joking at all though I said I said you know just said you know it's on that TV I said I got a I got a taste for a different civilization right now I say God by the Holy Ghost I said gosh that is what God is trying to do see god this doesn't want to change your legalisms God wants to come inside of you and then you desire but nature is different and you don't even desire those things no more I said when you look at that TV all sets on there's things to show you have a desire for the realm of hell they looked at me he's like Oh didn't know what to do with that one so he walked away well then an hour later he comes back around he said so cama you know I got it I got TV you know I know I know you do Josh Phegley do so but you know I I kind of watch the Discovery Channel and you know my kids like you know National Geographic I said that's okay I said I'm talking about it a nature change I said something that just completely revolutionized the way you think he's like okay okay so he walked up again he come to me three times in the same day hey come up he said it's a camera just want to tell you you know yeah you'll have a TV you know he's like that's won't let you know that you know yeah ever how's it going to I just wanna let you know you know I mean TVs really not all that bad you know it's not that bad at all he said I just well let you know you know if you you ever desire to watch TV you know you can come over and watch TV with me and my family I said Josh I'm the head of my house I want to get TV I bring a TV in my house but I said I'm telling you that the love of Jesus Christ is greater I felt like I had my three showdowns and I was done after that but but anyway but you know it's so crazy that we thing different but that's what it is you see brother sister the thoughts we have of sin have completely changed over because we realized that our sin question is settled and I don't desire to have a TV in my house I desire to do a lot of those things of the world don't have it I have a hard time putting my kids in basketball and you know what we do you know they're wearing pants anyway right oh that's okay they can play all right I figure we can be a light somehow we got to get amongst the world brother sister not be not in friendship with the world is the only entity with God but bro sis real shine light I loo you we don't need to look coldish we need to look completely full of agape love all right so notice this so all you do is you put your hand on Jesus Christ and what the same question is settled get the Holy Ghost so I want you to see this as we begin to bridge this because I want you to see how powerful this is for seal he says now they were God's lowercase G there and then if you become born in the family of your family name you are a son and a part of your father and then when sin came in we found out the man crossed the chasm and the blood of bulls and goats covered but did not remit until the real bleach came that could take the stain of sin and break it completely to pieces and send it back upon its original pervert earth at was Satan you know where all your sins have you've got the Holy Ghost they went right back to Satan you know who what that means that means they were his identification they were his sin they never had nothing to do with you so when it got back to Satan he waits his time of eternal annihilation now that shows what we believe we believe that you will absolutely be done completely away in an island and the church said Amen hallelujah I believe that sin will be broke up and when it's confessed upon the basis of the blood of Jesus Christ it's like dropping a drop of black ink and a bunch of Clorox bleach it just breaks it into the chemicals and sends it plumb back to where it came from that's sin brother sister maybe you did earlier there when you laid that confession out say God forgive me I think I'll for me done this blood it went back all the way to them right back to that devil where it come from hallelujah he couldn't see it if he wanted to Duncan oh ma and that's the way the blood of Jesus Christ does then that sets a man across the chasm again as a son of God and then he becomes why he's the creative power of God is in him and at least whenever God can command it to be done it'll be done when we get back look at if you're on the right side of the chasm the cause of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost proves he you've got the seed notice he says that when Moses under the blood of bulls when he met that lights the pillar fire in that burning bush and he stood down there on a commission God had given and he was a prophet and when the word of the Lord came to him he spoke and even things created by the word notice this see and now if it'll do that under that the blood of bulls what a out the blood of Jesus see where we're getting you got the Holy Ghost that opens up a big big possibility now doesn't it so notice he says what about the blood of Jesus not covered but remitted it all together there's no it's not covered its remitted that means God has accepted in it's done away with and you stand in the presence of God as a redeemed son now see the church is far beyond its standard of living and I think too many times were probing instead of really coming out and facing the issue the City issue we'd rather talk about a spoken word talk about that brother/sister spoken word wasn't it was a possibility through the shed blood of bulls and goats let flies come forth it came from a sacrifice of bulls and goats so what is it now look at now he states it's the problem we're living what he says beyond but below our standard of living all right and what instead of coming out and facing the issue does the blood of Jesus Christ really cover my sins we just stay there in this confusion okay in my Center am I not a sinner in my seat or am I not seed what am i we've got to get to a place that we can boldly say I'm a son of God now short by my love I'll short by my fruit I short by everything I am hallelujah so notice he says and finishing this and now notice that there's something wrong somewhere in the churches and I think it's the denominational systems that's twisted the people's mind so forth until they don't know how to do it that's right but we're promised that it would be revealed that is the potential that the blood opens up it brings you back to the the word Amen the spoken word is the original seed brother sister we were called what not to go just back to Pentecost we were called to go all the way back to Eden amen hallelujah so look at the power of the blood of a boar goat think about that Sun stand still Joshua said who's Jesus Christ he'd be I'll say I'm Joshua Jehovah Savior but what he did not know the name he was not able to recognize the future coming of Christ but just knowing that he was under that sacrifice just knowing his position in the commission from the from God Almighty he was able to what look at his sacrifice this is where it is brother sister are we looking at our sacrifice he could look at his sacrifice and say in the name of Jesus Christ the Son of God today Hebrews 10 one for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshipers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins oh wow that was the purpose of a sacrifice to take away your conscience of sins you deliver the book of Acts it says in great grace was upon them all your grace is unmerited favor oh you know when the Holy Ghost found them they were 100% perfect then why they need great grace they didn't just be grace they need great grace hallelujah so he says but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year you notice that it's under the sacrifice of bulls and goats that there has to be a remembrance of sins and so many times you see we remember all of our sins almost element just as I appreciate dad told I said I still remember when I was five years old and I was lied about having a talking a cockatiel I still remember that I was five years old trying to win her in him it was wrong but I still remember that sin and there it sits I'm 38 years old that's 33 years ago I said God when I accepted Christ said God forgive me everything maybe now and then that little thing pops right up on us five years old and you know how that is if you remember things that fine he remember the whole lot of things but what your prophet said we're not like God he said God he said he can what he said he can forgive and forget but we because we're in a different dimension we cannot forgive and forget hallelujah but when we look at this word we should be watching it's setting or the basis of Jesus Christ shed blood at Calvary amen because what it was impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins the blood of Jesus Christ is different notice God hiding himself and simplicity and revealing himself in the same he says if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will shall be given to you where's the church standing at let there be frogs and there wasn't a frog in the country in an hour's time there were ten foot deep in places what was it it God the Creator hiding himself in a simple man notice this I want to ask you something if the blood of a ball or a goat be used for a bleach which can only cover could put a man in position to speak the creative Word of God and bring flies into existence why would you stumble at the bleach of Jesus Christ's blood who could speak a squirrel or something into existence he said don't you do it don't stumble over simplicity believe that he still remains God o my pardon of sin oh how I wish I could then mark 11:22 have you Satan this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you that what you said will come to pass oh you can have what you said how powerful we see that the blood of bulls and goats it could put a man in a position to speak creative word what about the blood of Jesus Christ you see I'm saying when's the last time you spoke something into existence and here's the thing this is not it we're not chasing power or it's actually all we are I'm not here to say who is who's not oh that I don't know but brother sister look at what he says he said back here he said you see the people have been taught wrong I don't know what her idea of the squeeze is and all these things like that if we're just gonna gather well we're all gonna meet at brother Jesse's house well write it right through brother Jesse takes through brother brother branham through a lot and there's all you can whole you take it all the way back through the word there's five identifications of the third ball he said there's an hour that God's going to do some really great things for us hallelujah God is going to exorcise himself through his children but you notice how he's talking about the sacrifice and he's talking about how even people with a blood of bulls and goats mentality and revelation could what bring forth all of God's abilities on the scene then what about Jesus Christ blood here this we say Oh God I could just figure it out he says don't you stumble over simplicity let's read another one God item something simplicity says now the blood of bulls and goats could give power given power to Moses to go out there by the commission of God and stretch forth that Ron say let there come flies he had the Word of God and he spoke that word and when he did it become from God's thought a word is a thought expressed and so then when God thought it and put it in Moses his mind and he spoke it it become a word did you read that he said God thought it and put it in Moses mind to speak it where is the church that will say but we have the mind of Christ we brother/sister should have such an experience with the law that if God we would even have a thought come over us and it would say something to the word we would go right with it because it's the same thing under the blood of bulls and goats God could put a thought right in his mind Moses could think it Moses could speak it and God would bring it forth oh how he wants our minds to be watch indeed ouch meets for the Masters use he says Moses turned around went back maybe did another fly in the country an hour from then maybe one old green fly begin the bus around and a half hour there's ten pounds per square yard what was it the creative word of god that was spoke by the lips of a mortal man what's the matter with the church today with the pastors today well it's just the pastor's or the big name preachers or this but no no it's the church in every place there's a church was a local body right there within that body is the ability to have nine spiritual gifts to have the fivefold ministry to have what all those things promised of God manifesting right there so notice what's the matter with the church there's something wrong my opinion we're not coming with that sincerity to the right thing for that right if God could do that by the blood of a ball goats and bulls that only covered sin and made a perpetuation for the center but the sin was still there only covered over what can he do through the blood of his son that omits sin and God has not manufactured but he created a blood that takes away all sin Alleluia Jesus Christ didn't come in the blood of a ball or go it was especially created God blood shed it would hit the target right on saying perfect sacrifice it is finished hallelujah so notice what's wrong with the church's a blood of bulls and goats revelation could bring those things forward I'll tell you what mister should we mean my wife we we went to pick up some furniture the about a month or two ago and we're driving along the road and here we have we forgot one special thing we forgot blankets and tarps we're driving back on the road and anyway it starts sprinkling all over I'm like oh no cuz I looked at the radar and it wasn't sprinkler or nothing I was looking at the radar and it has kind of just kind of mood I said I said in the name of Jesus Christ rain get back and just like in a couple seconds the rain was gone I really think anything else just like glory to God you know he's kept on going to driving away I got about 10 15 20 miles down the road all of a sudden start sprinkling on my wings you again see you gotta be kidding me nice kept driving look at my wife feeling a little bit farther I stopped a little bit and then this you know it rain pretty much almost the whole way home we got about halfway home like I might man hi I said I see what God did that back there I was the Lord and she said why did you stop she said God listened to you and God listened to that the first time why when it came back did he just let it go like here's nothing then thank God for a good wife even keep me in line all right let me God for him and I said that's exactly right you remember when God told the Prophet to speak those four holes and he shot him and he couldn't find one and the devil was fighting trying to tell him it wasn't that way hallelujah just because brother sister you say stop or something because that's what we got to see was that the mind of God remember God told brother branham he said you had need of those squirrels just like Abraham hallelujah and watch bringing forth those squirrels he'd go to Harry Wright's house and watch she would hear that testimony say that's exactly the truth they meant and that would draw salvation or two boys by the third Bowl oh ma talk about a revelation of being under the blood really quickly let's go through some of these things we'll try to try to stop pretty quick here I got a timer on this computer praise the Living God isaiah 43:25 it says i even i am he that blotted out by transgression for mine own sake Oh hallelujah look what he wrote in the book of Galatians here that's not Galatians it's Old Testament sitting under the blood of bulls and goats he said I'm blotting out their transgression for mine own sake and will not remember thy sins hallelujah the blood of bulls and goats Isaiah 40 Father remember these old Jacob in Israel for thou art my servant I have formerly thou art my servant Eliezer thou shall not be forgotten of me I have blotted out as a thick cloud by transgressions and as a cloud thy sins return unto me for I have redeemed thee there they were just following the blood of bulls and goats and God says I'll blot them out what that sin and I can't even see it come back to my retention Omaha wonder what they did when they read that and what if they said well I'm in Laodicea I'm gonna worry about that when we look at some of the things these people did moved on by the Holy Spirit couldn't even receive it on Sola it could not have the joining yet because Christ had not died but they're just look at the sacrifice hallelujah Hot Springs he sent us Arkansas 63 why says now God seen that the blood of bulls and goats could not take away sin he never manufactured but he created a chemical in the blood of Jesus Christ they meant that sin once confessed in the right way you don't even bridge that chasm you take the chasm completely away that means there's no way back he can't give you the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost you if you once received it let it ever be your testimony they ever be in your life let it ever be the spoken word out of your mouth don't bring false accusation hallelujah brother Troy preach the message one time traitor from brother Brooks's church and then he brothers message that giving bearing false witness of your baptism I still remember that title because here we were what being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and repenting from our sins and then all the actions that come from our life in our mouth bear false witness that we ever were done had it done to us hmm the sound of the abundance of rain [Music] well Olivia what he says I can't make it no I've already made it because he called me he chose me how can we love him how can we serve him so look he says and God don't even know that you ever sinned the Latin got the Holy Ghost did you know right now singing right here at this moment God never knew you sinned I can't see it that's right he said he put them in the sea of forgetfulness to remember them no more at all against you than men and women stand in the presence of God as sons and daughters got the very nature of their gods in their hearts notice this it is continuous where is the church today it's constantly over the fact that we think we're a whole bunch of big losing sinners what's happened to the church when we can see that the blood of Jesus Christ so remitted sins that God don't even remember we see then whatever you ask in my name that I'll do it what's the matter it's because somebody has been indoctrinated Scriptures for the people called an idiot look at that it opens up whatever you ask in my name I'll do it when you realize that God can't see your sin how many times we come to prayer to God her or things like that was the Oh God oh my god I gotta try to put all this stuff on there man I just in case I didn't get it the first time come on you know we do it we come say Oh God is there anything my life all about I'm sure I'm sure huh we're staring at ourselves so much that we can be no benefit to God you remember as Jesus Christ she said ask that your joy may be full it was his desire for you to ask so that he could give it to you because he wants you to be happy we're not talking about mercedes-benz's and all these things we're talking about the blessings of God brother sister we're talking about clean sanctified lives we're talking about healings we're talking about deliverance we're talking about our family members we're talking about what God drawling the scene in some it's hunger I look at my mom and say she see I'll tell you what I better act like she's seen call her hear her better pray like she see amen so notice what he says what's the matter people are flipping these scriptures all around we can't even understand who we are I'm just reading four different quotes for the sister and he says the same thing all the time what's the matter she will walk out the door Oh glory to God 55 I did 56 yeah I guess the devil is right I'm a surfing don't you know the mayor the city gave you rights yeah and where you falter he's gonna step up just keep that conscience or you're what were your you have a fleshie tables in the heart when you want to live the word and when you feel the devil fight those things you look right back to the word amen so notice what he says he says this is the only thing that I can figure has been done because God's remedy is still the same notice now it's dangerous to refuse the doctors inoculation how much more God it's dangerous when we refuse the revelation notice back in Micah where did he get this from 18 it says who is a God like unto thee now that partner synuclein passes by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage he retain if not his anger forever because he delighteth in mercy you knows that God likes mercy he delights in that holla new you you've sinned or die God I'm gonna give you mercy he will turn again he will have compassion upon us he will subdue our iniquities he's going to subdue them and thou will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea that's where we get what he put your sins in the sea we're talking in the Old Testament he made the sacrifice of the blood of a Borg and he can look and say who is a God like unto thee guess all of our sins just from the revelation of following up a type with a blood of a boar go I will perform the truth to Jacob in the Mersey to Abraham which thou has sworn unto our fathers from the days of all Omaha look he says he says he the bridegroom took away your shame put in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing in the water of the word and the blood of life that's what the Bible said your first husband that you were married to the world the anointed bridegroom he said to the world he says the anointed bridegroom was 14 who has washed you by all the washing of the water of the word by the church no that don't sound right does it no you might find that in the Almanac but not in God's Bible hallelujah why our sins where are thy the few setters you are standing completely justified as though you never did it and at the beginning this is my message to the church now as we go off here just the man you are standing if you're standing on God's Word with God's Word every Amen every jot every tittle where you standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from them shucks see get out here in the week where you can get right before the Sun I hear the coming of the combat you're standing complete justified like you never did it in the first place hallelujah it's a very timely message because notice you talk about of Thanksgiving I feel real good I'm more thankful for that than anything I know of a sacrifice that he could look that could justify him to a place he never did it in the first place back to the blood of bulls and goats then poor fellows had to live under this type of a revelation and at something Psalms 103 8 it says the Lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenteous in mercy he will not always try neither will he keep his anger forever he has not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded US according to our iniquities with the blood of bulls and goats for as the heaven is high above the earth so great is his mercy towards them that fear Him notice as far as the East is from the west so far hath he removed our transgressions from us oh the blood of both and ghosts it could give them such a revelation see we're not talking about the circle of the earth it says the far as the east is from the west there's no place back why do you think that those Saints could go into Abraham's bosom and then when Christ came they could take our rapture numbers 23 18 he took up his Perrigo elbow talking about Balaam here Balaam did everything he could to destroy the children of Israel he took up a parable and said rise up Balak in here hearken unto me thou son of the poor God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent have he said and shall he not do it or has he spoken and shall he not make it good behold I received commandment to bless and he has blessed and I cannot reverse it he hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob look at this an ordained prophet with the little gift of a prophet I'll curse them I couldn't do it notice Satan can't even go through the blood of bulls and goats to curse God's children notice you have not behold iniquity and Jacob neither has he seen perverseness the whole perversion could even see it the Lord his God is with him and the shout of a king is among them oh ha God has brought them out of Egypt he has that were the strength of a unicorn that's all he could say he brought them out of Egypt hear that water they come up to the first issue no water complained murmur and let's go back to Egypt had to small to rock had to do that a couple of times cos Moses coming into the Promised Land complained cuz it in there but then their food God gave them manna and here it comes back around God says they have the strength of a unicorn I haven't even seen any perverseness you know hum I don't know what you're looking at BAE look but that's not what notice surely there is no enchantment against Jacob neither is there any divination against Israel according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel look at this what F God wrought if God could look at Israel and what could say this is what you should be saying about them what hath God wrought in front of it here they were complaining murmuring and God could not see it blood sacrifice their caller lujah so you see the only time Satan can get the upper hand is when you forfeit it absolutely for free we're closed just play these quotes in here very beautiful finish off on this he says as many of the things as I were approaching the new year that I wished I could forget about but I know I've confessed them as wrong to him and he put them in the sea of forgetfulness notices brother branham you there's many of the things I wish I could forget about OMA I confess them as wrong to him and he would put them in the sea of forgetfulness and he won't never remember them no more he said now see we're not made that way we'll always remember we can forgive one another but we can't forget about it because we're made different but God can forgive it and forget it he can just wipe it out as though it never lost see because he has access to that sea of forgetfulness but we don't hallelujah you know if you had access to it or I a Texters we should be trying to get away with stuff but God didn't make it that way he makes us a lot that you can forgive but not forget because then we can depend on someone who has an access to it he says just think of it that God cannot even remember that we ever sinned think of that choir you young folks what if what about it God don't even remember that we said see he can forget the whole thing and never will be brought into memory anymore wouldn't that be something hallelujah what's the hymn very simple message brother sister I want us to see this if we can identify ourselves and say I've got the Holy Ghost then you see how that changes everything about us I want to tell you something just for a moment here when we first come into this message it's probably pride 2003-2004 a couple years in fold this three airplane most people I know this year and anyway there's a brother who it invited me to come down and go hunting with his on a Saturday was on a Friday night he called me said he said break and we'll come down Hawk and I said well I said I want to you but I got a preach I won't spend as much time as I can getting ready for the ministry and I kind of bugged me a little bit and then you find that going that's something just fun yeah yeah yeah I said brother you're a spoken word charlie god I said what would you say if I told you that you could squeak at deer news this isn't you would have I said you believe God couldn't do that I said yeah probably I'm sure yeah why not I can do that then I was just like I can't say that it felt like the laws are breaking or anything and I said brother I said you said you were smoking words so that God didn't get I said yeah I said so you could speak on your new assistant Simone you could have that I said do you think God will do that I said when you made that statement you said well I think so I said with faith you can't say I think that's right I said you believe anyone Larson he said sure I think so I said no you said it again I said you have to to say it and believe it and say God is gonna give me that dear and that was tomorrow they said I could tell something movies in he said yeah he said God's gonna give me a deer tonight I said brother let's just take that a step farther I said what kind of deer is God gonna give he said God's gonna give me a 10-point buck I said he is he's sitting sure is I said I'll tell you what you spoke that with faith I said you call me tell me about that father he said I got off the phone noon the next day call me they said he said birth camp you'll never guess sorry no he said I got me a temple he said praise be a cop and we just had a little we had a little shopping time but I'm telling you all this for that I said there are laws I knew hardly anything about it yeah are you hardly anything about how to take through the scripture the oneness of God and all these things and all the mysteries and then God could just take a simple simple person it just be in the right position and to take the right thought to realize that thought was from God and to bring that fall forward and God can bring it I believe without a shadow of doubt right now for the sister don't put that do you they're right he's not back here there he's spoken there that night before yes yes and this is where these things troubles from sister because you know it's not this complex thing that we put so far we we just we had faith in our sacrifice faith that God could actually speak to our minds and then it was is soft and that we could speak that saw you manifest itself God's gonna do it again varies God but what troubled me brother sister is in you know a couple years after that break five years after that the brother completely backs right now I'm still I said okay so your brother's right and yeah we say these groceries I know that's a very very simple message but could you imagine if we applied that's we imagine a loser what's the matter with our churches what's the matter with us yeah Jesus Christ [Music] brother sister we just went through those things to show you that those season that's so far away God the word is already I believe loving and being willing then when God speaks we identified as the word go that's a mess Lord what's your plan you got a blood that completely omit yours yes I encouraged you from the sister do you think you've got all the ghosts you believe you've got the Holy Ghost six would say that's not the word to say if you believe you've got the Holy Ghost yes so I asked you tonight brothers sisters we get ready to pray what's there if we sit as a as a group of believers born again into the bottom how that changes our mentality my friends how it does away with a lot of the things that start Henry's and we could just lay them that blood and trust the one who has the access to this year yes as we look at this coming to the closing of time god help us that we might be able to see ourselves clear God is making us do this part let's pray our most precious Lord Jesus Christ a little simple message God about looking at the blood of Jesus Christ how powerful that blood is how much more for this blood home in our sins how much more could it take away the desires of sin and Lord maybe a lot of times we we get so back slid got it the Lord it seems like we really do desire to sin but Lord you know deep down we don't want to do it there's none of us here free from mistakes even brother Brown Camus who said many times but yet Lord and all those times he covered them put him under the blow Lord we want to be and we know we look at ourselves we don't see condemned remove ourselves we don't see you are worthless but yet when we look at ourselves we see a son or daughter of God that has the Holy Ghost it's on their way to the rapture that all things are possible - I mean starting living under the blessings of that blood we pray O God give us the mind of Christ take us far away from any layer of the sea and thought any label to see in a way and nor place us into a position then we can see more clearly what you've given in forces we love you Lord we're asking order you touch every heart you see Oh God Norman maybe a lot of times we just really get hard on ourselves or mistrust tonight Lord he give us a mercy give us a revelation ago take us to a place oh come we can become more fit than finding the bosses made me to be lord I pray around or does this word has been sown more than we of God would take a good look at ourselves in our churches and see oh god how we can better implement this work then we've been perhaps let us straight Philippe maybe we have the right night nothing it's about Maury power and all these things like that but Lord it's only fill your word we just want be so set aside how once was we're struggling I should head away now Lord Jesus Christ [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] nobody would just for the wonderful message what that was didn't remember them hols of goats he's forever I know opps I know what I used to be so he's forever perfected how do you want to see yourself the way he sees you I want to see myself as he sees me confess don't listen let's just take a moment and best any sin as we pray Heavenly Father we know we heard tonight the seed of God does not sin we heard that that is so true absolutely no more than our flesh we make mistakes and that's what we might call me a sinner bar by something like that but we know the soul never could sit again once it's wicked what a refreshing that is for me tonight I surely need this message here tonight what sin there's no sin imputed to my soul blessed is a man of sin is not compute David despise the blessedness of this man I believe you describe it us tonight Lord God our Father help us Lord Jesus to recognize that our soul does not listen when the our soul always believes and forgive us when we make mistakes yes give us when we grieve the Holy Spirit in our thought life and then we sang the wrong word or we think or we respond the wrong way to stuff forgive us we didn't mean to do that then Lord we know when our heart condemns us now we can ask what we will as our brother says for a 10-point bucks world's for salvation of souls we can ask what we want it'll be given to us because a heart condemns us that Father forgive us Lord God of us to see ourselves now you as soon as we confess it know you forgiveness as soon as we confess it you as I was reading with Benjamin tonight or later earlier today the woman who watched Jesus feed at Simon's house Lord you said my faith has saved you go in peace so she came in a sinner we'd say and left that she could leave peace that's how fast she cried and she cried out over his feet she's like oh God he said all these other starchy people wouldn't even kiss my feet but she's not ceased to just kiss him kiss my feet well that's how we are we just come in we couldn't stop chasing praising your name so we know an or we hear the same word tonight your sins are forgiven you go the peace or ministers every heart then that word of truth will God Wiki they could be forgiven - hallelujah may we see ourselves as through the blood of Jesus Christ from white legs in fact whiter than sorry we love you lord thank you for the Word of God Lord may we be so sanctified that you can put your thoughts you can speak your word Jesus Christ intersect do you not have so much sin what's it that's as far away from the east is from the west it was gone
