========================================

um so you know actually preaching on David numbering the people was a kind of good continuation of that series but James 1 ver8 James 1 ver8 then we'll read James 4 ver8 so as we preached and we looked at on Sunday James 1 is for us as genuine Believers that are living San ified lives living above adultery and uh other uh awful things we see in the scripture there by God's grace Idols uh things like that really awful sins uh that's chapter four chapter four is about adultery Wars within the church and so forth uh but Chapter One deals with us where we we're we're in need of more patience how many know sometimes you need patience on God hallelujah but R that's the first one you need patience with is God hallelujah we want to be patient with the Living God hallelujah surely we need patience James 1 ver8 we'll read that one then we'll read James 48 it's nice they're both the eth verse all right James eight let's read that if we can on three one two three a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways all right let's go to James 4 ver8 all right let's read that on three ready one 2 three draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you cleanse your your hands ye Sinners and purify your hearts ye doubl minded so again we see dirty Hearts dirty hands Sinners adulterers uh verse one says Wars and fightings among the saints let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make it know to God here tonight father God we love you bless the Lord tonight Hallelujah Lord we bless you God we give you the sacrifice of praise from uh Lord our lips the calves of our lips the scripture says Lord God forgive our sins this week forgive any evil word evil thought any evil deed Lord Jesus wash Us in thy blood that we be pure just now Lord as we come before the throne of grace as we look to the word of God lord we're not here by form or fashion we're here by spirit and by truth Lord God in the sincerity of our hearts and lives so father minister to all the needs here today Lord bless your people physically thank you for the ones that come out here tonight those that are working minister to them bless them strengthen them those that are sick and Afflicted we pray for healing in the name of Jesus Christ and Lord help me tonight to get out of your way Lord we know it's the preaching of the word that brings life that brings transformation and help us to all receive it by faith faith comes by hearing hearing by the word of God Lord let it be a reality here tonight again we pray Lord bless us in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God hallelujah so I trust you were blessed you know by uh Sunday's message I think as I more the more I preach on the more it kind of opened up you know uh we looked at Eli at the ending there there and uh it tied him perfectly you know the adultery with his sons with adultery in uh James 4:8 proving Eli was double-minded uh what a good connection there I didn't even see that there to I was preaching it and then the reality of how he he was so careful about the holiest of holies think about that he the presence of God he was so he trembled at the presence of God but he didn't tremble at the outer court or the inner court right so he was all about the presence of God it was all about getting the feeling getting the presence of God the trembling but missing the other parts we got to take care of all three parts praise God we love the presence of God I love the presence of God I love to feel God I love to see God move who doesn't who doesn't want to see Miracles who doesn't who doesn't want a a dream or Supernatural or song you know or who doesn't want a testimony where it's something oh the presence of God was there but we got to make sure we look at every core hallelujah look at the outer core make sure that's clean the holy place and then the holiest of holies praise God so you know Eli is like the truest definition of unstable un unstable Health unstable spiritual life unstable parenting uh he was unstable uh in every way and so we see it uh plain from the scripture what a great lesson that is now I was thinking about our lives you know we have health as an area we have our job you know we have family finances relationship there's at least five areas you know John Maxwell says there's 12 you know I don't know I can't really go that far but there's at least five areas of our life you know maybe spiritually would be another one your spiritual walk with the Lord so maybe there's six seven8 something like that but uh just something to keep in mind there you know you want to look for stability in all the areas of your life that's what people are you know brother R said people are thirsty for God right they're thirsty for love they're thirsty to see a real Christian praise God and so that's why we want to make sure that all all of our Lives they're are balanced out and people can see stability in our lives Hallelujah that will speak uh brother Bram said that's that's more powerful you know living a sermon is more powerful than preaching one Hallelujah so may God help us to have that type of uh dedication sub in our lives that people can see that and they can see Christ in our lives Hallelujah now I didn't get to this I want to go to James chap 3:8 I want to preach this so Lydia you can pull out some of these verses I want to preach a little section here you I really felt you know of course we're inspired to preach this just like when brother McBride came he preached on what he preach on the tongue right James chapter 2 and here I pick pick it up James 1 and James 4 also in James 3 you know we look at the tongue and uh you know double-mindedness here is is also seen in chapter three and double mindness double not mindedness sorry is is also seen with our words okay so other words our words should be saying the same thing all the time what is Jesus he was full of what Grace and Truth and Paul said let your words be seasoned with Grace Hallelujah so you know we want to look at that here tonight we got to speak the truth of course we got to call out sin you know we got to rebuke sin before all and there's a great balance there but you understand you know in this case we're going to see uh how James here is addressing this double-mindedness double-mindedness with the with the real Sanctified believers they wonder is God going to hear me is God going to supply wisdom is God going to supply the need or not that's a double-mindedness we all have to deal with then there's a double-mindedness like a uh an unsanctified person would struggle with like Wars fightings adultery idolatry all these things that's another kind of double-mindedness here uh I think this I think this impacts you and I sometimes uh you don't have to say Amen you could just say ouch or you could just listen Hallelujah verse verse eight you probably know where where this is going but the tongue can no man tame now see notice he didn't say the Holy Ghost can't tame it right you and I can't tame it but if we yield to the Holy Ghost it can be tamed Hallelujah remember all things are possible to them who believe right it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison Hallelujah you know someone could uh someone could be so nice to your face church and they could turn around and they could say they could curse you right right after that right that's how deadly the tongue is hallelujah verse n therewith bless we God even the father and therewith curse We Men which are made after the similitude or the image of God right we're creating the image of God out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing my brethren these things ought not so to be Hallelujah so James is letting us know you know we want to bless people remember Jesus said bless bless those who curse you remember Jesus said that and Jame James saw in the early church he saw in the in the book of Acts church people would bless and then they would curse just right afterwards and James said shouldn't be like this right uh verse 11 doth a fountain send forth at the same place water and bitter of course the answer is no that's a rhetorical question right it's either fresh water or salt water right verse 12 can the Fig Tree my brethren bear Olive berries no either a Vine fish no so can no Fountain both yield salt water and fresh water Hallelujah so here we're seeing the doubled mindedness that that we battle with our words we have to make sure our words are edifying we have to make sure our words are blessing people yes there's words of Correction if any any parent knows that right one one second I I see that school all the time one second I'll have to do a correction and next moment I'll be smiling and and praising them you know like like today this one girl did this and that I had to kind of do a certain rebuke but then with a minut I was praising her I was said great job I compliment you that was wonderful you know uh so there's times for that but that's not what James is talking about James is talking about people that are they they're they're insincere they're blessing and then they're turning around and cursing the same person they're blessing right that's what he's talking about he's talking about a double-mindedness all right now verse 13 who is a wise man and end do with knowledge among you so who would you you know who do you think in our church you know think about that who do you think in your family where's a wise person who knows a lot about God right that's what the Bible says let him show out of the good conversation that means Behavior so who wants to be wise and and knowledgeable in our church who wants to be wise knowledge okay so he he says if you want to do that then show good behavior Show good conversation so make sure your behavior his works with meekness and wisdom Hallelujah so again make sure you say gracious words a lot there's a time like I said to bring correction remember the Bible said if you see someone in caught in a trap you go to them humbly that Spirit that's on them will get on you remember remember that in Galatians chapter 6 you better be careful you better go when you try to correct somebody you better go with with a real Meek Spirit or that same Spirit on them is going to jump on you because you're opening yourself up to that uh you're trying to exalt yourself maybe against them but you got to go humbly and like brother Dennis preached you got to go humbly right and you gotta uh like brother Dennis said when he preached he said you got to remember that if if a spirit's on a person don't look at the person don't get angry with the person remember it's a spirit Hallelujah that's right that's what Paul or that's what James is saying here if you want to be wise if you want to have lots of knowledge behave the right way be humble now meekness means humility or mildness of wisdom so wisdom is humble right wisdom is mild in its uh Behavior hallelujah it's that steady Christian Life verse 14 but if you have bitter and V now bitter means piercing or sharp but if you have bitter Envy Envy means je Envy means jealousy or malice if you have sharp jealousy or piercing jealousy and strife which means contention or arguments in your hearts okay so look what's in people's hearts bitterness jealousy and arguments he says Glory not and lie not against the truth so this is the opposite of wisdom everybody see that tonight wisdom is humble uh mild uh good behavior uh but the other side double- mindedness is is bitterness envying and arguments Hallelujah can you ever see that so jealous arguing that is against the truth now I gotta I'm sorry uh Glory not and lie not against the truth verse 14 yeah lie not against the truth so jealous arguing is against the true the truth because the jealous arguing is devilish and it's false wisdom so be real careful church when people argue about things everybody listening real good tonight keep uh you know keep keep a a reminder of that say Lord remind me not to argue with people you know if they want to argue just let oh fine you can believe whatever you want I love you let's talk let's change the subject right but don't get into arguments and fusses right because the Bible says that's a bitter envying Strife it's Pride right it's Pride it's a manifestation of Pride because only through contention it comes Pride okay now verse 15 this wisdom descendeth not from from above so God didn't send down uh a bitter envying arguing Spirit God did not send that down Hallelujah but that's Earthly and sensual that censal means beastial in the uh Greek so beastly like animal devilish so be be very careful people that want to argue right people that want to are jealous of other people and they're very sharp with bitter sharp words against people remember that's beastiality nature that's not that's not the nature of Christ that's the sensual worldly beastly nature Hallelujah so be so Be watchful people that want to argue uh people that want to fuss you got to watch that by God's grace that's double-mindedness Hallelujah because remember these same people that are arguing they'll come by and the person they're not arguing with they'll say well God bless you how you doing oh we're doing good let's praise the Lord right but but the person they're arguing with they're all fussed with them of the so bitter water's coming out and then sweet water's coming out over here so be very careful of devil minding this church and the church said I'm saying watch our lives let's watch our lives by God's grace Hallelujah remember the devil's going to try to lay a trap for you and I that's why we need the word of God hallelujah to overcome that trap Hallelujah to be ready for say to be ready to say oh we just heard A good sermon on that we just heard the word of God so I'm not going to fall into that praise God hallelujah verse 16 for where envying and strife is there is confusion which means instability right we're talking about being stable single-minded right so whenever people Envy or have Strife which is arguments against people their lives are full of instability and that also means confusion means disorder and every evil work okay now that's a lot of evil in people's lives right so hopefully that doesn't deal with us here at our church by God's grace because look every evil work lots of evil work in their lives Hallelujah that's beastial sorry that's beasti I'm sorry beastly sorry beastial or beastly sensual devilish wisdom which we know is not wisdom it's not God's wisdom it's worldly wisdom Hallelujah verse 17 but the wisdom that's from above is first pure see pure heart that's why Jesus said blessed are the pure in heart Hallelujah for they shall be see God is't that beautiful a't that wonderful to have a pure heart praise God I have nothing between men I have nothing between women nothing between God I've got a pure heart praise God glory verse 17 but the wisdom that's from above is pure then Peaceable creates peace it's gentle and easy to be intreated which means persuasive right you ever seen that a real humble person uh they can kind of bring down a situation if if a Situation's escalated the spirit of God will bring down that situation it'll deescalate it right it won't it won't escalate it it'll deescalate it because the Bible said it's gentle it it's Peaceable it's easy to to bring down and and bring any arguing or accusations it's easy to bring that down see that Hallelujah that's the wisdom of God that's the peace of God it's full of mercy and good fruits see full of Mercy full not partial lots of Mercy we're going to see that tonight with King Saul my goodness God is full of mercy and good fruits without parti it so see the spirit of God it doesn't uh put this one person above that one everybody's the same everybody's uh my brother everybody's my sister praise God I treat everybody the same hallelujah amen right but then the the the double-mindedness it has favorites it treats some people different than other people right but uh we know uh God or David wrote to Solomon David told Solomon he said men that rule must fear God and they must be impartial they must honor God more than they honor man Hallelujah right so it's that impartiality it's knowing that God is the judge and and we must treat everybody the same Hallelujah and the wisdom of God is also without hypocrisy which means it's sincere the wisdom of God is sincere hallelujah it's not insincere and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace so here we learn that uh double-minded Believers are unstable but we must plan seeds of Peace if we want to reap peace that's why brother R said you want somebody to say something good about you say something good about them right so practicing bitter words produces devilish fruit right but the opposite is true planting peaceful seeds or words produces the fruits of the spirit praise God hallelujah that's what we want to do we want to we want to plant the right seeds by the grace of God hallelujah remember we just want we just want Sweet Waters to flow from our lips Hallelujah all right now let's review the fruits of the spirit it's been a while since we did this uh the barber asked me a few weeks ago he said what are the fruits of the spirit I named them off I think I missed a couple so I want to review them if I thought if I forgot them it'd be good for all of us to if I forgot a couple it's good for all of us to go through it Galatians 5:22 if you got your Bibles Hallelujah review the nine fruits of the spirit let's review them in contrast to James 3 so remember James 3 had bitterness cursing envying Strife confusion all that's in James 3 remember James 4 had Wars fightings among you a adultery idolatry so James is given us a clear example all these things were amongst the church James saw it in the church thank God there was the Holy Ghost to clean it out hallelujah amen glory these things are right amongst the church you know as I've been around the message all these years I realized you know I told you the story when I first got saved I thought we're just there's this room is full of just angels in here but I realize there's a lot of devils around too right uh so we're thank thank thankful for God's grace thankful for his cleansing power and remember this is also Rapture time this is Harvest Time so people have to manifest the seed that's within them that's of course but in every time but especially at the end time we have to manifest the life in the seed Hallelujah so see in other words we should manifest these fruits we should be planting the right seeds of Peace of Grace right of truth of mercy and that's what we should reap these fruits of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah now remember Church don't forget this there's fruits for justification because John the said bring forth fruits of repentance so you're going to see certain fruits of people's lives wow they really got saved wow they've really changed I know when I first got saved I never said a cuss word again just when I got baptized in the Lord Jesus Christ I was a I was an awful speaking person but just just getting baptized I never had a desire to cuss again that was the fruit of repentance and then there's fruits of sanctification as well Hallelujah brother R said it's changing your mind changing your habits praise God it it cleans out all your bad habits that's what sanctification does and brother man said that sets you in order to receive the Holy Ghost that's what the Bible says amen God gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey him hallelujah amen Galatians 5:22 now let's really search our lives here let's look at the fruits of the spirit let's see if we have these fruits in our lives but the fruit of the spirit is love that means affection of course for God and for people right it means benevolence or Good Will that's what love is good will you want the best for everybody Hallelujah brother said if you want to see somebody go to hell he said you need a fresh trip to the altar right he said you better see check in and see if you're saved if you now other than the devil right we all want the devil and the demons to go to hell right right of course we want them to be judged and so forth like that but he says it's love the fruit of the spirit is love it's affection it's good will the next is Joy which in this case means cheerfulness or gladness now church it's easy to be that way when things are going good but we want to see the fruit when it's going not so good that's when I want to see fruit that's when you need fruit you need fruit when times are tough Hallelujah right so God so God help us to put on a cheerful anointing right put you on the Lord Jesus Christ put on a cheerful Spirit even when you don't feel like it put on a glad Spirit even when you don't feel like it he has made me glad I Will Rejoice for he has made me glad that's a fruit the next the third one is peace which means rest or quietness Hallelujah see we got to have rest in our souls right our minds we have to give our minds Rest by the Holy Spirit that's a fruit of the Holy Spirit my mind can rest I can just be I can just focus on God I'm just going to rest on God hallelujah I'm going to be quiet before the Lord now number four longsuffering which means patience right and we've been looking at that we looked at that on Sunday with uh patience there that's what we need Hallelujah we need to have patience in the midst of Trials and we have to know if we ask God for wisdom God's going to give it to us amen we just got to wait for it praise God all right fifth gentleness which means goodness or kindness and of course the next one is goodness which means virtue where's virtue Hallelujah so goodness means virtue that's that public strength to be a real believer in front of anybody in front of your co-workers in front of your family that's an unbeliever that's uh the fruit of goodness you're virtuous you do what's right Hallelujah these are all fruits of the Holy Spirit and then Faith which means persuaded it means Reliance I'm relying on God I've got the fruit of faith I'm relying on God Hallelujah Austin's been telling me with his new uh occupation life he's got to rely on God you got to live by faith right brother if anybody needs the fruit of Faith it's him Hallelujah right self-employed sure but God's trying to build this in our lives right we want to see it all of our Lives Hallelujah whether we're self-employed or not we want to see a Reliance I'm relying on God hallelujah it means constancy the fruit of Faith which is constancy you're constantly loving God constantly in the word constantly obedient to the Holy Spirit and also means uh belief you have the fruit of Faith the fruit of belief I believe God hallelujah amen so I'm just giving you different synonyms so you can understand the fruits of the Holy Spirit uh love joy love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness which means gentleness or humility gentleness or humility Hallelujah now so far has anybody seen arguing in here has anybody seen bitterness in here that's not one of the fruits that always be right like Jame anybody seen adultery in here no see those are all things James is seeing he's seing all these things but then you know Paul of course wrote this you know but Paul's saying these are the fruits of the Holy Spirit when you plant the right seed you get the right fruit praise God and the last one is temperance now this one deals with self-control and the Greek says especially the sexual area so that's a fruit of the Holy Spirit you can control your passions you can control remember that's also that's also uh one of the uh stature of perfect man right it's also one of the initial ones uh initial attributes or brother man calls them virtues but virtues one of the virtues you know so I call I call them attributes in the book or characteristics of the holy spirit so that means you get a uh you get an initial anointing of temperance and then when you get the Holy Ghost you're born again you get a greater portion of it praise God Amen Hallelujah that's right Glory so there's all nine nine fruits of the Holy Spirit now how many looking at your life today anybody looking at your fruit basket today praise God let's look at our fruit baskets today what fruits do we see in our lives praise God and if we want more fruits first we got to be pruned right got to receive the water of the word hallelujah is that right and you got to plant the right seeds hallelujah amen that's right that's the word of God Amen it's good review church now how do you get these as well verse 24 they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust it's a daily crucifixion mortification daily dying right praise God if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit people say I'm walking in the spirit I'm walking in the spirit or I'm led by the Holy Spirit the only way you do that is if you crucify The Temptations to be double-minded Hallelujah that's what he's talking about in James right Hallelujah draw nigh to God God will draw nigh to you somebody uh I'm not going to say someone from overseas though texted me and said they uh they said pastor can you help me I fell into fornication so this man had relations before he's married and he said how can I overcome this I said you got to hate your sin I said you I said you don't know it but you have hated God's word and guess what verse I took him to 2 Samuel 11 where Nathan said you've despised the word of God which means hate you know he's you know see people come to church and that and they think they love God but it's manifested by our daily actions praise God lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God they might have a partial love for God but if someone can commit such things like this they don't at that moment they're not loving God they're hating the word of God God they're living by their passions and finally after numerous scriptures I was able to show them well how do you get your mind right you've got to have it transformed every day by the word of God hallelujah you got to you got to meditate David said you got to be planted amen not rooted up and uh you know confused and and tossed you know like the Bible said toss to and fro you got to be planted by the word of God hallelujah you got to stay in the word of God you got to let your mind be transformed by the renew of your mind make your body a Living Sacrifice to God hallelujah but that's an important thing to bring out people do these awful sins because they they hate the word of God that's why they do it right they might have some type of affection but to do something like this they have to hate the word of God thank God for the holy spirit thank God that he helps us to crucify the Flesh and the affections thereof Hallelujah we love think about that we love the crucified Jesus more than we love the the the the desires of the flesh Hallelujah the cross and Jesus dying and resurrecting that means more to us that gets us more excited than giving the flesh something that feeds it hallelujah praise God Amen that's a real believer amen that'll bring forth real fruits of the Holy Spirit praise God I told the brother that's what you need you got to love God instead of hating God you got to love God and I said you got to get revenge on the devil I said how do you do that well how do you get revenge on somebody you get them back right so how do you get the devil back you gotta when he brings his temptation you got to rebuke him you got to rebuke him and you got to do the opposite of that you got to give yourself more to God hallelujah that's how you do it you got to give more of yourself to God Amen I told him you got to be looking for that next Temptation and you immediately got to tell no I said you immediately got to slam that door praise God that's how you get revenge on him give more of yourself to God give God the glory Hallelujah draw nigh to God Amen and give all your love to God make sure God gets all your love all your time all your attention Hallelujah give him all your affection Church Hallelujah there's the love of uh the fruit the fruit of Love Hallelujah give him all all your affection hallelujah how many want to do that by God's grace that's right I appreciate people you know that share these things with me it keeps me sharp too like I said remember I told you that that 73y old man it came out more that 73 year old preacher he was looked to be one of the most famous preachers in America for five years that's come out he's had been having an affair with a woman in her 20s and he's 73 in her TW it's a third of his age and people have exalted him like he's think something great like this now they don't believe in the Holy like we do so they can't live a high enough life but the point is right the point is people can hide their sin for a while but their sin's going to find them out praise God hallelujah and see that that ought to be proof if if somebody can hide that sin behind the preaching they must not be preaching hard enough amen right they're just preaching a water down gospel but we don't want the water down gospel brother said we want a bare-fisted gospel do you know what that means in the boxing World they got to wear boxing gloves so it doesn't hurt as much brother R said that's what the preachers got today they got boxing gloves on where it's not as hard he said take those off and start punching the devil praise God bare fisted preachers amen preach at their sin right preach at all of our sin because we're battling on a daily basis sin in our members praise God that's why we got to preach on these things hallelujah hallelujah and like like I told you that example from the message preacher out there in in in in April a message preacher for 10 or 12 years had a church and uh goes after After High School girls yo see that they must be preaching a water down gospel because sin has to have effect on someone's life right it's leav it has to so something must have been wrong with the preaching the whole time and it could have been like Eli they could have trembled at the presence of God when it come down to the real details of the word of God the Simplicity of the word of God they must have been off a 100 miles hallelujah hallelujah praise God I hope that's making sense here by God's grace I don't mean to confuse anybody but I just want you to see they I mean people can have Miracles they can have gift they can have the prce of God tongues interpretation healing mirac whatever but they got to have every area of their lives in tune with the word of God hallelujah all right now let's look at the life of King sa I told myself I was going only going to preach 45 minutes but then I forgot to set my watch so I don't know what am I at Lydia you can you see it on there 30 okay can I fish this 15 minutes I might be able fix this we'll see uh like I said Sunday I could have preached four hours because I have all these uh Bible examples U and I'm going to bring them down I'll do one time like I told Brother William and about I want to preach on Peter Peter is quite the example of double-mindedness I was doing some study and I found this outline of his life I'd never seen it like that before so maybe Sunday morning I'll be preaching on Peter we'll see by God's grace and in a good way right because we can all look at our lives and see Peter can't we right anyone anyone ever here uh denied or I should maybe shouldn't say denied anyone ever here felt like you let down Christ you didn't stand up like you should have well then we can say God bless Peter God have mercy on Peter right because we want Mercy on ourselves Hallelujah all right so let's look at uh um the life of of Saul King Saul I'm just going to hit some highlights here like I said maybe 15 minutes maybe that might be pretty good now first thing we see about Saul is that he's chosen for King uh remember uh but we see we see good you know we see good that God had called him and he surrendered to the call but remember he was hiding away from it right he was hiding from the the call of God right which was a a little sign of things to come right he knew God had called him he knew there was going to be a ceremony to anoint him King but he hid the Bible said he hid away he wasn't willing to come out and really stand out so see there must have been some doubt in his mind Hallelujah hiding away from the anointing but in chapter 10 ver Samuel 10:1 Samuel took the vial of oil and poured it on his head and kissed him and said is not this because the Lord has anointed thee to be Captain over his inheritance so we we see a good start the prophet loves him he's got the anointing oil on him not just oil but he's got the Holy Spirit on him the oil represented the holy spirit all right then in chapter 10 uh verse 10 the spirit of God came on Saul and he prophesied among them now brother Braham said plainly he said Saul wasn't uh a prophet but he had a gift of Prophecy he said because the prophet of that day was of course who Samuel good Hallelujah Samuel Samuel was the prophet of that day but Saul had a gift to prophesy so Samuel would hear from God Visions but you know Saul he could get in the spirit we see he gets in the spirit he sings and he'll start prophesying with his songs now Austin knows a little bit about getting inspiration for songs right because he'll just come to you right well that's what Saul was Saul was just praising God and he would just start prophesying well Israel will defeat the Philistines and Israel will will destroy their enemies and all these prophecies because he got in the spirit praise God and this is all good right he starts off really good but let's look at the double-mindedness of Saul so we can apply it to our lives Church no matter how good our lives get or no no matter how uh faithful we may seem we have to guard our minds because it's the greatest battle ever fought did you ever realize that he didn't say the greatest battle ever fought was in the soul he said the greatest battle ever fought was in the mind right because Satan has access to that one Satan don't have access to the soul thank God for that Hallelujah so see so see he gets anointed the spirit of God comes on him he prophesies he's got his gifts operating hallelujah thank God amen glory that's in uh chapter 10 verse 10 he starts prophesying all right now and then he gets some early Victory so he starts off good in chapter 11 uh verse one he he slays the ammonites Hallelujah and also in verses 1- 11 he gets victory over nahash the ammonites and so he gets two victories right away so he's got the spirit on him he's got his gifts operating and he gets two big victories right at the beginning talk about a good start he's on a good rooll by God's grace but then in Chapter 13 is his first mistake God told King Saul to wait for Samuel to make the burnt offering how many remember that right but what does he do he said oh it's getting late uh uh the sun's going down you know he said by this day I better I better intrude into the prophet's office I better inject my own thought into the word of God see trying to be something trying to be something that he's not everybody see that he's doing a prophet's job that that sacrifice was only for a prophet now look he could have the devil could have said well look you prophesied you got a gift to prophesy come on why can't why isn't yours just as good as his because it wasn't God's provided way Hallelujah he goes ahead and makes the sacrifice remember as soon as he got done Samuel walks up said what do I smell here what's going on here he said well I didn't think I would I didn't think you'd be here but you know God God is always uh God has always has a provided place of worship God will provide the need amen we just got to wait on God wait on God God will provide it amen patience so see we he lacked patience so here we see the the first evil he lacks patience God help us to be patient in 1st Samuel 13:13 uh Samuel said to Saul thou has done foolishly thou has not kept the Commandment of the Lord thy God okay so a foolish thing church we got to be very careful make sure we keep all the commands of God hallelujah and and let's if we make a mistake let's be like David and said I've done foolishly Lord I've done foolishly right because we know God is rich in Mercy as well but that's one thing we don't see a lot from Saul we don't see a lot of humble repentance right we see a lot of uh uh just doing what he wants to do a lot of self-will we'd say now verse I'm sorry the next chapter in 1st Samuel 14 he makes a rash vow and basically he curses his own son and he don't even know it he said anyone that eats all this day is curse and Jonathan didn't know that Jonathan went down there found some honey remember that and his eyes were open that's what the word of God does to us amen we're tired when we're weak when we're struggling what does God do he sends us Honey Hallelujah he sends us the sweetness of the Holy Spirit to give us strength to cheer us up Hallelujah I say like that he gives us the joy of the Lord oh how many times have I seen it praise God Amen struggl and tired being discouraged somebody come around and make you joyful in the Lord hallelujah God sends you a blessing he G sends you some some some uh some honey to encourage you but then later in that chapter after you know Saul talks to to Jonathan and so forth then Saul defeats his enemies in 1st Samuel 14:47 so now he gets his third real big victory all right so he's pretty good it's kind of like three to one right now right three good one maybe four to one maybe four to one he's prophesied maybe four to one he's been doing pretty good now chapter 15 is his downfall this is his greatest downfall Saul disobeys God's command completely to destroy the Amal likeit and their livestock and he spares King a G and some of his animals and because of this God rejects Saul as king so it looks like he got two strikes and he was out that's what it looks like church in baseball you get three and then you're out but here in God's way for the king they got two stries and then they're out everybody see that two and they're out my goodness and uh you know think about that you know God said destroy everything you know you know why I did that because the amalekites had really treated Moses bad they had really done them wrong they wouldn't let them cross through their land they wouldn't give them any water remember that they wouldn't even feed them they they wouldn't make they wouldn't make their life a little easier God help us to make lives a little easier for somebody else they understand what I'm saying they wouldn't even o open up uh the their their land and let Israel walk through and God's anger was kindled against them God said I'm going to use Saul to do it but then Saul had pity on them but he wasn't supposed to have pity he was supposed to to obey the word of God praise the Lord and church that applies to our lives we got to kill every Speck of sin in our lives and the church said don't spare the pride don't spare the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh whatever it is don't spare that we've got to kill it praise God we're commission to do that amen isn't God's anger against sin Hallelujah see we get we can learn so much from this we've got to crucify the lust of the Flesh and the affections thereof amen we have to crucify these things and see that this is this relates to our lives as well the amalekites and then be God said because this because you rejected the word of the Lord the Lord has rejected thee from being King over Israel now brother brandham said brother Bram said uh Saul was into greed and riches that's why he kept some of the the the the cattle okay that that that may be true because remember brother R said three things get the preacher right money wh women popularity but then remember right after this it might have been money but remember this Saul said uh he Beggs Samuel Samuel just come come worship with me so everybody can see that I'm with the prophet of God so we can see that was popularity Saul was interested in popularity Hallelujah he was interested in greed and brother man said greed so he's interested in money and popularity we never see him struggle with women right but we see him struggle with money and popularity and he just wanted everybody to he just wanted to look good he wanted everything to look good but he wanted to compromise on the word of God see we cannot compromise on anything don't we don't that's I don't care that's why I put my sermons on YouTube I don't care what people say I know I I they can say whatever they want I want to love God I want to serve God hallelujah I don't care if the church looks empty or full it doesn't matter the ma what matters is are we living up to God's word hallelujah not trying to impress people and get more people to fill the church you know brother R rejoiced but what brother R said you know I wish know brother talking about how some of his people left his church and went down to another church and brother BR said I I hope God will do that I hope God will fill up their church and then God will just fill ours right back up again so brother wasn't worried about people leaving and going to different churches he said oh they can just go on to that church over there that's fine may God fill that one up and then God may he fill up ours as well praise God hallelujah see he wasn't worried about you know what it looked like to the to the people but but Saul was so concerned what it looked like to the people he was a in other words he was a people pleaser and God helped me not to be a people pleaser God help the preachers that come in here not to be people Pleasers but they'll preach us the word of God I no matter how much it burns our hide brother M says burns your hide amen now chapter 16 now what's interesting in chapter 16 Saul gets refreshed by David's heart so look now we get a good thing so now it looks like he's got five or six goods and he's got two bads but God's already rejected him see he gets refresh so see somebody can be rejected by God maybe for a Ministry but then they can still get refreshed by the Holy Spirit Now isn't that the mercy of God you understand what I'm saying he was Saul was already rejected by God he's going to be replaced in maybe a few maybe 10 15 years but then God still let him get refresh in the presence of God through David's gift that is the mercy of God you know I feel like this is like a part uh this is like a part 10 of uh the message of Grace that's what I want to say because God had so much grace on Saul so much grace are you seeing it in chapter 17 he does Wicked or he does he does he has no courage because he won't go fight Goliath Goliath's like send Saul what does Saul do I'm not going anybody else I'll reward you if you go see the spirit of God has left him he's afraid to go fight a warrior he's he's afraid to go fight uh uh maybe some big obstacle he lost his faith he lost his courage see that's what we need we need courage in the face of adversity everybody see that so you see there's another another evil he lets a teenager he's a grown man it'd be like Let It Be Like Me letting uh you know Victoria or Zion or Genevie you know go out and and pray for a sick person well I don't want to go you guys go to the you guys go to the hospital and pray for the cancer patient you know that's what it would be like because I'm so much taller you know Saul was head the Bible said head and shoulders so David was just maybe up to his shoulder and if anybody had a chance it was Saul but he was afraid because the spirit of God had left him God give us courage let the spirit of God be on us Amen to fight the Lord's battles what battles do you have to fight with let the spirit of God be in your battles amen see because everybody's got a battle who who doesn't have a giant to defeat out there tonight who doesn't anybody got anybody giant free out there no no Giants come fight my Giants then come fight uh come fight these Giants we see there uh the aners and everything like that that's what I'm talking about you know just major battles praise God things that we should be praying for so see he's he's uh he just goes back and forth this double-mindedness right he gets refreshed but then in the presence of Goliath he gets fearful so did the whole Army where is that refreshment see how quickly church we can lose our refreshment we get refreshed we get refreshed on Sunday boy you better watch out Monday or Tuesday the devil's coming on Monday or Tuesday if not for sure Wednesday morning right right before church the devil's going to try to discourage you see that Saul he's afraid to fight and then he gets jealous he gets a jealous spirit because they're singing Saul has slay his thousands and David is 10,000 1st Samuel 189 says da Saul I David from that day forward in other words he's going to kill him from that day forward right not I am for good I am for evil he's kind he's going to try to destroy David from that day forward all right now in chapter 19 we get evil and good Saul Now starts to try to kill David remember he sends two troops out and what do they do they start praising God they start prophesying he sends people to kill David but there's such an anointing on David that the the men that are going to kill him they got under the anointing of the Holy Spirit to me that that's what David was writing about he said you m you make a table for me in the presence of my enemies right my cup runs there my cup runs over in the presence of my enemies Hallelujah is't that beautiful that's like that great David movie right they come in there wanting to kill and they just fall into the anointing what a beautiful what a beautiful story that is in in the presence of their enemies David gets his cup running over and then Saul comes last of all and the Bible said Saul prophesied again so not only did his gift operate before now his gift is still operating and yet God's rejected him see people you don't see Saints we don't lose our gifts there's 15 minutes so maybe give me 15 more see the God doesn't take the gifts away the the only way we lose gifts as if we bury them in the ground that's what Jesus said one man buried him in the ground but see Saul had already been rejected he done evil he done all these evil things and God still uses his gift in the presence of God because the gifts and callings of God are without repentance we ought to say Amen to that Hallelujah in other words if I make a mistake God's not going to throw me in the dumpster well I'm done with you no the only way you go in the dumpsters if you bury yourself in the dumpster God can still use you there's hope for a second chance a third chance there's hope for a new season you can get your joy back you get your dance back Hallelujah we preached on that you know uh was it was it uh Hosea preached about that you'll get your season of Joy back Hallelujah just stay true to God God won't take your gift away he's just trying to train you get you to trust him help you to die out from your sin get the spirit of God get the fruits back and then God will use your gifts again Hallelujah don't think God cut me off and God's never going to use my gifts if you humble yourself God will use them again by God's grace you know that's what brother uh remember brother Rod you all know brother Rod right when we went down when we went over there to oberin that's what brother Rod uh prayed for me brother Rod said remember we were praying at the altar here but right by Charles uh finny's uh pulpit and he prayed for me he said he said Lord uh send a miracle anointing bring that back on brother Jesse's life a few weeks later I went to Iowa and we got those two Miracle testimonies I thought what a wonderful blessing that was how did he I mean I wasn't even I didn't ask him to pray for that he just felt letter of the Lord to pray for that I was so blessed amen hallelujah that the Lord could kind of speak through him and give a prayer and then just see just to see it answered a few weeks later see God has everything in control praise God if we go through trials we go through dark Seasons we go through valleys Church stay with it God's G to walk right through the valley with you praise God he's going to bring you back to where you need to be he's going to get your gifts in operation again hallelujah it's beautiful in chapter 22 we see evil in chapter 22 Saul kills the priests and the high priest because they gave David the shoe bread and the sword of Goliath now church this is where Grace really steps in a man murdering others right murders a whole group of priests I need to look that up and see how many that was I didn't look that up but now he's murdering I mean he remember he set his eye on David from that day forward and remember he just prophesied a few chapters before that he he prophesied he was under the spirit of God then he he grieved the Holy Spirit and then he gets under the spirit of murder isn't it striking the look at the double mindedness look look at the Double mind everybody see that that's what this is about double-mindedness one day praising God the next day trying to destroy things destroy people that's double-mindedness Hallelujah just like Eli oh I tremble at the Ark of God but I let my sons you know destroy the offering of God I I look past their adultery all right I don't I don't I don't care for the the Mind we'd say or the uh the the manora uh I'll just kind of let that go and I'm just going to focus on the trembling at the presence of God thee I'm just going to focus on the ark the power of God see but we got to look at everything in our lives Jesus said Jesus said uh make sure you don't lose sight of the the Lesser matters of the law remember that Jesus said you got to do the little things too not just the big things you got to do the little things as well praise God hallelujah that's true verse 20 I'm sorry chapter 24 1st Samuel 24 we get good and evil David spares Saul's life for the first time he did it twice and Saul says David is more righteous than I in first Samuel 24:17 and then Saul stops pursuing Davis look the spirit of God comes on him he says you're more righteous than I isn't that isn't that hum humility church when was the last time you looked at somebody and said wow they're more righteous than I am you don't got to say Amen but when was the last time you looked at somebody and said wow they are more righteous than me see that's the holy spirit that wasn't the spirit of the devil that was the Holy Spirit on him wow he could have killed me he didn't I'm not going to chase him anymore so here so here we see bad and good in the same chapter right so he goes from one him to kill him and then he his mind now goes back to the things of God oh he's more righteous than me I'm going to stop pursuing my son-in-law right now we go down to verse uh I'm sorry chapter 26 now Saul pursues him again so see there's a double-mindedness I'm done talking about this I'm done doing this right I'm done attacking him I'm done chasing him down but then he goes right back to it see the double mindedness I'm done with it no I'm back on it flipping right flipping right back that's what we're talking about double mindness James says that we have to guard ourselves from that church I'm talking to each every every person here tonight God help us not to be double-minded right let the fruits of the Holy Spirit right uh manifest out of our Lives see that see this is just striking to me I I never gone through his whole life like this before but look it's just constantly back and forth good evil good evil good thoughts bad thoughts good words bad words prophesying for God trying to kill people and then literally killing people and then prophesying was that right yes he prophesied oh that was right before he killed people he prophesied right before he killed people my goodness so that was 1st Samuel 26 Saul pursues David again and then Saul says he sinned in 1st Samuel 26:21 you want to put that one up there and then Saul says he will he will not pursue David any longer and then Saul never chased David again then said Saul I have sinned returned my son David for I will no more do thee harm because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day behold I played the fool and have ered exceedingly does that sound familiar playing the fool David said I've done foolishly see Believers right Believers so here we see good we see bad and e or evil and good again evil he's chasing them down and then we finally see good he finally gets the victory over his uh hatred towards David right then he finally after the second time he spared my life I think this was the one where uh his his uh David if I'm not mistaken David's men were telling him God has given him into your hands kill him and David didn't do it he said I won't touch the Lord's anointed the first time remember he cut off part of his skirt he said look what I got right this is this is the grace of God God's grace comes on Saul and Saul says okay I'm no longer GNA chase after David I'm done being double-minded back uh I I'm going to chase David I'm not going to chase David I'm going to chase David I'm not going to Chase David I'm done with that and he finally gets the Victory church a man a man criticized brother brandom for saying Saul was saved a man criticized him and I'll talk more about that I got the quote I think it was from 1950 1961 1961 yeah questions and answers 1961 so I'll read that in just a moment here hallelujah then we go to chapter 28 this is the witch of Endor chapter we're familiar with that there's a lot of uh we'd say maybe unusual things in here but there's also a lot of Revelation as well now church we see again we see evil and good in this chapter we see evil because Saul uh he doesn't know he can't hear from God so he goes to a witch which he already said anyone who does that should be killed so look he put a death sentence on himself just just like David put a death sentence on his own four Sons remember that that man will restore fourfold right and what' God do God took four of his sons Saul said anyone that goes to a Witcher medium they shall die guess what Saul died the next day is that right Church the very next day and Jesus said how you judge others that's how God will judge you right judge it so we want to be gracious how you want to be gracious in your judgment Hallelujah help me to judge like Jesus said judge right judgment that's right Hallelujah and what's amazing church is that um here here we see the good now the good is that he fasts all day and night all day and all night so 24-hour fast when was the last time he did that right that's sincere isn't that sincere he wants to know from God but he he says like I can't hear from God but he's willing to fast day and night to try to get some guidance for his life what does the woman do she does her enchantments the spirit of uh Samuel comes up and he said why did you disqui me from my rest I think about that church that means in Paradise it must it must have been peaceful in Paradise right and then when Samuel's Soul comes up it must have been unpeaceful because remember all the demon powers church remember the demons that are wrestling with Daniel right not not Daniel but wrestling above Daniel right remember that the prince of power of the air Persia so Samuel was like why'd you dis quiet me why'd you bring me up he said well the Lord won't answer me by dream or Vision well why of course why not I mean you're killing people mercy and brother Ram says see he says he said Saul had to be saved because Samuel was still a prophet he still had on the prophet's mantle right and then he said Saul you'll be with me tomorrow so brother R says wherever Samuel was that's where Saul and his Sons were so brother Ram says if if Saul wasn't saved then Samuel wasn't saved either that's a pretty good thought isn't it that's like a prophet of God thought amen because Sam Samuel said you'll be with me and brother said look he he died two years earlier he's still a prophet you always are what God made you to be see you keep those gifts Hallelujah everybody see that they're part of your character part of your spirit right like people that have the PO or the gift to write songs it's a gift it's a healing gift it's a gift people that speak in tongues it's a gift to them it's part of their human spirit it's part of the spirit that God created Samuel still has the prophetic gift but this is why God sought to kill him think about that remember God was trying to kill Moses as well how many you remember that because he neglected the abrahamic Covenant and he's trying to bring the children of Abraham out of Egypt and God said I'm going to kill you because you've neglected this see Church don't feel bad if God's after you God's giv you really bad spanking don't feel bad lots of Believers went through that Moses right and then even Jesus came to to to Paul and said Saul Saul why persecutest thou me right he said you're having a hard time kicking against the Pricks right so see look even in all this failure even all this disgrace God shows him Mercy but we see the humility of Saul Saul stops chasing David and he fasts and prays for 24 hours I should say pray but he fast for 24 hours I I don't know that he did pray so I shouldn't say that Glory 1 Chronicles 10:13 says so Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the Lord even against the word of the Lord which he kept not and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar Spirit to inquire of it and inquire not of the Lord that isn't that something Church what did what did Samuel say I'm sorry what did Saul say Saul said God won't answer me when I inquire of him but God said you haven't inquired Saul was so double-minded he had thought he' inquired but he really hadn't inquired of the Lord because God said you didn't inquire see church that's see double-minded people they're so blind spiritually they think they're so spiritual but they're not they they they say remember Saul said I've obeyed the voice of the Lord and Saul Samuel said what's all that bleeding oute here what's all the oxen in the Sheep you didn't kill everything see double-minded people are so blind spiritually they can't even see the plain simple Bible truth laying before them is that right and so we see King Saul again King Saul he can't see it he said oh I've inquired of God God's not answering me but God said no you didn't inquire of me see you know what you know why church because you got to seek God with all your heart soul mind and strength so apparently Saul had not done that he had not sought God with all of his heart soul mind and strength and again God took his life God killed him right because of his Disobedience his transgression and in the inquiring of the familiar spirit all right we're almost done here by God's grace almost done that busy body clock now U and then in chapter uh 31 1st Samuel 31 Saul's wounded remember he tries to commit suicide by falling on his sword to avoid capture remember it didn't work even in that he failed even in that you feel and I'm not I'm not badmouthing Sor I'm just saying when a person tries to do things without God they get a lot of failures every understand that now look he's trying to take this into his hands he tries to take his own life into his hands just like he tried to take the sacrifice in his own hands at the beginning just like he tried to take the amalekites into his own hands church we don't we can't take anything into our own hands we got to wait on the Lord hallelujah we got to keep the word of God and wait on on the word of God see Saul was always trying to do it himself make this happen make this happen you can't do that you got to wait on God hallelujah everybody see that he even tries to take his own life and he fails at that see trying to take things into his own hand try to do things himself make things happen church we can't make anything happen right but we see some good here he goes out to fight the Lord's battles he knew he be with Samuel in Paradise he knew he was going to die that day it's of course bad he tried to take his own life but that's not the unpardonable sin remember brother R's mom told him that brother Ram's mom always thought suicide was the UNP partable sin brother R said no it's blasphemy of the Holy Ghost that's the UNP partable sin now what do we see we see the foolish virgin could the foolish virgin be saved with a a suicide attempt it looks like this according to this they could be because that's not the unpardonable sin right that's the torment I'll say this that's the torment of being double-minded all right somebody can see that then remember another uh another man from the Army come around and uh Saul asked him to kill him and so the man did and then remember David had that man die because he touched the Lord's anointed all right now let's close with this here let's go to second Samuel chapter 1 David's song and remember this was a beautiful part I think this was the end of part one of the movie David 2 Samuel 1:1 17-27 Saul has died we know he goes to be with Samuel he was saved he went to Paradise in the heart of the earth and then David sings a song Here we can see that David forgave Saul imagine if someone tried to kill you imagine if somebody threw a spear at you multiple times now for our day probably shoot a gun at you right he forgave him and church this really shows the power of the holy spirit with forgiveness this is why Jesus said if you can't forgive someone who sinned against you the heavenly father won't forgive either because if anybody had an excuse to be upset with somebody and not forgive them it was David and David lamented with this lamentation over who Saul the man who chased him down and tried to kill him and tried to throw Spears at him and kill him he lamented over his life see because he's got the Holy Spirit on him he sees it it's not the evil spirit on that person it's a it's a person in the image of God and over Jonathan his son so here he sees he's already lamenting he's sorry for sa for Saul look at verse 19 David calls Saul beautiful and mighty remember he was on numerous occasions and the church said he prophesied he he beat some of these uh he beat the Philistines numerous times he beat uh other ammonites he had some great victories and so look the holy spirit will look at the good we do amen not the evil that we do and the church said that's what brother R said I trust God he said I trust my uh my commentary will be written like uh David and Moses where God doesn't remember my mistakes like Abraham God don't remember my mistakes he only sees that I was trying to give be strong in faith and give God glory praise God oh my God God help me Hallelujah that's Romans chapter 4 remember may God only look at what I'm trying to do and may God forgive all my mistakes that's what David Gets Anointed with when he sings this song how the Mighty Fall I'll be playing that one tomorrow morning when I study the Hallelujah beautiful song they the Mighty the beauty the beauty of Israel King Saul was the beauty of Israel when he was under the right mind not when he was double minded when he was single-minded he was the beauty of Israel he was a mighty King when he was under the right mind God help us to stay under the right mind Hallelujah verse 23 now David not only calls him uh beautiful Mighty now David calls him lovely Pleasant United Eagle lion sounds like the four anointing doesn't it you got two of the four in there right you got two I guess if he's Mighty that means a mighty man anointing could be three in there Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their death they were not divided see see uh Saul wasn't upset with Jonathan and David anymore he was United with them he had a repentant Heart Church and church remember remember the thief on the cross God forgave that man after mocking Jesus God forgave that man Jesus said today you'll be with me in Paradise that's amazing grace what what a murderer a murderer who killed all the priests he was pleasant I guess if God forgives all of his sins glory amen if God forgives all of our sins amen then we'll be pleasant to God too amen only if God forgives all of our sins so see David is under the anointing of the Holy Ghost here not his not his uh Vengeance we'd say not as human thoughts he's under the anointing of the Holy Spirit he says they were swifter than Eagles and stronger than Lions one time remember one time Saul was chasing after David but then a word came and said King Saul the Philistines are upon us and Saul left chasing David to go defend Israel that's why he's called swifter than Eagles see even even as he's chasing David he's able to leave that oh I got to go I got to try to help out our people by God's grace again double-minded Church double minded I want to kill him but I better go protect God's people right and how many grudges will people hold against people in the message I always think of uh uh William and beatric because they know so many things I've talked to some of them about some of the things they've seen you know in the message and what about what about this see the spirit of God forgives these things that's the Holy Spirit singing on David how many know he was a sweet psalmist the Bible says he sings Sweet songs Under The anointing of the Holy Spirit Hal and they were stronger than lions for the Lord when he had the right mind when he uh uh when he a overcame the double-mindedness when he had the right mind he was like an eagle he was like a lion for the Lord amen look what he even treated the sisters good look at verse 24 he even gave the sisters nice clothes how many sisters got some nice clothes on here tonight that's what King Saul did he sent the sisters some nice clothes ye Daughters of Israel weep over Saul he gave you scarl he gave you never had Scarlet clothes before that's what Saul gave you remember he he was good to you gave you some good nice clothes don't don't forget that David even under the spirit of God see you buy somebody some clothes that's a nice gesture of Love isn't it with other Delights who ha put on ornaments of gold upon your perel so they must have had some type of a nice ornaments on there maybe some pins maybe a cross or Star of David or something like that and David David says the Holy Spirit remembers this about Saul he did some good things but he did a lot of evil things too so what does the spirit of God remember the spirit of God remembers the good Hallelujah not the evil and he closes one more time in verse 25 and 27 twice calling these men Mighty under the power of God he prophesied he defeated Kings Hallelujah my he he was so faithful uh in some of these times he'd run run the battle to defend Israel he give the women clothes he's a mighty man when he had the right mind let's stand to our feet little after almost 10 after 8 Mali can come here by God in this song David forgets all of his suffering church I don't have time but I could go to the Psalms and I could show you some of the Psalms he wrote when he was hiding away in the caves how many remember that he was complaining to God why am I hiding why am I being chased down in a cave and see under the Holy Spirit he forgets all of his trials and he only sees the good in people hallelujah so let's examine our hearts and lives if we're holding something against somebody let's remember what did the Holy Ghost do in David it just complimented them oh when they were in their right mind they were Mighty they blessed people they they were good to people that's what the Holy Spirit would do it forgets Hallelujah it really Church it really sends our sins as far as the East is from the West it really throws them in the sea of forgetfulness because remember through all those murders in the sea of forgetfulness that's where Grace steps in Hallelujah so I could really call this the message of Grace part 11 but I'm not going to because here we see the grace of God grace forgets all that David suffered hallelujah how many want to have that kind of Grace in their lives like the spirit of David was the Holy Spirit that was on David I'll say like that that's the real Spirit of God's love let's bow our hearts here as we have a word of prayer father God we thank you for tonight Lord God we're thankful for this opportunity to be in your house Lord now we see a second character double-mindedness Lord this is perhaps more so than Eli with all the murders the Abomination Lord of going to a witch Lord such awful things no wonder the Bible said you took your mercy from him as far as being King but Lord we also seen another way your mercy was very gracious on him to save him wherever the prophet Samuel was that's where Saul went Lord thank you for amazing Amazing Grace here tonight Lord God sometimes you wonder Lord how could God save me or how could God save that person because God is rich in Mercy if that person will say I've done foolishly I'm ashamed of what I've done I want to be forgiven I want to end my life the right way I want a fresh start a new lease on life I want a pure heart I want to see the fruits of the Holy Spirit In My Life I want people to see that I have Sweet Waters flowing from my lips that I bless people I don't curse people father we're looking at our fruit baskets here tonight Lord God we're looking at our lives looking real closely Lord God help us Lord tonight Lord God to gain something from this message that we've heard a message of Grace Lord we see a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways again father we ask for the stability of the Holy Spirit Lord God hallelujah give us that Spirit of forgiveness Lord God like we see on David Hallelujah with the spirit of God on us Lord we'll thank people for the clothes that they gave gave us we'll thank people for fighting the Lord's battles we'll be grateful to hear testimonies of people because that's what the spirit of God does Hallelujah Lord the scripture says that we can save Lord others from a multitude of sin by introducing them to Jesus Christ help us Lord God to share about Jesus Christ with others Lord God Hallelujah to hide a multitude of sin just like Saul's multitude of sin was hidden by the grace of God oh God thank you Lord for Amazing Grace here tonight Lord God may we examine our hearts and lives God and live a life that's pleasing unto you as we saw on Sunday night Lord God help us to live all pleasing with all wisdom
