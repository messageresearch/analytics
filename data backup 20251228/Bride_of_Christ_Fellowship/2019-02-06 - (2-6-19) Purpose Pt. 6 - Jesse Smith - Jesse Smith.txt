announcements by the grace of Lord like to just share a few announcements the Sunday Lord willing I'd like to have a carry in this Sunday so I'll text everybody about that between services I still won't do a second but I'm gonna ask my wife to remind me to sit down and relax so I don't preach so hard the second service to wear myself out so you could do that honey I'd appreciate that so let's try to a carry in this Sunday I'll text everybody and let them know about that I just kind of wore myself out you know Sunday you know preaching twice and song leading twice I kind of wore myself out a little bit so let's just do two more services also the following Sunday brother Simon will be preaching because my wife and I scheduled a little getaway from my wife and I to get away a little bit rest up so brother Simon will be here on February 17th for two services then the following Sunday my brother cam will be here so it three Smith brothers three weeks three weekends in a row by God's grace so looking forward to that and we may call a communion on when brother cams here on the 24th I maybe do a communion that evening by God's grace on the 24 so Lord willing would like to do that by the grace of the Lord okay also just announcement here I just want to share but I got the first draft of my book in my hands by God's grace oh I'm so happy about that you can tell there's just a few mistakes I've found a few more mistakes so it's not the final drafts I got to fix I fix a few things but I sent it out to four other pastors I'm sorry three other pastors one and then brother Simon was evangelist so four other people got in our hands now and they're making corrections and so it looks pretty good front and back there look looking really excited about it and reading through it trying to find any more mistakes I'm really excited and thankful that the Lord allowed us to be able to do that so we're maybe a month away Lord willing maybe a couple of weeks we'll see what happens kind of depends on how quickly the people can get me some corrections but really excited about that and hope it'll be a blessing to the Bride of Christ the pastor's who have read it one pastor from Arkansas said it's much needed he's going to try to get copies for everybody in his church then another pastor said it's a great tool it's be a great help and brother cam said he said that these thing think is gonna be very helpful for especially young sisters who maybe don't know the scriptures about modesty and holiness and things like that so that's what I hope it is I hope it's a book that brings people revelation I hope it's a book as they meditate on the Word of God that God overview stuff and I hope that introduces denominational people to the message of the hour that's what I really want that's I really wanted to be so I'm really excited about that brother I don't mention brother Branham but like I said to chapter 8 so that's when they can know where do I get all these teachings from from Jesus first but then Jesus gave me brother Branham brother Graham gave them to us so anyway looking for that also just a few prayer requests here I guess just one actually to keep praying for the boy in my class he's had it really hard but just this week something changed the mom put a post today on faith yesterday on Facebook and said all of a sudden and just changed so he hasn't thrown up or had any any other problems for the last 48 hours we can thank the Lord for that thank the Lord for that and we're just thankful for that but also brother Jim from Albion sends his greetings he's a pastor he's preached I think last year right maybe two years ago he preached for us or was it last year probably two years ago was it last year okay so we had him out praise God that's right yeah right the end of July yeah where he he came and preached that last outreach service for us and I just told to preach yeah so he sends his greetings but he also asked for prayer so I told me well yeah we will lift up in prayer I said many a Wednesday night I'll pray for cam and brother Brooks and all the brothers around here brother Jim and so we'll lift him up in prayer tonight are there any other requests tonight you'd like to share yeah my wife oh yeah we could pray for our sister Connie I believe she's live streaming tonight but she did ask for unspoken so we can pray for that Lord bless you sister Connie Haven okay unspoken and caris all right we'll pray for our friends all right praise the Lord thank the Lord thank God for His mercy also I got a letter in the mail from a preacher from California and he says I never heard about what you teach but he said I found you on the Internet I like some more resources from you so let's pray for that man and perhaps the Lord will reveal the message to him so he's a California pastor just got that letter today so may the Lord help us I thought with that book coming out hopefully out can be something we can share with him so anyways let's just go before Lord and a word of prayer here let's just bow our heads Father in Heaven we just thank you lord we sing these praises from grateful hearts Lord I know I will be and

and we sing hallelujah you're my portion you're my salvation ah surely by God is shrink the mushroom your love depends it depends praise God let's take our Bibles here tonight by the grace of Lord thank the Lord for his amazing love Alleluia like to go to Hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 tonight I like to look at part 6 of the purpose series by the grace of North Hebrews 12 verse 1 very familiar scripture to us but would like to look at it in the light of God's view of our lives God looks at our life in one way there's a few ways he encourages us to look at our lives and one of them is a race I'm a little bit familiar with that you know I used to run track you know so play a lot of sports a lot of racing in my life but God gives us these different metaphors and we look at Lord willing look at for metaphors tonight of how God paints out our life for us ways we can think about it and that should help us to know our purpose by the grace of the Lord Hebrews 12:1 if you're there say Amen let's read verse 1 together then I'll read a little bit further let's just join our voices for verse one on three one two three wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us I like to read verse two also looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against him lest she be wearied and faint in your minds you have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin and you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him amen let's have a word of Prayer if you ever need on your heart just make it known unto God hear Heavenly Father we loved your word we've sung your songs we worship you tonight your love is what's defending us Lord on all of our battles it's your love that gave us the shield of faith to extinguish every dart of Satan oh god it's your love that gave us a sort of the spirit to chop down our enemies that come against us Lord with your word it's your love that gave us the helmet of salvation to protect our mind Lord God the belt of truth Lord to hold up all of our armor Lord and to keep us in a ready position our minds ready to fight against all lies we thank you for your love did this to us and Lord we give you glory father help us Lord to lay aside any sin that would easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that set before us speak to us we pray tonight in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless you being seated praise the Lord I'll have a few slides here tonight Lydia not all I don't didn't have the time to get maybe all the slides but we'd like to use some quotes here and scriptures by the grace of God so look at that part six tonight I told you on Sunday I think I'm gonna close the service kind of with it'll update on some things that's been said you know in the Jefferson movement I think I'm gonna or Jefferson bill or rather Jefferson Jeffersonville movement I just kind of said that on Sunday I've just kind of been listening to some things that are coming out of that movement I just kind of want to share them in order to just show you the truth I just want you to see the truth not that any of us are you know moved by that I don't think any of us have ever been you know tempted to forsake you know preaching live preaching you know I hope not because brother Branham never did that and he never told anybody to do that but just because it's such a burden it's the it's the current it's the current wave the Bible said there's tossed you know by every wave of doctrine and so this is the most recent wave that's kind of hit the message remember back in 2012 it was to believe the signs stuff that was the wave that hit the gospel ship right but our ships still sailing thank God we've capped the wave thank the Lord and overcame the wave well this is this this Jeffersonville tape only movement that's you know that's the it's the current wave and I don't say that critically but we got to be honest what's the truth of God's Word and so like I told you on Sunday night I said I want to mention that so I'm gonna mention that I've been studying a little bit on that too but lore winning tonight we want to start with this thought we read our text I didn't get to all that I put verses 1:8 but didn't get to all that I want to just start with some inspiration that I've received from chapters 5 and 6 in this book I read this book last year it was a real good blessing to me like I said I think about 90% of it is pretty accurate I should say pretty Akron oh really believed 99% is really accurate I would encourage you to read it as long as you just obviously if you don't believe in the Trinity I mean you'll be you'll be good I just got to stay away from that there's two thoughts on the Trinity and I actually actually cite those Quotes in my upcoming book after this one gets out Lord willing if God Terry's the writer says that you know God didn't need us because he wasn't alone he had the Trinity with him so he had all you have the two other persons with him and he was he wasn't at all he wasn't alone at all so it doesn't really need us or didn't have to it which is true I mean one way God didn't need us the Bible says that in acts 17 it's not that God needs you God doesn't need man you know necessarily to exist he's easy turtle but he wanted us he wanted our fellowship right and he was lonely in that sense like he wanted the fellowship with his children and then there's another one where he mentions the Trinity and of course we know that's wrong but like I said I found much great truth in here and I want to start with that and then Lord willing look at four metaphors where God gives us to kind of view our purpose from God's eyes many times you know it you know if we're not careful you know Satan will go try to convince us you don't really have a purpose right your life is hopeless there's no real meaning behind your life and you know if you're not famous if you're not rich if you're not a part of a big church or if you're not if you're your name's not all over social media or or you're not a millionaire you're nothing right that's what Satan tries to get people to to think all your life is just who are you you're one little person and so Satan tries to attack your purpose but the Word of God tells us our purpose we have a holy calling amen and then inside of that holy calling if you're male you know you have a certain calling this way if you're a female then you're calling goes off a different direction there's branches like roots you know and then they all trickle down and and your purpose goes down one of those tracks and you've got to recognize you got to see your track which one it goes down and you've got to be obedient and you don't you want to stay on God's track and not try to afford your own track and so it's important that we we have to get in tune we saw that's last week that God will drive you to your purpose right he drove Cain to his purpose just offer the right sacrifice and you'll be accepted he drove Judas to his purpose you're chosen you just got to be a faithful apostle just don't just don't lust over money and you'll be all right he drove the rich young ruler to his purpose just forsake everything and come follow me you have amazing riches put out but they didn't they didn't accept that purpose but thank God there was some like Peter and James I said all these fishing nets who cares about this job I want to serve Jesus I'm willing to leave it behind I'm willing to leave my dad with my job that he thinks I'm gonna take over one day I'm willing to leave the father's business in order to join my true father's business amen that's right and so God will use the events in your life he'll Drive everyone to their purpose and they can either accept it or reject it if they accept it then they receive that power and then that purpose drives them forward like we know Paul Paul's Paul was driven to his purpose through meeting Christ there on the road to Damascus and then that purpose drove him right yeah that purpose drove him to be and Jesus told him you're gonna be a light to the Gentiles you're gonna turn many from the power of darkness to the power of light and it's that purpose drove him and then Jesus he also heard how Jesus said this man will must suffer great things for my sake remember God told that to Ananias so no doubt Ananias we're told that to Paul you're gonna do great things you're gonna turn men here and turn on the light for many people right you're gonna turn on the light switch or pull the light switch but also you're gonna suffer great things and so when people rise up back of us in different ones would say you're going to Rome to die Paul could be bold and say that's fine that's part of my purpose amen because I persecuted the Church of God I've got to suffer for the Church of God amen and every time Paul got persecuted he wrote it and every time he went jail he wrote about it later saying what encouragement it was to the Saints remember that's it off to preach on that eventually it was such an encouragement to them they they heard of Paul saying faithful yet his bonds and they knew that either real revelation of Christ he didn't sell out and try to baby and try to get out of the the prison sale and baby his way out and he didn't he didn't try to roll back or what's the word day he didn't try to recant that's the word I'm looking for he didn't try to recant say well I'll go back to gym just give me my freedom back I'm gonna be a happy Roman citizen I won't cause all this trouble no he knew the trouble was just the effects of preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ hallelujah and so see Church God uses the events of our lives to drive us to our purpose and then we gotta let that purpose drive us forward now let's look at these metaphors here the chapter is actually called seeing life from God's view but let's look at for metaphors God gives us of our purpose okay the first one is the race and that's the one we just read in Hebrews 12 now Paul talks about running the race as well but but here the Bible says in Romans 12:1 let us lay aside every weight and the sin with which dust so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us now you know runners look for every advantage they can get I think the last time the Olympics came around I never watched him but I think I heard online that some fastest guys would shave every little hair on her body any hindrance that would give them just a slight edge to try to go a little faster they'd be willing to do that and you know how immoral it is they strip almost all their clothes off especially the women now or they look like they're running around in bikinis out there onto the track which is a disgrace in the sight of God but they'll take they'll lay aside anyway they'll lay aside anything that even gets close to discouraging them from running their best now how much more church should we apply that spiritually to our lives if we know something's on our phone keep struggle with us how much how quick should we be to get rid of that if we know being around this person at this certain time of the day is going to lead to some awful how much should we avoid that if we know going to that friend's house or that family members house or if we don't listen to that certain music is going to bother it's gonna hinder us how much more we should avoid that we should easily lay aside any weight that we might run the race with perseverance now don't get me wrong there's a difference between laying aside away of sin but then carrying a cross as you run the military I talked to brother Adam rego I've talked to mr. Atkins at and when they train they got to run their mile with the heavy pack on I forget how heavy it was was it fifty pounds or something I forget do you remember me I do okay he might not have been there when we talked about it but maybe it's like a 25 or 50 pound pack and they've got to run their mile race and they got a certain time now that's that's like us as Christians we've got a jesus said you got to take up a cross daily and follow me and so that's part of our Christian race is taking up the cross and carrying the cross and dealing with the same burden every day right but the nice thing is that Christ is there to help us carry it or were we were following his footprint sir we know this is the right Road I'm on the right Road I've got the cross without a cross then you're not doing what God's called you to do you forsake in your ministry you for taking your purpose so there's a balance we must we have to understand there's going to be a burden there's going to be a heavy load as we run but it's a different kind of load than the load of sin because the load of sin brings death oh but the weight of the cross brings joy because jesus said he did it for the joy that was set before him like your life in my life although it's hard although it's we struggle we get weak sometimes there'll be times God will give us great joy they'll come a testimony after you know there'll be great joy finally Oh after all these weeks or all these months or years oh there's a great joy thank God for this joy it was worth it all I wouldn't change it all because there's joy at the end of that but at the end of sin is only death and heartache and torn lives and ruined lives and ruined relationships in church splits and all all these awful things negativity and slander that's the end of sin and death but we at the end get to see joy the joy of the Holy Ghost oh it's a race eh is it not church so the thing is that verse two this is how you got a run see we run and with the cross and our head get so our face just points down and alls we can see is when will I die when I go into heaven or whatever I go to heaven but the Bible said he got lifted Jesus you gotta run with your face after heaven amen looking unto Jesus Jesus is not below Jesus is above amen set your affection on things above so see you as we run the race we gotta keep our eyes on Christ I love that don't you thank you lord if the cross is heavy it will bet it make you bend over from time to time but we must keep our eyes on the Lord Jesus and not love the things of the world or feel sorry for ourselves or oh the world must have it so much better they don't we've got it the best because we've got the fruit of the Spirit praise God we're actually producing something that has value to it while their lives are producing death hell amen alright now let's go I believe it's a first Corinthians 9 let's go there for a scripture about running the race again here's another one I just came to me so I didn't really have a chance to look it up but I'm just you know sort of familiar I imagine yeah first Corinthians 9 look at verse 19 let's start a little bit before that this is a thought I've been working with a little bit I may preach it later but this thought of how Paul he was all things to all men so let's read this for a little bit to a Jew he became like a Jew to a slave he became like a slave to a free man he became like a free man and that's interesting I want to just go a little deeper in that and study on that doesn't that sound interesting because in other words God wants us to try to feel the pain or feel the struggle that another person's in he wants us to put ourselves in their shoes not judge them and say well you're just a serpent's eater or you're just not as good as us no but try to feel that their pain and relate to them so you can understand how to win them for though I be free from yet have I made myself a servant unto all that I might gain them more so the way you gain souls is by serving people god help us to do that God show us how to serve people and unto the Jews I became as a Jew that I might gain the Jews to them that are under the law as under the law that I might gain them that are under the law to them that are without the law as without law but not without the law to God there it is right there so Pete so sinners that had no law off he tried to think how would they think but he always kept the law of God that's why people got all mixed up well Jesus ain't with drunkards so I can go into the bar no you're just deceived that's not what Jesus did he went into their homes and then he did probably didn't go into big places like that because he never sinned and and he was always righteous and pure and he created an atmosphere amen he changed the atmosphere I remember he always cried even Mother Mary he even corrupted corrected mother Mary if he corrected mother Mary and Peter how much more a bunch of sinners sitting around at the table that means he was constantly correcting people ever he went but see people use that as an excuse to play pool or listen to dirty music or lust after women or something like that they use excuses like that well uh it's a it's a wedding so I can you know I can get drunk and I can I can dance a worldly music at a wedding not if you're a Christian you can't you see so we got to balance these out here he was still under the law to Christ now did you catch that we're not under law Moses weren't in law of the Holy Spirit people say I'm not under the law well that's true in one way but it's wrong in another it's true yeah we're not under every 613 law of Moses but we are under the law of the Spirit and the law of the Spirit is life in Christ Jesus in other words the Holy Spirit would tell you don't sin obey the law and if you obey the law you walk in the spirit but if you disobey you broke the law of the holy spirit now you breathe the holy spirit and now you got to repent to get back to where you are free from sin that's right so we are under law and I put that in the book hopefully people catch that hope hope that serves people up a little bit we are under a law today amen glory there's rules this this this this law is love but there's also rules to love amen now look at verse finish 21 that I might gain them that are without the law to the week became eyes weak that I might gain the week I have made all things to all men that I might by that all means save some and this I do for the Gospels sake that I might be partaker thereof with you know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so one that ye may obtain so you and I have to run the Christian race like we're the only ones who are gonna win isn't that what brother branham said Oh Graham said you've got to have the faith that if if one person goes in the rapture Bride of Christ fellowship it's gonna be me amen if one person goes at Ohio it's gonna be me levan said if your faith is not like that then you've got the wrong kind of faith see we got a run in a way that we are gonna win the race now that I heard you know this it goes way back to college so I'm going back some 15 years I heard my friend at college he taught a Bible study and I quote he said I think I'll pass it on just another way to think about it he said this prize was intimacy now we know it's eternal life but he called it intimacy in other words if everybody else around you isn't seeking God that's fine but your prize the reason you want to draw closer to God is the prize of intimacy that I can know him better that I can know Christ better in the powers resurrection and here's the one we don't like the Fellowship of his sufferings praise God so I like that I thought that was intimacy because everybody knows everybody can quote well gosh we've baptized which scripture is here everybody can quote that acts 2:38 what scriptures speaker brother branham everybody can quote that Luke 17:30 Malachi 4:5 and everybody can know that but whose intimate with the Holy Spirit today and knows kind of what God is dealing in their lives today and who they're supposed to serve like Paul we must become a servant all in order to gain some but yet while doing that never breaking the law of the Spirit now who's that intimate with the Lord you see so that I thought that was a good illustration of a price let me pull that up real quick before he finished this scripture the fellows of his suffering just I don't forget okay now let's finish first cutting these six no I'm sorry 925 and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things and they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible so athletes will put their bodies under great discipline in order to get a prize right college was the most discipline I ever got we would get up and like sometimes in the in the HOF season we get up at 4:30 in order to be at the practice field I'm sorry get up at 4:00 in order being on practice field we start practice at 5 a.m. we practice from 5 to 7 a.m. out in the winter out at the rubber bolt and then get showered up and drive back for class at you know 8:45 or whatever it was and then after class lunch and then films and then a little more practice two practices a day and then do your classwork after that and just just a cycle week after week after week after week that's the most discipline ever had and you know the famous people day they'll have a sugar free diet you know we think that's that's real discipline no sugar for months and months and no sweets and then they have such discipline and they do it just to stay looking young but see we should take that attitude no of course we should take care of our bodies and we can't have sugar and then get cancer from the sugar and say well oh the devil did this to me no you did that to you right did I saw a study this week that said obesity leads to cancer many times and of course everybody knows that but science finally proved it this week so you got to take care of your temple but they're trying to obtain a corruptible crown but we are obtaining an incorruptible crown eternal life a crown that will not fade away Paul's referring to that garden remember that the wreaths they wrap around the winners and the Greek society they they wrap around and Paul would have seen that because they had Olympic Games right there in Corinth or not Olympic but they had these games right there in Corinth he would win the city he would see their games he'd see them put on there they're guarded and everybody's clapping all are so good but all Paul saw that's nonsense but that's just a copycat that's Satan comping what Jesus is going to do for us amen that's just a corrupt and perverted copy of what's gonna happen in heaven amen all the winners of the race are gonna be crowned with eternal life amen so verse 26 therefore so run I run not as uncertainly fight not as one beating the air in other words I know where I'm running and I know who I'm fighting so this is where people struggle when they come to church they don't know where they're running they don't know where they're coming to church they don't know what gifts are in their life they don't know what God's called them to do in their homes or don't know what job or don't know what they don't know they're just running and kind of here to the air not quite sure but ball says work to know where we're running and we did not want to know who we're fighting let me say this before we get then we're not fighting Jeffersonville right we're not fighting you name the church we're not fighting any church we're not fighting organizations we're fighting Satan that's propagating lies behind some of these churches we're not fighting flesh and blood so we can argue we can disagree bitterly but then we should be able to hug and love each other that's right that's right and so it's got to be done with love in our hearts and at the end we can smile shake hands and love and pray we know who we're fighting it's not the individual it's not that city it's not that church it's not that organization that's not it we're fighting the devil verse 27 but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others preached to others i myself should be a castaway so we don't want to be a castaway means a reprobate which means a rejected mind remember the homosexuals have reprobate minds casteau so in other words I don't want to be a castaway God's just done with me Paul says if I don't stay steer spiritually disciplined I can be a castaway if I don't keep my prayer life right if I don't keep my Bible reading right if I don't lay aside these sinful temptations that easily slow me down if I don't lay them aside I could be a castaway God could cast me away we don't want to be like that we wouldn't be winners of the race praise God amen we want to be winners of the race we want to follow all God's rules and win the race now go to Philippians 3:10 now this is a beautiful portion why don't we just read 3 7 this is one of the most sweetest portions of scripture Paul's testimony about suffering the loss of all things that he might gain Christ but what things were gain to me those I counted loss for Christ yayyyy doubtless and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is a law but that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith here it is that I may know him see we only know him right this is the reward knowing him better on this side and the power is resurrection right they got for that we want to see more power of Christ and here's where we struggle and the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death so hope you see that one way to know Christ is to partake of his own sufferings Jesus why do I got to be rejected why don't have to be made fun of and mocked what have to be ridiculed why do I have to be abandoned you have to be abandoned or ridiculed or mocked or go through awful trials in order that you might know Christ in his suffering to relate a little bit to what Jesus felt then you can be made conformable unto his death how'd he die he died as a servant he died as an innocent lamb and that's how God wants us to end our lives right that when we die if God terry's and we go to the grave we died as a meek innocent little lamb amen because we he allowed us to suffer and he taught us obedience through the things that we suffered everybody everybody wants those first two I want to know I'll give me revelation give me the power but they don't always leave out that last one know that maybe a partaker of your sufferings oh thank you lord I love verse 11 if by any means so no matter how whatever it takes that I might obtain unto the resurrection of the Dead program interprets this force in the church age book Paul saying so by any means I might be in the rapture the first resurrection because everybody's going to be in one of the resurrections everybody so this has to mean the first resurrection you'll either be resurrected for the rapture or resurrected for the white throne judgment I don't know I don't know how to I'd rather meet Jesus in the air than meet Jesus on as a judge sitting on a white throne in front of me I'd rather meet him in the air as his wife and then when the white throne comes I'm already sitting way behind him on a throne - yes Jesus that's right yes sir I want to meet them in the air and say hallelujah I believe that you're coming back I've prepared my whole life to meet you in the air amen and then also I got news I just got to sit behind the Great Lord so you guys hear that remember when you preach that in our church that's right and they say I need a witness from there to see an aged would you stand up if you serve God admits his sufferings and God will call brother Jesse will you stand up because remember he's gonna do that he's gonna say Queen of Sheba stand up there's any witnesses men of Nineveh stand up and God's gonna call your name and God's gonna call my name it ought to be a faithful witness right now praise God I want to know him in the power of his resurrection I want to know him but I also have to be able to know him in the Fellowship of his sufferings and you know what that Fellowship is church it's Jesus coming when we get up to heaven at the marriage supper but if the Bible says it Jesus comes up and he wipes away the tears from our eyes because we've suffered because we and maybe brother Anderson will be disappointed some didn't make it Jesus will have to come and wipe away tears and maybe put an arm around us there there it's okay I lost you know I lost the son of perdition he can relate to us those that were with him he called him friend he was this for Judas was Jesus friend and he lost him the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death to die like a little lamb little mystery lamb isn't that how brother Branham died is a little mystery to Lamb everybody forsook him out in Arizona he got no invitations to preach from any church out there they don't want nothing to do with him because of his servers he doctrine and all that all women hate his women hating preaching which it's women loving preaching right loving the way God made a woman loving the way God made a man and he died as a lamb a rejected little lamb that's how he died I was talking to my friend last Saturday on the phone and I was praying lord help me to share the message with my friend and I said I said oh yeah you said 1965 I said yeah that's when our prophet went off the scene and I said you died in a car accident and I said but he saw visions he was a mighty man of God you know what his response was well he must have not had a vision that day that he was gonna died I said well no sir I said I said sometimes God takes people on certain ways I said you know you know I gave him some examples of other people that God let go through hard times and see that's how the world the carnal mind will think of that but in God's eyes it wasn't like that at all God was conforming him to die like Christ as a rejected humble meek little lamb because the Bible says we are made conformable unto his death that's right if by any means I might make the rapture praise God how many would say that tonight lord help me to know you your power and your sufferings so by any means I can go in the rapture that's what Paul that's what Paul wrote all right so that's the first one now the second one actually let me read this this is a good thought here I want to read right out of the book here because I'm not supposed to put this on a neat electronic device I don't want to break the law he said the way you see your life shaped your life how you define life determines your destiny your perspective will influence how you invest your time spend your money use your talents and value your relationships all through your attitude all through your perspective or what your life really is he gives some examples how people see their lives this is kind of funny he said people call their lives how I used to your life as a circus my life is a circus wouldn't that be so sad if you thought your life was a circus one little trick after another that would be awful but people told this man my life's like a circus one joke after another he said some people say my life is like a minefield I walk around I'm try not to step on a mine and get blown up wouldn't that be an awful way to see your life I'm just trying not to blown up the Bible says were more than conquerors in Christ Jesus amen now their trap set for sure but it's not going to take our life nothing's gonna take our life until it's Jesus time for us to come home some people say I see my life as a roller coaster you ever heard that oh my life is just up and down ups and downs we're brother have said it shouldn't be that way a Christian should live more holy and holy every day should be the same living in the Shekinah glory of Christ some some people call their life a puzzle my life is like a puzzle I really want this to fit it's just not fitting I can't you make this I can't make this to look right brother branham said that's how the denominations do right he said they put a cow on top of a tree doing some other things you know that I forget I read the quota over last year they got their puzzle all mixed up oh my some people say my laugh at life is like a dance or a journey or a symphony my life is like a carousel sometimes I'm up and down we read the carousels last year at Kennywood remember that girls up and down up and down on the carousel just around and around not getting anywhere just around and around I'm going on the same every every month I got to do the same thing it's just up and down up and down church our life is not a carousel see some people think is like a party right you've heard your sinner friends say that Oh life is just a party live it up if your life is like a party then your your only value having fun so this is how your your idea about life shapes your decisions well my life is a party I might as well live it up now I'm well I'm young so what's our view of life is it a minefield I'm just walking a minefield off I go to church if someone's gonna blow up in my face this pastor's gonna blow up in my face again I hope that never happens do we see it as a minefield because well how do we see life shapes of our decisions shapes everything so as we said the Bible offers four metaphors the first one's a race if you see it as a race then always you have the new church is just keep running made a pretty good lap this time we made it through 2018 praise look let's pick up the pace a little bit for 2019 sorry and all you got to do is just lay lay aside anything that's hindering you I've been carrying this pack of guilt of 2018 Oh God forgive me you can lay the pack down oh it's a lot easier to run now thank you lord amen oh my it's silly but it's true people will hold on the weights for years trying to run the Christian waste and wonder why they don't get anywhere my parents my mom and dad both got weights they tell me they just told me last time on the phone with my mom about weights they're still holding on to trying to run the Christian race and that's why sometimes Church that's why even message people can't get anywhere with God because they're so bogged down by all their weights helpless with the help of Jesus tonight give me about 20 more minutes I'll hear try to be mindful the time the second one is the test God offers us to look at life as a test other words might be trial temptation or like a refiners test right how gold is refined or it's tested to make sure it's the right kind of quality how many of them are Abraham's tests with Isaac he was tested God said I'm gonna test you do you love me more than my blessings are you serving me because you love me or you serve me because I blessed you God tested Jacob right he worked seven years for Rachel oh they even pulled a quick one on him on our work seven more tested him in church we got to be able to pass the test Adam and Eve failed their tests in the Garden of Eden did they fail the test can you keep all the Word of God in Heaven's and the Russians they haven't but in the earthly Garden of Eden can you keep all God's Word and they couldn't keep it and yet then God turns around and asks us to keep all the Word of God in Satan's Eden but let me tell you the bride's gonna do it hey that's right Adam Eve couldn't do it because they weren't born again even in an earthly perfect Eden but we can do it in Satan's Eden because we've got the power of the Holy Ghost amen I remember church this message if you remember this this is the message that God had in heaven and the angels one two looking so bad can you imagine that the BIOS that the Angels desired to look in God's seven sealed book God's book is there in heaven it's got seven seals and the Angels just look at it I'd like to see what God's gonna do we've had all these years with the Jews and Moses and Solomon I wonder what God is going to do Oh hallelujah they're just chomping at the bit I really like to look into that book wouldn't you Gabriel yeah Michael I told you that about 8,000 years ago now of course they wouldn't say that like that but remember that's our three dead that's I think that's first Peter chapter one yeah first Peter chapter one nope let me look it up here okay verse 12 thank you sweet thank you I appreciate that thank you that's a great blessing now unto whom it was revealed actually the speaking of Christ's crucifixion resurrection under whom it was revealed that not under themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you by the I'm sorry with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into oh my and that amazing the angels desire to look into those things that's awesome they wanted to see what is it all about what are these seven seals all about what is it now Church because they would see - they would see you know that they would they would minister to Gideon they would minister to Abraham and and they would see these guys die and they would not come in heaven where are these guys at and they knew they were in the heart of the earth how is God gonna get these guys up here they deserve to be in heaven but because they sit and sin debt wasn't paid for they had to stay in the heart of the earth and they desired to look into these things ha ha hallelujah and one day God sent his son right and they saw the sudden crucified and instead of coming up he went down amen and brother have said he defeated every devil on the way down there he kicked the door down took the keys of death and hell come follow me boys and Abraham said can we make a pit stop and Jesus said of course let's stop right there in Jerusalem amen and pretty soon after the resurrection he comes all up and he said it said open up he heavenly gates and they said who is the king and glory and they all shouted the Lord mighty in battle amen and then heavens all open they all come in and the angels say this is what it's all about praise God the blood of Jesus Christ the blood of God's own son was going to redeem and redeem them from the pits near the pits of hell and bring them up in the prints of God and give them action place higher than the Angels amen because they're more than servants they're bribed they're more than servants their family hallelujah the Angels desire I wonder what they were thinking in 1963 when the seals were open they desired what do these seals mean what are these symbols God and God never revealed it to them but he revealed it to a prophet and now he's revealed to us that we might overcome by the Eagle anointing praise God and be overcomers in this hour hallelujah that we might be made ready for Jesus as second coming oh hi oh yeah praise God which things that angels desire to look into Oh mine now of course there's one thing that all of us desire look into when is that day an hour of the coming of the Lord when is that rapture going to be but Jesus said I don't even know that only the eternal spirit knows that the eternal spirit did not let the flesh know did not let the veil know and the Angels want to know but bo-ram said once the angels he said once Jesus gets that different robe on with the paps and everything like that once he steps off that throne then all the Angels gonna say he's ready he's he's gonna come now it's time for the rapture and the angels will see it first but guess what Christ will let us know the Bible said we'll know the times and seasons amen that's why I want to preach out and pretty soon remember the Bible said you need not know the times or season because you yourself know that the Lord comes as a thief in the night amen in other words we know the time and season will feel it will have that right in our souls will feel it oh the Lord is going to come soon why because we'll see the latter rain and bromance say we'll see our loved ones for about a month or 40 days that's how we'll know to praise God everything will be letting us know the people of God will know everybody else it'll be like a thief they weren't expecting it but it won't be a thief to us because we'll be the ones that were know we're gonna get taken up we're the ones getting snatched up we are what Christ is coming back for amen he's gonna let us know before he takes us that's right so the second one life is a test enough after finish with this one God is continually testing your character and my character he wants to see how much faith we have how much obedience we have how much love and integrity and loyalty we have he's constantly testing us because he wants us to be more loyal he wants a hat he wants us to have more integrity he wants just to really love one another so he tests us do you really love your brother do you really love your sister it'll let a little tests come in to see if we really love them how many want to pass those tests I want to run a good race I don't want to be bogged down I want to run the fastest time I can the fastest time I ran was like a ten six I think that was pretty good for high school I want to run faster than that I'm gonna run I don't run this fast my personal time I want to do is in a blink of an eye because the Bible said you'll be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye I know I'm gonna have a personal record when these days for the air I'm gonna have a PR one of these days I'm gonna be 10-6 by longshot and brother says it's not even badly batting of an eye it's a twinkling of an eye and then just a little twinkle I'm gonna run a lot more than 100 meters I'm gonna run to the air praise God amen amen we have said that we're running so far we weren't even past the Milky Way what a race we should run that's right we don't need to because we are the moon glory will go so fast right past that we'll travel like a thought we'll travel like light because that's the fastest thing there is in the universe light jesus said you are the light you are the light of the world hallelujah Oh God helped me to be ready amen help me to have loyalty integrity and love obedience character faith let me have that even if it costs much suffering let me be conformed to the image of Christ give me a few more minutes here like to take a few more thoughts I see the nice part is it's like I already just I just wrote my own thoughts all over this book so it's like my sermon notes are already right here I just gotta look at my notes so it's different usually I type out my notes and put them up here but here I just kind of wrote out Oh make sure you preach this this this ties this with with that that think of how all these people all these believers pass their tests like with Jove I've been reading through drobe now I'm at the part where allah who is rebuking job and job is like elihue's like speak up job if I'm wrong and job don't say nothing he says you made me said you justified yourself more than God that's what Joe was saying something's wrong with God God's not defending me I'm a righteous man and member Joe repented at the end of that he was wrong Joe made it sound like something's wrong with God God's not giving justice and Allah who rebuked him for that see it's like Joe was he was starting to fail the test but all of a sudden God raised his faith and God came to help him out he was having struggles my medals oh it was should have been better than I've never been born and that's not God that's not wanted them to do and then there was times he would get an encouragement I know my redeemer lives the lightning flashes thunder rolls he getting Karen now standing with him on that day but there was times he got down but God ended up ended him up helping him pass the test I know God's gonna help you and I pass the test - if God help brother man pass the test he's gonna help us pass the test Joseph passed the test twelve eleven brothers getting rid of him right we're not all eleven but most him want to get rid of him he passed the test of being away from his family of being thrown in prison and even being approached by a woman right he passed that test along with the beautiful woman coming on to him and trying to seduce him he even passed that test and said how can I do this evil not just to your husband but to God so God spirit was so close to Joseph how could I do this physical lustful act when God is right here with me Amen that's what we need hallelujah how could I say evil how could I think any lustful thoughts when the Holy Spirit's in my soul praise God Amen that's what we need we need the character to pass the test in fact church character is both developed and revealed by tests so in every test it helps your character get better but by also showing what your characters like it reveals what kind of character you have right our trial show what we're made of if we fall out the pride that it shows we weren't strong enough and we got to get stronger if we follow the lost that shows well we weren't strong enough there we've got to get stronger but we overcome lost overcome pride overcome all these fears and struggles and all these if we overcome that it shows we've grown as Christians amen and we're further up the road today than we were last year ah thank you Lord you are always being tested by God let me read this I got a few more minutes this is beautiful I just put a star this is great I got to read this word for word listen you don't know all the tests God will give you but you can predict some of them based upon the Bible you can know what kind of what tests you're gonna have you're gonna be tested by major changes Joseph went through a major change he didn't expect to be thrown into a pit church think about it he was walking the glory of vision he just saw a vision everybody's bound down to me my God's gonna help me a rule and then the next day he's thrown in a pit and he's off as a slave where and it never sees his brothers you're gonna go through major some of us will go through major changes but we've got to have godly character in the midst of that test things we don't expect to happen but we got to have godly character the next thing is something we all started with delayed promises well God I thought you promised me to heal me I thought you promised to save my family and the church said I thought you promised a new America for me I thought you did and God's like yeah why are you getting so upset about it I'm trying to develop patience in you I'm trying to get you to produce some patience well I supposed to be right now the preacher made it sound like it was now well how do you know it was a preacher and not your misunderstanding well my mom made it sound like this or my dad made it sound like this or grandmother made it sound like this and Abraham didn't know Church Abraham didn't know was gonna be 25 years he didn't know that that's just what God allowed it to go through Joel didn't know it was going to be months but it was many long months with skin boils and not being able to sleep all through the night and losing his family and losing his money and losing his respect even from church members how many months sometimes do we have to go through of hard trials and we think where's God at he's here the whole time he's here the whole time he was with Joseph the whole time he was with job the whole time he was with brother Brandon the whole time he'll be with us the whole time you'll get tested by major change is delayed promises impossible problems like Abraham and Sarah's age how could they ever do anything about that how am I gonna have a baby I'm 90 years old well actually 89 at that point she laughed how am I gonna have a baby I'm 89 years old how can God do what I'm asking him to do yesterday it's ridiculous how that happened and then they named Isaac laughter that's his name laughter so God can remind them you laugh but I gave you a laugh of joy afterwards I change your mocking right or your unbelief I turn your unbelief into belief amen unanswered prayers you have to might have to go through some unanswered prayers remember Hebrews 11 read it last week they so many of them died not inheriting the promise they didn't get to see the Messiah they were all sacrificing for the Messiah believing the Messiah is going to come I know you didn't come then come in their lifetime undeserved criticism and senseless tragedies I didn't deserve this why is this happening why is such a tragedy I've lost my closest friends senseless it seems but it's not because God works everything according to his great plan his great sovereign plan Church when we understand that life is a test I'm gonna read this right out of here you realize that nothing is insignificant in your life everything is significant in your life every stage of Joseph's life was significant it was preparing him for what was next so church think about it what is this current stage what's this season preparing you for God will show you right either now or afterwards he's going to show you Joseph could know because he had the vision oh I'm gonna rule or my brother's gonna bow down before me my dad's gonna bow down before me he knew somehow that's going to be a part of it we may not know but we've got to trust God's sovereignty amen that God is sovereign he'll mate he'll make all the events happen for a purpose there's a time and season for everything and I just got to be obedient in the time and season everything significant in your life now this is beautiful the good news about the test is that God will not give you a test you can't pass Amen hallelujah as a teacher as far as I know I've never given a student a test they couldn't pass I tried to prepare them I gave them all the information I could possibly do how much more is God gonna do that for us he will not give us a test it's impossible for us to pass he promised it and first Corinthians 10:13 and then church when you pass it so he prepares you for the test you pass it then he rewards you for passing it that's what the Bible says James 1:12 let's read that Hebrews 1:2 of blessed is a man that endureth the test just got to get through the test for when he is tried he should receive the crown of life which the LORD hath promised to them that love him so I'm not going to give you a test you can't pass but then when you pass it you get a great reward glory now that to me that sounds like a loving Heavenly Father that doesn't find it sound like a cruel God or a cruel judge that sounds like a got grace in mercy let's stand to our feet here the last scriptures of what William was still with us here I think I preached the whole sermon kind of on this thought go to 2nd chronicles 32 31 if you got your Bibles I'll stop right here have you enjoyed the Word of God tonight amen it's just a good reminder to me all these thoughts coming together we've got to look at our lives through one of these metaphors one of these views because this is how God views your life it's not a roller coaster you're just not hanging on for dear life like we went to the roller coasters last year acacia was hanging on for dear life and that 95 mile or 80 90 mile per hour a roller coaster so was I location we were both hanging on for dear life that's that that's that you don't see roller coaster in God's Bible do you life is just a roller coaster just hang on try not to get trying to fall off no God clearly calls it a race that you can win God calls it a test that he knows you can pass this is not too hard second chronicles first ascent chronicles 30 to 31 you got that Lydia you got that oh it's a cowboy I'll get it I just thought maybe somebody had here 10 chronicles 32 31 I preached the whole sermon when brother William was here I remember that on a Sunday night I'll be in the business of the ambassador's of the princes of Babylon who sent unto him to inquire the wonder that was done in the land God left him to try him that he might know all that was in his heart remember when I preached that you didn't remember that God left Hezekiah to see what was in his heart God kind of stepped back a little bit well let's see if my anointing leaves him let's see how he acts remember Church this was after Hezekiah got sick the Bible said he threw his hands against the walls like give me there are 15 more years and God gave it to him but then God left him and said let's see how he acts now and we all know what happened the Babylonian princess came in said oh would it be okay if the Catholic Church look at the great things of God can you show us all your mysteries and and can we see all the vessels of God and he has get has it guys like sure he's all prideful yeah come on and you can you can touch and and see all the lower lash I'll show you all these mysteries and the Bible said don't cast your pearls before swine and because of that as a kind I'd was God angry at him he got so exalted and lifted up he let unclean people go into a clean and holy place that's not how it works in those days you had to be clean to come in a church the same thing could be for us Oh somebody that they're kind of like a they kind of act like a believer oh but but yeah you're part of the church you can do communion and you can do everything with us and find out later they're not really they don't treat it as reverently as they ought to or be some of something like this oh you're new the church oh you can come and you can preach right away you just you're right in the right in the faith oh you can come right up to the piano and you you can just have a position here or you can ride away you can be a Deaconess oh yeah yeah you're right in there and they're not they haven't proved a holy life yet so God left him to try him now the thing with us churches like this brother Branham said when he lied he said there's like a black sheet that came down between him God and God had done talking to him I don't remember that but at the same time the Bible said he was sealed with the Holy Ghost unto the day of his Redemption so what does that mean it means he's got three parts soul body spirit and so God cut off the anointing from his body and the spirit but not the soul right because God said I'll never leave you or forsake you that's what Hebrews 13 says so God took all the feelings out the visions out remember Abraham said that for two weeks he said let me pout when I said you owe me to understanding why this woman died in the hospital that was saved you know when she was should've drowned he got arrested you only understanding and the black sheep came down he said God let me cry it out for two weeks no one didn't feel God didn't feel nothing but yet he was sealed by the Holy Ghost the whole time Church you and I ought to be feel grateful when we can feel God's presence because brother Graham many numerous times in his life made mistakes like we all do and couldn't feel God's presence in other words come to church in you don't feel the anointing you don't feel the sacredness you don't feel the sweetness of the Holy Spirit we should live close to God obedient to God that we can always feel as presence there may be times we know in those times God is was testing us God was seeing well what are you gonna do when you're all alone and you're at a hotel and there's a TV there you're gonna turn it on and watch one of those movies oh it's a free movie we're gonna watch it what do you do you're all alone and here's this temptation what are you gonna do sometimes God will try us like that won't he how many want to pass the test by God's grace the Bible said the pride of his heart it was pride and he's an example of someone not dying prematurely but post maturely he lived longer than God wanted to live post maturely

name Amen praise God may be seated here I like to just just go over a few quotes just stay there America I just keep playing them this just let me just say like this I'm gonna do this just a little test we got a pass and what is the test to not criticize our brothers and sisters in Christ switch back over then I want to show a few quotes I told you on Sunday I wanted to share those again I like to do that tonight just real briefly and I have these videos I saved them if you want to watch him you know I shared him with Wendy I think I knew she wouldn't be our Wednesday night so I told her you know before she left some of the quotes and I shared some of the videos and and then after this we'll pray for the movement here I believe it's if I believe it's just a movement that gets got off track I believe they're sweet sincere say people I believe they're off track by taking preachers on the pulpit and then criticizing those who do have preachers in the pulpit so Bob Arum said when the seventh church age comes the he'll be a prophet you'll know he's a prophet because they'll be in that word exactly as God gave it to Paul so brother Branham was supposed to give us this right here and not change one thing that Paul said he said he won't deviate from that word for one moment not by one iota now here's what's been said it was a literal quote from a certain Brandon family member says God's Word which is the tapes and they say it's the tapes or nothing now what does this do Church this exalts the tape on equal level as the Bible and I believe that's wrong I believe the Bible is on its own level do the tapes contain many truths yes but the tapes are not the Bible the tapes points you to the Bible they say the tapes which is the worst so see what they've done they made a man infallible they made every word a man said they've said they made it thus saith the Lord that's wrong that's wrong and the second one this is word for word this is what a family member said the make believers so remember there's three kinds of believers and we are called make believers I can let you listen to it if you want make believer says man I don't know if playing the tapes is right or not it could be I don't know my pastor says if I play tapes in the church and we listen to them I'm a lazy pastor that's the make believer he says well the family says if you don't play tapes all the time you're I'm sorry when you play tapes all the time you're a believer you're a real believer if you struggle with should we play tapes or you live preachers you're a make believer see so all my preaching too something to this movement is make belief that Church let me say this I'm not a make believer I believe this word I've I wasn't raising the message I don't know nothing I didn't know about it I left everything to this message like I told the guy on the the YouTube the message believer or the the Jeffersonville guy I said the message is not the tapes brother Manson the message is the Bible vindicated word that God promised the message is the Bible I believe every word of the message because the message is the Bible brother Branham says now here's the test we're gonna get angry with it am i angry tonight I'm gonna pass this test I'm not gonna fail this test somebody calls me a make believer I'm not gonna let me tell you you're an unbeliever I'll do you one better no sir I'm gonna pass this test let me say like this God's gonna prove who's the believer and to make I'm gonna make believe let me say like that I'm not gonna Pat myself look at me I'm a believer and Jefferson movement Jeffersonville movement is a make believer I'm not saying that tonight I'm saying though I'm a believer I believe that with all my heart if I if I don't say that something's wrong with my faith well am i a make believer or not what am I see you have to say you're a believer they better understand what I'm saying you have to say you're a true believer but the test is are you gonna point the finger right back and say you're a make believer you're an unbeliever no sir no sir I see my life as a test I see my life as a race I'm not gonna pick up those those critical stones and try to run a little faster with these 20-pound stones a year they make my layer I'm not gonna run the race like that I'm gonna lay those weights aside I'm gonna run real smooth I'm just gonna be real patient and run the race without any weight of sin hindering my walk with God okay are you gonna email them back and text them back oh you better believe that with all the sweetness in my heart like today I was called because I made a comment about that made a comment and the it was the tape the tape boys from a certain country in Africa they call themselves the tape boys I can show it to you if you want afterwards the tape boys from a certain country in Africa they said well you wouldn't they said if you were a tape person you wouldn't even ask these questions and they said you're not even a real preacher and I left everything to preach the message I got two choices either I can fail the test I can pass the test I've ever written him back but I'm gonna write him back tomorrow in the morning after I pray I'm gonna pass the test I'm gonna say I'm not going to stoop to your level I might not even say that I'm gonna say well you're a child to your opinion but here's what brother Branham said show me what Paul said I'm the prof of the age I real sit down and preach no he said you preach the word he said preaches the faithful men that they can preach it also Amen rightly divide the word of truth don't sit down preach the word brother BAM said I'm not the only trouble on the beach he said we need more of them he said if God calls do you preach get out there and preach it we need more of them huh well the Branham says we need more preachers but the people say say what the tape say say what the tape say are not saying what the tapes say so that's fine you don't fine I'm not gonna call you make believer I'm gonna call you my brother and I'll let God sort it out because at the test church I got a pass to test how does that make you feel Lydia and a man says all your daddy's not a preacher how does that make you feel now guys that make you feel kind of putting them on the spot that thank you sir it would make me feel bad if somebody said something about you oh you're just a bunch of snakes in here let's basically kind of what they're saying you're make believers these aren't snakes these are God's lambs God's sweet little lambs and you know what the family member said the family member said their church is the lion's den now did you catch that what is the Lions that in the Bible the Lions then was Daniel the prophets test and the Lions were the enemies so God had to close the mouth of the Lions and this family member said their church his the Lions dead making it something like it's good the lion's den was not good God had to save them from the Lions then I thought how striking they admit they're the lion's den we're not the Lions then were the fold of the Sheep praise God and we say that with love it's just the test that the last one you know that's last one but just close with that let's pray for our friends in Jeffersonville they might not believe I'm a pastor or you know someone's not everybody horse but you know they might not believe I'm a believer but I believe God knows I'm a believer and that's really all that matters and God wants me to pass the test and I'm not the judge but Christ is the judge and Christ will all sorted out I'm gonna be one of those three that's for sure believer make-believe or unbeliever and I'm gonna run the race with patience that I can win the prize to have the fellowship with Christ and his sufferings Heavenly Father we love you lord thank you for Lord this life has erased this life as a test surely we can see this is just the test Lord just gotta pass him gotta go back and study the word go back and study my notes from the Bible and surely we can pass this test help us to be a meek bunch of sheep dear God with backbone of course the Sheep has a backbone they're not jellyfish give us some backbone Lord but help us to stand there like innocent humble sweet sinless sheep dear God it will be grateful God we will love Lord when it doesn't seem like it's easy help us Lord Jesus and help our brothers and sisters that your jeffersonville of course not everybody feels that way there but Lord these are direct quotes from family members of your prophet dear Lord we just want to keep the right balance in the scripture we don't want any leaven getting into the doctrine dear God we just want pure unleavened bread of the Word of God we want every dot and iota from Paul's message to be in this message amen we don't want to take one word away or add one word he was just every word of all he meant every word it's revealed to him there and Arabia dear God amen as Paul said I did not learn this from men I'm not here to please men but I learned this from the revelation of Jesus Christ amen read it Lord God let us live by the revelation of Jesus Christ and then we'll love those who speak against this blessed are you and men persecute you for my name's sake help us Lord to be real Christians by the Holy Spirit I know you will Lord you've helped me at least twelve and a half years as a pastor I know you'll help me the next by the grace of God probably to be a faithful servant to you we love you Lord we look forward to meeting you you want to run this race faster than we ever have in
