sing a special thank you for honoring your daddy's request i appreciate that so i got to make reminders there lydia to have you guys sing every other week or something like that you know i really appreciate that beautiful thank you wonderful songs brother really enjoyed that by god's grace beautiful praise god ephesians chapter 5 verse 32 i'd like to start this next chapter here this is chapter 4 of the upcoming book by god's grace it's called the mystery of the new testament church as the bride of christ so this is uh we finished lord willing wednesday night if you didn't listen that that was on daniel's 70 weeks we kind of finished with that uh and i just got an email about that today from a brother overseas i thought that was really uh interesting i don't know if he listened to it or not but if it's not then that would be really interesting like perhaps god's working on both ends to help people out but um we finished chapter three up and then we're looking at chapter four here today by god's grace can you just real quick switch over to my phone just for a moment before we read the text i just want to show the progress we got so far on the book um so i'm actually 57 percent done because yesterday i finished the rapture so it's i did the rough draft was that was all done september um and then i was waiting for all the edits from my one editor but she kind of stopped editing i don't know why but lydia started to help me back up so lydia thank you so uh i just got one two three four lydia is currently editing the seven church age chapter uh but the final ones this one's now done too so i'm 57 done and uh i just thought you know you know with my other editor not helping out it's kind of slowed me back a little bit but i'm not quitting praise god i'm not a quitter i think it's going to help people and anyways that's just kind of my progress there by god's grace i just i'm really sharing it to you to encourage me not to quit okay because i know it gets uh anytime you do a long project or something like that you gotta just gotta keep yourself encouraged like david you just got to encourage yourself in the lord so i just thought i'd kind of show that for my sake i don't give up and quit got to stay focused here so ephesians 5 32 we'll look at the church as the bride of christ it's a great mystery paul says not a small one not a sin not a not an easy mystery or something like that it's a great mystery ephesians 5 32. all right let's just read that together on three one two three this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church let's have one more word of prayer here ask the lord to minister to us heavenly father good lord our hands are up our hearts are up lord we're humbled here in your presence lord we're grateful for the service this morning the worship and the word and the fellowship in between lord we're just so happy we're so thankful for all that you've done lord and oh lord you're you're moving us you're driving us into a preparation for your coming and we're excited lord as your prophet said if if the lord would have asked him any time to live he would have chose this time and so lord although the pressures seem to be mounting lord god yet we know we have peace with you lord god and you'll you'll deliver us from this lord god you promise not to let your bride go through the wrath of god so we thank you for that lord god and we ask here tonight god you'll minister to us by the word of god through the holy spirit i do pray lord for jose god and for his daughter jolene god that you'll open up the way that she can get home this is her third try to go home please open up the way let her have a negative covet test dear god and please bring healing to brother jose lord in jesus name lord i pray for stephen as well or he uh there's a question about his job situation lord we just pray lord you provide him a secure job lord god just guide him lord god and uh either restore this company's ability to to have employees or lord open up a better job for him lord god and bless him as he labors for you lord god as he works on his schoolwork and father lastly for sister naomi lord just give her and eden and the children rest there lord god minister to them here even in the home lord god minister to nature and virtue and eden and sister beatrice and all the saints dear god bless them god let them get rested up tonight here and father we're just so grateful lord for all the sacrifices lord the saints in the house of god receive our worship receipt receive our praise tonight lord anoint me to speak anointing us all to hear in jesus christ's name the church said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise the lord i don't have any quotes really to show tonight i'm just going to be preaching kind of off my notes here for this uh chapter here yeah if you can just remember brother stephen in prayer he said their company is getting rid of their machines a little bit so he's not sure about the future of that company and everybody needs employment so let's remember him by the grace of the lord jose's daughter i guess this is her third chance to try to fly out to nicaragua he said and they're not refunding her ticket money either because she they didn't get the covent test or something like that so it's not a very good situation let's just remember them in prayer that this week they'll be able to get that out uh let's pray for that here okay i think that's it all right okay so let's look to the word of god here tonight uh here's what i like to do i like to just look at uh the text here uh the confusion surrounding this why is this such a great mystery or what is the mystery of this topic and then uh i want to show how jesus defines this as a mystery uh and jesus defines that the church is the bride because it really doesn't matter what any denomination says it matters what jesus said praise god and jesus calls a certain group as his bride and he calls himself the bridegroom and then lord willing i think i'll just close with astor so give me i'll set a 45 minute timer again here i'll try not to wear you out or wear myself out i hope you enjoyed the word of god this morning was it a blessing praise god i hope so and i apologize you know bang and see it couldn't be here but uh uh we do have do we do we do the audacity on that one okay that's right because we stopped because we're out of okay yep so i he and i could just talk about that in this there's really nothing that too deep in there but anyways lord bless them and good to see them in the house of lord tonight praise the lord so uh we start with ephesians 5 32 paul he's just laid out from verse 22 to 32 how a man and woman are to treat one another in the christian home and this is totally different to any roman culture right as we looked at that last year uh roman culture a woman was just a piece of property just like a a table or a chair and a man could have her you know beaten or you know divorced and all anything just like the children the man had total control he could have bad things happen to the women children um and they didn't really have any respect one to another right um but then the christian way of life that paul was introducing was totally it was like 180 it was upside down literally or spiritually it turned their lives upside down praise god because it didn't make the man the know-it-all it made the man the servant right he's not the he's not the arrogant lord or he's a know-it-all it actually made him the servant and turn the total upset upside down because jesus christ came not to be served but to be the servant and so that's why i look at my life as a husband i'm a servant how can i serve my family uh my selfishness gets in the way but the holy spirit gives me more grace praise god amen that's i hope that hope everybody can relate to that you know we all need to uh overcome our selfishness but paul uh paul lays it out in 22-20 i'm sorry 22-32 the bulk of this chapter deals with these verses and i'm not going to go through this tonight but there's five instructions he gives to married couples there's five instructions and he says this is a great mystery so see sisters your life is a mystery to the world brothers when you're a real man your life is a mystery not a small one it's a great mystery how our families can operate with such unity how there can be such love in a home praise god because my wife and i surely grew up in a home where there was no message believers there right and we know the hurt we know the pain caused in a home like that and and people come now and they talk about the love they feel in our house you know and they talk about the spirit of god you know one time my mom came and visited for a few days and she left weeping she's saying this is she said this is amazing this family she said i just i think she called it the picture perfect family and i'm not boasting or anything like that we can only boast in christ but when you apply god's word to your house you get results from it and so i remember one time she left weeping and crying saying this is just such a blessing and so that was vindication to me that we're on the right road where jesus is the way i'm on the way he's the truth he's the life right uh and so this is a great mystery it's a great thing to try to grasp and understand that two people can be so uh dedicated to one another in service to one another praise god and so paul uses a marriage relationship uh to express this mystery praise god now i'm going to get right to it like i said i'm going to try to watch my time here tonight uh so the confusion that i've found at least in the people i have talked with is who is the bride which group is the bride now there's a small group uh there's a small group that doesn't even think there's a bride now the reason i say that's because when we first started this church we put up a website in 2008 or 2009. you know bride of christ fellowship at the top and i started getting numerous emails like what do you mean you're the bride there's no such thing as a bride and i'm like i typed in these verses like from john chapter three like jesus says there's a bride and i can't remember what their justification was for that but it didn't move me at all because i know the bible says that there's a bride amen so there's a small group that doesn't really believe the bride is a physician but most churches recognize jesus has a bride but the question is who is she and uh what which group is she now some people say like the universalist they'll say everybody's the bride right every but we know that's not true right we know uh there's a group that's the wise virgin that's the bride there's a foolish virgin she's the rejected bride and then there's the imposter bride right the roman catholic church so there's really if you look at scripture there's three brides right if you look at the scripture there's the wise the virgin they're both saved one's the true bride uh one's rejected and then the third is the imposter who has the abominations on her foreheads right mother harlot mystery babylon and her daughters and she's got daughters so the evidence is not in what the groups claim the evidence is in the way they live praise god that proves they are the bride of christ like brother adam said the beauty of a church is the character of the people right it's it's judged in how obedient they are to jesus's commands so here's the revelation i just remember i try to summarize these in one sentence the revelation is the true church submits to all of jesus's commands now with the promises of being raptured and then ruling and reigning with her husband in the millennium praise god so that's what i found because jesus said uh when you're born of god you are guided into all truth by the holy spirit amen praise god so uh this is uh all devoted to that this next teaching so get your bibles ready let's go through i'm going to get lydia malachi anybody else want to read let me know i i'll i'll take all the reasons elizabeth you want to read all right i saw her raise your hand thank you appreciate that so we'll have we'll go lydia malachi and elizabeth for readers okay lydia mark 2 19-20 uh malachi john 3 28 malachi and then elizabeth revelation 22 17. let's do those three i'll be preaching a little bit in between here just to kind of give my thoughts okay what i thought were inspirations from the holy spirit okay so let me go ahead mark 2 19 and 20. amen okay so jesus here calls himself the bridegroom what a strange thing he's a young rabbi preacher right a lot of people like him at the beginning he's healing everybody after a while he starts bringing out the correction he starts bringing out the doctrine and the prophecy and then they hate him but he calls himself the bridegroom i'm the bridegroom beautiful now twice in two parables we're not going to read these but you're familiar in the king sun parable in matthew 22 verses 1 to 14 jesus places himself he's the engaged son who's awaiting believers who will accept the father's invitation to come to his wedding and wear the right garments praise god he places himself as the son getting married praise god amen praise the lord and then you know the ten versions the parable of the ten versions he likens him himself unto the the bridegroom who comes at an unknown hour and those that are ready got to go out to meet him praise god amen they got to get their oil they got to get all all the oil they got stored up they got to clear off their wicks and get it all prepared and go out to meet the bridegroom and then the bridegroom says tells that the foolish version no you can't come in right i never knew you so what what a picture there what a picture so you have a group that's the trooper that goes in as part with the bride and then a group that's kept out she's rejected so it's perfection in three we can see it again what a picture now this is beautiful john the baptist how many believe was a prophet cause jesus the bridegroom and us the bride so malachi can you read that john 3 28-31 christ please but that i have set before him he that has to write a surprise to the friend of the bridegroom which stands for here's him greatly because with the brightest voice this is my this might be their first fulfill he amen he read the next verse he that cometh from god or from above all amen so that shows john is speaking of heavenly things praise god he's talking about a heavenly bridegroom a heavenly bride praise god i love that see a real prophet of god who's got the spirit of elijah he just rejoices hearing the voice of god he doesn't call i'm the voice of god like they're saying today you know what they're saying today brother man is the voice of god no no he's the friend of the bridegroom praise god he rejoices in the voice of jesus praise god what a difference my that's a good scripture to use for that group i never thought about that till now he said i'm not the christ john says he said he that hath the bride see we're not married to brother branham we're married to jesus christ amen brother pointed us to jesus christ hallelujah oh thank the lord praise god and he stands there rejoicing because of jesus's voice amen hallelujah so brother had to rejoice in what jesus was saying the word of god praise god and that made his joy fulfilled i love this now listen he must increase i must just decrease boy but a lot of people don't like that one around the message john the spirit of elijah has to decrease that christ may increase amen now it's interesting a lot of people say we have the spirit of elijah now and left brother branham and comes on us i don't know about that i can't find that in the scripture uh myself unless you use the type of elijah and elisha but then we've got to find like where brother am taught that so that could be a whole nother subject i have to study on that but see the idea is the the man the one who's pointing to the messiah has to decrease so that jesus may be emphasized right and and uh you know we've all been to churches where they say brother and brother brandon brother and it's just it's too much right it's too much emphasis on brother branham right there's times we need to mention the prophet of god just like you would uh you know john or paul or any of those so to us it's the same thing right uh because brother adam is pointing back to the word right like martin luther pointed back to the word but there's this idea where church we have to have in other words we have to have our own testimony we're not getting to heaven on brother branham's testimony right brother didn't fight your battles with our bridegroom praise god amen and i know that gets you know some people's feathers ruffled but if you really understand it you'll see it's true our emphasis has to be on the holy spirit uh interacting hearing his voice and seeing him live in our lives amen okay elizabeth you want to try revelation 22 17. whoever amen praise god beautiful you have the bride and jesus speaking together at the end time praise god so right here before the end time the spirit that's the holy spirit that's jesus and the bride are saying come praise god amen both are hearing both are speaking right she's speaking with him she's saying what he said praise god they're giving it out and they're inviting anyone to come and see praise god now let me just lay this in here i didn't really plan to preach this but go to john 17 verse 9. i don't have this in the book but go to john 17 verse 9. you know i've heard people say oh don't pray for the world because jesus didn't pray for the world well it's kind of different you know jesus god would have given him understanding on who to pray for and who not to right but look the bible just said whosoever will let him come that's everybody right so the bible just said the holy spirit and the bride invite everybody to come so we would do the same thing we invite everybody to come but we know not everybody will come right but it has to go to all nations i have to go to every people group right um but now jesus he had god gave him special knowledge so if you read john 17 9 i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which thou hast given me for they are thine so it's interesting here jesus says i don't pray for the world but did you catch us after you resurrected he said go into all the world and preach the gospel praise god see that so jesus he had only had a short time on earth 33 years he couldn't spend his time praying for this the world right before this is this isn't right before he goes to gethsemane many many scholars say this is on the way to gethsemane he's talking about the holy spirit's going to come and he's praying and he says i'm not praying for the world i'm praying for those that you've given me that will hear the word of god so jesus directly prayed for the elect amen for you and i praise god in fact i wrote that my book brother amen i choked to bang too but he's a little bit further away i said jesus prayed for me neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word jesus prayed for me he prayed for you he prayed for all those that would hear the gospel through all the preachers ordained all down through the age that's you and i amen and if you pray for peter brother banging it hell it'll it'll it'll hold for us as well because he prayed for us amen hallelujah thank the lord i said i'll tell you what it's held for about these 20 years serving god amen it's been holding strong by god's grace the anchor holds amen though the ship gets battered the anchor holds i just want to lay that out he says i'm not praying for the world he said but go into all the world and he said bride he said the spirit of the bride say whoever wants to come let him come praise god that's why we still pray for sinners right that's why we that's why we still pray for uh anyone to come to be saved because we don't know all right so does that help by god's grace so be encouraged you know if the holy spirit tells you not to pray for somebody don't pray for but if the holy spirit don't tell you to pray for them pray for them pray for mercy right pray for grace okay because the voice of jesus will be in the bride the bride will be saying the same thing according to the scripture thank you now lydia uh revelation uh well you know i'm going to skip that one because that yeah i'm going to skip that okay i would do it on time okay good uh let's show your church how god uh how long is this section here let's see that one's kind of a long one um yeah let me just lay it in here real quick well sorry i'm trying to decide this looks like a long one i guess we'll have to read all this yeah so let me just show you how god uh i'll just refresh your memory how god searched for a bride out of israel but then she turned him down right so god had divorced him so let's look at those scriptures here tonight just so you have an idea now let's start with the good part how god because of his love he called israel he basically espoused himself to israel married israel but because of her unfaithfulness he had to put her away let's start with that to show you it's all based upon love amen god started saving israel because he loved them god saved you because he loved you praise god amen i love reaching out the love of god i just it makes me happy i think that god would love me amen a sinner but god could make me a saint praise god so deuteronomy 4 37 these are scriptures i found recently last year reading the word of god so lydia deuteronomy 4 37 malachi deuteronomy 7 verse 8. and then elizabeth you could go to ezekiel 16 verse 60. all right so lydia deuteronomy 4 37 malachi deuteronomy 7 verse 8. see god's plan has always been to make a a human group his wife that's always been his plan right that's what was in the garden he made a man a man and woman in his own image right what'd he do he created a marriage a marriage praise god a man and a woman if i'm gonna if he was gonna represent himself in any way he could have used anything right could he's rocks he could use mountains i'm gonna represent myself as a man and a woman because that was his plan all down through the age all right so malachi do you remember me i'm sorry lydia drew army force 37 amen because he hated their fathers no he loved their fathers he loved abraham he loved isaac he loved jacob praise god he loved those faithful men and women of god you believe that amen amen malachi deuteronomy 7 verse 8. amen so the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established god called israel because he loved them god calls you the bible says for his great love wherewith he loved you the bible said it's a ephesians 2 4 but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us god's love is running after you god's love is constantly pursuing you praise god it's all about god's love amen okay now let's go to elizabeth there in ezekiel 1660. whenever you're ready hon [Music] [Music] amen now i had to read the end of it because in the beginning it's very descriptive i don't know if you remember this chapter but god finds israel he says in a in a pool of blood and he said he rescues her uh she's a neglected baby in a field and he saves her nurtures her until she's of marrying age and then he enters into a marriage covenant with her she became his and he clothed her and doctor in beauty and worldwide renown praise god it's because of love right he loved this woman he loved israel sadly her pride just like just like lucifer her pride caused her to find other lovers she became a harlot with every nation and i doubt her and guilty of abortion the bible says that israel forgot god's grace in rescuing her from her humble beginnings i'll say it like that her polluted beginning but god would ultimately forgive her like elizabeth read praise god nevertheless i'll remember my covenant with thee amen see even though she doesn't keep the covenant god said i'm keeping the covenant praise god because no man was was strong enough to keep the covenant only god who makes the covenant praise god amen god was going to forgive them now let's look in the scripture where you can see how they god had to put her away so lydia jeremiah 3 verse 8. uh yeah three verse eight so whenever you're ready okay this is jeremiah let me check the year on that jeremiah 3 8. okay that's 600 years bc wow yeah 629 bc okay so god already tells him he's going to give him a a divorce bill over there sorry i was looking at malcolm like where's your bible and he's holding zion that's okay buddy keep holding that i just was caught off guard there okay so uh jeremiah 3 now jeremiah 3 verse 14. let me read that because it says turn o backsiding children saith the lord for i am married unto you so god said he's go he's going to put her away he can divorce her but then still begging her turn and come back to me because i'm married to you right and then israel leaving her husband is in verse 20 jeremiah 3 20. surely as a wife treacherously departed from her husband so have he dealt treacherously with me o house of israel saith the lord see god was a faithful husband praise god god was a faithful husband it was the wife right it was unfaithful israel who uh was unfaithful now in verse 22 yet god will offer divine forgiveness return ye backsliding children and i will heal your backslidings behold we come unto thee for thou art the lord our god the same thing's true the same thing is true today anybody that backslides they can come back to god if they want to praise god that's why we pray for them praise god especially our family members right those even the mind that have been in church backs in and out uh no longer serve god we know god's still there god wants to heal god wants to bring restoration god wants them to do the first works if they'll just accept it this is how great of love our god has a faithful covenant keeping god amen praise god now i think i'll stop there just uh because there's a whole lot more on that one let's get to esther i got about 21 minutes there to hit 45 minutes so everybody feeling good tonight okay praise god i just like to stop and make sure everybody's happy and everybody's doing good by god's grace okay let's just go to esther um if you've got your bibles let's turn to esther now in the book i got eight women who specifically typed the bride of christ the gentile bride uh it could be jude i guess yeah i'm sorry it's jew gentile bride because jews are grafted all nations are grafted into the bride all nations there's a small remnant the bible says of jews in the bride okay so sarah rebecca azinath rahab samson's bride from timnath esther i'm sorry ruth esther and solomon's wife the shulamite so in the book i got those eight women you can all see how they type the gentile the jew gentile bride of christ i gotta have to say that because it's not just gentiles it's youtube okay let's go down here you've got your bibles let's look at uh esther just a beautiful picture here it's been a while since i preached on this um so we'll just go over what i got here in the the scripture now esther is a jewish queen of the persian king xerxes during 6th century bc this is not long after jeremiah okay and she types the new testament bride church so xerxes must type christ then xerxes previous queen vashti whom he put away now this is maybe different for some people i believe she types israel because he was already married to her right if we were saying with the scripture the foolish virgin was never married because she'd never been born again right she never never received the covenant right so that's different than some preachers preach it i can't see it the other way i can only see it this way i believe vashti types israel because he has to put israel away or blind her right you gotta put her away uh like a bill of divorcement just like isaiah 51 verse i'm sorry isaiah 50 verse 1 says let me read that isaiah 50 verse 1. isaiah 51 thus saith the lord where is the bill of your mother's divorcement whom i have put away or which of my creditors is is two i'm sorry is it two whom i have sold you behold for your iniquities have you sold yourselves and for your transgression is your mother put away okay so the god explains iniquity is what drives someone away from god they sell out to iniquity they sell out righteousness right they sell that out so they can have iniquity i can do whatever i want and so because of that because they take a a lifestyle a habit of iniquity god puts them away he's forced to put him away in divorcement because they're not living true to the covenant okay so vashti has to represent israel as far as i understand praise god now next in the story christ has to go looking for a virgin bride amen esther 2 verse 2 says the king servants that ministered unto him said let there be a fair young virgins sought for the king praise god amen hallelujah so it was a requirement that the wife be pure praise god speaking of the gentile or the jew gentile bride of christ this type is awesome praise the lord mordecai esther's cousin urges her to enter the contest to become xerxes new wife mordecai the elder staunch jew seems to type the law of moses as a school master pointing us to jesus christ so he seemed because he said go go enter go enter the wedding contest right see if you can win the beauty contest how many people would like that today i would like that that wouldn't be very good would it but he's like go point he's pointing point to xerxes amen point to christ hallelujah that related that related uncle or loretta related cousin rather pointing this pure girl pointing her to the husband christ see if you can be the true bride amen see if you could be the one the king delights in amen hallelujah the bride that jesus delights in that's you and i amen out of all the other like brother brother said brides and brides and churches and churches there will be one bride who's the chosen bride amen so uh this spiritual type is second corinthians 11 2 for i'm jealous over you with godly jealousy for i've espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ so this is the type esther wins the beauty contest by adorning herself according to hegei's requirements and nothing more let's read that praise god that's esther 2 15. lydia can you get that one for me esther 215 amen praise god now haggai represents the holy spirit's work of sanctification it's the second work of grace the first work is she's she's called she's justified to join that group right she's and that's what justification does it separates us from our past life right just like we're saying about tonight the red sea are you guys thinking about that that red sea types justification oops sorry get too close to that see that brings you out of your past life into a new life so did esther being chosen that was justification the second stage is sanctification amen keep do everything haggai says that's the second work of grace do everything in and then perhaps you'll get the seed life from the king right all right i know we're kind of being straight here but that's that's that's the story god gives us right i mean it's kind of kind of out there but this is the story if you if you're going to become the wife of the king and receive a seed life you got to go through this work of grace amen and he doesn't add any she doesn't do anything outside just what the bible says praise god and read that if you read that there's no makeup in there yeah they try to tell me that all the time there's oils and spices but there's no makeup in there the bible calls it paint ah these people add that's why they get their they get in trouble with those bible versions right the bible versions might not make up the false ones but not the true word of god just what haggai commands see she lives by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god now um elizabeth can you get romans 2 29 now i'm going to say a few things before you get there so take your time romans 2 29 let me get back to this as she's going to romans 2 29 esther's wedding night types the christians born again experience because new birth is likened under receiving seed in first peter 1 23 and i know that's graphic but this is the wedding night is typical being born again it's a type of the born-again experience according to first peter 1 23 i'll read that because it's a reception of life first peter 1 23. oh there we go hebrews james first and second peter okay sorry first peter 1 23 being born again not of corruptible seed but in but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever praise god so when a person's born again the the seed they receive is a a seed of life and he says we don't have incorruptible seed like a natural man right but we've got incorruptible seed the life of god amen amen so when esther goes in there on that wedding night and receives the life of the king it types the baptism of the holy ghost praise god amen all right now here's though here's the the most glorious parts of this revelation outwardly everybody thinks esther is a gentile but inwardly she's a jew elizabeth go ahead romans 229 this is the beauty beautiful part of the type inwardly yep [Music] hey man that beautiful paul's got to tell him who's the real jews here the one the real jew are the one who serves god with a pure heart their hearts have been circumcised in other words the extra fleshly desires have been separated from them can i say like this permanently praise god amen i'm permanently separated from most of my sins can i say it like that everybody understand i'm permanently separate i'm never going to go back to them again i can't you can't it's dead praise god it's dead amen you can't live you can't connect something dead to something alive praise god i wish i had the intelligence to say it i've got education but no intelligence that's the bad part oh see although she was jewish her real identity was unknown to the king and everyone and all shushen right in other words everybody considered her a virgin gentile she never even lived the day church this is that she never even lived one day in jerusalem so really i mean her whole life speaks of gentile gentile gender and it types she's an inwardly spiritual jew right what does that represent represents you're a child of abraham amen the bible said by faith you're a child of abraham he's the one that started the jewish or the hebrew race that's the one god chose to start it praise god that people because eventually come out of him abraham isaac jacob out of jacob come the 12 sons one of them was judah jew praise god amen glory now here's where we are i'm going to try to finish with this i got 10 minutes if i go 45. thank you for your patience everybody thank you haman's plot to kill the jews including mordecai and esther types the very end of the times the gentiles because remember revelation 12 who's that dragon kind trying to kill the jews remember that let's let's go there we got time romans 12. let's go there i'm sorry not romans 12 oh goodness revelation 12. goodness gracious talking too fast now revelation 12. see because satan still knows that that brought i'm sorry that jewish people is covenanted to god and satan's always against that covenant he's against anything god okay revelation 12 13 and when the dragon saw that he was cast under the earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child that jewish people man child was christ see and to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle amen god likens israel to the eagle the woman's given two eagles i'm sorry two wings like an eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into her place where she's nourished for a time that's a year times two years and a half time half year that's three and a half years so after amen rapture she's got eagle wings oh glory two wings prophet amen moses and elijah amen and through their power they're kept secret praise god for a time a year times and a half a time three and a half years praise god amen that's beautiful glory how she nourished out there in the wilderness verse 15 and the serpent cast out of his mouth waters of flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away the flood that's the and the tribulation period and the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which a dragon cast out of his mouth and the dragon was wrath with the woman jew and went to make war with the remnant of her seed that's 144 thousand which keep the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus christ oh no longer blinded praise god no longer wondering who's the messiah jesus is the messiah oh what a happy people they're gonna be when those blinders come off this whole time they missed it but now they can see jesus was that suffering servant of isaiah 53 praise god amen oh that's beautiful so see who's that dragon after the dragon is after the sun right jesus the man child but anyone connected the people the man child as well so see so haman's plot to kill the jews even mordecai is typed to the times the gentiles so really satan hates all jews and all gentiles all christians right christian jews and even blind jews and gentiles he hates all them that are connected to god now so haman's plot to kill all them is like when the beast out of the earth raises up in revelation 13 11 through 18 because the beast has the plot to kill all both small and great rich and poor bond and free six descriptions there who will not take his antichrist mark right gonna kill everybody that won't take their mark remember what was the image of the beast the world council of churches and church their their website literally says we are to be the image of the church it literally says that i've seen it i've got i got a picture on it on my slideshow their whole goal is to be the image of the church and then and the bible says the image of the beast is going to want to be the ones that uh that uh share forth the mark of the beast so the churches are going to be for that oh shut down any church that won't join us oh it's plainly told in the scripture now he says now the bible says his theme the beast theme is going to be peace and safety right we read that this morning peace and safety peace and safety yeah while they're saying that they're going to outlaw true christianity and institute unionized religion well johnny are you in the union brother yep every year i got to sign my union papers you got to sign them every year too or just the one time that's nice we gotta sign ours every year we gotta sign like we're gonna join again and pay our dues uh and you gotta be in it you you have to pay your dues and you lose i think it's like 900 now a year just to be in that union uh you have to if you're going to be a teacher you got to have the union you got to be in the union rather so the same thing's going to be about churches right you got to sign the paperwork you got to join the union in order to have a church okay so the same thing is with haman's plot now just as haman's plot was foiled by esther's prayer glory i'm looking forward to more prayer in the years to come if the type is right we've got to be a church that's into prayer amen not just prayer but a special kind intercessory prayer we've got to be praying for all of god's people to be delivered praise god she is able to uh foil his plot of killing all the believers all the holy people amen aren't you glad you're holy praise god he's trying to kill all the holy people remember all the people that won't bow down to haman remember he wouldn't mordecai would have bound out bow down to haman satan hates that when you won't bow down oh but let's not bow to anything but christ amen amen satan hates that so he wants to destroy them and it's only going to be foiled through the bride's prayer and intercession to the king oh glory remember they fasted three days before the queen put on her royal apparel and stood before the king remember it could have cost her life it was a life or death situation right but she was willing to die to save her people because she knew she was ordained to be queen for such a time as this amen right church god has called us why were we born in this time why why couldn't we be born a time when jesus was on the earth well because god had us ordained for such a time as this we're to manifest a real grind to christ that's why i was saying if you remember was was it last weekend mother uh the bang i was saying i might not be a prayer warrior yet but i'm gonna be a prayer warrior esther we don't see her as a prayer warrior until the end i'm not discouraging anybody from praying we need to pray every day i pray in the closet this morning and you we all we need to pray to god but her prayers really become powerful at the end of time when the pressure's on amen she becomes a prayer warrior can you imagine that three days of fasting i've never fasted that long three days of fasting before she goes into the queen i'm sorry the king rather willing to die but she knew this is why i won the beauty contest this is the this is why jesus showed me the message amen praise god because i'm supposed to pray for the church i'm supposed to pray for the family god knew i could be a prayer warrior praise god for such a time like this how many women if you had now think about a queen now think about if everybody was serving our think about if everybody was serving you and they brought your food to you when you went like this your food was brought to you that's what esther could have done right she's queen but she turned that down for three days of not eating think about that but she had the character see she was burdened so that her her people weren't destroyed she wanted to see them saved amen so see she had a fast she was so burdened for her people she would turn down luxuries and necessities in order to see life saved amen that's got to be our desire to church right we got to sign cry for the abominations we've got we've got to pray against that we have to pray god deliver your people save the bride uh save us from evil to come don't worry god will bring us down there don't worry just like god brought the pressure around esther he's going to bring the pressure on us too we can't escape it but then god is slow that's what i just said then god is slow like birth pains praise the lord now i gotta laugh but it's uh it's gonna be a serious thing see the pressure's gonna come on slowly like the birth pains a little bit hard a little bit harder a little bit harder but god is going to bring us to that place i believe that's the word of god all right now she gets clothed in the holy spirit's anointing and she becomes a king and priest unto god right because the king is the scepter she gets the the the king points a separator she gets the approval of the the king but she's a priest because she was praying and interceding for god's people see that she has the royal authority she gets the authority of her husband and she's interceding and i like this uh she had access to the highest authority and she took advantage of it at church that's what we got we got access to the highest king of kings to the great the only great president of this of this world amen we have access she went to the act the highest access of the land the highest authority and so do we the bible said we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand praise god see she had access to the grace in which she was standing in she was what she was chosen by grace to be the queen and but that that that queenship gave her access to authority and that's what it does for us praise god it gives us authority before the throne of god how did there's about 45 minutes okay i'm almost done here okay so bear with me or let me set up a five minute timer here hopefully i can get that in five minutes thank you for your patience church thank you uh almost done here now just as esther had political pressure there's coming a time for us of political pressure a squeeze time upon the bride church at some point the false churches are going to unite with the political leaders it's more obvious than ever right now right they're just going to give in whatever they want oh it wasn't that georgia guy wasn't he a former preacher that georgia senator who won i think he was a preacher he's got a history of sexual abuse and all kinds of abuse i'll probably get censored for that anyway so the false churches are going tonight with the political system and change the laws we're going gonna feel the pressure of the movement but we're trusting that jesus will spare us from the hour the mark is laid down according to revelation 3 10 because thou has kept the word of my patience i also keep thee from the our temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth oh that's a promise i'm holding on to praise god lord i'm keeping you i'm keeping your word lord keep me from that moment when the mark of the beast is laid down that's what he said praise god that's what he told the philadelphia church age right if you keep my word i'll keep you from the temptation that comes upon the whole world amen praise god so what does esther do in that time of the squeeze she prays and fast then she wants to hold a want two wine banquets for the king wine represents joy and the boldness of god's spirit right as taught in acts chapter 2 acts chapter 4 and psalm 16 verse 11 and your presence is fullness of joy so instead of choosing fear in her time of trouble she chooses to honor her king with praise joy rejoicing magnifying his name yeah so see as that time nears we got to have services where we're purposely remember we did a couple weeks ago when canvas here we prayed for the latter rain remember that wasn't that a wonderful time see so we got to keep doing you know as it comes down that's the reality it's going to come to that we have to pray lord come to our banquet amen come to this first banquet send us that ladder or that former rain and then he says what do you want come to the latter rain praise god send us send us the latter and send us another wine banquet amen hallelujah this is so beautiful praise god because brother adam says thus saith the lord out of joel chapter 2. so we'll battle fear right we'll battle fear but we've got to hold wine banquets we've got to host the king in his glory and his beauty and worship him amen praise god we've got to do that we have to keep gathering to magnify his name so these two banquets speak of the former and latter reign from joel 2 23. also church let's read this lydia isaiah 25 verses 6 through 8 and malcolm got your bible now okay malachi first corinthians 15 51-54 now listen these two verses go together isaiah 25 speaks about swallowing death up in victory what does that remind you of the rapture paul says death is swallowed up in victory but look where this scripture comes from it comes from isaiah 25 and it talks about having a wine banquet at the time of the swallowing up of death praise god see we're going to be so drunk on the holy spirit that life is gonna swallow up death amen we won't even fear death because life is present praise god we'll be drunk on the holy spirit praise god right we won't even consider these other things we'll be totally under the influence of the holy spirit praise god oh my i'm under tonight praise god lord i feel like dancing or something praise the lord amen bye see because it's god's spirit we'll take the fear out of it praise god amen isaiah 25 6 through 8 please lydia shalom interesting it kind of sounds like israel right and it may be it may be a compound prophecy but look he will swallow up death in victory that's the rapture scripture so lydia or malcolm read that first corinthians 15 51-54 amen praise god so when this this old pest house gets swallowed up in a brand new body then that saying is fulfilled death is swallowed up in victory praise god if i feel this good in death right now what am i going to feel like when i get a brand new body praise god amen look at that now go back to isaiah 25 in this mountain i wonder if that's the mount zion showdown in this mountain the lord will make a feast of wines on the leaves well refined that means it's going to be really good wine raise god hallelujah he's in this mountain he'll destroy the face of the covering cast over all the people praise god so there'll be no nothing will be hidden anymore praise god he'll swallow up death and victory and the lord will wipe away all tears from off their faces oh my what a day of victory praise god so former rain ladder rain that's what i can see now esther sitting at a table with her husband her greatest enemy haman it's like psalm 23 5. so elizabeth want to get that one psalm 23 5. thank you i should have told you earlier sorry but uh this is what it reminded me of as i was reading through the scripture this summer i thought wow there's esther at a table heyman her greatest enemy there's her her lord her husband you have all three at the table you got nothing to fear praise god because you're uh your head's there your husband's there so yeah i uh psalm 23 5. you know this scripture always i was confused what does that mean in the presence of my enemies how could i have a dinner in the presence of [Music] enemies amen see though there's pressure look the pressure is sitting with her at the table the man who's gonna kill her but while she's there she has nothing to fear because her husband's there thou art with me praise god amen and thou anoint this you've anointed me and not just a little anointing my cup runs over praise god right here i am i got my worst enemy but i got my husband right here praise god see though the pressure's mounting even shutting her doors this anointing will ensure her deliverance praise god david knew his victory didn't come by his power but it came by god's anointing amen same thing for you and i we don't overcome by our ability it's god's anointing that helps us overcome amen praise god amen it was on the day of the second wine banquet esther finally revealed her petition to her husband right and he saved her from her accuser haman she never had to suffer through the hour of death haman had planned because xerxes did away with him right so will the bride church be saved from living through the great tribulation when the mark of the beast is laid down christ will remove his church from off the earth before the tribulation praise god now there's types afterwards of the hundred forty four thousand uh but i'll stop right there by god's grace let's stand to our feet i'm gonna stop right there i already went an hour alright 55 minutes so let's stop right there is it a great mystery church oh what a great mystery christ and the church so you start putting all these types together you get a pretty good picture of what's going to happen and that's why i want to put all together it'll give us a great understanding and now even today helps us understand with you know banning uh uh freedom of speech and everything it gives us a good understanding of how this is all gonna play out by the grace of god amen all right musicians if you'll come let's have a time of prayer and worship if anyone desires prayer you're more than welcome to come we'll be happy to pray with you hallelujah aren't you glad jesus loves you church that he chose you to be his bride he chose us what a what a privilege and uh let's pray for god's anointing right his anointing that no matter who we face no matter what enemy we face god's anointing will rest upon us and our cup will run over praise god heavenly father we just thank you for tonight lord thank you for the word we read lord your son jesus was the one who said he had a bride praise god we saw lord how you put away the jewish bride divorced her like xerxes and vashti the lord you had i had to find a pure bride everybody thought she was gentile [Music] you found one lord who was ordained for such a time as that when satan was going to try to destroy the whole group of believers one shot with the mark of the beast but yet lord you made her a king and priest you say a queen and priest unto god hallelujah thank you jesus lord we know you've called us for such a time as this if that election 60 years ago when the catholics got in cause brother branham to seek your face god made the same thing happen today lord where the bride will begin seeking your face more dear god hallelujah jesus lord this purple curtains on the move dear god coming to maturity help us lord to have that maturity help us to have that anointing let our cups run over lord tonight no matter what enemy comes no matter what trouble comes god let us have that double anointing that full anointing of running over power lord god to overcome evil and do which is good thank you for your assurance in these types of god surely we're close lord to the reality just as joseph was a type of jesus christ esther an inward jew

oaks yes let your holy spirit anointing break every yoke lord god any be setting sin lord anything we struggle any mind battle let the anointing break that yoke i pray in jesus name hallelujah let us
