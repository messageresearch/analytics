said amen god I shoulda beena seated there praise the Lord you'd see the Saints this morning praise the Lord so I yeah okay well ready to go thank you sir thank you so look at this message here today this part seven I was just going to update everybody on my book I finished the rough draft of the book so I have eight chapters and then 43,000 words twenty-seven references all lined up and really really excited about it so I sent I sent an email out to ministers last night and I was hoping that they could read each read one chapter for me and just give me their honest thoughts and feedback that's before I take it to a professional editor I imagine the professional editors not gonna like my book very much but I just want the grammar fixed I'm not gonna delete any of my content because it's the message of the hour but anyways I'm looking I told the minister brothers if you just read it one chapter this week and get back to me and maybe I can edit it for one more week and I'm gonna have my wife edit it she's really good at editing and things like that with grammar and she's you know really educated you know smart like that and then I'm gonna send it to a professional headed her so I imagine this will process will be over in about a month or two and then we can have that book on print and I'm just gonna use them as witnessing tools just to give out if the Lord willing but I'm really grateful for God's strength and to get that done by the grace of the Lord so I just want to update you on that if anybody wants to read the PDF I can email you the PDF really simply it so it's like six hundred some kilobytes it's a really small file if anybody wants to read it it's a lot of words like I said it's 80 pages single-spaced so it's it's a lot of reading but if anybody wants to do any reading let me know by God's grace as we begin let's look at Laodicea again by the grace of the Lord I forgot to change the text here so I got the wrong I got the text from last Sunday so forgive me by updating everything else there so we're at part 54 in the series I did five on emphasis 8 on simona five on Pergamos 7 on Thyatira 9 on Sardis 13 on Philadelphia this is the seventh on Laodicea and just romant reminding you that we are in the age of the open door right now the door of the name of Jesus the door of water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the Godhead as one person this door has just opened up recently from the Philadelphia Church age and so we are the we are the recipients of the open door aren't you glad the door has opened to heaven amen and there there is a door that's open and it's the Baptist of the Holy Ghost it's the eternal life that door of eternal life is open here through the name of God's Son Jesus Christ for that is God's name because the son comes in his father's name this door is opened up despite organizations and synagogues of Satan to raise up the doors opened up and we have to go through the open door for Jesus is the door Amen so glad that Christ is the door and we're here at the Laodicean Church age you know it's been 112 years we're inching closer to I wonder if our age will go longer than Ephesus I wonder but Ephesus was 117 years were at 112 now since we crossed over to 2018 and we're still battling lukewarmness aren't we we're still overcoming lukewarm spirits praise God we're overcoming it with the Eagle anointing hallelujah flying above the church world systems and we're flying up into the heavenly atmospheres of the Word of God and so we're grateful for that now our text today is Jesus's loving correction and the Prophet addresses it in the church age book like this he said and now he says to his own as many as I love I rebuke and chasten now brother man said to reboot rebuke is to reprove to reprove is to expose with a view to correction Jason does not mean to punish it means the discipline because the subjects amendment is in mind so whenever Jesus corrects us his thought is for us to expose or to us to see to expose our weakness Jesus wants to see how weak we are but also give us the vision to where we need to go so he just doesn't you know I some bad parents they just like to punish their children but that's not the Lord the Lord does of course chasing us spanks us you know spiritually we'd say but he always does it and then he gives us the direction on where we need to go so if let's say temper is over you know we're overcome with temper and the Lord has to correct us on her temper he's going to correct us in our temper but then show us how to overcome our temper but man said your temper you you temper your temper he said through prayer you temper your anger through prayer amen and uh you know I got a text from overseas than this this brother keeps texting me like how can I overcome and I want the baptism of the Holy Ghost and every time I get in the setting he's a young man every time I get in the setting I just keep falling and I I said you've got to die you've got to you got to die out because the Bible said when we're baptized with Christ were baptized into his death and sin shall not have dominion over us anymore and so I said you haven't prayed hard enough and he text me back this morning like you're right praise the Lord you know I've got to get closer to God and I said that scripture you know we do not overcome be not overcome with evil he said every time he'd walk into his is gathering with his friends at the study place he said he'd be overcome with evil and I said you've got to overcome evil with good and if you can't overcome that situation at a study group and I'll say like this if we can overcome a situation that we should avoid them until we've got the power to overcome evil with good amen remember your Creator your you create atmospheres you can walk into a situation of anger or bitterness or backbiting you can walk into any situation and by your creative power that God gave to you you can change the atmosphere I'm you've ever seen that happen before in your life where God has used you to change the atmosphere amen it happens numerous times to me at work where I have to change the subject or I have to speak something good about the principle or speak something good about the teacher you got to change that or change or speak something good about the student you've got to change the atmosphere you got to take it from complaining to Thanksgiving praise God got take it from the negative to the positive praise the Lord and so this is how Jesus corrects he exposes he shows us our weakness but he gives us a view this is where you need to go this is how you're going to be corrected through the Word of God and that's why you know whenever I've got to preach a cutting message I may cut and cut and cut but at the end the offers always given come to the altar or come up for prayer come to the cross for healing amen if the words cutting you then you've got to allow it a chance to be healed with the balm of Gilead prays to the heart the balm of the Holy Spirit we've always it's always there's always the view to correction we can overcome we can be amended our character can get better praise the Lord because Jesus is interested in us becoming a better Christian now the love of Jesus the ones he loved would be rebuked and chastened now let's read Hebrews 12 5 through 11 it's worth reading you know when my brother Paul came to visit quite a few years ago in the Waterloo Church he gave a testimony and his scripture for his life was this scripture right here he'd been through numerous car accidents and and his in his testimony he said it was because he was running from the Lord he knew God was allowing injuries and God was allowing car accidents because he wasn't fulfilling the Word of God and I always remember that about his testimony that this was the scripture that he read and as he was reading it that night he was weeping and crying and still thankful that God allowed him to go through the car accidents and still be alive and see the hand of mercy in the midst of the car accidents he'd been in he's been in at least three now and each time has walked away by the grace of God verse 5 and he had forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him now if we're real sensitive we'll get real discouraged if somebody rebukes us how many know what I'm talking about if you're really sensitive boy if somebody rebukes you all it's just like ruins your day in my room you're weak I know it's hard for me to get rebuked sometimes it's hard for brother Brown to be rebuked by his wife when she said Oh bill shame on you for thinking you weren't called to the ministry remember when he said that his wife rebuked him he said our brothers aren't you glad for a godly wife when he starts talking all this negative she said oh you ought to be ashamed of yourself bill behind but see we can't let ourselves get discouraged we're not to faint and give up and oh there's just no hope I just can't get it right I just can't overcome God doesn't want us to faint he doesn't want us to quit trying he wants us to take courage and see where he's taking us he's taking us somewhere yes we've still done wrong yes he knows you've done wrong but if you've asked forgiveness he's forgiven you anyway it wants to take you somewhere he wants us to go forward he always corrects with the idea that I'm gonna take brother Jesse higher in Christ amen because I need correction I need the Word of God to guide me and strengthen me in to correct me but he wants to take us higher in Christ so don't give up don't faint if you might have to take a little side take a side but then take courage sign don't maybe don't cry I'll say I would say I don't have a verse 6 for whom the Lord loveth he chasing us it's a good sign God loves you if he's correcting you and scourgeth every son which he receiveth and that word means a spanking a beating he scourge as he spanks every child that he loves praise the Lord think about the thing about how Jonah was spanked you know he got spanked remember the burning of after his gourd died there and he got he got spanked he got spanked in the belly of a whale with seaweed all over him he got spanked next time Jonah you'll learn to honor my word because I love you and God gave him a chance right God gave him a second chance to go to Nineveh aren't you glad for second chances our God is the God of second chances he corrects us and lets us try it again by his grace so don't give him up don't think but yet if you make a mistake he's gonna have to spank us and scourge us but he does that because he loves us I've only had two you know spank my children a few times over the years not very much and I noticed if I've got to apply the rod they really get better right away thankfully for that my dad like I said my dad only had to spank me one time that I remember and I never did that again there's something about when you know it's the hand of God when you know you've gone against God and you've reaped the effects of the seed you sowed there's something about it that teaches us a lesson that we know next time we'll never do it again and that's what God wants us to learn God wants us to learn not to make that mistake again but to always obey the word of the Lord that's right verse 7 if ye endure chastening God dealeth with us son there's a big if this is why Judas was not a son he couldn't endure the correction of the Lord no doubt Judas Judas heard the most anointed services ever preached he couldn't say well my preacher wasn't anointed he had God Himself preaching to him but he couldn't endure the correction of the word of Jesus preached he couldn't stay with it he wanted to leave it he'd rather sell it out and you know get away from it for a little while he couldn't endure it but if we can endure the Word of God that's preached to us learn from it grow from it then God will treat us like sons and daughters amen for what son is he whom the father chased us not he's not a son if God doesn't chasing you or you're not a son or daughter what kind of child what kind of a dog grows up who's never chasing as a child what do they act like they're selfish right all they can think about is themselves they have no sense that they've lost their conscience they can just do evil and there and then they're just they're okay with it and they they have what the Bible calls we know a reprobate mind because they haven't been trained to obey the Word of God they haven't been corrected and then seen well this is what you need to act like it when you need to do the correct decision next time or son I know you're gonna eventually be able to live like this they never had somebody sit down with them and tell them here's where I see you going this is where you're gonna live and you're as far as in the ways of God you're gonna obey next time they never had that and so it's very hard for them to obey and hear the voice of God that's right what son is he whom the father chased us down he's not much of a son he's not very diligent with the father's possessions right that's right verse 8 but if ye be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not sons so God doesn't even really place them in his family they're not even really considered family members if they don't go through the chastening of the Lord and we just saw last week the rich young ruler wouldn't be corrected by Christ and yet God blessed him now you see that seems like God bless his business efforts and yet he wouldn't endure why does God allow that God because the Bible said sin is pleasurable first season God gives him that season some people season is longer right than others but their sin their their pleasures of sin lasts for a season and God allows that as a temptation to prove to them and to prove to the devil and approved to God that they wouldn't serve God anyway no matter how many blessings they had they wouldn't serve God but a real Christian will serve God it no matter what you take from them amen because they're not bastards they're not children that are not of the family of God they are children of God the scripture tells us this so my prayers Lord chasing me when I'm wrong correct me I mean you know how it is as a parent when you see your children do wrong you just want to see them do right don't you you just want to them step up and and do what's right and that's how the Lord as the Lord just wants us to step up and do what we ought to do amen because we're his children verse 9 furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence hopefully you gave your father reverence hopefully your father was a godly man shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live if we can respect our earthly father and mother what about our heavenly father he's saying he's pulling this parallel and that's why we teach the children if the children can obey their parents when they're young then they can surely obey God when they get older because God is such a more faithful parent than we are even as parents right that's why they had they said honor your mother and father and I promise you a long life on the earth there's such a blessing if they can just learn to respect their natural parents then they'll learn to respect their heavenly parent God Almighty he's the father of spirits verse 10 for they verily for a few days chasing us after their own pleasure she's just a few days how many can look back at your childhood it just to seem like a few days then lasts very long you just I see my children grow up my their childhood seen the last just a few days I was looking at a picture they have Lydia and maybe occasionally I and Lydia was about a halfway up my thigh there I got Malachi on my knee and I've got to Kristen's hole in the case she has a brand new baby it's just a few days you know didn't last very long oh how we missed those times just a few days we have to chasing our children but God for our prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness so God corrects us so we'll enjoy the holy spirit amen how many want to walk in the spirit that God is trying to correct us so we can enjoy the blessings of this land hallelujah the milk and honey of this land ha ha hallelujah he's got to correct us and show us where we're wrong so we won't walk in the flesh we'll walk in the spirit and enjoy all the blessings of this Promised Land amen we partake or partaking of the grapes of the land or partaking of the milk and the honey the blessings of the good Word of God huh me know your happiest when you're obeying the Lord when you're walking the spirit you are your happiest you're your most content when you're honoring God's Word and walking the Holy Spirit that's right verse 11 now no chastening for the present seemed to be joyous nobody really gets joy out of being corrected right but grievious nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby so if you can endure the hardships of being corrected pretty soon you're gonna see the fruits of being corrected you're gonna see the effects like we said last week sowing and reaping if you can sow and and let God plant these seeds of obedience at the end of it you'll see all the fruits of obedience amen the fruit of the Spirit the Bible calls it hallelujah so look at verse 12 so what does it say so we've got to go through chase things so what you do verse 12 wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees you've got a hard time lifting your hands this morning go ahead and lift them now lift them in praise that then the service don't be discouraged don't faint don't quit don't give up if God keeps correcting you be grateful and do or the hard season let the seeds we planted in your life that you'll see the fruits later on amen that's right lift up the hands they praise the Lord amen say hallelujah lift up the feeble knees right get ready to move get ready to walk with the Lord and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed amen follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fail the grace of God to see it as God's grace to correct us if we don't take correction we have failed God's grace because it speaks of Esau but won't go to that the Bible says that let's finish the verse 15 looking to og lest any man fail the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled see when we get we're not careful this is like Jezebel remember when she was gonna get corrected by Jihu what'd she do she put the blame on Zimmer or on JG who remember that and here's what the Bible says when you get corrected by God you can't blame others for the problem you got a look to yourself and say God forgive me Jezebel was saying oh you're gonna be just like army you're gonna you're gonna take the kingdom the wrong way and so she got all the blame off of her and put it on Jihu and Jehu said who's on my side who's got the anointing of God on them amen she didn't even listen to Jezebel we shouldn't even listen to worldly life don't even listen to Satan for a minute just obey the Word of God just be anointed by the Spirit amen see but a root of bitterness will spring up there like it did in Jezebel if we cannot accept the correction of the Lord that says that's how you know like you use this tongue speaking in tongues there's an easy example if somebody is out of order with tongues and and let's say they give the wrong interpretation brother Branham said when you try to correct them if they don't listen to you and say you're right he said this shows they've got the wrong spirit anyone who can't take correction from the Word of God he's got the wrong spirit harboring the wrong spirit rather than obeying the Holy Spirit that's the tell a telltale sign that someone has the Holy Spirit and it's constantly growing in things of God because they can be corrected by the Word of God the child of God can be corrected by their father amen and the father gave us his word the father spirits gave us his word on how to live they meant his behavior guideline book amen so see this is what God does he he treats us like children now I'm 37 I'm almost 40 I don't really feel like a child anymore but I've got the picture myself as a child in the ways of God and those of you that have served God longer than I have you still have to picture yourself as a child before God right in other words I will need to be corrected God will have to correct me and show me so I can walk in the right paths we don't want to stumble from one path to another do we we don't want to start just make it through the week and make it through the year and kind of stumble and we want to know exactly where we're going we want to be on the path that God has called for us we want straight past the Bible said I want to be on the way of holiness don't you and out it's a straight road it's a it's a narrow road that goes up to heaven hallelujah I want to stay on the straight path I don't want to wander into this and then wandering to that I want to stay on the straight and narrow that's a child of God he keeps his path straight with the word of the Lord now here it is set forth the love of God so when you read when we read Hebrews 12 now we can see God's love set forth to us he desired in love a family of his own a family of sons sons like himself there before him lies all mankind as one lump of clay imagine that's how God sees you as a lump of clay you are as a clay well I tell you you can make some real beautiful clay ceramic pieces can't you if you got somebody who's really good with clay you can make some real beautiful things remember after we got married my wife gave a bunch out and we go over to our family for after our wedding you know she and we go over to my her mom's house and we still see though saving with ceramic pieces there because it's a value it's you you've made something beautiful out of something that not so beautiful at the beginning God sees this as a lump of clay out of that same lump he will now make vessels unto honor and the dishonor the choosing will be his own choosing then those chosen ones born of his Spirit will be trained to conform to his image in their walk trained sound familiar like child trained like going through the training of a child that may be the training of a sports team or the training of a new job when you have to go through the training of a new job those chosen of God when they're born of spirit are trained to conform to his image in their walk so all walks we have to be trained to walk like Christ walked amen trained to walk like Christ walked he reproves with all long-suffering and gentleness and mercy I like this he chastens with nail-scarred hands so before the Lord you know would correct you you looked at in his hand you know he'd have a hole there I tore a scar from where the hole used to be his hands he knows what sufferings all about and the reason he's correcting you is so you can be more like him I thought that's beautiful but you know when you got to go through me know when you go through training at a new job you really got to follow all the rules you got to follow your training to a tee right do you think they're going to hire you in your training if you're not paying attention do you think you'll get the job if they're training at McDonald's to flip a burger and you can't flip a burger and you're on your cell phone texting the whole time you think they're gonna hire you course not when they train you they want you to be diligent about your training they want their training you so you'll remember how to act when you get out in the real job and that's what Christ is doing here this morning he's training us so he can take his word and live it out in our daily lives he wants us to be trained to be conformed or fashioned to his image but it takes a training we've got to pay attention right we've got to listen during training it's got to be important the training has to be important to us we got to really listen to our supervisor I'm so glad we have a supervisor who never makes a mistake our Lord Jesus he's going to train us he's going to correct us with nail-scarred hands I just want you to know the nail-scarred hand should remind us of his suffering then if we remember his suffering we can suffer through our trials whether they were our fault or just a test like job Joel was just a test apparently now brother Bram City had a little fear and these things came upon him but when God said when God looked at him God said he's a perfect man he's forgiven by the blood of his sacrifice so it really wasn't job's fault now Jonah that was his fault he should have went to Nineveh but he chose a ship to Tarshish that's what he chose it was his choice so he had to suffer for his own decisions amen but was he a son yes because he does eventually know in the very lowest spot of that that that ocean in the belly of that whale he cried out to God and he quoted Solomon's prayer that I'll lift your holy temple and if I look to your temple and pray you'll hear an answer amen so the trial brought him to his lowest position physically and spiritually that's what the trial did and that's what trials do helped us to do it's a faithful saying if we be dead with him so we got to be dead just our sin we got to be dead to our desires we shall also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him they'll also deny us so he cannot deny any of the word we've got to Keith the word and suffer in well-doing the Bible says just do what's right make the right decision do what the Word of God says and remember it's nail-scarred hands that are correcting you he's been through the fires of trial he's overcome every drop he's overcome harder trials that will ever have to overcome and if he did it then his spirits here to help us do it through our trials amen whether it's our fault or whether it was a test like job like we sang on Wednesday though he slay me yet I'll trust him I love that song the Prophet says sometimes this Potter must take the vessel he's working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he desires it but it is love that is his love another way of his love there is that there cannot be in every year I modeling claimed my class and every year we have a science unit where we have to design a boat that floats and so you know when I'm in a hurry to the previous year I'll just kind of smash up those boats a little bit and put them in the bag and try to get right try to get ready to the move I'll move on to the next lesson well a year goes around I usually teach in the fall as our first science unit on physical science and they have and they have to design a boat and so I've got to take that clay and it already looks like a boat that's gonna float I know what a boat that's gonna float made of model clay I know what it looks like so I've before the lesson I always forget like oh yeah that's right I got to smash these down and make them so they don't look anything like the right design and so the first two children will fail you know they'll try to make a real flat boat but you got to give it you know got to give it a bottom you got to give it to some room and then it has to be tall enough so the water can't flow into it so you've got to have the right design they try to make it flat like a piece of paper these six and seven-year-olds and so that's what I think of when I've got it sometimes it's got to be thoroughly broken down and the children toys come to me and say mr. Smith this is hard now I know modelling clay is hard you've got to put some heat and pressure on it and sorry after that lesson I end up with blue hands yellow hands and green hands go got that modeling clay all over there because I've got to thoroughly push it down I've got to lean over I tell the children you got to lean over that you got to put your weight into that amen and sometimes God puts the pressure on us he really puts the pressure on us what are you gonna do as he's leaning over and smashing your life or your attitude or your character or whatever is he wants to thoroughly break it down that he can rebuild it a rebuilt life how many could say amen to that Jesus rebuild my life this is Ryan Church age book this is right where we write in our progression on the church page book to rebuild our lives we've got to be willing to have God rebuild our lives to be shaped more like the life he'd like us to live that's right that's the first thing I thought of was just leaning over then I get I get I get clay in my ring I get clay on my fingernails but it's worth it because they that's one of the lessons they learn that's one of the ones they remember the most at the end of the year is building these boats and and making them float and that's what God does it is God's love that will thoroughly break a man down think about Jobe again God had to take remember there was three waves of trials remember he first lost his animals and he lost forget what after that and then he lost his children three waves he lost everything and then he still got on his knees and said blessed be the Lord he gives and takes away and the devil said watch this because he's got good health he said well let me let me touch his body said God God said don't don't take his life just put your hand on his body and that's when he really started questioning that's when he really had some mind battles when God even let his health get attacked but there was no other way forgot to do it because that's God's Way of love he's got to break us down to build us up again there is no other way according to the prophet of God in the Bible a chai many times you see with children they got to be broken down from their old habit in order to do their new habit like we do we do math on the iPad at school and I've got to break their habits and sometimes it's hard like sometimes if we're doing like six plus two and they're gonna use their fingers to count on I've got to break their habits they'll say six seven eight and they'll put up like three fingers and nine and they'll put up the wrong one they'll put up different numbers of fingers so I've got to hold their hand down and a teach him to teach them to count on the right way this is my job you know some of you brothers working really hard and there's steel and sparks flying and I've got sparks of anger flying around all day sparks of complaining and sparks of emotion raw emotion I've got to train them there's no other way for me to do it I've got to show them how to do it and I've got to guide them step by step and then they pretty soon they get it six seven eight and seven eight nine and then six seven eight nine ten and you've got to do it there's no other way you've got to take them through the hard process of breaking down their old habit and making sure they've got the new habits how many want new habits to serve the Lord the right habits this is how it does it he breaks us down thoroughly to get rid of our old habits and builds us up with new habits I've got a new habit for those of you who like goal-setting I've got a new habit every day and I didn't bring my goal page with me but I've I've started writing out my to-do lists every day on paper and I just make a bulleted list and this this works for me I found this is this is God retraining me so before each day I write down the things I want to do the next day and on Sunday I'll write everything down the whole week I got to do some like it just it does something for me it's like I remember it better and so I'll take a picture of that that to-do lists each day and I'll email it to myself because my emails like my constant to-do list and I just love when it finally gets down and shortened because it just keeps filling up all day all day all day they're gonna emptied out and fill it up the next day and so I found this habit to be helpful for me with the things of God for example around there I gotta prepare sermon for Wednesday on Monday I gotta start that Monday Monday I got a write for 30 minutes on my modesty book and Tuesday I've got to do all this and I found that if I I found this habit has helped me to focus and get more done I started that book December 22nd and I finished on February 10th so less than two months 80,000 I'm sorry eighty pages forty-three thousand words and I found this is a way God had to break down my habits because before I just say well I look on my phone and and pretty soon the phone became common so I found another way oh I've got to write it down take a picture of it keep it in the place where I look the most and I found the most success there as far as the habits changing my habits to be more focused on the things I like to do now how many want more habits that glorify the Lord and that's where that's what we have after over me I've got to write that on there I've got a prayer I read my Bible contact so and so do these things I got that's what that's the way I found to help change my habits that I can do the right things that I want to do because remember like Paul said when I want to do good evils right there there's this is such a quick temptation I'll just neglect my responsibilities for a few days I'll just put this off for a day but I found for me like for the habits God giving me I've got the mint and that's the way of meditation writing it down meditating on these things and I found for me that's been a real victory a real way God has shown me on how to develop good godly habits I've gotta look at it I've got to meditate on it I've got to ride it I got to take a picture of it I've got to send it to myself an email just so I can be focused on the right things if not that evil is gonna be right there with me the whole time praise the Lord thank God that he breaks us down thoroughly in order to build up good habits now the Prophet goes into this little thought after he talks about being rebuked by God he talks about Satan's threefold power Oh little flock do not fear this age is fast closing as it does those tears will be bound together and as a three-fold cord is not easily broken they'll have a tremendous threefold strength of political physical and spiritual satanic empower and they will seek to destroy the Bride of Christ she will suffer but she will endure if you're not those things that are coming upon the earth I love this for he who loved his own love them unto the end think about Jesus and his disciples and his crucifixion who left to who was the one that got scared and left was it Jesus that left his disciples or was his disciples that left him his disciples left him Jesus loved them unto the end but they chose to separate themselves from the Word of God Jesus's love is so faithful Churchill loved us to the end of the Laodicean jay-j men but it's gone that we're have to go through some suffering we're going to go through some correction he's got to show us and break us down in order to show us where we're going in Christ see his faithful love will keep rebuking chastening and rebuilding our habits and our behavior until the very end of time to the end of our lives to the end of time whichever comes first whether we've got to die and then go to the rapture or just be changed in the moment and going the rapture either way we must accept that God loves us and because God loves me he's gonna correct me he's gonna show me where I'm wrong break me down and build me up to be a better Christian amen praise the Lord Amen hallelujah the hard part is we don't like our we don't like being broken down right we don't like to think all my life my routines are gonna change and Oh change is so hard you know changes that it can be difficult it is difficult the pressure and heat is difficult but it's worth it if we're gonna be trained to be conformed in fashion in the Christ it's God's only way to do it break us down now the Prophet goes of this thought on the consummation of the Gentile ages we are coming down to the very end of time in fact brother bran about his ministry he said thus saith the Lord they'll never be a greater ministry to the Gentiles than his ministry so we're not going to see anything as far as supernaturally we're not going to see anything more supernatural than the Ministry brother branham that discernment that we saw we can still watch it on tape and we can still hear it on tape we're not gonna see anything greater than that and so we we're not going to be deceived right and if any preacher rises up and pretends like they have a greater gift than brother Branham we're not going to be deceived because we've got thus saith the Lord the greatest sign that God gave to Abraham before the ghent of the destruction of Nineveh I'm starting out a bit with Sodom was that is the son of man to servant that was the greatest side he had before right before the body change and then before the destruction of Sodom so we've got to understand that and we've also got to understand that as we come to maturity the tares are going to come to maturity as well we can see them binding with online I didn't watch the Superboy I don't believe in watching the Superbowl but the day after they had a little article on there on the website and it said there was a Superbowl commercial that stressed the unity of one world religion so I I just clicked on there and watched it it was a Toyota commercial and the Toyota commercial all these football fans are going to a football game and there's a there's a Catholic nun there's a Catholic priest there's a Muslim priest there's a Hindu guy and they all get in the Toyota truck and go off to the game and they all sit by each other in the stands and say we're on the same team and this is the propaganda that's being pushed out to these people right this is the propaganda they're all in the same team yeah that's the devil's team but God's team is the way of the word amen the way of Jesus Christ remember Muslims they've recognized Jesus was a prophet but they won't say his blood was the blood of God's own son they won't say he was the sacrifice and if they reject the sacrifice then they reject the forgiveness is that right to reject the blood is to be out from under the blood we accept the blood so were under the blood amen we're forgiven because we accept the blood of God's own son but this is the propaganda and it's increasing remember ever if years ago everybody fell in love with the Pope everybody falls in love with the mother harlot that's just that's just what the Bible says just what the Bible says we're all the same and the Pope had a commercial last year around Super Bowl time where all these different faiths said we're all on the same team I have that sort of my computer if you like to watch it after service I can pull that one up they said we're all on faith and we're all if the Bible says there's only one faith but see these are all coming to a fruition brother BAM says they're all coming to maturity and as they get more mature and powerful they're gonna bring some type of little squeezed upon the bride we know that here's what he says this age is the last of the seven Church ages what began the first or Ephesian age must and will come to a full fruition and harvest in the last or Laodicean age the two vines will yield their final fruit what's the final fruit of the bride of Jesus Christ she's got the fullness of Pentecost in her Amen hallelujah so you got the fullness of Acts chapter 2 in her Amen that's her final fruit because that is the latter rain hallelujah oh that makes me excited Church to believe I'll be a part of that hallelujah the two spirits will terminate their manifestation in each of their final destinations the sowing and watering and growing is all over summer's end of the sickle is now thrust into the harvest that's speaking of course the Tribulation Period after the rapture so see now is the time that we've got the so now the time that we got to be watered by the Holy Spirit now is the time we got to grow in the presence of God this is the time to do it now look at the Prophet says in verses 15 to 18 which we have just studied lies the true picture of the ripe and false vine false spirit false church people so brother Adam said this scripture here now I don't smaller I had to make it smaller to fit on the screen but Loran said this is the the full mature false church member this is what they say when the seeds of nikolay tourism and the doctrines of Nikolay them and the Jezebel religion and the doctrine of balaam when that all comes to amateur Antichrist seed of Satan church member this is what they say is that striking Church in a striking this is what a mature serpent seed says because this is the false Church now they say it down here this is what they say but let's read up to it I know that works thou art neither cold neither hot I would not work cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth so Jesus spews out the impersonating churches we know that he vomits them out it makes him sick to say that their Christian churches they can't speak for him anymore because they're speaking for Satan they're speaking for lusts of the flesh instead of speaking the Word of God now look because thou says so these are the words of a mature serpents eat if I can say it like that isn't that striking when a person becomes a mature seed of Satan this is what they say because they say I am rich this is a mature Antichrist follower I'm rich so they look at the word the word says whatever and they say look at the word and say I'm rich I don't care what the word says I'm rich look at the word and say I've got increased with Goods I don't care what the Bible says I've got lots of goods I've got homes and money and furniture I've got I've got all kinds of money okay all kinds of goods they look at the word of this day look at water baptism they look at no women preachers and women cutting their hair or shouldn't cut their hair look at that and say I don't care I'm rich I'm increased with Goods they look at the word and say I don't have need of nothing they look at the word they hear this preaching or profit thus saith the Lord's and and discernment something's they look at that said I don't have need of anything that's what that's a mature serpent seed understand it's the false church they ripen and become this in the next few years this is what the churches are going to become and when they turn down what you and I believe and they have these attitudes where our church is so big our church is rich our church is increased with goods our church doesn't need any teaching from a small church like yours you see what they're saying they're saying oh it doesn't matter what the Bible says about baptism it doesn't matter what the Bible says about the Godhead it doesn't matter what the Bible says about your appearance and how you dress it doesn't God's looking at the heart we preach that on Wednesday yes God is going to look at the heart and he's going to judge your heart by this word amen that's exactly right he looks at your heart he's going to judge your the intense the thoughts and intents of your heart by this gospel of Paul amen so this is a fruition I just want to emphasize that that really struck me as I studied the ripe Antichrist fruit is this attitude I don't care what the word says I'm rich we've got so many big churches and big buildings and missionary programs we got our own jet planes and we've got all this property I don't need I don't need the word I don't need what you're preaching that is a mature Antichrist follower Jesus said there's hope though for people that are in that system aren't you glad for hope he said there there's correction if you want to be corrected and if you want to be one of my children there's hope for you amen now before we get to that hope so see our character should be totally opposite of Laodicea later to see his character the much the mature Laodicean is going to say I'm rich our church is rich we've got increased Goods we don't have need of your preaching that's what they're gonna say so the church says this my works are all right because I'm some new quorum sometimes I do what's right I'm okay brother Jesse nah I'm not too bad you know sometimes I do good things you know yeah that's an awful thing to say you should do good things all the time praise God if you stop doing good things and do evil things you need to get saved because they say well sometimes I'm lukewarm you know sometimes I'm on fire for Jesus sometimes no no I just get distracted no I'm human right but you're supposed to have a part of divinity in you and that's supposed to correct you fast to get back off walking in the divine Way praise God you're supposed to crucify that sin daily amen but we see the the the mature notice see in church remember says well sometimes I do good brother yes sir sister so and so sometimes I do what's right I'm pretty good sometimes Jesus wasn't good sometimes Jesus was holy all the time Jesus remember those notable words he said I always do that which pleased the father therefore the father loveth me hey there glory he loves his son because his son always honored his father but see I'm mature serpent seed person will say sometimes I don't need the preaching I don't need that that doctrine I don't need your fanaticism in your church I'm pretty good most of time well you don't sin or you think you're so holy I see that this is a mature ripened Laodicean church member that's gonna that's going to receive the mark of the beast and they say I'm rich our church is rich or I'm rich personally like we know the prosperity movements really big in that striking you ever thought about that how leão to see us all about am rich and increased with Goods and this is the greatest age we've ever had a prosperity preaching I've ever thought about how striking that is it totally fits the prophecy for this day it totally reveals everything that Satan's after Satan's after the lusts of the flesh that's what the fall shirt says we're rich we've got so much giving I'm increased look at all that we have look at all though that we can do for the kingdom of God we pass out Jesus films that's fine we pass out Jesus movies that's fine but Jesus has to be in you praise God it's better for them to see Jesus and you then Jesus on a screen amen hallelujah right that's right oh I don't have need of any are more preaching not the time to tote the line at your preaching brother Jes you're just a legalist see we don't have need of that we have to go to all that lengths God loves us God receives all of our worship no he doesn't he proved that with Cain he receives one worship there's one provided place of God's worship that's always been the way and that's through his word so church this is what I hope you say this morning we have to be the opposite of that because I'm mature a mature Laodicean serpent seed person that's what they say but a mature Holy Ghost filled Saint says this God is anointing me constantly to do good works as we'll see in Scripture I you should say that and I can't wait to do good works I am so excited to do something good for somebody that's what the Holy Ghost for a person says I hope you feel that way this morning boy God is anointing me to help people that are less fortunate than me praise God instead of aw I'm rich I only worry about myself I've got everything I need but see a Holy Ghost filled person once they reach out and help somebody else a true Holy Ghost filled Church says this I may be poor naturally but I'm rich spiritually hallelujah because because I've been given all spiritual blessings do they say we're rich naturally but the realtor says we're rich spiritually with the Word of God amen the true church says I am in need of decreasing the number of my Goods right Amen Church though worldly Church says oh look at all I've got and they they they value it so much but the true church does they say I need less brother Branham says if you want to go up you said you gotta unpack he said you're not packing up all your possessions that on the rapture he said you've got to unpack everything like we're talking about the cares of the world well I care so much about this or I care so much about that we've got to care more about going up than staying down here because this is what the this is what the Serpent's eat churches say oh look at all I've got this means so much to me and don't get me wrong it's sentimental value that belong to your grandma your dad or your mom or I understand that I've got pictures of my parents or grant they mean a lot to me but I'm not gonna let that get in the way of obeying the Word of God the true church says I have need of more of Christ's words let's see the foster says I don't have need of that I'm rich I've got goods aren't we're big of a rich we got everything we need we don't need more of the word I don't need anything and of course they're saying this to Jesus Christ we don't have need of anything Jesus and Jesus is outside of their church trying to get in can I come in my man said he said he's saying can I come in with the Pentecostal blessing oh we have need of the Holy Ghost amen we have need of all the Holy Ghost praise God but the foster says we got all the spirit we got all the Holy Ghost we want we got we've got religion we've got money and everything we've got everything we don't have need of nothing where we need more of God's mercy how many would say I need more chastening of the Lord I need more rebuking I need I need God's guidance to help me walk the straight path how many would say that but they don't feel like they're like well I've just lived so well for so many years and yet breaking the Word of God they're so desensitized to the of God remember the Bible said you could have a conscience that seared with an iron these people go to church for years and years they never hear any real preaching of the word and their conscience has been seared which means the nerve endings aren't they're not working anymore there's no feeling there you preach the Word of God they don't move right like I even remember when brother vans Church invited me to preach at the youth meetings I preached my heart on a preach against sin all I know how and just a few people would be moved the same thing would happen if I preach to the denomination you preach your heart out and say this is sin same thing happens when I'm preaching messy churches you preach if they're not careful they get so desensitized to the ways of the Holy Spirit I don't have need of repent we have constant need of repentance amen we have constant need of correction what child doesn't praise the Lord what child of yours what little child of yours doesn't need constant correction and we are all children of God I don't need corrected by my father I'm so perfect I'm so holy can you smell the pride in that statement and you taste the arrogancy in that statement I said where the brain calls it later he said the pride and arrogance I don't have need of that I don't have need of that preaching like that I don't have to live that look at all I've got God's blessed me oh my now let's look at a few scriptures well I got through that's the wrong one go to James 1:27 let's just read this again I know we've read it a couple times but let's go back over let's just flip through your Bible I'm gonna try to close here let me give me 15 minutes here James 1 not Jude its James 1:27 I wrote the wrong scripture this morning James 1:27 who'd like to read that for me anybody read that for me lid now okay okay Malachi and Olivia read the next one now okay amen so if you have hot works and if we said this earlier I just put each one earlier on earlier from on a separate slide God has anointed me constantly to do good works if he's anointing you to do constant good works then you are gonna find people who are hurting and try to help them out that's being on fire for Christ leaving your home and visiting people who are an affliction that's what the Bible says is pure religion and pure of course means no defilement like you're not I'm not doing this for my benefit it's hard for me to travel or I'm busy or I could be doing other things right but I've got a I'm doing this for their sake only because I'm living for others this is pure religion and to keep all sin off you to keep all to keep your shirt clean and white like this one gotta keep it white that's when you know you're really doing pure works before God you're trucking everything you can to make sure you're walking the Word of God every time you see someone who's afflicted you try to help them out right but Jesus said I know your works or the false church you do some things sometimes you're doing good all right our work should be good all the time we've got to make this it's my constant habit to help out people who are hurting Titus is going to Titus 2:13 now he just talked about the rapture I think we'll read it Titus 2:13 Lydia can you reroute loud thirteen and fourteen Lydia amen so we're looking for Jesus is coming and while we're waiting he redeemed us to take us away from all sin and that would be we would be zealous for good works so huh me know right now I could just prove through this sermon there's two things you got to have zeal for zeal to repent when you're wrong and zeal to do good works amen if you are not passionate about repenting something's wrong with your attitude if you're not passionate about doing something good to help out somebody who's an affliction you're in need of prayer right you have got a Laodicean lukewarm attitude and you gotta get that attitude off and get the anointing of God on you because I can prove out of the Bible that from this sermon two things you need to be zealous about repenting when you're wrong getting right and then doing good works for people I can prove that by the scripture that's why it's so sad people are so zealous I like I was talking to the teacher on Tuesday at the middle school she used to work at arrow and now she works at the mill school she said Jessie how do you do this how do you do to Bible clubs and preach three times a week and do a teacher I just looked at her and write her super why I said I don't watch sports she's like oh yes you have all that time she's like you have six kids how do y'all do this I said well we don't we don't invest in worldly things like that and she's like yeah I always do that I don't watch TV there you know how do you do that you have to be zealous over God's works and you have to reject the works of the world and do what God wants you to do I got a zeal for that so that's what I do we need to have a zeal for helping out other people a zeal to repent when we come to church in here we're wrong or just listening to the Bible at your home you know you have to have a zeal to say I'm sorry will you forgive me so this is what the true church says they've got real hot works they want to help out people who are afflicted and if you wanna know people that are afflicted let me know I know if you want to help people with just with a few groceries let me know I know I'm gonna go drop some off today to a few people if you want to know people that need help will ask me but we need to be zealous do good works don't always have to be money it can be something else right helping people with your time or if you're a mechanic you fix their car form you know just give good works to people in affliction that's what the true church does now the true church says I'm poor naturally but I'm rich spiritually I've been given all spiritual blessings now that's Ephesians 1:13 he's blessed us with all spiritual blessings 2nd Peter 1 verse 3s about the Statue preferred man and the Bible said he's given us all divine promises amen that we can partake of all the divine nature of God every promise is given to us if you need peace brother he's got peace sister if you need joy he's got joy amen it whatever we have Nino would ever promise that we need he's offered all of it to us amen Romans 8:32 the Bible said shall he not give us freely all things if he spared not his own son if God wouldn't hold back his son and would give his son but the Bible said how much more will he freely give us all things but we got to ask and we got to believe we got to obey right we got to so the right things and we'll reap the right things right church so that's what the real church says I might be poor naturally I don't have everything I want naturally but one thing I've got I've got spiritual riches Oh glory I'm in need of decreasing my goods now first Timothy 6:17 says you cannot take anything with you you will take nothing with you much as I love my ring as much as I appreciate my glasses I'm not taking them with me right so we need to be able to have less jesus said in matthew 6:19 don't lay up your treasures on earth don't have more things on earth where moth and dust corrupt and destroy he said but lay up yourselves treasures in heaven we need to get more treasure in heaven we have to have more property in heaven we've got to have memorials in heaven praise God you know they got the Korean memorial they got the Lincoln Memorial the Washington Memorial Cornelius had a memorial fasting in heaven amen there is a memorial of the fasting corniest it in heaven ha ha I knew you I can you imagine walking down the streets ago there's memorial to Cornelius hallelujah now I'm not saying it's like that but I'm trying to give you a picture we go to Washington you see we see the Washington Monument the Lincoln Memorial I haven't seen it but I'd like to you understand but in heaven there is memorials where people have fasted prayed given alms they've done the things of God and heaven remembers it we need more possessions in heaven than we need them we have on earth amen go to Psalms 9012 let's read that one they would like to read that for me Psalms 98 Malka Psalms 9012 all right so I've just felt burdened because I feel the effects of literacy on my life I start worrying about this and worried about that financially and worrying about this we're in about the giving in the church worrying about how much money I'm making it work and I remember I've got to overcome that too I've worried about the uncertainties what if this happens or with this happens with the church what half of how we gonna do this and how we're gonna do that and I'm constantly living under this too.we I've got to overcome that I've got I got to be rich in spiritual blessings I've got to be rich in the promises of God amen I've got to cast it down myself just like all of us have to cast it down Psalms 9012 Malachi amen I only have so many days left right you only have so many days left teach us to number our days if I live a long life like I said I'm 37 five a long life maybe I got 40 50 more years but I should live my life like I've only got a number of limited number of days and not be so concerned about the natural things the natural goods but about spiritual goods that's what wisdom does it teaches us the number of your days realize your days are limited so make the most of those days don't be concerned about treasures on earth be concerned about treasures in heaven the true Church says I have need of more Christ's words Jesus said blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness we've got to come to church hungry we've got to come to church thirsty and the Bible said we got to gather more's we see that Day approaching and we get a little discouragement the Bible says in acts 4 we've got a crowd have a prayer meeting say give me boldness I've lost my boldness restore my bonus for Christ amen I thought the early church did who had the baptism of the Holy Ghost make me more bold give me back my first love help me to be more bold for Christ how many want to be more bold for Christ this is what the true church says the foster says I don't need more of God I'm good I'm coasting I'm I'm I'm too blessed to be stressed it depends how you apply that depends what your life is like so we should say the following we should we should say I'm content being poor if we're not rich naturally and yet having my daily necessities the Bible says as long as I've got food in food and clothing the Bible says I should be content but the true church like I have more worldly goods and I'm more we need to say I need less worldly goods I need more of the word in my life praise the Lord look what Jesus looking brother him says next after Jesus rebukes them he tells of the three things they need and we're gonna get to that hopefully he says no words ever spelled out a more bitter denunciation that means a rebuke there was never a more bitter judgment in the whole Bible than this right here and no proud and arrogant religious people ever deserved it more I couldn't find the quote my brother Adam said why this is so brother Ram said Christians the days of Ephesus had to die for their faith they had all kinds of persecutions and they were really rugged Christians but brother never said now in our day we have so many riches that there's really no excuse not to that there's no really fear there's no like there's no one there saying I'm gonna kill you if you don't obey or if you say you or love Jesus and so instead of the fear of persecution it's the temptation of riches that's why these people I think it's a note that not 1965 or the brand tells us that that's why the rebuke is so great they don't even have any real battles this this economy that's not a real battle compared to you know life or death for just saying you're a Christian so nobody deserves a more bitter rebuke than this age because they had no real battles to fight compared to the physical battles that they fought in the earlier days what do you have to battle brother Jeff I had to battle the temptation to be rich had to battle you know money I had to battle some drugs and overcome drugs and you go to the early church what you have to battle steaks knives swords being burned at a stake and this is why Jesus gives them the most hardest rebuke your life was so easy you had really no excuses but you chose to love the things of the world when there was really no real battle there I know the deception is greater than this day I know that but also at the same time there's no real physical persecution or pain for most people in this day and so Jesus gives the most bitter denunciation to this group by now let's go to clean 7:25 what a parallel we see in Ecclesiastes 725 with the latest in Church H this just came to me as I studied I just felt it was the Holy Spirit picking up that word bitter when I read that word bitter this morning my mind went immediately went to could easy a c7 please a c7 25y I'm really part me okay are you talking to me I got a few minutes left here my I want to go please ya see 725 I just felt directed here I applied my heart to know and to search and to seek out wisdom and the reason of things and to know the wickedness of folly even of foolishness and madness so he want to know he won't know all about wickedness he went to all doubt foolishness craziness what is this all about in verse 26 and I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets and her hands as bands whoso pleases God shall escape her but the sinner shall be taken by her behold this have I found say at the preacher counting one by one to find out the account which yet my soul seeketh but I find not one man among a thousand have I found but a woman among all those have I not found though this only have I found that God has made man upright but they have sought out many inventions can you see the parallel program said no no age ever does it deserve a more bitter denunciation and then Solomon says there's nothing more bitter than a woman who in snares you can everybody see this how the natural woman of Ecclesiastes types of spiritual woman can you see how it types out because the woman her heart is strongholds or addictions or traps the woman in the psalmist talking about gets you trapped in a situation gets you addicted in a certain situation and her hands or bars or prison bars I mean oh brother Ram said the churches are like cages of unclean birds well the Bible says that they're like Eagles he said there's Eagles trapped in those cave we got to go and let the Eagles fly praise God but see the woman the bitter woman she traps him in there he realized that all these megachurches are just cages they're prison doors remember brother never had the dream he said all these church members saying deliver us brother brand they're behind the doors remember that there were just church members and he said house and he'll give away to the name of Jesus Christ amen that's what they were lacking they have Father Son Holy Ghost and that's what I put my book that was my testimony I can never overcome any addictions until I came to the message of the hour day man because I was imprisoned by that bitter denominational woman because she wouldn't preach the Word of God is going to keep me in her system or you'll make a good Luther Luther and preacher they told me that's what they told me you'd be a real good Lutheran preacher I said I don't want to be a Luther and preacher I want to be a Holy Ghost field preacher Amen but see that woman system traps you in there and there's nothing more bitter than a woman that traps with her snares she she's controlling right a man in this case the church controls the people we must escape her naturally and spiritually and notice men will just run after their own inventions oh just got their own devices and and worldly things wit worldly pleasures now I hope you can see that and there's nothing more bitter than a woman that snares and in traps and traps a man into sin and it's a perfect type of the church today Laodicea has trap people in it with all of its trappings right or you can still go to movies you can still smoke you can have social wine you can have all these things and they're trapped by the lust of the flesh that's right I got two more slides here let me finish up with two more slides first Timothy 6:6 let's go there and now that connects now that we have more bitter there's no bitter denunciation for the woman there's no bitter there's no bitter woman than a woman who traps you in addictions and how the Bible said riches are snares so a woman who has snares is also a rich woman just like the rich churches today first Timothy 6 6 through 12 so to me the church that's a that's a chain of truth that cannot be broken that's a truth that from the scripture I know I'm going a little longer here just bear with me here first Timothy 6:6 but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and is certain we can carry nothing out and having food and raiment let us dare be with content but they which be rich fall into temptation and a snare there's a snare see the woman who has snares remember that she's more bitter than death and now the Bible said riches are a snare so see there's nothing more evil than a rich woman right evil woman in this case a rich church there's nothing more evil than a rich church oh I hope everybody can see that it's right there Elaine in the scripture for us the snares of riches it says and they into a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows but Thou O man of God flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience and meekness now we don't have time to go there but what did Solomon get ensnared with riches rich he has so rich and the women right the rich women from other countries he got ensnared with rich women and it kept him from giving a hundred percent to the Lord I don't want to give 50 and be lukewarm I don't want to look down in my life and say well half of my schedule looks like it glorifies Christ half of my free time looks like it's glorifying Christ I want a hundred percent of my life to glorify Christ Salman couldn't say that then of his life he got away no longer was it a hundred percent was in the word that's maybe 50 40 last one it's gonna look 20 let's say on our feet here I'll closer this one Luke 2045 I was just looking at this yesterday with the myth the widow and her two mites Luke 2045 I just want to remind us of this Scripture this is really beautiful Scripture Luke 2045 then in the audience of all the people he began I'm sorry he said unto the disciples beware of the scribes which desire to walk in long robes and love greetings in the markets and the highest seats of the synagogues and the chief rooms at feasts which devour widows houses and for a shoe make long prayers the same shall receive greater damnation so who gets the worst judgment on the day of judgment those who claim to be Christians or believers and we're not so the false church right the Bible says nobody gets a more harsh judgment in the book of James than preachers who are corrupt now Jesus saying this in a big crowd so they all hearing what he's saying right and then look at verse 21 and he looked up and he saw the rich man casting their gifts in the Treasury remember rich and increased with Goods I don't need nothing and he also saw a certain poor Widow casting in thither two mites two mites and that day was 3/8 of one penny I don't know what that equals to us but it's probably really small I don't know two mites she gave her two pieces or two mites 3/8 of an Israel cent and he said of a truth I say unto you that this poor Widow hath cast and more than they all this is quite a thought for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that you had who got the greater reward on the day of judgment or who's gonna get the greatest reward the wood the widow woman in heaven she gave more than what the rich Pharisees gave because we know they just did it for show and they're going to be judged and they have no treasure in heaven but here's a sincere woman and this whole time Jesus stands there and watches her he said hey watch this woman he doesn't rush up but ma'am said you and I would have rushed up and stopped her from giving oh no sister you just keep that that's what brother Branham said just just keep that oh it's okay but Jesus lets her give her 3/8 of a penny to the kingdom of God and look she even gave it to the false church system but because she did it in sincerity because she did it to glorify God then we know these things are true jesus knew the laws of God would go to work for her right the treasure were these the Treasury were these chess or boxes outside of the the woman's court at the temple according to Josephus and the the the believers put in contributions whether voluntary or they're paid year lead ties and offerings they had to give so Jesus watch all the rich guys pour in there and a woman walks drops tink tink these guys are dropping off and it's clang clang clang ching ching ching ching ching and they're thinking all man look at my money in heaven's own way up my bank account and yet they're serpents but a real humble woman walks up there she's not increased with goods she has need a more of God but yet she's still willing to give her part to God and Jesus lets her because she knows or he knows the law of gods or is going to operate for the woman widows were the worst off in the Middle Eastern country as far as economics now that's Josephus history on the Treasury look when it says widows are associated with weeping mourning and desolation that these are the words that describe her experience here's a woman that's weeping all the time she's desolate she's and yet she still got enough grace to go to church and drop off a few mites poverty and indebtedness always follow widows because they had no source of income if they had no husband widows were frequently placed alongside orphans and landless immigrants homeless so you would place a widow with a homeless person and an orphan who had no family that's how bad off she was yet she still walks out there and say I want to do something for God I can't do much for God but I'm gonna give everything I got to God and who gave more who have rhetoric rewards in heaven the widow woman will have rewards in that striking the Bible says all's we must do is seek first the kingdom of God don't don't worry about tomorrow search what we're gonna eat what we're gonna drink we're gonna put on the Gentiles are gonna seek after that they're gonna but so much thought what they eat and drink and wear but your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof don't worry about tomorrow just say God I need you with me right now I'm gonna say that Lord help me just to realize that I need you with me right now and help me to give you what I have right now that's just bow our heads in word of Prayer Lloris you can come to the piano when you're ready Heavenly Father we thank you for this time Lord God thank you for this word that we've heard Lord I just saw it Lord of

ago with the church in Macedonia they were going through great persecution but they gave of their abundance to the church in Jerusalem as a sweet savor unto God and today we see a woman who doesn't have anything to give but she gives it anyway Lord you let her because you have laws of reaping and sowing as we said last week Lord I've tried to get the people's minds focused on others because this
