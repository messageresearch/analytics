========================================

praise the lord for that eliezer call me praise the lord for years to hear we'll just sing a song here i really love this song it encourages me and i i had him put it into the little thing there so it hopefully should be there but it's called i am resolved amen amen i'm resolved no longer to linger charmed by the world's delight amen uh i guess i'll just sing it and we'll see if we can match up there so yeah i am resolved no longer to linger [Music] things is [Music] oh [Music] cool [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] yes [Music] my so [Music] foreign [Music] do [Music] amen praise the lord i certainly i enjoy that song so much amen just to glorify the name of the lord jesus amen praise the lord certainly good to see brother cam and family here i tell you the lord has just really blessed me on this trip everyone that i was hoping to be able to drop in and see at some point they all just wound up in my path so that my heart is certainly full this morning just really grateful to that praise the lord uh you know i just uh it's amazing how time flies by it feels like i just got into town yesterday and here we are already near the end of everything but you know we're redeeming the time amen for the days are evil so you know praise the lord that we're not creatures of time even though we maybe seem like it right now but we're creatures of eternity and well i'm looking forward to spending all that eternity with you all and most importantly with our lord jesus amen all sat down around i believe maybe in a big circle at some point and just hearing the lord speak to us and us worshiping and praising him around there oh i can't you can't even imagine it when you don't get tired when you don't have you know you don't have any sickness or sorrow to worry about anymore and you can just revel in the joy of the lord and for a moment by the grace of the lord maybe we can just enter into that little slice of eternity now as we enter into the word and uh you know it's been a great privilege to be here brother jesse i certainly appreciate it and uh you know given the testimony last night as soon as you know as soon as i left my wife had to remind me of a couple things i left out you know she's like well it was a sunday not a saturday or a wednesday when you proposed and these things like that but you know the lord has grace we don't we don't uh my memory is not perfect for sure and uh but by the grace of the lord you know we're just grateful to him let's turn in our bibles if we can a couple of verses here i certainly appreciate it brother jesse even when you open the service this morning speaking of this verse here romans 12 chapter 1 speaking of a living sacrifice i've just felt it on my heart so much and we'll probably even revisit some of the things we even ministered on on friday but it's been such an impression on my heart that the hour that we're living in he's calling for a complete surrender of your will because if we are going back to an eden condition that was the one thing that we find in the garden of eden was lacking in cain's side he could not surrender his own will what's the one thing he couldn't do the lord told him what to do but he could not surrender his own he said lord i'm going to do it my way and if we're living in an age that is a perfect example of that it's this age everywhere you look is i'm going to have it my way i'm going to do this the way i want to do it and it doesn't matter what anybody thinks but the more the lord reveals to me at least the more i see that lamb nature needs to come out in us just giving up our rights to him and completely surrendered to him so we're going to read this and then we're going to turn to john chapter 17 as well so just keep that in mind just a couple verses here romans chapter 12 verse 1 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world now i want you to see how he's connecting these two things it's not it's not just that when you present yourself a living sacrifice but when you do that what's going to happen to you you're be you're going to be not conformed and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god in this age god is looking to prove his word but he's looking to prove it through you you are the proof of god's word in this hour there is not another age coming amen there there is not another message coming there's not another there's not another end time sign coming you are as the prophet said in one point you are the final voice of the final age and if god's going to prove his word by anybody it's going to be through you but the only way we can do that is to submit ourselves a living sacrifice to him amen he won't kick he won't drag you kicking and screaming and then pull you like a puppet to make you perform his word he's looking for willing vessels he's looking for christ-like character that's why i i've been just so drawn to the garden of gethsemane over and over again because it was there god proved what that character was capable of amen because we understand the spirit of god even left the vessel in the garden and yet the character was so infused into that body because we understand he was the word made flesh there was no sin in him that he was able even then to lay down his own will and in this hour i believe he's going to prove that his word is so powerful his blood is so powerful that even a sinless flesh can be trampled underneath the foot of the the soul of the believer and and brought into subjection to this word you can't do it yourself and you got to be you got to be willing to recognize what part is you and what parts the word but praise the lord we have a message we have an open book before us to give us the simple it's so simple brothers and sisters and that's simplicity i want to just drive that home it's simplicity remember it's it's not the big things that you try to do but it's the little things we leave undone right so let's turn to john chapter 17. the message i'd like to speak on this morning would just be one word sanctification amen but we're gonna lord willing maybe approach it in a way that is a little bit different john chapter 17 we'll start at verse 17. jesus is speaking to his disciples he says sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth as thou has sent me into the world even so have i sent them into the world and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth amen let's just go before the lord in a word of prayer heavenly father lord we know that any mortal could read the words off the page father but it takes your spirit the holy ghost your very presence lord and your nature to reveal it to the to the heart of the believer lord and as we just come before you this morning father we want to submit ourselves completely to you as those living sacrifices lord we want to be completely surrendered to you lord mind body soul spirit everything that we are we want to just lay it upon the altar this morning lord we don't want anything of ourselves left oh god lord as it was we lord minister this morning may it not be my thoughts but may it be your word lord if there be any of my thoughts lord i pray you'd remove them and just cleanse them by the fire of the holy ghost remove them out of the way father and lord let your spirit speak to your people lord may we just commit the service into your hands bless all those that have traveled you know different different distances and different times lord and sacrifice to be here lord and we just pray oh god that he would bless them and abundantly lord above all they could ask her thank father we just love you so much father we commit the service into your hands in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated you know in in our age that we're living in we kind of spoke a little bit on friday you know we we really understand that the age we're in is a selfish age right we understand even though we were smitten out of this age what we call the bride age and everything we've come up higher than that and yet we still if we were to go farther even back into john 17 we understand i pray not that you would take them out of the world see we're still in the world but we're not of the world and being that as it may we must contend with the spirit of the age in which we've come out of and we understand that even goes back to the book of exodus exodus and how the the the mixed multitude that came out of egypt although they were experiencing the exodus and we understand right now we are experiencing in exodus brothers and sisters we said on friday you may not feel it you may not see it but as this word goes forth the master's hammer is just slowly forming you into his image yeah and and the lord gets the glory because it isn't about the way you feel it isn't about the way you think you see yourself but it's about his word that's taking effect in your life when you bring it into a willing heart when you bring it into good ground how many of you are good ground this morning you're gonna bring forth a hundredfold you may not always see it in the moment you know not all and not all the trees bring forth in the same season not all the crops come forth at the same time and so many times the devil in the see the age i have to take the age that we're living in because that is the spirit that is trying to press its way into the believer in this age and if you look around you can see what is the world focused on it spoke i've always i've always joked and called it the unholy trinity and i still do of me myself and i because it's it's it's a focus on the self that's right it's a desire to lift oneself up you know we we uh we think about even you could go even in the social medias and things that they have and i think about how they actually preach to the people and the people don't know it because they're in darkness but the people will be with that excuse you i think about how they have the tick tocks and the facebooks and the instagrams you know what they call those people they literally call them influencers they are trying to provide an influence upon the people that follow them now and that's what they've done they've brought influences into the world and even us as believers though we we try to shelter ourselves from all those things you can't help but be surrounded by that darkness because that's the atmosphere of the world that we live in which is why it's so important that we create our own atmosphere that we take that creative power god's given us speaking the word meditating upon the word of god speaking the positive things of god the prophet said that the christian is always positive never negative why because the word is yea and amen so we think about the age that we're living in that laodicean age what did laodicea mean it meant people's rights and if we're not seeing that either you can see in america is the perfect example of it why she was founded upon people's rights and in this age that we're coming to people's rights well i have a right to do whatever i want to do i have a right to this that i have a right to that but see when we became a christian we removed ourselves from worldly and and the cosmic world order as it were that that world order of politics and worried about all those things we've come up into a heavenly kingdom that's taken us beyond the worldly thoughts we can get so caught up in oh what's this doing over here what's that doing over there what is that to thee follow thou me and when we're talking about sanctification see jesus remember he was our example and i i i think we even mentioned this on friday but if you find yourself measuring yourself by other people then you're looking at the wrong measuring stick and i i hate to say it this way but if you're even looking at brother branham as your measuring stick you're looking at the wrong measuring stick he was an example for sure he was a wave sheet that the lord allowed to show us what could happen if you could fully surrender yourself and yet even then he only pointed to christ never pointed to himself that's why i love that song we sang because jesus he is greatest he is highest i will come to thee oh lord i haven't come to just sit at the feet of a prophet but when that prophet said behold the lamb of god that taketh away the sin of the world i gladly left that and i went with that word we don't have to revel in a day gone bye and we don't have to just look forward to a rapture that's become a body change but god is working right now but he's waiting for willing vessels he is waiting for somebody who could truly get sanctified that's right i'm not just talking about cleanse from the things of the world because we know what that is but remember sanctification is a compound word and too many times we leave off the second part remember what does it mean cleaned and what set aside for service and see what do we do we leave that part off because i think subconsciously we just expect god to just do that part for us but see jesus said in john 17 he said i sanctify myself for their sakes it's not he our example and then paul has to come along and say i beseech you what is missing she said i beg you he's begging the brethren give yourselves a living sacrifice if i could say it that way i'd say sanctify yourselves for the brethren for that is your reasonable service we don't realize how much we are affecting each other whenever we do the things that we do you are a part of the body thank you brian you are a part of this body whether one part rejoices the body rejoices with it whether one part hurts the rest of the body hurts with it yeah amen every little thing that you do affects all those around you and so if we could get out of that mindset of that laodicean well i have a right to it and we do have rights to it brother branham said we're living below our god-given rights and that is true but it's not just about your rights it's about the rights of your brothers and sisters who i be struggling it's about those that are out there that you love that you're praying for and fasting for and weeping for see since life that christ is given was not meant to just be closed up to yourself it's not meant to be just closed up to living waters tabernacle to bride of christ fellowship but he said freely you have received freely give what did you receive brothers and sisters what did you receive did you just receive an educational knowledge of an open book did you just receive something that could make you feel a little higher than denomination no but you received life and thought more abundantly you received life glory so freely give that life you ever feed light which is the life so freely give that light it's not enough to know it it's not enough to rejoice in it but it's time brother we are leaving i believe this is just me it's what the lord's put on my heart but we're leaving the little things undone because we're so busy looking only for something that's coming in the future we're looking for these great manifestations and they're they are here i believe even now they're happening in little portions but if we leave the little things undone how can god how can god trust us with the big things how can he trust us with the big things we're looking at all this stuff oh lord i wish you would do this great thing i wish you'd do this great thing and we ought to look for the big things we never cease looking for those things but in the meantime let us continue in the things god has called us to that we can do and say oh i would love to know the will of god well the will of god is his word and what does his word say see the the devil has has fought the people of god so much with works because as soon as you try to do works for god he's right there to say oh you're trying to work your way to heaven you're trying to work your way into some favor with god and i would say amen to the second one i am trying to work my way into more favor with god because i wanted to see that i'm obedient to every word that he showed me amen amen we're to be a living sacrifice every day putting yourself your desires your will upon the altar your will has to die randall verton's got to die every day it is not in my natural flesh to want to leave my wife and my two cute little dogs and come all the way out here and kind of be alone from that's not my natural desire but when the lord calls i will answer why because if he's done that much for me if he could leave his kingdom of heaven come down here and dwell and die for me how much literally or is that for me to just take a few days of sacrifice but we get so selfish we get selfish with it we want to do what we want to do and what do we say that's that's a little that's a child's mentality right when a child's got their little toilet you try to take it away and they slap your hand say that's my toy see but an adult see an adult when you become an adult brother i don't like i said i don't have children yet but they're coming brother amen they're coming you know when they're they're on their way but i i haven't been a child i understand it i can see it but you see that when you when you're younger you do whatever you wanted to do brother cam you remember we used to go wherever we wanted to go we did whatever we wanted to do if we felt like going to this meeting we went there if we felt like fellowship over here we fellowshipped over here but once you start taking responsibility once you start becoming an adult you start to mature a little more you realize god has placed me under a responsibility god has put me in a position and with that position comes certain responsibilities that i must fulfill or i'm not fulfilling the obligations of that office right if i were if i considered myself a husband to my wife and i didn't tell her that i loved her if i didn't express love to her in any way if i didn't provide for her the way a christian man is supposed to provide for if i didn't love her with a christ-like love then i wouldn't be fulfilling that office but i had to sacrifice for that because my body does not always want to tell my wife oh i love you or maybe i'm tired and she wants to go go shopping or something and what love me to go with her and i maybe don't want to but what is it it's the love of christ in your heart that drives you to fulfill the word of god amen i'd say children same with you with your parents you don't always want to obey but see if that holy ghost is there and that word is working on you you say you say say lord help me to be submissive lord help me to follow my parents leading why because that you must be that way because as you grow up it's never going to end little ones that's never going to end because you may think you outgrew your natural father but you'll never all grow your spiritual father you'll never outgrow him he'll always be there to guide you and direct you and correct you and tell you you can go here but don't go there do this but don't do that so you better start practicing it now you better start getting used to that now and being in that mindset of lord help me submit to my heavenly father as well as my natural parents amen praise the lord amen that's why it's uh it's a pretty powerful commandment of commandment with promise children obey your parents that i may be along with you that it may extend your days and be well with you so that's such an important thing it's such an important principle that we can take with us amen but see sanctification we understand the cleansing part we preached that how many times how many times we understand the holy ghost is always there convicting us when things aren't just right the holy ghost is there to tell us that thing you shouldn't be looking at that you shouldn't be thinking about that you shouldn't be doing this or that and that's wonderful we appreciate the lord for that we need it we need that more we need it more than ever we've let a lot of things slip probably because it's so easy however now we got to get to the second part it's time to set ourselves aside for the service of the lord and see that's not just something of you say well lord you cleanse me now just move me over here and just do whatever you want no he wants you to set yourself aside for his service every day he wants you to get down and say lord i'm gonna set my will aside i'm gonna set my desires aside what service would you have me provide for you today i just say this because this isn't to glorify anybody but i think about maybe ministers particularly pastors because there's more of an obligation to be there and to minister on a regular basis how many times brothers have you woken up and in your flesh you had no desire to get up and preach that morning because you were tired your children were keeping up late you didn't sleep really well or the devils fight you because we fight the battles but you know what you do you set that aside and say lord you have called me to a place where i must set aside my will and fulfill the word of god for what i do and what did he say feed my sheep feed my lambs be a good bishop and a good steward with the household of god and so what do you do no have you been perfect absolutely not i'm sure you have it i haven't either how many times have i said i was gonna preach or was gonna do something and then i didn't do it thank you lord for repentance forgiveness and for his blood but as we're going along in this journey he's just getting us a little closer he's just getting to listen a little closer we're drawing closer and closer and closer to him and the two are becoming one even now that uniting time is happening right now it's not a future event it is happening right now but it's going to take apart from you god will not push you through that pipe he can't do it because he did not predestinate you we talked about predestination he did not predestinate you just because he said i'm going to do this new he brother branham said he predestinated you according to foreknowledge because he knew what what you would choose so you have a part to play you must choose this day that's applicable every day of your life when you wake up choosing this day who you will serve are you going to serve your flesh on sin unto death are you going to serve the lord jesus christ and the spirit to life that is an everyday battle we've gotten so predestinated that i feel so many times i see spiritually that people are just laying back in lazy boys just saying well lord i came to the knowledge of this message and that must be good enough it's not good enough because it's got to live it's got to live and god is not playing with corpses here right he's not playing with corpses he's not going to take you like a puppet and just move you like a puppet on the strings i thought that i had in my mind i had that idea for many years i'll just be honest that i was expecting that holy ghost to be something that would come and that would just move me wherever he wanted to move me and he will he'll move in here but it's upon you to take that unction and put it into action by slaying that devil in your mind and moving forward you say brother that sounds like a lot you're trying to save yourself by works no sir no sir i know the work's already done i serve him because i serve him and i fulfill this word because the word in me wants to fulfill the word it has nothing to do with salvation i'm already saved he's already done the work now it's my part to play when john was sitting there and that mighty angel came down and said eat the book he said you must prophesy he didn't say i'm going to come and prophesy and you're just going to be there he said you must prophesy to many kindred nations and tongues there is a word not only that but you he had to re that angel didn't come down and force the book down john's throat he said take it you eat it you take it you eat it you prophesy god is looking for willing vessels that's the difference in this hour there's many people in the time of jesus that were living according to the law but had no real desire to do it they did it under pretense they did it for the they even scripture says he said they devoured widow's houses right that means they were doing shady deals behind the scenes they looked good but as soon as that person would die they'd swoop right in and say well the church is good it doesn't sound like the catholic church to you sounds like a catholic church to me they swoop right in and say oh she was a member of the synagogue this person was a member of the synagogue and and no doubt she willed everything to the church she willed everything to the synagogue devouring widows houses scooping them up making long prayers for pretense why to show the people that outwardly they were one thing when one of brother jesse said they're not inside inside on the inside they had no care for that at all it was all a means to an end and we got a lot of people even in the message that are like that we may not see them all yet but they will manifest themselves because it's got to in this hour but it's got to be so close it would deceive the elect if it were apostles they would deceive why you think those spirits are so close and they gotta come from the same group because they both heard the cry they both heard the cry but one day had the oil one wanted to seek after god one was there because it seemed easy they just happened to be there that's right they just happened to be there yes sir brothers and sisters we've got to give up everything that we thought we were we've got to give up all the thoughts that we thought we had we've got it's going to be so much simpler than what we thought it was going to be we thought like we said on friday we thought it was going to be i'm going to run over a troop i'm going to i'm gonna run through a troop leap over a wall then i'm gonna be doing this and just it's almost like a like a magic show like pow missing limbs restored yes it will happen we know it's coming but he said it would be so small it'd go right over the top and you wouldn't even see it jesus was on the scene the very god of heaven was on the scene at only a tiny fraction not of the world but just in jerusalem in judea knew that he was even there be the case in that day and that was the very god of heaven made flesh so much so that that the scripture said that if i could compile all the works he did in the book we wouldn't have the volumes to record it now think about even in our day when the prophet comes on the scene malachi 4 comes on the scene round the world seven times a healing ministry like the world hasn't ceased in the time of jesus christ and how many people have even heard of him now multiply that by a tinier percentage and that's how much is going to know about anything when this bride takes off the scene if they don't know about malachi 4 and we think that we're going to go around and just do these things and the whole world's going to know it then you don't know your bible because it pleases god to hide these things amen the hidden things belong to us the children of god that's what belongs to us so what is your motive and objective you got to make sure those are right first of all are you just looking to do something to prove something to someone else are you looking to do something or or is your heart's desire saying lord i just want to fulfill the word of god because that's what jesus's desire was he said lo i come in the volume of the book to do thy will oh god there wasn't anything beyond that i don't want to fulfill someone else's portion i want to find the portion that's allotted for me and lord help me to get into that spot stay in that spot and whatever whatsoever your hand find it to do do it with all your might you say brother that's carnal well why is the scripture saying james that pure religion undefiled is this to visit the widows of the orphans to do these things be not weary and well-doing but see we've forgotten it we've forgotten it it's so simple yes sir hallelujah i just thinking about brother jesse you're talking about talking to the brother in prison what happened to visiting the people in prison did not jesus say he said when when did we come visit you in prison when did we do this and we need to do that see it was so simple but we've left that off because we're just so comfortable in our little zone our little zone of of the message that we're not willing to venture out and see why because we're afraid of persecution maybe we don't want to admit that but so many times that's really what it is because we're afraid well people aren't going to accept it yeah 99.999 will not accept it we've already been taught that you better get that idea out of your mind right now but it's remember it's like those seeds brother branham said when he's talking about i think it was in the it is the rising of the sun he said all those seeds when god formed the earth were already in the ground he had already put them in the ground he said but when that first sunrise came up what happened that sun that light struck the seed and they started to come to life that's what we're doing right now brothers there are there are not many but there are seeds still out there and it's up to us to shine that light that big old gospel spotlight you're going to be brother you're sweeping over everybody you can find you may only find one out of a billion but you'll find that one that you're destined to find because if if that light see that the light that you're shining be the true gospel light if it be this message that we've received which is the only true gospel of the hour there's nothing outside of it i don't care how nice we try to be about it there is you cannot make a rapture outside this message it can't happen because is it the light for the hour and if you're shining that true light then the only life that can come forth is the light is the light that can that was represented with the seed because god is only matching it's just one it's there they have to be the same so don't be discouraged when all these ones will take so much and come to only so far and then fall away you know what at least praise the lord maybe they got a portion they may have got a portion and maybe they might have just been just been here to receive judgment sure you don't even know why see but we remember what we said what is our expectation we spoke at that upfront what is our expectation that everyone who comes in is going to receive it we know that's not true so why do we get discouraged when it doesn't happen when the words already told us oh lord no doubt we ought to have more sorrow for the souls that are out there well to have more love and compassion for that but our expectation has to be in line with this otherwise we can't see the world's expectation when he went down to the pool of bethesda was that he would just go you're healed you're healed you're healed i mean i can say it this way that sounds like religious like a modern benny hen oh you don't wave his hand over all the pool but then they all pass out and they all wake up healed or something but that wasn't so he passed by worse cases to meet the one that was predestinated why because he knew that he could receive it and it was his hour to receive it what what did the prophet say he said that was god's compassion that's not see human compass his ways are above our ways his thoughts are above our thoughts they're so past our finding out but we're so concerned with our own little worlds the scripture says be not concerned with your own things but every man look to the things of others right remember that isn't a covenant looking that's a that's a care that's that's a looking out for that's a watchfulness that's a watch me on a tower that says oh my i see this brother looks a little discouraged i'm gonna get down on my knees and pray for him i'm gonna i'm gonna sacrifice a little bit of my time to pray for someone else and not just get down before god with a grocery list of things that i want god to do that's not a relationship yes if you're married and all your wife comes to you for is honey i want this honey i want that honey would you do this honey would you do that okay i just need this i need that i need this and i need that and we want to sit down with her she don't want nothing to do with you that's not a relationship that's nothing but an indentured servant is that what we've made god it's time we come up a little higher hallelujah praise god let's turn to ephesians i'm sorry uh first corinthians forgive me first corinthians we're at the uniting time that's right we are at the uniting time the bride and the groom are becoming one first corinthians chapter 7 verse 34. i was really struck by this it says there is a difference also between a wife and a virgin the unmarried woman careth for the things of the lord that she may be holy both in body and spirit but she that is married care for the things of the world how she may please her husband now i want to i want to take this if i could it sounds a little strange but let's take the anti-type of that see he's talking naturally but let's take it spiritually if you're unmarried you're caring for the things you see if you're not married spiritually you're going to be caring for the things of the world how many how you may please yourself but if you're truly married to christ then you only care about the things that will please your husband it's time we became we where where where are we trying to please yes see now he's talking let's take it up a little level higher if you're unmarried i'm not talking natural i'm talking spiritually what are you caring for if your eye if your appetites and your thoughts are always for yourself well then you're married to yourself you're caring for yourself what can i do what can i do this but if you're married to him you say lord what would my husband desire of me what what does he want from me so i can give all that i have to that desire right i want to be married to him i want all that i am to be married to christ so that my only desire is for him that every every ounce of my being is lord how can i please my husband see the remember he's talk that's a he says he says this is a great mystery but i'm speaking concerning christ in the church see there's a marriage happening there's a unification happening and he's showing us even in a type what happens when two get married is that wife cares about the husband cares about the things of the husband so what are you caring for if you're caring for your own things well then we better check to see where we're at in our marriage vows because if all we're caring about is ourselves well then where's the other part where's the care for the husband see he cared enough for you that he came and died for you he came down he sacrificed everything for you he gave up remember he gave up the chance in a natural family for a natural things he gave up the natural things that he had a right to right so that he could for the glory that lay be before him he bore the cross in despising the shame so that's the question where are we at come on what's our what's our desire how are we are we setting ourselves aside really sanctifying our lives setting our will aside setting our desires aside we've got to do that if we want to see if we want to see this from the lord amen ephesians chapter 5. ephesians chapter 5 verse 30 through 32 we've heard this for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cult shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church so that's the question who are you married to where's your marriage because we understand what happens when you're married your desires your obligations change a little bit right when you when we were single we'd go do whatever we wanted we could we were basically in the natural at least we were living to please ourselves because we didn't have obligations but see once you've been married to christ those obligations change and are we the bride of christ or are we the white are we becoming the wife of christ right now then what happens that wife has her obligations changed now she only concerns herself with the things that can please her husband oh lord help us yes that's it lord help us because we're so selfish we are so selfish maybe it's not you but it's me if it's any if it's not for anybody it's for me i'm not this isn't condemnation but we need to check up he's calling us higher we're coming where it's a uniting time and the only place to be united is in christ and we've seen what that nature produces because we've seen it in the word and we saw it through a prophet that was a wave sheep what did he do a man and this isn't glorifying the man it's the christ in the man that was giving us an example that i i think about how often i will just not do things because i'm a little bit tired and yet this brother that we that we love and we've seen what the the spirit of christ did in him would bang his leg against the car and pluck out hairs from his arm just to drive miles at midnight to go pray for one person that's the spirit of christ being made manifest that's look at paul and all the things that he labored in the things that he sacrificed had nothing had one cloak to his name and yet we're not satisfied unless we got laodicean parks all over the place now we got to have a good car gotta have a good house and i'm always reminded that scripture said therefore having food and rainment be content how many of you got more than that and still sometimes you find yourself not being content like you ought to be i raised my hand saying lord forgive me i've been so many times and what is it because you got caught now in the type what paul spoke about when you're married or things you get caught up in the natural how to please your wife or please your husband in the natural but i want to be that portion in the spiritual lord how can i please you today how can i lay myself down because that's where you will find the contentment that's where you will find the true joy it's better to give than to receive but we're always looking to receive something from god why don't we look to give a little bit of what god given us out the world perverted that into a christmas and all this garbage that they got out there but let's take the reel there's a bunch of scarecrows out there but let's push those aside because there is a true spirit of god that's going to work in his people there are real works that are to be done not for pretense not because you just want to look good to your pastor but because the word said it i don't see someone doing it the lord put it on my heart to do it and i will fulfill that word if there's no one else to fulfill it i will fulfill that word because you've been called to do it what's the only thing that can fulfill word word word is the only thing that could fulfill word it isn't that's why the pharisees said they could do all that they wanted to do they could put all these things and see we've heard the story brother brain i'm told who was there when you were sick the kind of priest who was there when they did this the kind of priest and satan uses that as a scarecrow to put you off from doing all those things because those things are good what's the difference he was doing it as a job he was doing it because it was my obligation to do it he was doing it because that catholic church would receive money from them just like the pharisees he was doing it because he loved the praises of man more than the praises of god that's what he said they love to wear long robes and to say oh bishop in the streets oh mighty bishop and all these different things i went to my grandmother's funeral a couple weeks ago she actually passed away like a year and a half ago during coven and they weren't even had the funeral until recently well they did it in the catholic church and i tell you what i was actually kind of excited to go because i had never seen a catholic service before in person except for when i was like a really tiny little child that brother it's exactly what it is but they walk they're playing all this music they have a little mini choir in the back with like three or four people singing of uh whatever they do and then here comes the bishop just walking down all slow there's i'm not kidding you there was probably only about 40 people in the whole thing and the thing could probably hold like a thousand fifteen hundred people and harry comes just [Music] like just all like pomp and circumstance what is it just i want the glory of man you can see it in their walk you can see the way they they act why because it's just a job it's just something that gets them a title but see it's not so with the people of god see satan has used that as a scarecrow to do away with the things that we still need to do to visit the widows and the orphans and to provide for the needs that you see in the body and to provide for the things that people have need of and to be there to pray with someone when they need it or you know help out someone when they need to move or be with someone or give them some a meal when they're sick or something and we and we look past those things because they look so small but it's the little things that we leave undone every when the lord puts that unction on your heart think about the woman that the lord put on her heart to pray for that little baby in the prayer line had she missed that unction perhaps that baby wouldn't have even been healed because the lord put it on her heart to do it but it's so easy so it's such a little thing the lord puts it on your heart to pray for somebody said well i can't do it because the pastor will do it it's not on the pastor right it's not on the pastor is in office to fulfill a service to the lord and to the people of god but you have a service to provide for god himself you have a part to play each one of you that doesn't mean we just go off and do whatever we want the lord's put a bishop over the church to be an overseer and we just don't sheep just don't run wild but at the same time they take the unction of the lord and they run with it and and i believe a pastor would be so if i could say they're so proud of his of the sheep that god's given him to be overseer of if he heard about a testimony a brother jesse hears a testimony of a sister got somebody on her heart and called someone in the church and prayed over the phone and they got healed that would be a testimony for jesus christ why because it's the holy ghost working in the body but we've turned it back into another bishopric oh it's all going to come through the pulpit it's all going to come through the pulpit no it doesn't it works through the body of christ he's calling each part of the body to play their part why because whether you know it or not the pastor can't even fully play his part until you're playing yours he can't do it because they all got to be in their positions that great orchestra that conductor could be up here conducting all he wants but if the two of us where the flute should be and the flute's over where the bass drum should be the music will always be messed up that's why each one of you has a part to play each one of us has a place to that you that only you can fulfill that's right there's no big eyes or little use remember there's a reason that brother branham would tell these little parables remember he talked about the i think it was the swedish man or something or whatever it was i talked about the the bolts a bunch of nuts he said but without the nuts you got a bunch of junk why because it may seem like the littlest piece it may seem like this little thing but you give it time you hear that little rattle in the car and you can't seem to find it it's maybe one little cotter pin that's out of place you give that time you run a few thousand miles on it pretty soon your axle falls off or something why because that little piece means something each piece has a purpose how many if you ever put together i think about it think about this you put together those little furniture things they have it like ikea and places the little solder furnitures and different things you can buy at stores and they come with instructions that us brothers never look at we just throw them away and start putting it together and you get finished putting it together what happens why do i have like six boats left over why because you didn't follow the directions why and even though you didn't know it the engineer designed it in such a way that those pieces had a purpose and that's what we do with god we we want to do something and we just run out without checking this without checking up here lord what would you have me do we just go out and do what we feel like we ought to do and what happens it all falls apart we wonder why and the engineers satan if you would have just the engineer's saying to you if you would have just taken that boat over here if you would have just taken this little prayer over here if you would have just taken this little offering i told you to give a month to go over here then you wouldn't be struggling where you are you wouldn't be fighting where you are but we leave all the things undone because what we put we put ourselves before him and we don't even know it we don't even know it because we've been puffed up by being called the bride we're the bride we're the bride we're the bride i tell you what esther was the bride too but when she wanted something from the king she went down and she bowed herself before the king not only that she she didn't even ask the first time the first time she went to him she said lord my only ass was it was a banquet of wine it was a banquet of stimulation said lord i just want you to come to our bank with a stimulation and that satan was there remember haman was there so yeah he's gonna show up too that's okay but it's not about him it's about the king and what did she do she said lord i just want you to come to my banquet of wine then i'll prepare for you the simulation we're going to worship you we're going to praise you and then what did you do she got down before him and he said what is your what is your request queen esther and i'll give you anything up to half the king she said oh my king if it pleased me she didn't even give her a request then when she said come tomorrow again to the banquet that i will prepare for oh my goodness that's god's people that's the wife who ain't there looking for just something god can do for her she wants to perform a service for her king she wants to give something to him she said come tomorrow come tomorrow tonight we're going to put another banquet on for you we're going to we're going to put another feast of wine on for another stimulating revelating that's glory to god a rejoicing time for you then he gave her everything she had needed then she could make her petition no see that's that's maturity see because remember esther already knew everything that was happening at the time and i'm sure there's probably even a deeper type there that i don't even see yet but i'm sure it's there i just hadn't studied this just kind of came fresh here so i wasn't necessarily studying on that but you think about it that's all right but what did she do she had a maturity to her yeah she knew what heyman's plans were she knew he was there yes but she could wait to the second time she said oh now i'll make my request known see how often do we do i think about you know brother branham i think there was the brother that had the issue in his i think he had like a growth on him on his ear or something and he wouldn't ask brother branham about it because he felt he didn't want to bother him but what happened the lord honored that brother's faith because he knew that god could do it but he just didn't he just didn't feel like it was his place to interrupt the prophet while he was while he was hunting or whatever it was and the lord came right around and honored that why because he wasn't seeking his own he was having respect in this case just respect to an office he said i don't want to bother brother branham he's doing this hunting trip and i know this is when he relaxes and so how many times if we would just you know if we would pray for one another i said that's been my prayer lately as lord help me not to just always get down and think of myself no it's it's easy you start praying for for others that you love and that other than you know and it seems like within a few minutes you're just on yourself over it's like this revolving loop of here we go back to myself back to myself back to myself but the lord wants to see that that that sacrificial life that setting aside of your life all to him and that's what we're talking about a real sanctification setting yourself aside so that he can use you because he can't use you if that if your vessel is busy doing everything you want to do what god goes to reach on the shelf where you should be set aside and you're not there i can't imagine how disappointed he is when he said well i cleansed you i sanctified you and here you are doing what you think you ought to be doing or what you want to do and he goes to use that vessel and it's not there well say lord forgive me for not always being available where i ought to be not being not being surrendered to you the way i ought to be lord have mercy forgive me amen lord have mercy you know we're looking he's put up the devil's put up all those scarecrows we're going to close here in just a minute i have like a one quote here i just want to read if i could he's put up all these scarecrows and he's got us thinking in a certain way he's got us into this place where so it's just lord lord's going to do it lord he's already done it how many times did the brother branham have to say even about just about healing and in general he said if jesus christ was here right now he couldn't do any more for you than he's already done i believe it was in the church age book and you correct me if i'm wrong brothers but i believe in the church age but brother branham said the reason people will miss it is because they cannot accept the full atonement because they can't accept it and when you accept it what do you do you surrender to it accepting being able to accept something is a surrender right because all day long someone could try to give me a gift give me a gift give me a gift and i'm just no no i just can't i just can't i just can't you know people like that you try to give them try to give them a blessing and they're like no no no no and you're just like just accept the blessing i just want to help you or the lord put it on my heart to do it that's how the lord feels about us sometimes if we would just surrender ourselves to him accept lord i'll accept whatever blessing you want to give him whatever blessing you desire for my life lord you've already given me more than i could ever have imagined you gave me eternal life you gave me a a a faith and a hope of a resurrection and a body change that i know is coming you gave me a holy ghost to give me life to believe your word when the rest of the world can't see it what more can i ask for and this is from god's only provided place of worship the other man said that every little jot everything you must be faithful in always the little vine the little the little fox spoils the vine sometimes you leave he says it's not the big things you do it's the little things you leave undone remember a chain is only its strongest at its weakest weakest link blessed are they that do all the commandments of god that they might have a right to enter in do all god said and it said for women to have long hair he said a man told me not long ago i don't preach a clothesline religion i said well then you're not preaching the gospel he said god laid it out there he said what to do you either do it that's your natural reasonable thing that's how simple it is god said it i will do it lord give me grace to do it more the lord give me grace to do all the little things all the all the big things all the little things i don't want to leave any of it undone because all it took was one in the garden of eden just one lord i want to be there and i know it's not about all my works are going to help me to enter in no because any holy ghost-filled christian knows that they can't do it without him because it's not me that do with the works it's christ that's in me but my job my obligation is to give that living sacrifice is to be dead to my thoughts dead to my expectations that what i think is coming no i don't know what's coming lord i i can only understand what i can understand that you've given me so far lord let my mind let my mind if i can say it this way let my mind just be a big comma and whatever you reveal to me let me be ready for more let me be in the channel so the next time you reveal something i can say amen and roll right with it he said blessed our day he says he said uh that's your natural reasonable thing what little thing what the little insignificant jesus said blessed are they that would take all the little thing do the little things a woman and a woman let her hair grow that's just that's just something she can do that doesn't even you know you think about that even the natural it's just something nature does it for her right and she won't even do that she won't even do that oh teach us great things how can you teach great things when you won't do the simple common thing because you see your motive and objective is wrong see that what does that show if you ever seen anybody have you ever worked in different places where you see a person come in and the first thing that they're doing is trying to undermine the boss or trying to trying to to game for a higher position right away even though they don't know anything about the job they're in i've seen it and you can tell right away what motive they have has nothing to do with doing their job properly it's all about finding a position it's all about more power it's all about more authority for themselves and see that's what we see so many times if we're not careful is we can't you know if you're going to get promoted let god promote you what did he say he said when you go to the feast take the lower seat so that then we which is the governor of the feast can say oh friend come up higher but let's say lest thou take the higher seat he said oh someone more nobler than they come in and then you'll be forced down oh my so when we're trying we want all these big we want the big thing i want to we sh we ought to be seeing all the spiritual gifts in the church i don't care what anybody says those spiritual gifts are for the local body yeah they're for this body they're for the body we're down in texas they're for living water's habit every local body should have them but i say lord if i'm not ready for them then i need to be more surrendered there's a reason we ain't got it yet because i believe that we believe we should have them but there's a reason god the word is not wrong it's always us it's me it's me it's me o lord standing in the need of prayer there's nothing wrong with this word we have received a perfect word in this hour all the mysteries of god should be finished they've been finished they are being finished right now and you the question is can we surrender to them are we willing to wait upon your ministry maybe you feel a call in your life that the lord has put it on your heart that there's going to be something great coming well you know what until that time whatever he's given you be faithful in if you're faithful in italy you'll be faithful and much right you know why you don't get much because you ain't faithful in the little yet you know why the church doesn't have much yet this bride is because she hasn't been faithful in the little things yet why because that's the law of god it's just the word it's that simple we say oh well it can't be true because we're the bride that's nothing but pride that's nothing but pride because i remember a vision the prophet had of that bride going up and what was it the last little bit started to stumble and we're at that spot right now that i believe this word is crying out to us the holy ghost is yelling to us get back in line it's time we told the word once again and stop playing around stop thinking that we get to skip all of the intermediate steps and get to business with god and say lord what are the little things we're leaving undone he's he's going to do it he is doing it but he's looking for people to surrender to it he's looking for us that would just be willing lord whatever little thing you want lord i'm going to be i'm going to be that that wife that's married to you and only cares for the things of her husband now we're not talking naturally we're talking spiritually i only want to care for the things of my husband how it can please my husband that's what i want to be all right amen we're going to keep reading here he says he says how can you teach the great things you won't do the simple common thing because your motive and objective is wrong we need to check up on that sometimes lord lord forgive me is there times where i've wanted something to happen just because i wanted to prove somebody wrong i know i just admit i've been guilty i say lord please just let this happen so so they can prove it wrong no the lord doesn't play like that the lord does not mess around like that the ultimate proving wrong is going to be this body change when they all look around and say i thought i thought the rapture was supposed to happen first and he says it's already coming you didn't know it that'll be the ultimate if you want to put it this way i told you so but that's why we wait on the lord because he said i will avenge vengeance is mine saith the lord i will repay but we're all looking for where to dig our little things in whether it be you know uh theologically or spiritually whatever way we want to do we're looking to dig the knife in so many times because that that briar nature that we have to fight every day we got to tamp it down we got to tamp it down it's your love to god lord i don't care what you want me to do i'm willing to do it he says then you're getting somewhere but if you don't do it that way the way he said do it it's his choosing the place i have chosen that's where you worship with your sacrifice you put cain brought a sacrifice abra brought his it depends on what place you take it into if you take it into the place where he's chosen it'll be all right he'll accept it if it's not he won't accept it now there is the difference between a pharisee and a born-again son or daughter of god because they know where to take the sacrifice see the pharisees had tons of sacrifices oh i go here and i do this funeral service and i go here and i do these arms and i make these prayers in the square and i do all these things but their sacrifice was being brought to a place of selfishness it was being brought to a place of self-serving like look at me look at me look at me but the christian what do they do they'll do these things in secret don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing when they give their when they want to help out a brother or sister they don't have to go and let everybody know that they're going to do it they don't have to tell other people after they've done it they don't have to do this and do that or when they're going to go over to do help someone else out nobody else has got to know about it they just do it in secret why because do when you do it in secret your heavenly father will reward you openly i say lord that reward that i want is just a closer walk with him that's the kind of reward we're talking we're talking about spiritual rewards we're not talking with natural things those are great praise the lord you know if you've got a house and a car and all those things but you know what i want let's build up our kingdom in heaven let's build up our treasures in heaven let's not don't even worry about what other people think about you people some people you know the way they think they may see you doing a certain thing or not doing a certain thing and assume something and you don't even know when you get on the other side you don't know that that person gave everything they had to jesus christ and you never knew anything about it because you were looking on the natural you couldn't see the inside lord help us to have spiritual eyes to see and ears to hear right amen remember first corinthians chapter 13 he says though i give my body to be burned though i give all i have to the poor and i have not charity it avails me nothing that's right so what is it remember the pharisees did all they could do they gave up everything they had to be in the priesthood they're in the priesthood they gave up all those things seemingly even though in their heart they were ravening for those things that's all they desired but on the outside it looked great but what was it they couldn't come to that holy ghost surrender to say that's because that's where the sacrifice is accepted is underneath that that token the holy ghost the only place the sacrifice can be accepted is when you're doing it according to his will and not your own that's right amen says let us notice here the place that he chose for the sacrifice to be laid he placed that he chose to put his sacrifice you can't put it on any of these gates but the place that he chose to put it he also put his name in that place see that's what he said here he chose to put his name in it now let us search the scriptures for that place for that is the place where he put his name now let's read i'm going to skip down here a little bit he says he's talking about uh he says now you can't take this your sincerity in all that you want to confess you just can't take it to a methodist altar to a baptist altar to a pentecostal altar but there is an altar somewhere that he chose to put his name in it and he would meet you at that place now if you get everything running just right it's going to run everything's set in order if there's a short in that wire that light won't come on because it's been grounded and when you'll take one of god's words or one of his places and in your now listen to this if you'll take one of his words or one of his places and in your own heart have selfish objectives it'll ground the power of god right there so what's our objective is our objective to to do our own will because we have a vision and we have an expectation of what we want ourselves to be or are we trying to mean his expectation of what he wants us to be are you are you set let everyone abide in the calling wherein they are called are you satisfied with who he's made you are you satisfied with the gifts he's given to you or are you always looking to take someone else's or are you unsatisfied always looking with the carnal side of always looking on the things of others and say oh i wish i had what this guy had oh i wish i had what this guy had oh i wish i could just do this the way this person does it you can't you never will be able to the the best you'll get is a carnal impersonation if i tried to preach like brother cam or brother jesse or sing like another person to do this agent the best it would get is a carnal impersonation it won't do any good that's right i'll never be satisfied because i'll deep down know that i'm just faking it and god will never be satisfied because that's not who he made me when god isn't satisfied when you try to form yourself to another image he said be comfort be transformed by the renewing of your mind transformed into what into his image not anybody else's and that image is an image of sacrifice it's an image of sanctification setting yourself aside every day to serve him amen jesus said i only do that which pleases the father i only do those things so he says he says if you've got your own selfish objective it'll you'll ground the power of god right there if you do it because you now listen if you do it because you want to be smart you want to be different from somebody else or something right there it's grounded it'll blow a fuse you're wrong you've got to come with sincerity with all your heart your motives and objectives place that on god then search for his place find where he said and bring it there wow that's what he's looking for we need more sincerity if if the lord if the lord could tell the prophet of god of this aid the messenger of this age that you lost the love for the people you need to be more sincere and now we've come 60 plus years down the line from that then how much more than we need to have why because iniquity shall abound the love of many would wax cold that's right and we're seeing it brothers and sisters ye who are filled with the holy ghost can see the iniquity even within the ranks of the message you can see it you can see that they say one thing act another way you can see all these different things but don't let it make you grow cold you know what you cling you cling closer to jesus christ you know what happens you know what happens when the weather gets colder you get closer to the fire you get closer to the fire and right now the lord is wanting to become so close to that fire that you and the fire become one you will become that fire she becomes him you become that living voice you become that life it's the only way it can happen but see there's not it's not just any life it's not just your interpretation of that life it is the life of christ that will bring it manifest let's stand to our feet i want to be more sincere lord jesus help me to be more sincere lord help me to be only caring about the things that would please my husband lord if i want to be married to you lord you place that engagement ring upon me the earnest of our inheritance that that wedding band that you're bringing us into unity and this our lord help me to only care about the things that would please my husband in this hour help me to be fully surrendered lord to everything that you would have from me lord not not to build up my own name but the name of jesus christ that everywhere i go lord that that life will be able to shine through me lord because you're not going to dwell in a filthy house you're not going to lord when when i when you want to call me lord when you want to call my brothers and sisters may he look on the shelf and find that that life is so set aside it's sitting on that shelf perfectly ready to be grabbed by the master's hand and use lord for whatever you would have it to be used for lord if it just be a little thing lord if it be a big thing we don't care because we know that the only place we can find joy the only place that we can find peace the only place we can find satisfaction is in your perfect will lord lord we know we can't find it anywhere else lord we can all i believe testify that we've tried to find that satisfaction other places lord maybe even when we've even since we've started serving you we've maybe tried to put our hand to certain things thinking it was your will but then we find it all fell flat because we had the wrong motives and objectives but lord let us lay that on the altar now let us be honest with ourselves lord let us be willing to wait upon our ministry lord let us be willing to wait for that still small voice lord and in the meantime lord all the things that you already said in your word that we ought to do let us be about the father's business lord you've already given us the blueprints you've already given us the instructions and lord i believe that the ones that are here this morning you've already given a heart to receive it you've already given a heart that they desire to perform it but lord may we just get out of our own way and not worry about the bigness or smallness of the seeming situation but lord if we could just look into the word and say lord that's the word that needs to be fulfilled in this hour lord jeremiah send me let me be willing to fulfill that word no matter how small lord if it's just giving a cup of water to somebody lord if it's just getting down on my knees for a minute here or there because all of a sudden throughout the day you put somebody on my heart lord maybe i was at work and i didn't i thought i didn't have enough time but lord you put it on my heart right there just to go even it was just a prayer for a minute more i want to sacrifice my will to you so that your glory could rest upon me lord that your work and your power could rest upon me will glory in that lord will just say lord i don't care how big or little it is i want to do it for your glory not with the wrong objectives lord but just to just to know lord i could imagine just to know that we're in your will would be enough for me to know lord that i'm performing the word that you desire for me would be enough for me lord let it be for each one that's here this morning lord lord i believe each one of us is desiring to surrender ourselves more to you lord jesus lord may we just place ourselves on the altar this morning oh god place ourselves on the altar every morning when we wake up lord from the time we wake up to the time we go to bed just to bury that old man underneath lord and say lord have your perfect will and way in our lives lord i think about enoch it wasn't any great amazing thing but the scripture simply says he walked with god and he was not for you took him lord it's that simple everyday walk lord that you've called us to if we could be faithful in that little thing that little everyday walk lord it seems so simple but it's so easy to let it slip or because we get caught by the cares of the world and so supposed obligations that we have lord let us not be drawn by those things lord but let us be drawn by those bands of love back to you lord amen we just commit ourselves to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we ask it and we thank you for it lord amen thank you lord jesus how many you feel clean how many of you feel like you've been cleansed this morning i feel i feel there's a renewing in my spirit that he's bringing us to that place of full surrender where his least little desire is my greatest desire amen amen let's just sing that song the more that i surrender amen if you have need a prayer we'll pray for you we'll have our brother jesse come up here to close the service we appreciate you we appreciate our your pastor brother jesse for having us just pray that something was said that would draw you closer i believe the ministry we're not here to uplift ourselves we're out here to uplift the name of jesus christ he's the only one worthy the only one holy there was no one else found worthy to open the book amen
