on this Father's Day thank you Lord for your fatherly love and guidance we give you all the glory and bless this word now in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen praise God let's take our Bibles here this morning not the grace of all I like to preach a Father's Day message by God's grace Abba just a few texts here let's go to acts 13 verse 21 they'll be our first text by God's grace I like to just title this little Father's Day message called after the Father's heart I'd like to preach on that this morning after the Father's heart acts 1321 so this scripture is about David who is after the Father's heart 18:21 if you're there say Amen and afterward they desired a king and God gave unto them saw the son of Kish a man of the tribe of Benjamin by the space of 40 years and when he had removed him he raised up unto them David to be their king to him also he gave testimony and said I have found David the son of Jesse a man after my own heart which shall fulfill all my will let's go to Luke 15 here I'll just have two spore shion's of Scripture here today by the grace of the Lord Luke 15:17 this is the story of the prodigal son after the Father's heart amen Luke 15:17 when he came to himself he said how many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare and I perish with hunger I will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father I have sinned against heaven and before thee and AM no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of the hired servants verse 20 and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him amen may God has besting the reading of his word you may be seated by God's grace I'd like to take a few minutes here and preach on this little thought of after the Father's heart just kind of been on my heart I guess this week by the grace of the Lord you'd like to preach on that this morning praise the Lord God is so good to us how many thankful for a Heavenly Father amen I can truly say that God has been a tremendous father to me every need I've ever had God has provided and so I just want to give him praise and honor for his great provision I'd like to look here at this after the Father's heart and I'd like to go now to romans 5 i just kind of want to build just a little foundation here so let's go to romans 5 verse 6 if you have your bibles that's read out of here we have just take our time this morning by the grace of the lord know yesterday when i was with that gentleman you know who tried to commit suicide we were talking and and this scripture just came to me like and i'll just share a little bit about that just a encouraging testimony Romans 5 verse 6 Romans 5 verse 6 Romans 5 verse 6 glory for when we were yet without strength in due time Christ died for the ungodly for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die but God commended commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us much more than being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him Amen what a promise amen for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by what our own good merit no by the death of his son Amen Jesus Christ death reconciled us to God much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life amen but not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom now we have received the atonement amen I think I'll just pause right there there's a whole lot in this passage but the point I want to bring out was just verse 8 God commendeth his love toward us that means to prove to someone commandeth means to prove so God proved his love to you and I in that while we were sinners Christ died for us amen and then the Bible said he justified us by his blood so when we believe in Jesus Christ and accepted him he justified us he declared us righteous we're believers and his Christ took our sin upon him and now we take on his righteousness amen and because of that we are saved from the wrath of God through Jesus Christ what a blessing amen we were enemies to God but now we're reconciled by the death of Jesus Christ praise God and we're supposed to have joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ amen we're to have joy this morning you have joy amen in your heart joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ because we have received the atonement amen and that means we are made one with God that means there are no more sins against us remember the day of atonement in Leviticus 16 they all the believers could walk out of that fellowship on that Sabbath day they can all walk out and say my sins are gone you ask me why I'm happy I'll just tell you why because my sins are gone amen this is the one day of the year that we can clearly and proudly and thankfully and graciously proclaim all my sins are gone amen and now that not only do they could they declare it they could actually see it they could see the air and you know have an escort you know to take the the goat as far away out of the canvas possible and then push him off a cliff and then and say that that our sins are gone away our sins have been sent away amen we have received the atonement have you received God's a told me this morning amen that you know you're one with God amen the Bible said when you're truly justified you have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ we do not have war with God we have peace with God amen now our reason this meant so much to me and ties in with this message is because yesterday as I said we were at the hospital I just went by myself I mean here my friend and I and he said one of the reasons he didn't contact me back was because he saw people in the church used me and he named a certain name and I'm not going to call names but he just said brother Jesse I said I'd saw this beat this person kept using you and I got angry and mad and and I didn't want to I didn't want to let's watch any more sermons I don't want to text you back because you were just getting used the whole time and I said brother I said I don't know if I was used the whole time because I felt sincerity in different individuals you know you feel in sincerity at times right you know you try to help people and and you you and I can sense right we can feel that people are being sincere or not right we can sense it and so I said times I said sincerity but but I think sometimes I was being used but I just looked at him and I started crying because I started thinking of this scripture and I and and I thought of how Jesus and I said that's brother I said Jesus Christ died and rose for us and the and I said Jesus Christ the Bible says that the rain falls on the just and the unjust and I said I look out that window I said look at that that Sun came up this morning and that sun is shining on all the people who blaspheme Jesus's name that Sun is providing food it's going to the the crops that are going to produce corn and beans and soybeans and all the food that people are going to eat this fall they're going to enjoy their summer corn on the cob you know sinners but God lets it come up anyway because God is merciful and he started crying he said that changed my mind he said you really said something there Jesse and I said well is this the Holy Spirit but he just couldn't stand seeing someone used and it just made him mad and so he said he couldn't come to church he couldn't you know watch church and and I said I said that's I said I don't mind being used because I know how much God loves me I know God loves sinners and how much more of God loves sinners how much more did he love me praise God where we love God and we try to serve God how much more does he love you and I Amen because he loves his children and so that just struck me yesterday because God is so gracious and remember Jesus said these words in Matthew chapter 5 so I'm went from Romans 5 to Matthew 5 in verse 38 you've heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek turn to him the other also so Jesus tells us we there's times we're supposed to take physical pain and turn the other cheek for the sake of Christ verse 40 and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him Twain oh my give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away you have heard that have been said thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy but I say and you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you and I was telling the brother I said how can how can we how can we pray for someone that uses if we never let ourselves be used I tell you what church it takes a real humble person to be used by somebody else on purpose I know you and I it's difficult someone's to asking things from us to ask in our time our money our resources they're asking our energy and we know they only want it for selfish motives and yet if we give it anyway then we have expressed the love of God to that individual amen if you and I can do this if we can exfolia spresso our love like this then verse 45 tells us that ye may be the children of your father in heaven you know you're a true child of God when you go an extra mile for someone right when you give someone something extra and they're just keep taking from you and and they don't deserve it oh this person doesn't deserve my help this person doesn't deserve my forgiveness this person doesn't deserve it well that's just the wrong attitude everybody deserves it Amen let God be the judge of who deserves it and who doesn't amen are you with me we're so quick to judge and yeah we shouldn't the Bible says we should grow and love and abound in judgment but member Jesus told the Pharisees he said you've done the little things but you've left off the major things which are mercy and judgment amen mercy having mercy upon others so that's what I told the brother I said I don't mind to be used in fact I sometimes I enjoy being used because I know that makes me a child of God amen because that's exactly what Jesus says it doesn't bother me because I know that's what God does every single day of every hour of every year God is constantly giving giving giving and people are just not caring they're not thanking him but yet he gives anyway and no doubt God loves a cheerful Giver Amen God asks us what to give a few times a week maybe right does God ask you to give to the poor maybe once a week once once a month and we wonder well should I give or not you know but yet God is constantly giving every second of every single day amen he never stops he's just a giver he's just a constant Giver he's a this fountain of life just flowing and constantly giving life when people don't we'd say deserve it from our standards oh my that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his Sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the publicans so be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect how do you want to be perfect in the love of God perfect which means complete forgiven now you have the complete character of Christ expressing through your life that's perfection and Jesus shows this is the way to do it let yourself be used give at times when it's not easy to give give extra when you don't feel like giving extra highlight here yeah amen I'll say praise the Lord hallelujah so see God proves his love and that's what I told the brother I ended by saying this I said God doesn't have to show me any more love than what he's already showed me and I'll still love him the rest of my life amen you could stop showing me love he could let me go through trials and tests like job he could allow me to go and God really don't have to show me any more love because the Bible said he proved his love to all of us when we were sinners Christ died for you and I amen we know he loves us why because Jesus Christ died for us and all history at all civilizations have to testify to the fact that he died and rose again hey man it's exactly right I just can't get over this quote I'm gonna read it again I've read it numerous times the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval of you well God must be really upset at me because I'm having some cloudy seasons and storms in my life that's not always true remember Jobe it's not always true neither are bright skies and still water signs of his love and approval oh my everything's going good for me be careful that's what happened to the rich young ruler everything got so great he started big in building bigger barns he had to make separate bank accounts on top of his other bank accounts because of all his money and brother BAM said Satan blessed him that's what the sermon leadership 1965 says Satan was blessing him but God allowed it right so see cloudy skies aren't always a sign I did something wrong and neither are bright skies evidence that you did something right his approval of any of us is only in the beloved so in his heart amen in his bosom the only way God approves you and I is if you're in his bosom hallelujah you're in his heart did you know that brother Graham said you have a place in God's heart there is a place in God's heart for every true believer amen and I'm after that heart I'm after that place amen that's what I wanna know where's my place where's my position in the heart of God hallelujah praise God amen well any - God want me to do what does God called me to do I wanna find what God has placed for my life amen his love is elected which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us ah yes but how should we know we shall know because he said so so fate just in other words faith in the plain word of God is why how he should know that he loves us Amen just faith because he said so and he manifested that he did love us and brought us to himself and gave us of His Holy Spirit how many ever felt the Holy Spirit how many feel he gave you the Holy Spirit well that should be enough to know that he loves you a man that he died for you and then he let his holy presence come upon you and I Amen that should be enough evidence to show that God loves us he said but how should we know because he gave us a spirit placing us his sons and how shall I prove my love to him this is what I'm working on every day I think you are too how shall I prove my love to him to the Father by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass and the church said so your way to show love to God is to express joy in the hard times amen we can do that then we are proving to God God I know you're in control I trust you I love you I'm not looking at the cloudy skies or the bright skies I'm looking at the fact that you said you love me and I put all my trust in your hole laughs amen hallelujah your unfailing unending love glory is that a blessing God proved his love to us through Jesus Christ in the cross this is enough for me and because of that because of the love of Jesus Christ I give myself freely to be used so everyone say use me use me that's fine I want to be a vessel for God's glory because they use Jesus didn't they they sure did now let's go it's what I was mentioning earlier let's go to Isaiah 49 verse 1 please Isaiah 49 verse 1 this is what I was saying God has a place for you in his heart Church and it's in the Word of God hey man Psalms 49 verse 1 oh I'm so glad he's got a place for me praise God he says verse 1 listen o eyal's unto me and hearken you people from far the LORD hath called me from the womb Isaiah from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword in the shadow of his hand hath he hit me and made me a polished shaft in his quiver he hath hidden me there it is right there and he said to me thou art my servant o Israel in whom I will be glorified how many would like that position as a prophet you can't help it you are a sharp cutting sword to everybody you come in contact with Oh Lord why do I gotta cut people all the time why do people always have to be hurt and offended by what I say or what I preach why do people have to get discouraged and feel bruh you know broke in and and and feel why have to do that because that's what God made you to be praise God amen just like Jeremiah and Jeremiah 1:5 your God told Jeremiah before you were in your mother's womb I ordained you as a prophet and I sent you a part of for the nation's amen he sanctified him already he ordained him this is what he was going to be but the point I want to bring out is that in his quiver he hath hid me praise God so that shows the picture of God carrying a quiver as a bow hunter and the quiver is a case in which arrows are carried as a man as a hunter or warrior he only feels secure when he has his quiver full of arrows and so a man is blessed in proportion to the number of his children now that's getting into later in the Book of Psalms to see there is security and happiness according to the Bible when you found your place and you know that you have your quiver full Amen there's security in that you know that your Quivers full you know that no matter what enemy comes whatever predator comes upon you I'm secure because I have plenty of arrows in my quiver the Quivers are in their place amen glory and I say I said that's where I was I was in the very quiver of God amen and that's our hiding place praise God where's your hiding place today I hope it's not in movies hope it's not in food hope it's not in lust hope it's not in money I hope your hiding places in Jesus Christ they meant in the quiver of our Lord and Savior amen I say I said that's my hiding place that's where I go when I know I'm in trouble huh I'm and God's quiver I'm one of God's arrows hallelujah amen that's right now look brother BAM says the same thing in conference with God in 1960 I don't think I've ever preached this when he says he's talking about the conference's you know the big four conference and the Geneva Conference but there's one thing for sure you're going to attend this last conference he's talking about the white throne judgment we're all going to attend that conference we're all going to be there and we're going to give an account for everything we've done and when the scripture comes with for us of Isaiah though your sins be as scarlet then they should be white snow come now let us reason together saith God what are we going to say at that time so in other words brother man is saying God is offering to everybody a conference today amen right now guys are offering a conference and saying come unto me and there's anything you need to talk over let's talk it over right now praise God because today is the day of deliverance today is the day of salvation amen it should not be boiled for another day it should be done today hallelujah always today he said come let us reason together what are we going to say at that time we'll say God you never wanted to have a conference myth with me but brother Branham said God is gonna say I did ask you to have a conference I asked everyone to come unto me and reason with me tell me all your reasons why you feel this way or tell me all the reasons why you might be discouraged or caught in the trap or caught an addiction or caught in something else tell me all the reasons and he said I washed all your sins away and you'll be white as snow amen just got to talk it over with the Lord and reason with the Lord and receive his reasons or his answers to your reasons they been program said all someone might say he said I'd like to say this people inside and out you might remember but preacher now this is what brother man say I'm a preacher I'm just a poor man God don't really need me so how many ever felt that way I'll be honest sometimes I felt with God do you don't really need me you know I'm just a little old preacher I'm nothing I mean Who am I you know I'm just nobody well here's brother Graham's answer for that God don't really need me he says oh yes he does this is this there's a little place in God's heart says the song that no one else can take that place but you speaks to you it's you you're the only one that could fulfill that spot in God's heart amen he waits for you is that beautiful you have a place in God's art and he's waiting for all of us he wants to talk it over with you he wants to have a conference with you come and reason together before you to have meet before you meet this judgment because it's going to be terrible then and you can't talk it over then it's too late then you say but but I'm just a bum look he goes two step further he said God doesn't really need me and I said I'm just a bum anybody ever felt that way I'm just worthless well there's nothing I can really do for God brother Graham has another answer program said I don't care what you are so you make it as because I'm a bum or I'm I'm a castaway I'm to the black sheep you know God don't care what you are what you think you are he said I'm a drunkard I'm I'm an immoral woman I've done wrong or I've did a preacher wrong I've lived untrue to my marriage vows I've done the moral things I've drank I've smoked I've damned but I've stolen I've lied brother have said I don't care what you've done God called you to this conference he said come let us reason together though your sins be like scarlet there'll be white as snow if you'll just come to talk it over a little bit God said I need you a man glory is that not the gospel preached or what no matter what you've gone through no matter the situation you've been through the condition you find yourself in oh I'm a bum or I'm worthless or I'm I'm rejected I'm a failure God says come to me let's talk it over let's wipe away any condemnation in your heart let's wipe away any sin that you may have done and let's have a conference and let me make you white blue glory at least twice jesus said this he said whosoever will let him come at least twice let's go to mark 833 let's read it again today by the grace of God did you know that God has a place in his heart just for you oh it makes me happy this morning I can smile I can have joy amen the midst of any trial going through I know that there's a place in God's quiver that's a place for me mark 833 but when he and turned about and looked on his disciples he rebuked Peter saying get thee behind me Satan but all savers not the things that be of God but the things that be of men and when he called the people unto him and his disciples also he said to them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the Gospels the same shall save it another place he said you'll find it how many want to find their true life what was I truly called for what was my true purpose what is the true life I shall be living the thing we must know is that he's calling whosoever will and always we must do is deny ourselves take up a bird and take up a cross right and slowly follow him you can't run with a cross very fast I can't run it's a slow learning it's a daily process of learning to follow God and he said whosoever will that means it's for everybody here praise God we don't know who it's going to be but Jesus Christ said whosoever will revelation 22:17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely anyone who wants a fresh drink of Holy Ghost water can have it today glory amen anyone because Jesus say is saying come and then all those that heard Jesus say come and then anyone that's a thirst can say come everybody should be saying come let's drink of the waters of life let's have more of the Holy Spirit our lives let's enjoy this fresh water from God amen glory so at least twice it's in red letters Church Jesus Christ says whosoever will let him come we can't make excuses law I'm just a bum I really I did somebody wrong I've lied I've stolen I've smoked I drank I've been untrue to my marriage vows all these things all these excuses that Satan is trying to put before us that's what I was telling that gentleman yesterday God so much wanted to love you that he brought you back from the dead it wasn't it's time to go he said he's got a new lease on life and he said he tried to kill himself because he was selfish oh let's not be selfish let's think of others amen let's live for others as I said on Wednesday I hope that bless somebody on Wednesday but the reason people are unhappy and many times committing suicide is because they're living for themselves rather than living for others because the Bible said happy is the man who has pity on the poor God promised you to be happy when you care for somebody else we got to stop looking at ourselves we got a look at the sacrifice right we got a look at Jesus Christ he's the one that said I'm passed from wrath he's the one that said he loved me amen he's the one that said I got a place in his quiver hallelujah I've got a place as one of his arrows I'm one of his is his weapons to use in this day against the kingdom of Satan I'm glad to be a part of that hallelujah amen now with our title of our message here this morning we're looking at how at we're supposed to be after the heart of God but you and I cannot be after the heart of God until God comes after our heart because this is what the by teaches the Bible said no man can come to me except my father draws him first see the invitation was whosoever will let him come whoever wants to be a disciple himself take up a cross take up a ministry and follow me take up a burden and brother him said this is what God did to Abraham in Genesis 15 God took Abraham completely out of the picture showing he had nothing to do with it remember God put Abraham to sleep memory put him to sleep and then he showed him the furnace of fire and the sacrifice and all these things we preached how that a while ago I'm not refreshed on it but I'm reading the quote but then he said God put Abraham completely out of the way he put him to sleep and said God sought you not you seeking God you never did do it your nature's wrong you're a pig any amens on that you're a pig in the church your flesh is appeared can I say like that my flesh is a pig nature the flesh but not the soul he said you don't know any different you're just up he said you just live in a pig pen that's all you know you love it you drink beer slopping around run with the next man's wife and doing everything you can to do evil it just seems good oh brother whatever have it we're having a big time you think it's good but God knocks on your heart he says that's what changes it not you knocking at God God knocks at you Adam never not I love this Adam never knocked at God's heart praise the Lord oh man said I've never knocked at God's heart God knocked at Adams heart and you're a son of Adam he says amen that's right before God could be a son of God again God had to knock at his heart before Adam could be a son of God God had to knock at his heart before you can become a son of God God has got to knock at your heart oh thank you Jesus is that how we all started our walk we were running from God trying to do what we want to do but God came looking for you and I aren't you glad he came looking for you Lorie see and God even came to us even when our sin was grieving him I mean oh the Bible says that the Bible says that in Genesis 6 about the Giants we read that last week for questions and answers in verse 5 God saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the Lord that he made men on the earth and it grieved him at his heart to see God his heart is impacted by our decisions right-oh in the days of Noah all the sin grieved him because sin grieves a holy God but a holy God is able to to look beyond that fault and he's able to see our need amen and he's able to make a way back so we can have fellowship with him program said this in the way back 1962 the word of the Lord comes to the prophet and the Prophet was has to stand on the word and when the word is not obeyed there's nothing to do but rebuke that's all so this fella didn't mean to be bad he just had to do it because he's not governed by his own thoughts he was governed by the Spirit of God and that's the way we all should be governed by the Spirit of God and if we are then we see sin it makes us sick I'm gonna read that again if we're governed by God we just have to see sin and it makes us sick to see your phone is probably a great blessing to your iPad or your computer is probably a blessing to you but I promise you if you have that phone long enough it's going to be a curse too yet sometimes sometimes the phone you bought and paid so much for - a good phone many times it's gonna make you sick is that right Church see it ought to if you are submitted to God anything that is sinful should make us said God help us to get sick more often spiritually I'm talking about that if we see something wrong it should make us sick and it should make us turn away from it and should make us return to God amen if we are submitted to God we see sin it makes us sick there's something about it it even grieved God's heart one time he ever made a man because sin was so awful in the earth so brother M ties it back to this scripture right here and always grieves God and we know the Bible says in Ephesians 4:30 be sealed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost unto the day of redemption grieve not the Spirit of God so we know this attribute continues today it grieves God at his heart so God feels that when we make the wrong decision when we purposely go to evil which would be called iniquity when we make any transgression it grieves God at his heart and we don't want to grieve the heart of God we want to please the heart of God amen let's look at a few scriptures that we know will delight God let's go to proverbs 11:1 I've been in Proverbs lately and and this week I noticed there was four times where Solomon said his delight so talks about four things that God delights over oh I know you want to make God delighted don't you you know you don't put a big smile on God's face you want to make God's heart be joyful right we don't want to grieve the heart of God the Bible says you can regard of God we want to please the heart of God proverbs 11 verse 1 a false balance is an abomination to the Lord but a just weight is his delight now just wait I had to look this up I didn't quite understand what this meant in the Bible days they would have a little balance and then that's how they make it exchanges they would have a certain and they use metals and certain metals that were kind of common to all the all the government's and this is how they would weigh out there's so many shekels of silver they have to balance it all out and so a a just person with a just weight would use the right kind of metals they would use the metals that were established by the government but sinners would take stones that weighed less than metal and make them the same size in the same shape they would make all these impersonations of the real metals and so that when they would weigh out the amounts they would make them lighter in other words to gain more of their money it's always Satan's always impersonating the real true gutshot of God isn't he Satan's always impersonation you make these stones that impersonated the true metals that the true weight that God wanted them to use and God said I hate when people do that it's an abomination when there's an impersonation of real Christianity amen I wanna raise my hands in the house of God as a true worship I'm not trying to personate somebody else amen I want to give to the poor as a true expression of the love of Jesus Christ in my heart and not as an impersonation of trying to be anyone else but I have the real genuine nature of the holy spirit inside of the Amen I don't want to M try to impersonate brother Branham or impersonate brother so-and-so or sister so-and-so I don't want to try to impersonate it I want the person of Jesus Christ to live inside of me amen so God hates a pur impersonation making stones that look just like these metal standards of weight God said I'd the law right when they follow all the laws of the land I delight when they're honest and when they have integrity I delight in my children who are completely honest don't you want to be completely honest Oh hallelujah remember these were for the young children the Proverbs were mainly for the young children as Solomon said 24 times my son my son then he said four times my children my children so Israel we know had a high standard of integrity the people of Israel one of the church children to have a high standard of integrity amen now go to verse 20 proverbs 11:20 the same way proverbs 11 20 they that are of a froward that means perverse heart froward means perverse so it's not going the right way they that are of a froward heart are an abomination to the Lord but such as her upright in their way are his delight God is so happy God is so joyful the Bible says when we are just when we're fair and when we are upright in all of our ways everything we do is the best and most honest that we can possibly do God wants us to be honest Christians how many how many sunny God's help to be honest all the time I do I do when I was a sinner I just I live you know all the time you lie and sometimes you know my own nature I know this I'm a people pleaser I don't like contention I don't like arguments I don't like debates I don't and so sometimes I have to catch my flesh I will just go along with people just to avoid an argument I noticed that in the past and I've got to ask God and that would be being dishonest right and so I need God's strength to always help me to be just fair totally honest with everybody by the grace of God and that would delight God when completely honest with other people honey what that kind of honesty amen I do and this will make God delighted in your service Oh hallelujah let's go to proverbs 12:22 here's another one this is the third one on what God delights in at least in Proverbs I trust this will help you this week maybe somebody got a deal coming up here I hope this will help your deal right here look at this deal proverbs 12:22 lying lips are an abomination to the Lord but they that deal truly are his delight oh my brother I'm gonna give you this real good deal here and you're gonna make a pretty good deal I'm gonna get him I'm gonna make your deal but you're really not making a good deal right that's what people do all the time on Craigslist Craigslist and Facebook and eBay or you're getting a great deal getting a great deal and in their hearts they know you're not getting a great deal lying God hates lying but God delights in someone who's completely honest they deal truly and then God said that's something I delight in as a father that's my child I'm so happy look at my daughter look how she's deals truly with everybody look at my son he's honest he's got integrity he's just he's fair or I delight in them how do you want to make God delighted hey I love to make God delighted and then this one this is beautiful as well we've preached this before proverbs 15:8 proverbs 15:8 all right this sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord but the prayer of the upright is his delight when we can pray an honest prayer and we know God has nothing against us right and we know we have nothing against our brother and sister if we do the best thing let's go make it right as soon as possible praise the Lord then God delights in that type of prayer a prayer that is honest a prayer that is just and fair amen so that's from the Proverbs those are four scriptures on his delight from Proverbs hope that was a blessing to you hope you like that one now let's go to Psalms 103 verse eight Psalms 103 verse eight the Lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenteous in mercy you know some people would just forget about this you know the Bible says he's slow to anger now a church if we make a little bit let's say we make a little ion accident and people get so upset Oh God hates me God's he's all upset the Bible said he's slow to anger if you keep going and don't repent then God's gonna get angry with you but one little mess-up he's not gonna get so angry and throw you into hell he's slow to anger amen he's plenteous in mercy remember Jesus said forgive them seventy times seven in one day and then you'll start understanding the love of God are you grateful for the love of God seventy times seven right 490 times in one day if I sinned against bang he should be able to forgive me 490 times because that's the Word of God and each time I say I'm sorry brother I didn't mean to do that he could say I forgive you and he could cheat you try to trust me again that's the love of Jesus Christ look at verse 9 he will not always chide neither will he keep his anger forever he hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded US according to our iniquities for as the heaven is high above the earth so great is His mercy toward them that fear him amen as far as the East is from the west so far hath removed our transgressions from us oh I hope you're not sitting under the condemnation of sin this morning if you are the father saying come let's talk about it I will separate your sin as far as the East is from the West amen I'll separate you from your sins as high as the heavens are above the earth I'll make you white as snow amen this is what God our Father offers to us in verse 13 I love this I preached in 2015 and this is the title of my sermon like as a father pitieth his children so the Lord pities them that fear Him how many fathers out there how many fire how many fathers pity your children you have a lot of compassion not a forgiveness a lot of love children do I pity you case you Liddy do I pity you okay good I didn't tell them I was gonna say that either you know I just had a little testimony you know one of my family members come to visit lately and and they said they thanked us they thanked our family because they said none of your children talk back to us and they said all their other children that they around their relatives they all talk back except our children and so what is that that's the grace of God that's the power of the Holy Ghost living a sanctified life right living that life at home and that's the atmosphere that we want the children to live in all everyone else in the family talks back but not this home why because this home is under the atonement of the blood amen now say like this this church is under the atonement of the blood of Jesus Christ amen people should look at all eyes all of us and say they don't complain they're not backbiters they're not gossipers they're not angry they're not slanderous they're not blasphemous they're just sweet Holy Ghost filled Christians amen because we're under the blood of Jesus Christ amen our Lord and Savior under his blood and it should be taking a cleansing effect on us every single day amen because God pities his children amen - pity means it's the Hebrew word Rock'em to love deeply to have mercy to be compassionate to have tender affection oh my just this morning I was you know my little baby I was rubbing her cheek you know and I could feel that soft little peach fuzz hair on her and that that's my tender I was trying to kiss her on the cheek and say Danny loves you you're doing the baby talk I love you little baby you know oh you're so sweet here my little baby and that's is that not to under affection am i standoffish like you need to love me you need to listen to me tender affection that's how God is to us doesn't he come that way many times he just tenderly brings the message he tenderly brings his word and he draws you to fall back more in love with him amen tender it's tender affection that's how God is with us as a father tenth loves deeply as children so the Lord loves deeply them that fear him like I was telling that brother yesterday about the denominational people he used to be a Jehovah's Witness and he said that he said no Jesse I don't agree with them any with a lot of their things anymore he said but one thing I got in that church he said was sanctified and I don't know what all those OVAs Witnesses believe I know they don't believe in supernatural wonders and miracles can we when we tell about it when they visit our house they just take give it to giving me their card and leave and I don't have enough time to go study out there I don't care really what they believe I'm trying to get the message out I'm trying to be a pastor but the point was he said I was addicted to drugs and all these things like that he said but God called me that Church and because of their preaching they preach what we preach like set no evil thing before your eyes so he stopped doing pornography they preach on other things about clinic lenses a cleanly life and holy life and he said God used them for that and we got talking later and said how all the churches I have to the Catholic Church are daughters of the mother harlot how many know that but I said brother don't get me wrong there are some good people in there because God is going to make one more call back the calls going out right now he can come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and her plagues amen that's the call that's going out right now come out of denomination come out of Catholicism come on a Pentecost right of the organization come out and Jehovah's Witnesses come out of these things and come into the real love of Christ hallelujah yeah amen to be fully formed in the image of Christ verse 14 he knows our frame he remembers that we are dust so God remembers God knows what it's like when you wake up tired and you're worn out and you don't feel like doing anything for the Lord God knows he remembers he reno's what you're made of he knows you get tired but as a man his days are as grass as a flower of the field so he flourishes for the wind passes over and it is gone and the place thereof shall know it no more but the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto children's children hallelujah can you say amen to that hallelujah this is God's deep love to us it is not a superficial love it's not a love that you know he's gonna quickly get rid of us it's a deep patient love it is the Father's love Amen let's go back to Luke 15 where I read our text about the prodigal now we know a lot of the story here but for the Jew this was the lowest of the lowest you could possibly be because you're hanging around swine and swine were unclean so the son is as dirty and as low as he could possibly be he could not be in and around any more abominable things than a swine and here in verse 17 and when he came to himself he said how many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare and I perish with hunger so think how good the even the servants are being treated he finally came to himself well that means at some point he must have been himself but when he left the father's house he became a different person is that right now how did he come to what how did he become back to himself he came back to the very self that the father had build him up to as a child I'm you understand what I'm saying his father had raised in the right way his father raised him if you sin like this it's a transgression against God but if you live this way God will honor you right he had been taught by the father the father had taught him the Word of God that's what I want to emphasize today I will rise and go to my father and say to him father I've sinned against heaven and before thee and no more worthy to be called thy son and make me as one of the hired servants now look at verse 20 and he arose and came to his father church there was something in this boy that he knew his father would receive him hey Alleluia there was something that this father placed into him when he was before he lost his mind before he went head over heels over lusts and harlots in' and sin and all these things before he went into this deep muddy pit he had had this training and the father placed it in his heart the law of God and he knew the law of God and when he finally came to himself he had conference the father will receive me amen and if he had that confidence how much more confidence in you and I have in the father's heart today praise God amen he had have known this else he never would have went perhaps his father whispered before he left he said son you can always come home Oh dad ok get next to yourself I'm gonna have some fun in my life I'm not gonna live on on this plantation my whole life I want to go have some vile to live my life I want to do what I want to do no doubt he knew though that the father cared and the father had taught him these things that if you want to be received you just have to humble yourself and say I have sinned against heaven and I've sinned against you that's where we need to be faithful all the time if we've sinned against someone we must go to them see that the son sinned against his father and he said I've got to go tell my father that I've sinned against him honey no that's one of the hardest things to do though to face up to your own mistakes how we know that to face the person you sinned against how many know that's one of the hardest things to do it is that's why Jesus said that's how you keep a church clean go to them face to face but yet he was will to do this because the father had placed something in his heart where he had confidence that he would be received amen and not church when he arose what is he doing now now he's going after the father's heart hey man that's what I liked about this text today he knows the father's heart and church we know God's heart but we've got to do something about it we've got to rise up and obey the father and go to the Father and do what the father says we've got to know that the father will receive us we've got to go after the father amen Pilate knew you how many love the Word of God glory this is where I got this thought he's after the Father's heart he knows what the father is going to say because he was with the father and we should know what the father says because we were with the Word of God hallelujah now what was the father the father was just what was he doing the whole time he was just trusting I've trained my son the whole time I'm not going to get upset I raised him to serve God I know he'll come back look at the confidence that the father has he's my son I saw my wife bring him forth I raised him I provided for in other words the son had a place in his father's quiver praise God the son had a place in his father's Kingdom in his father's home just as God is a place for you and I hallelujah amen he had a place in his father's quiver he knew it and look he goes back and he says and when he was yet afar great far away off his father song had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him honey no this is Jesus talking about how God treats us as children Oh didn't God run to you Church don't you love that song when God ran to me honey felt like God ever ran to you and met you in your sin he met you on your way back to God amen he met you on your way back because he was always knowing you were going to come back and he can meet you today if there's anything keeping you from God he can meet you today on your way back to the fold of God amen exactly right and I like look at verse 21 God shows us how he treats us he says verse 21 and the son said unto him father I've sinned against heaven and in thy sight and then no more worthy be called thy son now does the father scold him and bawl him out you unworthy ungrateful son you took half of my money and you ought to be sorry you piece of trash you know something like this at what he says he's so happy he stands there's my son he was dead now he's alive let's have a celebration amen let's call the angels of God and they all worship and we'll dance in praise to the Lord amen he don't even say and rebuke him he sees he's come back and God just wants us to come back if we left Amen that's all he wants us to do you also hear us say the confession and then he'll receive us and then the angels of God go to rejoicing amen that's exactly right Church the father had confidence I put those values in him he and he knows that I take him back and when he 20/20 time he'll come back and his heart will turn after my heart amen the prodigal was after the heart of the father glory don't you like that hallelujah he was after the heart of his father now let's go a little bit further by the grace of the Lord I want to go a little bit further now let's look at David now remember acts 3:20 - lets go they forgot I'm sorry 1322 acts 13:22 I just want to this thought out here acts 13:22 you and I've got to remember that God's not tricked by us right God we're not we can't trick God with anything God sees us at our very core of what we are he knows if we're really sincere or if we're just going through the motions that's why brother Ram said you must be more got to him you must be more sincere and that's why praying and that's why praying and dying out in prayer is so important dying out so that you know you're absolutely sincere you know you're leaving Church different or you know I'm finally getting down to business with God that's the thing that what most people don't do they've got a pray until you mean business with God amen till you know you're more sincere than just going through the motions pray from your brother Jeff sir pray for me honey or pray for me husband or pray for me wife just a little go through the motions we must be sincere hallelujah and if this would God is saying look this is not it wasn't David that saying look at me I'm a man after God's heart it wasn't David saying look at me I'm a messenger believer I'm going in the rapture it was not David it was God that said that God gave the witness God called David he's a man after my heart you look at the Bible said I have he said to whom he gave testimony and said I have found David the son of Jesse a man after my own heart which shall fulfill all my will you know the story after Saul felt God went looking for a king oh yeah God went looking for a faithful man God was looking for someone who had a heart after his heart and then God testified to Samuel and said I found a man whose heart is after Mylar we could all say that church we can all try to say you know well I'm after the heart of God I'm going after the heart of God but God knows who's being sincere the only one to be sincere church amen amen God knows what you're after today what are you after today are you after just a religious experience are you after more of God's Word and you want to know God's Word for your life that's what you see God is the one who's gonna vindicate that God shows who's really after the heart of God amen glory that's exactly right this is God's testimony about David just like it was God's testimony about job job's a perfect man amen it was God saying that I were going to say that Jesse's a man after my own heart but the Lois is a man after my own heart and we can put all your names in there we want God to testify that our hearts are so pure there's one motive we have and that's the please God and to find our place in God's heart amen hey then that's well that's why that was so important to me because I didn't ever realize that till this morning it was God's testimony God was testifying and saying hey listen to everybody Saul was not after my heart but David is watch David David will be after my heart you guys wanted a king well I gave you the King you wanted but now this time I'm choosing I'm going to choose the right King amen exactly right look what brother Ram says well actually let's look at what David said David in Psalm chapter 1 said blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful how much time do I got oh my whoo I've already had an hour give me an hour and 15 I'll just in minutes I'll try to finish here okay verse 2 but his delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night see Church we showed you a God delights in but now I'm showing you again in a rehearsing to you what we should delight and we should delight in the word of the Lord it should be your delight to read your Bible in the morning don't you delight to do that it should be your delight to hear the word of God preached that's what a blessed man or woman is someone whose delight is in the law of the Lord and all the time they just want to meditate about God and His Word and think about how great he is and think about how God can move in their life hey man that's there should be your delight the too many people delight and other things we got a delight in the law in the word of the Lord this has to be our delight the word of the Lord that's right look at brother BAM said brother having said this he said when I was younger this is in 1950 he said I didn't want to look like no preacher brother BAM said a Bible under my arm I thought that was a when I walked out today to anybody you think oh look at that go look at that go to the pulpit but RAM said when he first went even a sinner he thought oh what a I don't want to be a preacher they're just a but look what he says but I find out friends it takes a real man to be a preacher it takes a real man to be a Christian amen not just a preacher but if this is mother Aaron's battle well I don't want to be a preacher sissies are preachers God had to change his mind and said a real man will stand behind the pulpit and preach God's Living Word amen like we read last week if you can't preach a sermon live a sermon amen and what good is my preaching if I don't live it but I'm living it by the grace of God amen he said I want to be a man that was 6-foot tall and weighed a hundred and ninety pounds that's pretty close to me I'm 170 I'm about 511 170 so brother band want to be as big as me but I'm nothing you know what I mean I'm gonna die if God don't Terry you know if God terry's I'm gonna die we're all just men that's funny you want to be 6-foot 190 I want to be a real man you see but but look you can't judge men by the size of their stature I see men that weigh 200 pounds didn't have an ounce of man man is judged by character he said then be a man after the heart a man after God's heart and God will bless you hallelujah pretty simple isn't it be a man for the heart of God he said and God will bless you the trouble is there's so many things were going after got to make sure we go after the word of the Lord I wonder you know on Wednesdays message I wonder did anybody make plans to try to find the poor people and your life I hope you did see if you are then you're trying to go after the word of the Lord by God's grace the Lord opened up a little thing there I was able to do some things but see you we got to take what we hear and actually go put it into practice we can't come here and just not act on it we've got to act upon the Word of God I mean oh that's what jeez that's what James said only the doers of the word are blessed not just hearers but the doers we've got to do what we hear so if you haven't found somebody poor keep praying and find somebody poor got to help you out gotta help you do it if God help me he can help you do it absolutely find someone poor who needs clothes or water or food or money or help with their car or something find somebody who's poor help them out by the grace of God alright now let's go to 1st samuel 1313 a few more scriptures like I said I just needed a 15 moments I got about 11 left I honestly I'll try to be done at that time by God's grace Sir Samuel 13 13 and Samuel said to Saul Valis done foolishly thou has not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God which he commanded thee for now would the Lord have established I came them upon Israel forever I love this scripture because this is one of those what if scriptures what if saw had actually done what God told them to do his his family would have been Kings forever is that right church and this is so important for you and I that we don't miss the will of God for our life he missed God's will by not obeying the Word of God did you know that salt wherever he's at I believe he's in heaven but Saul may think sometime my they've been a lot different if I had just obeyed the Word of God now Church you and I don't want to be in that situation we want to know that we know that we know that we did what God wanted us to do we want to know that so someone could ponder forever I wonder what if what would happen if I just would have waited for Samuel before I sacrifice those animals I wonder what could have happened my my son Jonathan would have been king are you with me church think about that he's forever going to be regretting my only what it did the Word of God and God gave him chance after chance after chance and he missed it next scripture but now that Kingdom shall not continue the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people because thou has not kept which the LORD commanded thee all's God wants is somebody to obey the Word of God God wants somebody that obeys the message praise the Lord not just listen to the message but obeys it I want to listen and obey praise God that's right this is what David did David was a man after the heart of God now this let's go to Psalm 78 I need to close so I'm saying it's gonna be hard to close so I'm 78 70 go there Malachi please buddy this is the scripture I've never seen really before today so I'm 78 70 and I appreciate everybody being patient with me here I'm almost done give me a moment try to by God's grace I just had a scripture come to my mind err and look it up real quick okay all right Psalm 78 70 Davie Dahl so a servant and took him from the sheepfold so he was so humble just a little he's this a little pastor he was just a little pastor with a bunch of sheep right he said he took him from the sheepfolds from following the ewes great with young so he'd always watched him in as their make sure they had their babies the right way Oh glory with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people and Israel as inheritance he used to feed sheep but God said because he's faithful feeding sheep I'm gonna have him feed my people amen so he fed them according to the integrity of his heart amen and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands oh don't you like that church now we're seeing what God what is a man after God's own heart he's a man that feeds the people the Word of God according to the integrity of his heart in other words he preaches what he lives and he guy them by the skillfulness of his hand now for us that's the skillfulness of Jesus Christ those nail-scarred hands amen God giving us his word go if you everybody was going to Luke 12:40 to Luke 12:40 - and the Lord said who then is that faithful wise steward whom his Lord shall make ruler over his own household to give them their portion of meat in due season blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find him doing so so God wants a servant who's giving the people the meat for this hour that they're living in praise God that's a faithful servant David was giving feeding them the food they had need of in church that's what I'm feeding everyone here I'm feeding us the Word of God amen look at verse 44 the truth I say to you that he will make him ruler over all that he hath but an if that servant saying is hard my lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens and to eat and drink and be drunken that lord of the servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him in an hour when he's not aware and will cut him in asunder and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers I don't want to be that guy I want to be watching and waiting for the coming of the Lord I want to be giving people the meat of God for the hour having them feast on it and I want to see Jesus come and say well done thou good and faithful servant amen that's what diva did he fed people he fed the sheep and then he fed the people from the integrity of his heart this is how Christians should live this is what we should feast upon as the word of God amen go to the book of John here I believe it's John chapter two but I'm gonna pull it up here I'm searching this the scripture just came to me 4:34 sorry John 4:34 remember with the woman at the well the disciples were asking Oh would you want us to go get meat or anything like that remember what Jesus said what was Jesus's meat that he was always eating John 4:34 Jesus say to them my meat is through the will of him that sent me and to finish his work hallelujah that's what we need to be feasting on find out what God called you to do and get busy doing it and the church said find your meat because the Word of God is becoming and it's meat to us find the Word of God that's for us to fulfill and that is our meat that's what we're feasting on is doing God's will for right now praise God and that's what a real preach that's what I aim to do every pastor aims to do that to give the people the meat in due season not to beat them and to get drunk and to have all these kinds of evil sins but to live pure and keep watching for the coming of the Lord go to Hebrews five part of meat is preaching the Word of God so that you know and you can recognize evil in your life praise God when the preaching comes and it shows you how to recognize evil versus good that's meat according to the Bible praise God look at verse 12 Hebrews 5:12 for when for the time ye ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again the first principles of the Oracles of God and I'll become as such as have need of milk and not strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he's a babe look at verse 14 what is strong meat but strong meat belongeth to them that are of a full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil a person who's feasting on the meat of God can quickly recognize this is wrong this is right that's someone who's really feasting on the meat of God you have you're so spiritually sharp you can recognize oh that's the devil trying to get it that's the devil trying to make me jealous that's the devil trying to get me to lust that's the devil to try to get me angry with somebody and the church said you see when we start when we can really recognize God God trying to protect us from any sin on any level no matter how big the sin no matter how small it is now we're feasting on the meat of God that's the Word of God and Jesus said it's my meat to do the will of God that sent me do you appreciate that word you appreciate that amen let's go to Ephesians chapter 1 verse 8 almost done here we will be a mature church when we can recognize Satan and every one of his tricks that's what Hebrews 5 is saying when your senses are exercising you can discern good and evil now you're a mature Christian but the way you do it is through prayer how many know that a more dedicated prayer life more communion more fellowship with Jesus that's how you become more stronger discernment in the Holy Spirit amen seasons 1:8 where he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence verse 9 having made known to unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which we have he hath purposed in himself so where's God's purpose for you it's in Christ where is God's purpose for you you're gonna find it in this word right here brother Branham says now Luke II said no it's not just one little thing it's a mystery God's will for you is a mystery and each man has to seek out the will of God for his or her self God's mystery I wonder have we done that lately have we sought out God for his will for our lives lately let me close the this thought the thought brother branham gives after this quote is I'm sorry saw turning into Paul remember Jesus knocked him off his horse on the road to Damascus and Jesus said rise and stand upon thy feet for I've appeared unto thee for this purpose to make the a minister and a witness both of these things which thou has seen and of those things which I will appear unto thee delivering me from the people and from the Gentiles and whom I now send thee to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me where a part o King Agrippa I was not disobedient under the heavenly vision amen glory saw was disobedient to the heavenly vision but David was obedient to the heavenly vision amen and now Paul is obedient to the heavenly vision and brother man said once God showed in his wilfer's life where did he go who knows where Paul went after this he went to Arabia for three years brother Branham said hum and he said how many was here yesterday morning the mystery of his will he said how do we find out God's will Paul it was known to him he didn't confer with any man no flesh or blood he didn't go to no school no seminary he said he went into Arabia and dwelt there for three years he said oh don't you imagine that was some time brother Egan three years down there Paul was in Arabia rented him a little building walking up and down the floors with the old scrolls he says right in these old scrolls how that God at the beginning predestinated unto eternal life he says oh I imagine Paul had a wonderful time I like to have been there with him wouldn't you let's stay on our feet by God's grace there goes my time an hour and 15 minutes praise the Lord now as your and I'm gonna read Ephesians 5 briefly after the heart of God what are we after today are we after money after women what are we after we should be after the will of God we should be after finding out the heavenly vision for our lives how many can say amen to that as you're standing Paul says in Ephesians 5:8 for you were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the Lord walk as children of the light for to the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth proving what is acceptable unto God have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them for it's a shame to even speak of those things which are done of them in secret see then hear that you walk circumspectly not as fool's but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be not ye unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is a man how many one know the will of God oh there's no good thing to know and we are called to prove the will of God in other words is this is this the right job I should have we should be able to prove that by the Word of God is this the right relationship I should be in are these the right hobbies that I have is my home life in the right condition we should be able to prove and say I'm in the will of God because God has showed me he's given me two or three witnesses please let's take this thought very seriously we should be able to prove that we are in the will of God it's a mystery and every man must seek it out for his own life hallelujah I didn't get there where I wanted to go but praise the Lord anyhow we're lost have you come here how many know God will accept anyone that comes to him after the heart of God member no matter where you find yourself we can know that God wants us to return to him no matter what we've done something wrong God's door is always open in fact the Bible said God's knocking on your door and he wants to come into your life amen and see once once and once we see that once we recognize that then we go after the heart of God hallelujah let's have a word of Prayer here Heavenly Father we love your word there's joy in your word this is meat to us Oh God I'm not thinking about lunch after this service because I'm feasting on the spiritual things now Lord God my meat is to do the will of him that sent me our meat Lord God is to have our senses discerned to exercise good and evil Lord we many times wonder when is your coming when is the rapture alright we thought it was sooner we thought it'd be this lord help us not to think of those help us not to be discouraged but help us Lord to feast on the meat of God help us to grow stronger daily as we discern good and evil as we delight in your word your God granted Lord Jesus help us to be more sincere help us to be men and women after the heart of God that's what we're chasing hallelujah we know there's a place in your heart for each one of us O God there's a place in your quiver where all of us belong there's a position Lord that we must attain - father you know my heart in the integrity of my heart I believe

they're in the perfect will of God and they understand the will of God for their lives Lord at the very core of this testimony that you gave David was a man after my own heart the very core of it was because David would do the will of God Oh Lord speak to us here today father as we sing this song Lord my Jesus I love you Lord speak to our hearts as you spoke through the sermon if there's something we got to make right Lord if there's something we don't know about may we make it right may we seek your Lord as Paul went three years in the Raby to seek you may we Lord go into a state of seeking you dear God setting our face before you Lord God to know your will for our lives your prophets that is not a little thing it's a great thing o God to know the will of God and we should prove it by

mystery of God for their life I know what God's called me to do I know where God's placed me I have a ministry I have a position it's in the heart of God and I'm doing what God's called me to do then then we're a man or woman after the heart of God how many understand that then when we know his will and fulfills will then were a man or woman after the heart of God that's all I want to be I want to be like David I just want to be a man who's after the heart of God I won't with God once and you know brother Brandon said Jesus Christ is the heart of God glory hallelujah and Jesus Christ is the
