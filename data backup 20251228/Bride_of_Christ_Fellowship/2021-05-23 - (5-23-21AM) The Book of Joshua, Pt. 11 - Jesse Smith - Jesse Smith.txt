was through the message that god had him forgive this police officer it was all over the news millions of people saw it he had hatred toward this police officer who targeted him and then when cam and simon or simon brought the message to him he totally changed and went on the tv and in toledo there and just pronounced for complete forgiveness through the king james bible it's just a tremendous

satisfied with you and all your blessings and all your promises that will give you praise and glory in jesus christ's name amen amen praise god and take our bibles here joshua chapter five joshua chapter 5 will start here by the grace of the lord joshua 5 verse 10 and then we'll do our uh memory verse for may out of psalm 19. joshua chapter 5 those where we'll start joshua 5 verse 10. joshua 5 verse 10 we'll read 10 11 and 12. i'll read that myself and then we'll just read our memory verse together so that make it a little bit easier i'll read verse 10 and the children of israel encamped in gilgal and kept the passover on the 14th day of the month at even in the plains of jericho and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover unleavened cakes and parched corn in the self-same day and the manna ceased on the morrow after they'd eaten of the old corn of the land neither had the children of israel manna anymore but they did eat of the fruit of the land of canaan that year i think i'm going to read verse 13. i think i may get to hear we'll see today and it came to pass when joshua's by jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand brother braham said this is the same man that was melchizedek hundreds of years earlier and joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries praise god let's go to psalms 19 here psalm 19. psalm 19 verse 13. [Music] let's read verses 13 and 14. i hope you've been quoting this i've been quoting this you know off and on i think i quoted even yesterday i was praying just saying lord let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight i don't want to complain i don't want to speak evil things i want to speak what's acceptable unto god let's read verses 13 and 14 together ready one two three keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins let them not have dominion over me then shall i be upright and i shall be innocent from the great transgression let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight o lord my strength and my redeemer praise god may god add his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated praise god i have some slides if you like to put them up there it's great to be in the house of lord together with everyone again we're so thankful for uh making it through another week praise god and uh we're just thankful for all god has done for us appreciate those testimonies brother jose that was really beautiful brother beautiful beautiful testimonies there so let's look to the lord here as we approach this word i just uh really been enjoying the book of joshua here and we'll look in chapter five today by god's grace uh i would like to uh start here with verse 10 and we read verses 10 11 12 and 13. um and this we have the general uh understanding here that israel is going to honor the passover and then the manna ceases from falling so in these individual scriptures we see a lot happening here now this is interesting you know john gill he was a preacher from the early 1900s he said that the camp of gilgal was about one mile away from jericho which is uh important to understand kind of the uh what happens next i'd say some of the context of what happens here uh so this is a quite a a story here as we saw last time last time we looked at a circumcision right it's a permanent cutting away of the flesh right it's a permanent it's a self-inflicted surgery right so the person that the man has to choose that personally individually it has to be his choice at least in this day it was the adult choice right and today it's the same it's the adult choices today praise god amen the adult has to make the decision that yes i'm going to be circumcised i'm going to keep the covenant i'm going to be completely separated uh from the flesh from the things of the world and i'm going to keep the commandments of god and i know that's going to make me have a part in the covenant of god are you glad to have a part in the covenant of god today it's called the new covenant not the old we are in the new covenant god is doing a new thing praise god hallelujah he worked with abraham and the old testament saints but for the last 2000 years he's been doing a new thing remember a day is with the lord as a thousand years praise god so god has just had two days with the gentiles it's been a very it's been gone very fast right now for us it seems like a long time a long wait but timings means really nothing to god as far as he just you know he shows signs and wonders by the the things in the heavens you know by he counts time and he gives us encouragement along the way praise god but with god he is outside of time and and he works outside of those things many times and and he can work despite what may seem like limitations because god is the creator of time and so uh we're thankful you know that we can see these types you know we'll get to some of these types in just a moment uh but i just want to look again here now in verse 10 i want to look at this just for a moment uh the children of israel encamped in gilgal which means rolling away remember god had rolled away all the connection to egypt right finally after after 40 years god had rolled all the reproach away uh they weren't they weren't keeping the covenant of god they were god's covenant people they've been brought out of egypt but they hadn't even kept the initial uh precepts of the covenant remember so much so that zipporah had to save moses's life because moses had neglected keeping the covenant right uh and and zipporah said you're a bloody husband to me right with their uh interesting relationship there i guess their human relationship we can say because we're all human right uh but he had failed to keep that uh but yet god had mercy on him and his wife saved his life brother branham said and in god and brother said god send us some more zephoras amen send us some zipporahs who will keep the covenant of god amen i think that's a beautiful testimony for zephora but here israel now look they've just crossed over about two million people now have have crossed over the jordan river uh the brothers have been circumcised here and they and then god says you you're going to keep the passover now this is interesting but look at the order here now they keep the passover which you know anything about leviticus 23. you know the passover was like the friday the saturday was the unleavened bread which actually lasted seven days but then the sunday was the uh the feast of first fruits right so when the bible just says passover it includes all three of those events right passover unleavened bread and then first fruits it includes all three so israel as soon as their cross over they get circumcised they keep the feasts praise god and so the order was they crossed jordan now jordan is waters and that's the type of the spirit immersion right the baptism of the holy ghost right because we know there's a water baptism that was the red sea but then there's another baptism so waters always represent immersion or baptism so this was the second baptism they had the water baptism of the red sea but god said you need another baptism praise god amen i don't know you need a baptism when you come out of the world and then you need a baptism when you go into the promises of god how many are living in the promises of god amen see outside of the land they weren't yet enjoying all the promises of god they had many wonderful promises but they were enjoying all the promises of god i don't want to live outside the land i believe i'm living in the land where i'm enjoying the full benefits the full promises of god where every promise is yea and amen praise god i'm not really looking for another day like yeah we're looking for the rapture we're looking for that day we're looking for the day of the lord but as far as a christian life you know we're not looking for another day like oh i hope someday i can i can live a real christian life we should be enjoying the blessings of a christian life right now praise god every earthly blessing every every blessing god has given to us peter calls it all spiritual blessings we should be enjoying those blessings right now amen hallelujah because we are living in our inheritance we we possess what god has given to us as christians were walking in the full plan of god amen now uh so that was the type of the immersion of the soul which we'll get to that just a moment the scripture so they cross the water that's the spirit immersion and then they get circumcised immediately after showing this is one and the same thing praise god god was going to give them many god has given us many different symbols to symbolize what happens when a person's born again right and so their their soul is immersed in the holy ghost and their soul uh the the fleshy nature or the unbelief is cut away from their soul praise god right because the bible says the soul that sinneth the soul that disbelieves it shall die but when you're circumcised and born again that soul the unbelief has been cut away praise god and now the only thing that's there is faith amen right the holy spirit in other words the faith of christ the spirit of christ amen the holy spirit now and then now that circumcision permanently cuts away that fleshly unbelief and then now they instantly or they immediately enter in to feasting feast right but they but they have all these battles but god said stop and remember this is feast time you've just crossed over all that you the reason i brought you out you've actually accomplished it praise god yes there's more there's many more battles to come and history says they overcame 31 kings if you count the kings there 31 kings they may have come over yes there was a lot of work to do i imagine god was telling joshua you got to slow down and you got to remember these wonderful things i've done and you got to take a few feast days and you got to rest in what i've done for you you've got to rest and remember what the passover lamb has done for you amen hallelujah remember that original passover lamb that was slain 40 years ago that brought you out and now you're brought in so see remember the cross in other words remember the unleavened bread that they're all the leaven was taken away jesus took all the leaven away praise god hallelujah and then the feast of first fruits the resurrection jesus resurrected to do this amen it was through the power of the resurrection right through the resurrection power that now we can cross over and we can be a part of the promised land through the work of jesus christ the cross the carrying away and the resurrection because of that initial work god has brought us into his further promises amen amen oh it's beautiful the man says it's deep and rich amen hallelujah now remember there was eight types there's eight and eight is the number of eternity right because eight is the first day all over again right so there and not now there could be more but this is what i found when i studied it there's eight types in the old testament for the soul's nature change you're filled the soul is filled right or uh then second the seal is i'm sorry the soul is sealed the soul is clothed the soul is circumcised the soul is brought forth or born again the soul is quickened made alive the soul is immersed and the soul is at rest praise god all these are descriptions all throughout the old testament the new testament they're all pointing us to one thing that jesus christ lives in you oh hallelujah they're all pointing to the same thing someone else is living inside of you it's christ amen amen it's the god of heaven is living inside of you all these different illustrations all to get you to see the great work all that jesus accomplished by filling you with the holy ghost all these descriptions have all happened that moment when eternal life came into you and you pass from death unto life amen they crossed over they cross over from death into life into the promised land praise god what a beautiful scripture that is now here this this tells us again first corinthians 10 verse 2 and we and we're all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea so the red sea represented the water baptism right and so that means the sea of jordan represented the baptism of the holy ghost now here's what joshua joshua has told this in leviticus 23 i'm sorry moses was told this but then moses repeated it to joshua let me check the year on that there scofield has a nice uh uh chronological order of scripture so this was in 1490 1490 okay so this was told to moses 1490 uh usher's history says joshua went in in 1451 1451. so 1490 this is about 40 years later 40 years there so 40 years ago joshua could remember moses saying speak unto the children of israel and i say unto them when you come in the land which i give you and you shall reap the harvest thereof then you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest unto the priests and he shall wave the sheep before the lord to be accepted for you on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it now remember god's saying remember to do this now church the only way we would remember is if god reminds us praise god which one of you are going to remember something 40 years later right you don't have enough paper you probably run out of paper right you lose the paper i mean after 40 years we can hardly remember one thing from last week right but god so see god is going to help us remember if god was faithful to remind them that god is going to be faithful to remind us praise god because god has a time and season for everything what a wonderful thing joshua could say you could say wow 40 years ago god said we were going to do this and we are now doing this praise god we're enjoying the passover oh we ate of the lamb and we're enjoying the unleavened bread our houses our tents rather are clean from all leaven there's no leaven among us amen we're a mighty army praise god there's no leaven among us and now we're waving the first fruits as we'll see and they weren't even theirs praise god god just blessed them with the first fruits of the canaanites right the jericho whites god let them have the fruit of the land from jericho praise god as we'll get to in just a moment this is what joshua here experienced now this reminds us church as soon as the day of pentecost came the holy ghost fell and what happened the people started feasting together i'm glad to say bang and i have been feasting for a long time now right brother we've been feasting together since the beginning my wife and i see when god falls in a place when god moves upon people he makes a new family praise god he unites a family of believers together and just like when joshua crossed over they had a feast so in the natural in the spiritual when the book of acts church crossed over in the baptism of the holy ghost they had feast they had doctrine and fellowship and breaking of bread and prayers and they kept it going in one accord they broke bread from house to house they ate their meat with gladness and singleness of heart they were happy about being christians amen they weren't sad about it they were happy about it amen they'd just been brought over the jordan amen they just crossed jordan into the baptism of the holy ghost they were good amen they're rejoicing in what god done they were praising god right they weren't blaming god they were praising god hallelujah having favor with all the people and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved that's what we can rest in god will always add the souls at the right time praise god he'll always do it and we just got to be faithful to him and his word and trust him and he will add the lord adds them praise god now remember this thought paul said we now this is speaking of a man who is in sexual sin he said purge out that old leaven that ye may be a new lump so look church a church that has sinners in it is an old dirty lump we'll say like that or old corrupted lump right but as soon as that part is interesting as soon as that one person leaves it's a brand new church amen hallelujah if there's a sinner amongst us and they would be convicted to leave or god would send them away or they would repent that'd be the best case scenario right repenting and getting right with god then automatically that church becomes a brand new church amen oh hallelujah see churches go through seasons of hard times and good times when are the good times the good times are when all the leaven gets put out and it's a brand new church again praise god amen remember jesus said i make all things new praise god and we ended with that scripture on wednesday that said the only thing that avails is a new creature in christ jesus that's what prevails that's what will give you overcoming strength is that you know your life has been made new i'm newly committed amen i'm newly encouraged praise god i'm newly strengthened i've got the joy of the lord i'm a new creature in christ that will prevail in your life amen for the joy of the lord is your strength complaining being discouraged being beat up being being destitute all these things that's not going to help anyone prevail praise god that's the anointing of the devil right but when the real christian army gets together they get rid of all their own leaven and they become a new army and they're keeping the feast the bible said christ is our passover amen even now jesus christ is our passover he was our passover lamb and can i say like this the token of his blood should be upon our souls amen and then we keep the feast now paul this is i believe if i'm not mistaken this was either 11 or 14 years after pentecost and paul's saying we're still keeping the feast of the passover we're still remembering the cross of jesus christ every day we must remember the cro the price that he paid and not only that but all that had purchased amen and purchase all that we have need of every day praise god so we keep the feast today not with old leaven not with sin in our lives right uh we don't we don't keep sin neither with the leaven of malice that's where we get a lot of message believers here malice and wickedness that's where satan can get them right they can say i believe brother braham i believe i believe all these things i believe the mysteries they can say all these things but let's get down into our lives and see if we're holding any malice or wickedness in other words we haven't cleaned 11 out of our homes we're out of our minds right it's okay to differ with somebody but we still must forgive even our worst enemies praise god love your enemies jesus said pray for them who despitefully use you so see a person will feel like not a new lump but a lot they'll feel like the gospel is getting old when they harbor malice and wickedness in their hearts and the church said but as long as you keep all that out you're going to feel like a new love all the time hallelujah that's right that's what the word of god says as long as you keep out the old leaven the malice and the wickedness and the evil thoughts you'll feel like a new christian all things will be new to you you'll you'll enjoy all the word of god you'll be nourished you'll be fed you'll be taken care of you're god's child and god has wonderful blessings at his table for you today praise god oh my god so christ is our passover the cross what's our unleavened bread sincerity truth and all sins confessed praise god so jesus we we know for unleavened bread was when jesus carried our sin away he took our sin to hell right that's brother man was a great story about that where he took he took the keys of death in hell from satan that beautiful story it's scriptural totally scriptural but for us it is getting rid of our malice and wickedness and being totally sincere with one another and with god walking in sincerity walking in truth friends if we're saying that today if we're saying i'm totally sincere today i i'm totally right before god i've walked into all the truth i can walk then church we are having an unleavened bread feast this morning amen hallelujah and we are actually enjoying the passover feast right now we're eating on the lamb praise god we're eating of the bitter herb bread we're partaking of his sufferings but also we're partaking of unleavened bread we're sincere we're walking in truth and it's a feast day it's a special day right it's a feasting time it's a time of joy because god has done great things for us he's brought us over jordan oh my fourteen years after pentecost they're still keeping the same passover feasts hallelujah that's uh in church whose responsibility is it's mine but it's also yours too you can't put it all in the preacher right brother ram said i can come be anointed as much as possible but if the people don't have the same anointing it ain't going to do any good so we've all got to keep the feasts praise god we've all got to remember the passover lamb we all got to be sincere and living in truth praise god and we all got to experience the power of the resurrection jesus resurrect my life today resurrect my attitude praise god amen resurrect my thinking amen make it live again praise god brother said never lose your enthusiasm but so many people are unenthused shows they're not keeping that quote let's keep that quote the quote is right here sincerity and truth if you're sincere with the truth you'll be enthused about the word of god i saw a woman yesterday dressed up holiness i said hi i really appreciate your modesty at the park i was at the park with the kids i took the kids at the park i said i appreciate your modest clothing and she said oh thank you i said yeah i said oh she said what church do you go to i said well we follow the message of william branham i said we believe in the rapture and the baptism of the holy ghost and all the power of god she said i go to the barbarian church barbaran church i said all wonderful i said i said jesus healed my mama cancer i had my jesus hat on i was waiting i was i've been waiting like three weeks to talk to somebody about jesus i finally got to do it yesterday i had my big just just got jesus on it i said jesus healed my mama cancer and uh but i was ashamed of myself i didn't serve god so i was 19 but ever since god god got a hold of my life at 19 i've been serving jesus she said that's wonderful so it was a great just a witness to her and and talk about that in church you see how the people uh but we got to keep our sincerity i love that i just love witnessing in church as soon as you do it as soon as you witness to somebody you feel really good and then we went and got smoothies for the family and a guy looked at me and he said hey can i talk to you you're a christian i have my hat on he's like he's like yeah i said yeah i'm a christian and he told me this story he's writing a book about marriage and so he wanted to get in contact with me and we got to talk about the lord we talked let's talk about the lord about five or ten minutes there about all that the lord the lord had saved a marriage through his his uh his little ministry there and things and uh so i'm gonna maybe help him write his book and we'll see how that goes but it was great i i just felt refreshed getting to talk to two people about jesus yesterday right cause everybody's got masks on and they're like don't look at me don't talk to me don't we i didn't wear mine all day yesterday that was a blessing so hopefully we come out of this awful season i'm just but church we have so much to be happy for when we're sincere and we're walking in truth we just want to spread the message praise god we can't lose that's what i want to get to we can't lose our enthusiasm amen we got to have the joy of the lord we got to tell others about jesus amen you got to praise god if we lose it it's because we got old sin in our lives and we just got to purge it out and then you'll feel brand new again honey can say amen to that that's true it's true we just got to confess our sins and we'll walk in the newness now notice matthew henry getting back to joshua he said we may well imagine that the people of canaan were astonished and that when they observed the motions of the enemy they could not think but them very strange think about it think about this church when the soldiers take the field they're apt to think themselves excused from religious exercises they have not time nor thought to attend to them yet joshua opens a campaign with one act of worship after another now church check check what happens israel crosses over jordan all the inhabitants now remember there was canaanites living outside of jericho right they had all their farms out there as soon as they heard it they crossed over all these farmers left all their farms and they ran into jericho to be safe but god you know you would think like a a military man would say okay we're crossover let's go take jericho right now but joshua's like no let's stop we need to have a circumcision we got to prepare our hearts for this battle amen our hearts must be prepared to fight praise god amen our hearts must be totally purged from any selfishness or any any fleshly desires if we're going to overcome we need circumcised hearts amen amen but joshua don't say okay where crossover let's go he said nope circumcise all the men that took numerous days to heal and then i said now and i'm sure all the men were ready to go i'm healed now let's go fight he said no it's time to keep the passover it's time to remember what got us here in the first place i think we can never forget what god is here the blood of the lamb god is here amen they take at least seven or eight or nine or ten days there maybe 14 days in other words they're taking breaks in the war malachi knows a lot about world war ii those soldiers on the allies have a lot of vacations maokai once they landed on iwo jima did they take a vacation no they just kept come and come and come and how long was that battle was that a month three weeks to take the island of iwo jima longer than that so the american army didn't take any breaks when they were taking over iwo jima right to get that island but joshua takes a break because he said we got to get our heart circumcised and we have to recognize we have to show special devotion to god we need to we need to fulfill what god told us to fulfill in other words it's the season oh glory it was the season of harvest amen and this is the season to remember what god has done for us it's the season we must act according to the season praise god and this is the season of the rapture amen it's the season of the finishing of the mysteries of god it's the finishing of the harvest and we lay in the presence of the son we humble ourselves and we become more like christ all the time amen that's not boring that's not old eleven that's new leaven that's life amen that's maturity praise god amen that's maturity becoming the wheat you were supposed to become praise god if it's old because you let malice and wickedness in if the message becomes old it's because they've let sin and complexes in their life our sister haverick's been a lot around a long time i'm sure you could say men to that you've seen a lot of people i've only been around 20 years and i've seen that a lot people that start strong but then the word becomes old it becomes boring it don't become as exciting as it used to be if brother brahm told us we got to keep our enthusiasm there must be a way to do it and i know the way it's the word it's to purge out the old leaven purge out the mouths purge out the wickedness keep your heart tender hearted amen keep your soul all loved for jesus and if you love jesus you can't help but love all those that he created amen hallelujah so all the canaanites are like what is going on how come now look at that church god has brought the mighty army over and all the farmers they run into jericho and they're just shaking i'm just i'll shake my knees like that they're just shaking for all these days like when are they coming they're going to kill us when are they coming remember this is god's judgment right this judgment on canaan is over 440 years old because god told abraham i'm going to bring my people out and judge the amorites he said the cup of the amorites isn't yet full so this is the judgment of all these canaanite nations and so see god's in no hurry i'll tell you god is a god of grace god let them have a little wildlife because he says god let rahab have a few more extra days amen to try to get some souls under that token amen hallelujah any naturals general would have just said okay we're over we're going to jericho tomorrow it's only a mile away how long does it take to walk them out church don't take very long 15 20 minutes but god said no we got to do the circumcision we got to get the covenant established and we got a feast this is not like any general praise god this is unlike any general why because he was led by the holy spirit praise god so instead of opening their campaign with fight after fight they open it with worship and more worship and remembering all that god has done see god wants us to rest look god is teaching them rest in me amen when you're when you're walking in obedience you're always right on time amen if you're in the perfect will of god you're not late you're not early your life is completely in line with god's word amen you'll never be late you'll never be early you'll always be right on time because you're keeping all of god's commands one day at a time hallelujah look what brother adam said he said you see he was joshua was getting his position then he he was to be the greatest military man that's ever been on the face of the earth there's never been a general like joshua no time no age nowhere has ever been compared with joshuas i know malachi likes world war ii so take note of that malcolm that's some that would help you out he's doing a presentation on world war ii this week i think so maybe you can slip that in there somehow these generals were great for the allies but here the greatest general is joshua there's never been anyone like joshua no one can even be compared to joshua because it means his name means jesus or savior deliverer now look if the greatest general could take time out of his busy schedule to make sure everybody had the holy ghost right to make sure all the men were in the covenant right to make sure we keep all the festivals of god we keep our sins we keep our hearts sincere right we live sincere lives before moving on to fight these great giants somebody got giants in your life right so did joshua right they had many giants there's many giants there to take care of but before they approach any of that they have to make sure everybody's circumcised amen make sure the flesh is permanently cut off and make sure they remember the power of the passover the sincerity of the unleavened bread and the resurrection power of the first fruits and recognize that we're in harvest season amen hallelujah that's glorious so joshua's no ordinary general he's not any hurry he's obeying god's word one day at a time just as the word comes to him what a moment he recalls the original passover lamb see this is from deuteronomy 6. he brought us out this is moses now he brought us out from thence egypt that he might bring us in to give us the land which he swearing of the fathers isn't it okay after god does something great just to stop for a few minutes and say look we are now in we've been out of egypt we've been out for 40 some years but now we're in saints what's wrong with that stopping for a few minutes and say listen yeah i know we got a lot of victory or a lot of battles to go forth but can we just stop a minute and say that we've fulfilled some scripture praise god hallelujah we can stop and say for a moment thank you lord we're a book of acts church amen god is still healing through prayer cloths amen that's the book of acts acts chapter 19 the same god that healed through paul's cloth is stealing through brother brandon's prayer class amen the same god right it's fine to take a moment and remember god before we go on to the rapture praise god we should stop and give god thanks that we are in the land amen i'm not in the denomination praise god i'm not in worldliness i'm not in justification or sanctification i'm in the holy ghost amen the holy ghost is here praise god it's an experience it's a land it's an inheritance and he's blessing us amen there's nothing wrong with taking a few moments to rejoice in that church thank you lord jesus some people should you know be thankful they're just out but church we're in right denominational churches down the road they can say thanks i'm out some of them are out some of them aren't right but we should thank god thank god that we're out we're through and we're in praise god amen i nothing wrong with that joshua god told joshua make sure you stop and do that first before you move on stop and remember that the lamb's blood has now brought you in i'm not outside i'm inside i'm not outside of god's family i'm right in god's family in other words when god has a family meeting i'm sitting there at the table praise god hallelujah when god has a meal i'm right there at the table praise god we're not crumb hunters amen we're feasting at the table amen the word of god has been given to us the promises of god are real and amen and we get a front row seat right at the table praise god we're not outside we're not trying to peek in and say man that corn looks really good that old corn well i really like to put some butter on that that looks oh that looks delicious oh no church we get to walk right up there and say is it my turn can i have some corn yes where's the butter we can take our own butter knife spread the butter over and just start eating so this is great this is glorious these promises are glorious we can feast on these promises one after another we're not outside hoping someday i'll get in we are in if you're born again you're in sitting at the master's table praise god hallelujah he said take a few moments and remember that you're in i'm in the faith the bible says examine yourselves to make sure you're in the faith we can relax brother jesse aren't you worried about uh inflation aren't you worried about world wars and all these things i'm just resting i'm just keeping the passover church amen i'm keeping the unleavened bread right i'm just keeping first fruits i'm keeping the feast as long as i'm as sincere as i can walking in all truth that i'm keeping a feast my soul is resting with christ hallelujah yeah we're not ignorant of all these things going around but also at the same time paul said we're keeping the feast and we have a sincere heart and we're walking in truth now verses 11 and 12. see people all get you know they kind of oh you're too legalistic about church and you're too legalistic about that was god legalistic about the the feasts no if there's a command you keep it you're just thankful to be out of the wilderness anything he commands i'm happy to do because i'm not in egypt anymore i'm not in the wilderness anymore i'm in the land i've seen him bring me out i've seen him bring me in praise god so see it's not a it's not a burden to do the will of the lord it's a blessing to do the will of the lord amen you're either working for one or the other right you're either working for the world or mammon or you're working for jesus we're working for jesus praise god amen now in verse 11 and 12 they did eat the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover unleavened cakes and parched corn in the self same day where'd they get that corn the bible said in verse 12 the man has ceased on the morrow after they'd eaten of the old corn of the land neither had the children of israel manna anymore but they did eat of the fruit of the land of canaan that year thank goodness gracious well or josh was like it's time to have a feast we need all this food and everything like that they're just sojourners right they just cross over but god by his power had driven out all the farmers and they have all these barns and all these garages or houses and church all they got to do is walk into the storehouses or else you gotta do is walk out to the field and start picking corn well here we got all the corn they walk into all these things they didn't even do right they benefit from the labors of others that's what jesus told his disciples he said you are walking in the labors of other men and you don't even realize it brother brahm said he said it's because of all those men from 1906 azusa street that prayed and fastened he said and beat tamarines on the corners without church buildings that we can have church buildings today with air conditioning we ought to be thankful church amen we're just living off other people's works right we're enjoying the efforts of other people praise god amen hallelujah we're we're enjoying all these blessings and many times we forget to be thankful that we are enjoying the benefits of other people's labors i'm so glad somebody labored to type out all of brother branham's words that's a lot of work that's a lot of typing that's a lot of time at the computer [Music] i'm so glad i enter into other people's labors i just gotta type in two words joshua captain lords and i can pull up all these clothes i guess oh yeah that's right here's what he said i just i'm entering into other people's labors praise god and that's what israel did as soon as they cross over god said you know celebrate this get all the leaven out but get the corn and they just gotta walk and get the corn it's just freely given church all these blessings are just freely given to us hallelujah healing salvation right encouragement joy and peace and patience all these blessings they're just freely given to us amen what did you do for it not much you just surrendered you just followed the pillar of fire you just followed joshua over jordan amen you just follow the arcade man the ark brought you over the word brought you over and all these blessings are freely given praise god amen god provides just what they need to keep the feast if god ever requires you to do anything he's going to give you what you what is required of you praise god whatever he requires he'll give you what you need to meet that requirement so matthew henry said the country people retired for safety into jericho they left their barns fields all that was in them which served for the substance of this great army and the supply came very seasonally for after the passover they were able to keep the feast of unleavened bread which they could not do according to the appointment when they had nothing but manna to live upon right they just had manna they didn't have the bread from the corn right and perhaps this was one reason why it was intermittent in the wilderness but now they find old corn enough in the barns of the canaanites to supply them plentiful for that occasion see they didn't have corn to keep unleavened bread see god wasn't requiring them to do those the unleavened bread in the in the wilderness because they didn't have the corn right but see now god has provided the corn and now they can keep the word amen hallelujah god's not asking you to do something that he's that he hasn't provided for you to do if god wants you to do something he'll provide the ability the funds the resources the attitude and the time and the energy amen he never asked them to do something that they couldn't do they just had to do it right they just had to go out and get the corn right god has a way to do it praise god by fear he drives out all the canaanites and the farmers run into the city of jericho and all the food just said how much food would they need saints how much food would they need for about two million israelites can imagine just imagine all the fields and all the all the granaries maybe i'll say like that to feed all these kids all these all these men and women these old men you know young men young women how much food would they need but god must have had great fields of corn all scattered right right over jordan right right by gilgal so they could just walk in enjoy one at a time that's how it is all you gotta do church is open up our bible we're gonna pour out some great blessings it's so close to us it's right by our desk amen it's right by our bed table right right right by your bedside table there you just gotta reach in and pull out the blessings they're waiting for you god wants to encourage you he wants to feed you praise god amen just laying right there now i read this quote to you last time i preached you a couple of sundays ago he's talking to spiritual canaanites the spiritual israel who's possessed the land aren't you glad you've come out of egypt's garlic aren't you glad you're out of the wilderness and remember they had to eat manna angels food out of heaven until they crossed over into the land and when they were crossed over in the land the manna ceased to fall they were fully matured then and they eat the old corn of the land now now that you're not babies anymore now that you're not desiring the sincere sincere milk of the gospel that you don't have to be babied and patted and persuaded to come to church now that you're real fully matured christians you're ready to eat strong meats now you're ready to come into something amen they were coming into their inheritance amen they were coming into their future homes on the earth praise god right that's what they were coming into where am i going to live am i going to live near the water so am i going to live near the mountains caleb had a mountain amen where am i going to live your lord show me where i'm going i'm ready to come into something i want a permanent possession i want to dwell on the land i want to do something for god amen he said there now here's for us you're ready to understand something that's deep and rich the church many times we just forget to remember all the great revelations god has given us right like when brother dennis was here last week the holy spirit brought to my rem memory that uh that that sermon that he preached about the the workers of iniquity a false sense of security remember that i never seen that revelation before where on the day of judgment the workers of iniquity go up to jesus and said have we not cast out devils have we not done all these wonderful works and jesus said i never knew you depart for me that work iniquity but they went into the primes of jesus with a false sense of security well because i had a couple miracles i must be accepted that's a false sense of security right their lives were living in iniquity their daily life would have told them if they looked at their daily life it would have told them what jesus would have said not just one thing not just a couple of miracles here and there but their daily living our daily lives tells us what jesus is going to say to us praise god right our daily life whatever kind of works we're doing we should be doing works of holiness amen we should be doing works of prayers works of fasting works of all giving we should be doing the works of the holy spirit and then jesus will say you're a worker of righteousness amen amen nobody get that they had a false sense of security because they had a few miracles here a few miracles there a few supernatural things well i know the holy spirit came upon me here but it didn't come upon them when they were committing iniquities every day right so see that's coming into something deep with understanding now right we're coming into something that's more uh more understanding more knowledge and this should separate us from just a justified or sanctified saint which we thank god for those two works but it should make us desire to move into the baptism the holy ghost to find our position and be effective at what god has called us to do we'll get to that eventually where they they were you know first all those brothers had to drive out all these kings and then they started placing all the families you know i think all the sisters waited on the other side of the river i think if i'm not mistaken i think they had to wait on the other side of the river some i know some of the tribes did two and a half of the tribes did but others were waiting there too until uh they drove out more uh the inhabitants and then they could start replacing now you can have peace there now you can be a like brother i said now you can be a cattle raiser now you can be a shepherd there now you can be a corn raiser now i can grow your wheat see god has something for us to do how many want to know what god's called him to do oh god we'll show you praise god just get in that land amen just be in that land be faithful in that land and god will lead you and guide you into your inheritance and your possession amen hallelujah see a real christian mature you're ready to understand something deep and rich he says been hidden since the foundation of the world now of course that when he was preaching this in 1960 that was how your names were on the lamb's book of life before the foundation work in other words god chose you god had four knowledge that you'd want to be saved and filled with the holy ghost so he put your name on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world and the church said amen that's the deep and rich thing he was getting into amen in other words god knew i was coming he knew when i was coming and he made a way to save me once i was here and he made a way for me to reach my future home to live with christ eternally oh thank you lord so they eat the old corn brother adam uses this to show the maturity of the born-again believer and what is maturity for us maturity is judging right and wrong and obeying the word we saw it on wednesday remember wednesday we looked at two scriptures both of them showed how god finishes and reveals mysteries but the whole purpose of them is so you obey the word of god think about think about this week any scripture you're having trouble obeying this week that's where you gotta that's where today you should seek help for that today right because the reason the mysteries were open so that we could have access to knowledge right and jesus said knowledge is a key knowledge is a light he said knowledge is a fragrance paul said that so whatever we have need of that mystery opens up the door then we can walk in and possess whatever we have need of oh you didn't have any struggles this week what how come you don't have a body change then how come you're here you should actually be in heaven right now you should be at the meeting in the air right am i right church yeah then you're perfect right so so see we all have something right we all have something we can see god and say lord i really need your help i really need to surrender here this is the area of my life i need to surrender and i need to get more victory over this praise god because we're constantly judging right and wrong see once we pass the test satan waits for a little bit he leaves for a season right he studies us waits a couple days a couple weeks oh i see they're getting a little weak there maybe it's in their diet maybe it's in their relationships maybe it's in uh what they're putting before their eyes maybe it's in their conversations their friendships and then he'll create this snare right the bible said a snare he said snares and traps to see if he can get us to sin right so yeah there's times we're rejoicing oh we don't feel satan's great attacks but be be careful be ready he's setting up a trap and he wants to try to get us to disobey the word of the lord right so he can make the church an old lump he can make it feel dead and cold but paul said purge it out so you can be a new lump well that makes me happy amen that makes me happy then all it takes is people just confessing their sins every week and we can feel like a brand new church amen oh hallelujah okay so brother brahm says okay when you're eating the old corn you don't need baby to come to church well that means you don't need baby to read your bible don't need baby to pray right we can add more on to that right fasting right cause i know people that are in the message and they've never fasted before well if that's true then i know people in the message that have never given alms before or never really prayed before well that's the whole point of christianity right to fast pray give alms to be a real christian and people are in the message but haven't done what the message tells them to do so see they haven't judged these initial things right and what that shows they're not mature christians right because a mature christian judges all these things and then he obeys the word of the lord amen praise god i think i'm getting somewhere i hope i'm getting somewhere by god's grace hope you're seeing this now this is the most to me the most important scripture about strong meat so what's our diet is our diet just mana just honey cakes from heaven or you can just you can just walk out you could have walked outside in the morning right outside of your tent i imagine some of us would have been so lazy we just want to open up the tent reached out and grab it close the door oh that's great right some of us would have been so lazy i wasn't planning on doing that but that's how simple it was to get a meal under sanctification [Music] you just had to come to church brother amen and your eyes are everything the preacher said you're just you're blown away by everything under sanctification right and when you first get the holy ghost my these ripe these ripe fruits are right there but there comes a season when you're born again all that runs out oh okay now you have to do some work you can't just reach out your door okay i'm i'm so satisfied no you got to put some hard work into it and that's where people start falling away right they don't want to give any diligence they don't want to give any human effort oh you're preaching legalism and you're no jesus said or paul said give all diligence and jesus christ said love the lord your god with all your strength amen see people get born again and they enjoy these mature fruits my but if they're not careful if they don't keep investing in their walk with the lord they're going to feel starving and like what man i'm starving i thought i was born again you are you just got to invest and you got to plant some seeds praise god you got to go back and eat some of that stored up uh winter food can i say like that what do they call that the canned foods you got you got to eat your canned foods that you stored up you got to eat some of that stored up you got to press play praise god even now they do it all the time which is not right as far as like they take the place of real preachers that's wrong that breaks the word of god but see people think oh my i thought i was eating a mature word you are but you've got to invest that's part of your labor that's part of your victory amen where you don't have to have everything handed to you god don't have to hand everything so easy for you he'll let you struggle there'll be a couple of times where it looks like everything's going to fall apart there's no rain how my crops going to make it and god wants to see that you're mature if god called me out of egypt and brought me this land he's going to send rain to this land amen i'm going to trust god he brought me that far i'm a mature christian i'm not a baby god will provide for me amen i'm going to come expecting to the house of god i'm going to be fed today the bible says strong meat is nourishment right nourishment christians need nourishment they need all the vitamins right they need all the minerals paul said there's some christians all they drink is milk and they're not getting nourishment to grow the strong muscles and to really grow into what a christian should grow into not a baby right not a complainer not a backbiter right not an incontinent person who has no self-control that's not a real christian that might be a baby christian right but see a real christian is able to have confidence in the things of god and feast on the strong meat of the word so paul says there's a time when you should be a teacher of the word now especially this is good for the parents right there comes a time when the parents have to start teaching the word of god you can't wait to every sunday to the pastor to do it or the ministers your children are going to ask you questions in the home and the parents said amen there's a couple events see you've got to teach again the first principles of the oracles of god now remember he goes through the first principles in just a few scriptures and i've become such as that need of milk and not a strong me so the time had passed where these adults should have been able to handle the deeper things of god like the anointed ones of the end time like soul body spirit like the mystery of christ in you the hope of glory like the rapture mystery right all these great mysteries right like mystery babylon all these mysteries but they can't even handle the initial things of getting like salvation and divine healing they can't even handle these things paul says because they haven't kept the nourishment they're not feeding on the word of god that they should for everyone that uses milk everyone that just stays on justification justification get saved get saved get healed get healed anyone that just stays on that is unskillful in the word of god brother brahms i just heard him say yesterday he said you cannot major on a minor now we thank god for divine healing but we can i see i hear a lot of churches majoring on divine healing just saying like the presence of god is here that's true but at some point the bible says you got to move past that right you can you focus on it when you need it but at some point you got to move on into the deeper things of god that's hard for some people to swallow but it's true see and an unskillful person is inexperienced so a preacher or someone that should be a teacher if they can't take you to these things of god then they haven't experienced the deep things of god but once you're in the deep things of god you've had that experience and you can take other people there praise god when simon came to our church years and years ago he said i was dying spiritually he said brother jesse he said your ministry nursed me back to health he said and cam when cam was here he said he said brother god was anointing you so much he said he said god wouldn't even i wouldn't even cam said i even felt the anointing when you preached on money like usually that's not like a topic you would feel like there's a great anointing my brother cam would laugh and joke and say even when you preach on money and ties and offerings and managing your money he said i felt the anointing there and how many people have we had come in the church and just they would leave us i remember brother peter remember different brothers we've had through and they said this was such an oasis for us our church was such an oasis because they were able to come in get fed the word of god get strengthened or get healed and then god was able to send them on to their destiny and i just wanted to be a faithful shepherd while i was here while they were here i just wanted to faithfully feed them the meat of the word praise god we had even had a brother here that was a seven thunders brother and he's and he was like wow brothers he said i've never heard preaching like that he said i love to preach in the ministry and they kind of worship you know joseph coleman but even coming to archers he was up clapping and singing song specials and just enjoying the prince of the lord because you have to exp when you experience the promised land you can tell others about it amen because you're experiencing it praise god and the word has made you live a righteous life but unskillful brothers and preachers haven't lived that they haven't experienced that so their preaching doesn't produce the righteous life they're babes behind the pulpit can you imagine a baby coming up zion coming up to preach to us today he'd probably do this first he get his tongue out and thing because that's what he does when he's real happy and we'd be waiting there for the word okay come on preach it preacher come on amen [Music] that's what the bible calls a babe when they just center on these elementary teachings now what are they strong meat belongs to them who are full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil so a mature christian just has this sense you know we used to watch uh comic books we used to read comic books and watch movies when i was on the world do you remember spider-man had that spider sense do you remember that i don't know if you guys are watching i'm about shame to say it but anytime there's like one of those bad guys coming he'd have this like this spider sense and like right the last moment right before he got hit he'd able to turn and block it or you know shoot the web out or something like that he had that sense where he could just sense evil coming and that's what the christian has amen they actually got that from jesus because jesus just he discerned all their all their tricks right they try to trick him with the question what do you say about caesar what do you say about healing on the sabbath and jesus would sense it he'd sense that and said i see you reason in your heart you're a hypocrite amen and you give them the right answer and then they'd have no more questions so just like jesus had that sense that's what we have it's the holy ghost the holy ghost is able to discern is this good or is this evil that's a real christian amen that's a real mature christian is when you can just get the sense i'm sensing this as evil i'm sensing something's not right or i'm sensing this as god i feel the blessing of god amen sensing good sensing evil i've learned that all these superheroes all they do is impersonate jesus that's all if you roll up all those superheroes even wonder woman if you you take all them roam up into one that's jesus right jesus can do everything he can fly he can you know he could he goes up to heaven and they just copy jesus he's the great mighty god right so here's what the babes do behind the pulpit therefore leaving the principles of doctrine of christ let us go on to perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and faith toward god so a milk preacher will just focus on just getting saved and repenting and having peace with god right just believe god just trust god now most churches do that and that are not in the message right they just want to get saved i've seen i've seen the remember went through those false prophets that minute that little series there a lot of those pastors said that if you want a deeper experience with god he they said leave our church our church is the safe sinners i've i've seen them i've seen them say that on youtube that proves without a shadow of a doubt they're baby preachers at the best at the best if they're not deceivers of men right at the very best they're feeding the people milk right but probably injecting some false things in there right so if you just stay on just repent get saved just believe god just believe god if you just stay on that long enough you'll be a baby next what else is next i believe there were six doctrines right one two three four five okay five let me go back repentance from dead works oh there is six repentance faith toward god baptisms laying on of hands resurrection of the dead eternal judgment six six six number of man you gotta leave the number of man and go up into the the heavenlies heavenly places right next baptism this is what we said with moses and joshua there are two baptisms amen right there's the baptism of water and there's the baptism of the spirit that needs to be taught now look how many churches are falling short on this i'm talking about outside the message think about that almost every church almost every church outside the message fails right there at the best they're giving them milk when they walk in what if you sisters would have woke up this morning and just put cups of milk at the table for your hubby for your children what would they have told you maokai lydia what have you told me if i would just place milk before this morning what would you have said i'm hungry you don't think these people going to churches are like i'm hungry so what does satan do satan gives them like riches right he gives them he tickles their ears oh you can do this oh you can be married again see in order to distract them away that they're just drinking milk he gives them the lust of their flesh that's what the bible said it will tickle their itching ears but give them unrighteousness now don't get me wrong i'm thankful for the milk when i'm thirsty i really like some water i like some liquid right when you but but there comes a time where lydia's now 16 and she said daddy i'm hungry don't give me milk give me something to eat praise god right and that's what that is so most churches don't even have anything more than milk now here it is laying on of hands we should lay hands on the sick thank god and thank god they recover praise god we should teach that the dead will be resurrected and have to give judgment at the white throne we should teach that praise god we should the bible said warn all men amen of the judgment to come praise god and save some pulling them out of the fire the bible said we should teach of eternal judgment not eternal punishment but eternal judgment those souls will be judged eternally but they won't suffer eternally they'll be annihilated praise god we should teach that but once we've taught it then he said we should move on we should leave those principles and go on to deeper things of god i like this this we will do if god permit that means if god instructs in other words god is the only one who can raise our instruction for the people in other words god knows what you have need of and when you have need of it god will raise the standard he'll start preaching deeper to us hallelujah that takes the pressure off me amen i mean i want to live higher myself but we can only go higher all of us can only go higher if god allows it which means we understand these we're enjoying the blessings of them we're living off them and but we want more we're hungry if i can quote lydia i'm a hungry preacher right that's what i should feel when i come up here i should feel hungry souls i just want me to preach god's word and give them something meaning to chew on amen they're so hungry uh i'm hungry i got to have more i want more of a relationship with christ i want to grow deeper in my understanding of jesus amen glory i should feel your hunger and you should feel my hunger too praise god that's that right remember in the next verse hebrews 6 4 i'm just going to briefly just read it what are the deep things here's one of them the anointed ones at the end time hebrews 6 4. i don't have it on my slide i forgot to put up there for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word sorry i was just checking the time there tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucified to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame so what are these deep things brother jesse they're the revelations of god that god brought us through brother branham these mysteries right the mystery of the anointed ones the end time comes out of the mystery of the kingdom of heaven because that's where jesus tells it in matthew 13. he said the rain fell on the tears and the rain fell on the wheat but both eventually manifest which one it was and then harvest time came and he said separate those tares bind those tares in their world ecumenical system but gather my wheat to the meeting in the air amen it's a mystery praise god that's what jesus says there as i'm sorry that's what paul says there now go down here let's not forget this this is beautiful verse 9 but beloved we're persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation through though thus we speak for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of your love which you have showed toward his name in that yet minister to the saints and do minister see now that's the trouble too a lot of people don't minister to other people we have to minister to other people we have to minister to the saints we have to help one another out see that see sometimes we get so busy doing our own thing we forget about ministering to the saints that might mean like jose sending prayer cloths to other countries that might mean that right or getting groceries for your mom or dad or something like that or caring for your father like sister havardic's been doing right caring for you is your dad are you still taking care of your dad sister bless your heart bless your that's what jesus would want you to do praise god brother man told us that if your parents took care of you when you were young take care of your parents when they're old that's ministering to someone that's serving someone else's needs praise god so see paul tells him god's not going to forget how you minister to other people verse 11 and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence there it is diligence you're not a baby god's not going to just drop off honey bread from heaven all the time you've got to take the word believe that promised seed go plant that seed and water that seed and let it stay there until it produces fruit praise god amen god wants you to receive that promise believe that promise quote that promise and one day you'll receive a harvest a plenty for harvest one day you'll see the fruits of that word praise god amen you're not a baby gotta have a supernatural experience every day that's what they had every day every day i wonder if some of them would peak outside to see when they fell every day they had to have that under sanctification but when they come in the promised land you got to be mature now you got to work the land you got to be diligent you have to trust that the god who brought you through all those steps he's going to be with you in this step he's going to help you fulfill your your destiny 9 show diligence verse 11 to the full assurance of hope unto the end that ye be not slothful don't get lazy in the promised land but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises faith and patience makes you inherit the promises of god let me close here i've almost gone about an hour and a half right so give me a set of timer here give me ten minutes let me finish up now here's where brother ram says this now he he brings it down and basically says this is what denominations do they will rally about around one of these first principles like repentance like that's a good baptist one or the baptisms that's a good pentecostal one because they make it tongues they just rally around there's two baptisms water and speaking in tongues they rally around that see paul says now lay all that aside see baptism laying on hands thinks but that isn't perfection that's only the carnal reform and that's where the churches leave off today is that old carnal reform one of them said oh well the water the water baptism means this and it means that so look what brother and is showing us churches will die and denominate when they just take one of these six principles and just rally around that and they fail to move on into the meat of the word praise god let me say like this are you hungering in your personal time with the lord are you hungering for a deeper walk with the lord or have you put it on autopilot preacher do my work for me oh my neighbor will plant and and weed and harvest for me really i'm going to move by you so my my neighbor will do that for me no you got to get out there in the field yourself how many sisters got a garden you got a garden that's right yeah you guys do i know uh your mom does a gardener sister have a garden too you got to get out there yourself or you got to pay somebody to get out there we send the little ones out there sometimes my wife does a great job out there if you want to if you want to harvest you got to get out there and work praise god but see churches don't want to labor and pray anymore oh church members don't want to pray like they used to pray i don't do that too often anymore right we don't pray like we used to we don't hunger like we used to we must show the same diligence if we want the same fruits as the old days we got to show the same diligence today praise god amen you're not a baby anymore we're just gonna fall out every day every day i'm gonna have the bible speak to me and i'm gonna just rejoice every day i'm gonna see a dream every day brother is going to do something that i supernatural to me it's not going to be every day but you've got to work like it is going to happen every day hallelujah it don't have to happen i'm still a child of god i'm still in the promised land i'm still mature i know it's going to happen i know there's going to be a harvest someday church how many years did god let paul sit in that prison how many years and paul had already been broken out of prison before he knew god could break him out of the prison if he wanted to if he really wanted to he could come shake the prison again and bring me out but he sat there and he learned this is producing something in my life this is bringing me to maturity amen where i can say for me to live is christ to die is christ hallelujah so no matter what situation i'm in it's always christ amen and to die is my gain amen church we can't rally around one thing most of mostly it's joseph's a prophet or brother ram's a prophet of god which is true but people rally around that i don't believe joseph is a prophet though but people will rally around those one things and they'll rally there and they'll die there and when they when they focus on that they they just drink the milk of that and they never go on into deeper things of god they can't leave that they stop right there and they no longer go into the things of god how are we going to go deeper in the lord amen i hope this is helping you by god's grace but said they set up organizations one sprinkles one poor see they're still on that baptism's doctrine they're still they can't even get past that thank god we're past that yeah that's why i love this church amen because i was raised in a church they just stayed at the repentance and laying on their hands and the tongue i was raised in the assemblies of god but that church had died the denominations died but god brought me over he brought me over jordan into the promised land hallelujah and i'm learning and i'm understanding things i never understood now that i'm in the word of god i'm in the deep and rich things now and now we're enjoying the full corn of healings and salvations and people being filled with the holy ghost now we're really enjoying some great blessings of god hallelujah we're discerning good and evil we're able to discern when the enemy comes in like a flood this we watch the spirit of god raise up a standard against glaucoma amen against heart disease the spirit of god raises up a standard against that against idolatry worshiping brother branham the spirit of god raises up a standard we sense the evil and we recognize the good and we stay with the good see one sprinkles one's forward one's backward all those things some lay hands on the six some make apostles by laying on of hands some make prophets and so forth that's what they do at the hillsong and the bethel churches right and pentecostals they i impart to you this gift and what if god never gave that gift then their whole life their life they believe a lie and they can never go into the meat they can't even keep sin out of their lives because they're they're just they're dead on that on that milk that's all they got is milk they're hungry but they satan gives them something to try to distract them from their their holy thirst right he said making some profits laying on our hands preaching the resurrection from the dead which is all right but the supreme need of christ that's all right but all these are formal reformations we're just been reforming now let's go on to perfection you get the picture everybody get the picture message churches can do the same thing and the church said they can rally around one thing and die and not go in to spiritual perfection i tell you church whoa we will be privileged if the lord helps us move on all of us now move on from elementary things help us all move into the deeper things of god where church not just one or two or three or four of us are born again but all of us are born again we're all ministering to someone like i'll say it again sister haverick's been taking care of her dad that's her ministry there he's yeah how how old is he sister 83. his health is struggling so someone's got a minister someone's got to take care of him and so god has anointed our sister there to minister there and be a blessing right so our prayer today should be lord who am i supposed to minister to now our mothers but god made it really easy for our mothers amen because god gave them precious souls to minister to to feed them natural feed them spiritual remember mom brother said you're a preacher i just read that quote this morning brother i said mother's the first preacher she's the first preacher telling the word of god right so we know our sisters and our fathers doing a great job instructing the children right that's their ministry but if we don't have one of those we got to have some ministry where god is helping us minister like like we said prayer clause maybe it's a ministry of prayer maybe it's a ministry of fasting maybe it's a ministry of giving food to the poor all these are ministries that's what the saints do when you're in the promised land you're mature you know what god's called you to do you're not a baby someone's got a baby you to come to church baby you to read your bible baby you to say amen right baby to listen to brother branham baby you to do something for you you don't need somebody to do something for you you'll do it because you're led by the holy ghost amen let me close to this here oh my praise the lord i'm happy today i hope you're i hope you're blessed today by god's grace i'm happy because i see mature ones among us praise god or you don't have to be babied you're ministering to others and you continue to minister and you want to go on into perfection you want to know more of the will of god for your life i think that's my greatest desire my greatest desire to see all my children filled with the holy ghost and to somehow see uh our church to see everybody filled with the holy ghost and then to outreach and win souls that's what i want more than anything else those three things my family our church and then i want to i want to i just want to do missionary work i and if i can't go i'm going to send somebody praise god all right so i want to grow into that i want to grow into seeing these things but i need faith and patience the bible says faith and patience inherit the promises of god all right i'm gonna close with this here take your bibles let's go to joshua i appreciate your patience with me and let's go to verse 13. i want to close with the captain of the lord's host this is beautiful hallelujah at church think about all that joshua's been through he brought he sent the spies over they come back talked about rahab he sent the ark before him the waters parted they come across he circumcised the male they keep the feast they've had all these glorious times and brother baram said one day while strolling along in the wilderness rocky hilly desert walking around long there he's seen a man imagine he's just all walking all by himself all of a sudden he sees a man and the man stood and drew his sword just like a man looked like a man and joshua perhaps being a chief warrior drew his sword too because that man's got a sword drawn that means he's ready to attack and he walked to meet him and said who are you are you for us are you for our adversary i'm going to read out of verse 13. came to pass when joshua's by jericho he lifted up his eyes he got closer to that big walled city oh i like this the closer you get to those great uh obstacles the closer jesus comes amen praise god now look he don't even know who this is and yet this is the man who's been guiding him the whole time amen the presence of god was unrecognized amen until this moment he couldn't even recognize the friends of god but as soon as he approaches this major battle of his life who appears the one who's been guiding him the whole life the captain of the lord's host comes to him physically for a personal encounter to remind him who's among him amen to remind him that he's with him praise god church as you come to mighty battles before your enemies god is going to show up in your life how many can say amen to that when you come before great uh obstacles and great giants in your life as you approach them and as you've kept the feasts glory as you've kept the sin out of your life amen as you've kept the passover as you've eaten the unleavened bread of the word jesus is going to appear to you and he's going to manifest himself to you in a new way you might not recognize it at first but god is going to show himself alive and let him know that he's with you even in you joshua don't even recognize him who is this guy who are you are you for us are you for our adversaries and he said nay but as the captain of the host of the lord am i now come and joshua fell on his face and said unto him what saith my lord unto his servant now this cannot be an angel because angels don't take worship john fell down to worship the angel he said get up get him good peter no uh cornelius fell down before peter get up cornelius right whenever they fall they try to worship an angel and he says get up worship god but joshua falls before this captain and says lord i like what brother man says the man he said look he said the man i could see his sword high saying no i'm the captain of the host of the lord the god of israel see he's approaching jericho and he sees this man with a sword up in other words now we're ready to fight now's the time to draw the sword now the word is going to lead you've kept all these formalities amen you've kept all these feasts you've done all these right things but now it's the time for the sword to go forth now's the time for battle and i'm leading you into this battle praise god amen he falls on his face and said lord what would you have me to do that's a great question we should ask today lord it's may 2021 what would you have me to do praise god who should i minister to your children and your wife first if you're a brother if your sister your children and your husband first what would you have me to do verse 15 the captain of the lords of host son of joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place where on thou stand this is holy and joshua did so look what brother adam says when he seen this man what was it it was the captain in other words the leader of the host of israel and that leader was none other than christ himself and what was he first seen in a pillar of fire and now the pillar of fire had become a man i hope you know what i'm talking about he had become a man god changing his form church joshua alone by himself seen just what it was it's just like moses moses was all by himself and then he's seen the burning bush because joshua is the new moses right the holy ghost is the new jesus amen i didn't hear you praise god amen the holy ghost is here to act just like jesus act when jesus was here praise god he said the pillar of fire led them as an angel here he stood and called himself the captain of the host he was the unseen one he's still the captain of the host of the lord the unseen one the invisible one the omnipotent one i like this here tonight can i say it like this the captain of the host of the lord is here this morning amen he's here this morning praise god just as real as he was standing there against the walls of jericho the same lord jesus a figurative type of course he was melchizedek abraham amen this captain might have said i met your great-great-great-grandfather abraham i serve him bread and wine and now i'm taking you abraham's seed now i'm taking you into the promises that i gave to your great-great-great grandfather because you're the same covenant the same family the same kingdom hallelujah i'm taking you in hallelujah amen i've never left you i'll never leave you or forsake you i'm always with you you may not always recognize me but i'm there anyway praise god amen i'm melchizedek but now i'm a different now i changed my mask now i'm the captain of the host of the lord i used to look like melchizedek but now i got a new mask on i have no father or no mother how do you think joshua felt after seeing this guy now look joshua might have been thinking well i'm the captain of the host of the lord right he might have been thinking well i thought i was the captain moses appointed me the captain so god comes around and gives him a reminder right before he goes into jericho right before he goes into this great battle he said let me remind you i'm the captain i'm the one leading you how many thank god that he's leaving you today amen really if jesus was here today brother bang he'd say i'm the pastor praise god if jesus was here today he'd say i'm the husband of your family i'm the provider of your family right right i'm the he said i'm the mother of your family would he not joshua's the captain but god is the ultimate captain amen hallelujah god is point a point in your position but really god is the true one jesus is the true holder of that office amen as long as you obey him and keep his word and let his life live through you you'll be successful more than a conqueror you'll possess the gates of your enemies amen hallelujah there he was melchizedek oh glory joshua he's moving in he said don't be troubled believe here's the prayer line he's here tonight to take over if you've got about in your life jesus can take over this morning that's why he's here he was going to take over before they went to jericho to let joshua know i'm here to take over he said i love that i believe the pillar of fire is with us tonight the captain of the host of lord is here tonight and the sword is pulled see it wasn't poll before but now it's time for battle and church you've got to know when it's time for battle that's when the sword gets drawn and that's when you know it's time to take god at his word it's time for war in other words many times for us it'll be like it's time to come up for prayer and really have a have an end to this i'm ready to overcome this i'm ready to defeat this enemy i'm ready to make this demon flee i'm ready to overcome that's when the angel lord pulls his sword out praise god the sword is pulled see he said angel lord is not afraid of the medical sign he said he said he's talking to someone in the prayer line they're trying hard i hope they get it something to cure cancer something to do these things with but so far the devil thinks he's got the bluff on them but when the sword of christ comes down he will never withstand that he will chop every cancer loose he will raise up the blind and the afflicted he's doing it everywhere david said it too it had not been the lord who was on our side how many like that blessed be the lord who have not given us as a prey to their teeth who's the one that's given you all these victories who's the one that's been on your side god's been on your side praise god joshua said whose side are you on he said i'm the captain of the side i'm the captain of your side our help is in the name of the lord who made heaven and earth if you need help today the captain of the host of the lord is here praise god moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called them he also justified whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say then to these things if god be for us who can be against us if the captain of the host of the lord is on our side today who can be against us church let's stand to our feet church think about the times when you've seen the captain of the host of the lord we just seen him with vang and who is dad right with jose's glaucoma we just seen the captain with his sword drawn brother johnny you not come up we remember we prayed for brother jose god heal him of that glaucoma what did we see we saw the captain of the host with his sword pole ready for battle archer glad church when you need him when you know it when it's when god leads you to this battle remember it always wasn't battles sometimes it was feasts sometimes there was days of rest rejuvenation healing can i say like that healing circumcision sometimes there were seasons of healing for you sometimes there were seasons of rest to remember all the things god had done but when god brought you to this great obstacle then the angel lord himself comes he pulls a sword and said now it's time for battle and i'm here to win the battle for you if we'll let him fight for us how many will let the lord fight for you musicians you can come play only believe only believe all things are possible only believe i remember that when we prayed for brother jose brother john and i i asked johnny to come up and pray for him i remember praying that that glaucoma would leave he goes a month later back to the doctor and the doctor says we don't know what happened but you don't have glaucoma anymore who took care of that not us it was the captain of the lord's host who's ministered to all those people by prayer cloth it's the captain of the host of the lord i remember when brother brian hawkins was sick of those couple years ago remember he came and preached about it he needed a hip transplant it must have been i don't know i didn't see him brother bang but it must have been the captain of the host of the lord pulled his sword i said brother you're 45 there's no way you need hip replacement let's pray for this and three days later the doctor calls and says your hips heal don't need hip replacement who stood up for that it was the captain of the host lord he stood up for us amen brian was facing a great jericho was he not a great obstacle glaucoma was a great jericho but our god specializes in bringing down strongholds amen hallelujah he specializes in bringing down jericho's amen and driving our enemies that's what the captain of the host of the lord is here for praise god to help us inherit every promise of god as we go into the deep things of god let's bow our heads here for a moment just play only believe only believe all things are possible heavenly father we've preached your word we've
