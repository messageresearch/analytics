bless you as being seated praise god so have your bibles ready i want to look at i'm just going to be preaching a little bit out of the chapter i don't know has anybody read chapter one out of the book it's okay if you haven't that's why i've been preaching it you know but if you haven't read chapter one it's just on the godhead and i'm slowly going through this but let's have your bibles ready uh church we kind of looked at all the eight eight reasons we could have said nine right we could have said nine reasons why uh the trinity is a false doctrine and it's a uh it's leaven from uh from the miserable woman right the evil woman who hid leaven in god's uh unleavened bread we'd say then it became leavened the whole thing was impacted by the leaven of the lie of the devil he changed who god was and ultimately church we know that breaks the first commandment right as soon as you touch god as soon as you start talking about god and you change it you break the first commandment then you know gets in the second commandment and third commandment those first three about god and so we want no other gods before us we don't want to speak anything evil in the name of the lord we want to honor the hollow name of jesus remember they did that awful threefold blasphemy remember they changed his name they blasphemed his name the saints in heaven and uh the eternal city they blasphemed all three of those of course through the roman catholic church uh so let's be thankful that we know god in truth how many can be thankful for that tonight what a blessing to know god so after this section in the book where i went through the eight reasons why the trinity's wrong then i show how it is clearly taught in the bible and the first part is that god manifests himself in three ways that's the key word manifest or form those are the two words the bible uses manifest or form he changes manifestation or he changes forms we've got some readers back there haven't you ready to lydia acacia maokai all right sure would you like to read sister would that be okay all right thank you i appreciate that usually i just you know pick up the kids but jose can you read tonight brother okay no it's okay i appreciate brother thank you sir so that's god's plan now god has many manifestations but in redeeming mankind he uses father son holy ghost because that's the name that is baptized right jesus said baptize them in the name so we're to be immersed or we're to be uh publicly identified in these three manifestations so three of the manifestations are crucial for redemption right you man can't be redeemed without a father in heaven without a god with us right and then without a god in us man can't fully be redeemed and brought back to the original condition like he was in eden praise god we need all three of those amen and so that's what we got by the grace of the lord so the bible says he manifests uh at least 11 times the word manifest is used in connection to jesus so we're going through all them through all 11 of them tonight because i don't know if you'll do it if you read the book or not okay so i want to make sure i teach it especially for our young ones they need to know this truth so that nothing can shake them right if they get a revelation not for me tonight if they get a revelation from the father tonight the gates of hell will never take it over them right they'll never be overtaken by the gates of hell man flesh and blood cannot give a revelation but as the children meditate on the word as even adults meditate on the word god will quicken that thought to us it'll be revealed to us it'll be made known and then god gets all the credit i don't get any credit god gets all the credit amen because i can't say well you're going to leave with this revelation i can't say that it's whatever god is willing to drop in our hearts tonight praise god and you never know when it's going to be that moment praise god so let's uh get your bibles here in case she's going to do oh yeah we never read our text do we oh that's a you have to forgive me i'm really tired i got up at 3 30 this morning i couldn't go back to bed so i'm just exhausted today so let's yeah let's let me read the text that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all the riches of the full assurance of understanding to acknowledgement of the mystery of god and of the father and of christ okay so we acknowledge the mystery okay why don't we stand though for the reading of the word right did so we didn't read the word we're standing okay so let's stand and let's just read john 1 31 you pull it up there john 1 31 let's go through all 11 times we'll just stand for the first one john 1 31. let's all read that together ready one two three and i knew him not but that he should be manifest to israel therefore am i come baptizing with water may god has blessed the reading of his word you may be seated here sorry i got my little order mixed up here i survived the first day at work with the children so that's good i survived so i say praise the lord for that so here's the first one uh john didn't know him right but he was manifest to israel all right so the manifestation that he christ should be manifest to israel john came baptizing with water in other words god sent a forerunner before the first coming of christ and we know god sent a forerunner named william branham to foreign the second coming of jesus christ both men have the spirit of elijah brother jose i got a video remind me i got a video to share with you about uh the cloud there's a brother down in south carolina that preached it it is the most phenomenal sermon i've heard on the cloud he starts with science and shows all there's three sermons on it it's it's tremendous so i gotta share with you remind me afterwards uh but and again god vindicating brother branham god vindicated brother branham no science can put that cloud that many miles high in the sky it was just it was it was not science it wasn't a thor rocket it's impossible it was god god forming that cloud to vindicate thus saith the lord that thus saith the lord was on the way praise god jesus had to descend in a cloud right the mighty angel come down clothed with the cloud oh hallelujah just it's just a refresher about how how powerfully we've been visited by the holy spirit in this hour amen all right so john 14 21 saints here's number two all right so olivia can you read that you got that john 14 21. wow so jesus is going to come manifest himself to anyone right that love him he will show himself so church you don't have to worry about the pressure's not on you all the time right god can use us to love people but really if someone really loves jesus christ jesus christ will come and make himself known to them amen okay next uh malachi why don't you get uh john 17 6. let's just flip through these you'll see it it's a beautiful beautiful subject go ahead okay amen now look at that church this is at the end of jesus life and he tells the father i've manifested thy name to them and what did these disciples do that we're doing too we're keeping the word i'm going to keep in the word tonight amen you're in the house of god you're believing the word of god you are keeping the word praise god see and so that's who jesus disciples are that's who jesus manifests himself to those that keep the word okay next acacia can you get uh first corinthians 12 7. now this also is with the holy ghost being a manifestation of god yes this actually doesn't refer to jesus right this refers to the holy ghost in believer so i actually put that in the wrong place in the book so that's kind of a little simple mistake there but i think the people will see that it's a manifestation of the holy spirit oh no i'm sorry i wrote it's 11 times it refers oh no i made a mistake yeah it's 11 times in connection to jesus this is really to the holy ghost see i did make a mistake there but so church so you can see when the holy ghost does something through our lives whether it's witnessing or miracle or repentance any manifestation it's god showing himself that he's in our lives so that's why we rejoice when someone put the testimony up here that someone got healed or saved or delivered or god answered some prayer that's why we rejoice church it's further proof that these signs follow them that believe praise god see it's jesus it's god manifesting and you and i he shows up god appears in us that's why the children want to grow up and they want to seek after god and god will do works in their lives great works right healing or deliverance or miracles or wisdom or knowledge all these great things that can flow as we yield ourselves to god that proves the holy spirit's manifesting or appearing in your life amen amen thank god all right go to first timothy 3 16 we're familiar with this one we could probably quote this but great is the mystery of godliness god was manifest in the flesh justified in the look how fast you are scene of angels preached unto the gentiles believed on the world and received up into glory all right now this is quite the scripture because brother graham says this is godliness restored to man so this scripture is all about jesus what does this have to do with godliness being restored to man it could only be restored to man through the death and resurrection of jesus that's what that is right because we see he was justifying the spirit scene of angels preaching the gentiles and recede up into glory so in other words the holy ghost couldn't be sent until jesus was glorified amen that's what john 7 says so this is beautiful how it connects to uh the statue of a perfect man jesus christ slowly anointing us with more and more anointing restoring godliness to man but it could only happen through jesus christ dying being buried and resurrecting and ascending to heaven thank god he's restoring godliness in our lives amen hallelujah next one second timothy 1 10. i'd love to hear those bible pages turning ii timothy 1 10. sister who would you want to read that when you get that thank you but it's not made manifest by the appearing of our savior jesus christ who has abolished the death and have brought life and amen praise god so this holy calling in christ jesus now manifests by the appearing of our savior jesus christ okay now paul was writing that he's saying by manifest by the appearing so he means when jesus was most recently at his first coming right that's what he means so again a manifestation by jesus christ we know the holy calling because jesus was manifest he showed himself he appeared to us so in the very beautiful scripture there and he brought it life and immortality to light through the gospel the good news how do you believe our church is all about good news amen but to tell the the good news we got to tell the bad news first right the destruction of america the destruction of the world the mark of the beast but after hearing all that the false church then we can tell you that there's a real church praise god there's real victory there's healing there's deliverance there's power in the name of jesus christ the good news amen you don't have to live in a dead old church you can come and be alive in christ jesus today like brother mj can recognize right we get all these new people in there and they if they're honest they can recognize there's something different it's the word of god it's the presence of the holy ghost praise god like we saw on saturday night right with our visitors many of them coming up for prayer weren't that beautiful just to recognize the presence of the holy ghost praise god hallelujah that's what's here tonight it's even here tonight the presence of jesus christ amen all right first peter 1 20. first peter 1 20. let's get haven you can read off the screen hon would that be okay thank you great job david i kind of feel like it's a bible study i want to cheer for you so look paul or peter calls this the last times now times must mean the last 2 000 years right so he or maybe he was just thinking of his his own human flesh that those were the last times there were no doubt last times for that generation they weren't going to live very long right but we can see jesus was manifested in these last times for you praise god okay first john 1 verse 2. i've been reading through this book this week this is just a power packed this is a revelation-packed book especially chapter three you got kane there is of the wicked one um and then you got no murder has eternal life i mean you have some just a major uh doctrine clinching scriptures in there just laying the uh putting the nail in all the way right putting the nail through and just solving the problem right solving the issue just with scriptures right there first john 1 verse 2 for the life the life was manifested and we have seen it okay so who saw it john saw john saw the life of god manifested in a man and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us can you imagine that when they touched jesus they were touching eternal life on the inside right the body wasn't didn't have eternal life yet but they were touching eternal life's form right they were touching eternal life manifestation can you imagine touching that and the fullness of eternal life was in that man what a what a privilege what an honor we've not only touched it we've seen it and then he says later he says we've handled it with our own hands a wha what uh what an experience no wonder church no wonder that these men will be right around the throne of jesus because they had the privilege to live and die for jesus all except john right all except john they died as martyrs but they got to handle eternal life do you think they care that all their mistakes are in the in the gospels do you think peter cared that his denials were in there no because later he got the holy ghost praise god and then it wiped all that away then he got power to overcome praise god and church he got to handle eternal life in a man hallelujah with he's handled with his own hands okay first john 3 verse 5. so chapter 3 verse 5. let's go back if we can to malachi first john 3 5. that'd be okay man okay amen wonderful so why was he shown why did he appear why was he manifested to take away your sin you ought to say praise the lord amen praise the lord amen he he appeared to get rid of my sin that's part of the reason he came praise god was to set us free from our sin problem amen hallelujah chapter three verse eight lydia can get that three verse eight uh this is a beautiful scripture all right so see he destroyed satan's works he took away all your sin that's why he appeared to defeat satan and to set you free amen all right first john 4 9 last one and do you believe that we've already gone over all 11. that fast first john 4 9. but see the bible uses it over and over and that's a revelation the holy spirit showed me that's the key word manifest or form all the time god uses it all the time in connection to jesus christ first john 4 9 sister who would you like to read that that'd be okay thank amen amen praise god that was god's love manifested with jesus christ and we live through him how many living through the words in this book here tonight i'm thankful for the red letters i thank god for the red letters amen see we're living through him through his word right because his body's not here thank god his spirits here praise god his spirit is here to back up the word hallelujah okay so church you've been you've seen all 11 or 10 verses that call 10 verses that call jesus the manifestation of god all right there's 11. now the next one is a different word the word form so can you pull up philippians 2 6 acacia philippians 2 6. this word in the greek form means the form by which a person or thing strikes the vision the external appearance all right so jesus came in the manifestation of god or we could say he came as the form of god the external appearance who being in the external appearance of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god okay now church just i'm going to put something in here i don't consider myself equal with god okay i have a i have a portion of eternal life in my soul that's equal with god but i don't have i'm not equal with god in the mind or the flesh and even the soul either because remember jesus had the holy ghost without measure but the bible says we have the holy ghost with measure so even the eternal life inside of us isn't as much we'd say power or as or authority as jesus's holy ghost measure amen praise god so we got to be real careful with that scripture right don't don't ever think well i'm equal with god i'm god no you're not you're a manifestation you're a uh you're an offspring of god you're a child of god but you're not god praise god a lot of churches get into trouble with that one with this scripture well i'm equal with god why can't i speak it well you can't always do that recently i've seen churches try to do that they tried to speak healing and then people have died in their church i mean maybe i'll tell a story once the live stream is over but people that we love and people that we know they just try to speak speak speak and then it don't come to pass well why is that because they're not equal with god they they should have stopped and said lord is it your will to heal the person now it's okay brother man says okay just to speak the word all the time but church it may not work out the way we're speaking because we don't know the ultimate will of god right you can speak it all you want you can speak anything all you want but you're not god and that doesn't mean it's going to come to pass so it's best to wait until you know it's god doing it praise god it's best to hope in god and hope in the mercy of god and speak what you want to happen but always say if the lord is willing or if it be the will of the lord does that make sense all right i want you to know that because we like i said i know i love beautiful people i love quoting you know speaking the word but then it don't come to pass okay so we just want to be aware of that and even i'm sure i'm sure i've done the same thing i'm sure i've spoken something and it didn't happen but as long as i didn't say thus saith the lord i'm fine right i was just speaking hope okay and of course you and i wouldn't speak in the in the name of the lord unless we absolutely knew it was going to happen okay all right so god father son holy ghost god manifesting god manifests as a father right son and holy ghost all right so let's look at a few of these here by the grace of the lord so three manifestations don't make three persons okay because this today i was manifested as teacher at school brother jose now manifested as pastor and brother and friend but i'm not the pastor to the kids at school that's a different manifestation right that doesn't so those three manifestations teacher pastor friend that don't make three persons i'm still the same person right that's pretty simple for us to understand right so we must understand god we must use god's words and god's words are manifest and form those are god's words okay all right so god manifests as a father when he created us and then he puts that knowledge inside of us that's malachi 2 10. can you put malachi 210 in case you can read that for us malachi 2 10. church the bible says the father created you and then the bible said the father created all things by jesus christ so the father was the invisible spirit and jesus christ was the word at the beginning all right so casey go ahead all right great job everybody look up there see the father father create us one god one father so god above us manifested himself through creation so church every time we look outside and see the beautiful sunsets and the the moon the last few days it's coming up to a full moon pretty soon i think it's the it's we're seeing the father manifested right because the bible said the father created us the father did this the invisible spirit but he did it through the word through his son amen all right so that's how god is manifested to us remember the bible said in romans 1 and 2 that there will be no excuse on the day of judgment because of creation and god manifesting himself in here and i thought of the third thing the soul thirst so there's three reasons no men are without excuse everybody has a holy thirst for god right everybody can see god that created you all these nerves and and cells and trillions of cells everybody can see god did this god put a conscience in you right that's part of it and also all the beautiful creation outside which we ought to be thankful for this beautiful weather today praise god all right so those three so there's three mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established there'll be no excuses on the day of judgment for any person in any country and any any uh uh any space in the entire world any continent right there without excuse because god showed them his power praise god and they all thirst for god all right so that means church said that just means like a heathen aborigine or someone who never they always lived in the wilderness that means every one of them has a thirst to leave that jungle to go find god do you hear me if they have a holy thirst and there's nothing holy around them then that means all of them want to leave their their primitive uh jungle life and they want to go find god but they either got to turn that they either got to satisfy that holy thirst or they got to hush that holy thirst aren't you glad church that god put that inside everybody that wants to know god can know god and if they if they if they don't leave and they still want to know god they can see jesus in a dream praise god hallelujah he'll come to them in a dream he'll manifest himself because he cannot be limited he cannot be stopped amen his eyes search the world looking for someone he can show himself powerful in praise god see even if they won't leave the jungle god jesus will still come to them because there's no excuses there's always a holy thirst in every person okay so that's how the father's manifested the son is manifested as we already read god manifests in the flesh in first timothy 3 16. remember god could not die in the spirit form so god had to be manifest or appear in flesh and jesus christ died he paid the price remission of sins only comes through the blood hallelujah and to do this god sent himself a once for all sin sacrifice that's in hebrews 10 10. you believe hebrews 10 10 in other words church god only needed one sacrifice god was so perfect so strong he didn't need a thousand sacrifices or even ten sacrifices he just needed one sacrifice and that was the perfect sacrifice by the which we will i'm sorry which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once and for all praise god see we're sanctified that means we're set apart by one offering believing in that one offering sanctifies us in other words it sets us apart i don't i don't think that's referring to the second work of grace i think that's just referring to that sacrifice when you believe in it it separates you from the world it separates you totally far apart from anything like that because now you're a believer now you got the anointing on you now you've got the love of jesus christ on you now you thirst for holiness praise god amen through one sacrifice god in flesh and that's what he's called he's called immanuel pull up matthew 1 23. what do you call this god or what do you call this manifestation emmanuel not a second person with us but church it's god with us uh matthew 1 a virgin shall conceive well bring forth the son they shall call his name emmanuel which being interpreted as second person with us did i read that right can you believe these people do that brother jose we laugh don't we how can they it ain't a second person it's god with us amen god just changed his mask i think i left a mask in my room i should have break out those masks from the other the bible study the other night god just changed his mass god put on a mask and come down and lived in his creative son and it's his only begotten son there'll never be another son like that one amen there'll never be another a holy sinless son like that one that will die on the cross he was the one and only the only begotten son of the father and you know one of those preachers one of those prosperity preachers remember i preached on false prophets in the winter time did you know some of them i'll just name it remember paula white she had a preacher come on her show and said that jesus wasn't the only begotten sons because we're begotten and she just sat there and said amen can you imagine that's like having no wisdom that's like having no discernment the bible said jesus was the only begotten of the father in other words the only virgin born son that was taken to the cross to pay the penalty for our sins and raise with our forgiveness fully purchased amen but a false prophetess like her who pretends to speak in tongues and pretends to send angels from from africa and south america to america and win the election for trump which it failed right the very same person does that says oh yeah jesus isn't the only begotten word begotten too that's a lie see the holy spirit will always pick up that lie thank god that we can discern truth and we can judge the right teaching amen so god above us god with us and now it's god in us as we already read first corinthians 12 7 this manifestation of the spirit is given to every man every believer to profit with all all right so that's that's really uh the most important scripture there first corinthians 12 7 the holy ghost is god appearing in us all right remember the holy ghost is literally god the father not a third person he's literally the same person the holy ghost and god the father are one and the same all right now go to uh if you've got your bible go to joel 2 27. i want you to see this this was a good thought that i put in the book as well that the i felt like the lord just just a simple little thought joel 2 27 28 29 i'm not going to read the whole thing but look on the day of pentecost what spirit did god promise to send the third person okay go to 28 yes okay so let's look at joel 2 28. does god say i'm in a poll i'm going to pour out a third person spirit now remember if the trinity's right these are separate persons that means they have separate spirits right the father is a separate personality jesus has a separate personality the holy ghost has a separate personality now the catholics will say the third person was poured out on the day of pentecost right but what jesus or what does the bible say the bible says it should come to pass i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh praise god not a third person spirit but my spirit and remember jesus kept calling this holy spirit the promise of my father the promise of my father and then paul said in first or second corinthians 6 he said god has said i will dwell in them i will walk in them i will receive them and i'll be a father unto them so god said i'm pouring out my spirit and then god said i will walk in them not a second person not a third person i myself the one person will walk in them church we are on the right side today praise god we are on the side of the bible today we don't add any words when the bible said god lives in us that's what we say god lives in us not a second person not a third person the one person of god lives in our souls amen if we're born again if not prove me show me a scripture where it says a third person lives inside of me you'll never find it trust me church you don't have to do it i want you to read your bible but you have to go searching for i've already done the searching for you the bible never says a third person lives inside of you the bible never says the second person lives inside of you the bible said god the father will live in you talk in you walk in you flow through you and anoint you it's the one person of god living inside of you amen now you can search all you want but i'm telling you you don't have to you're never going to find three persons in there thank god see church our our faith is rock solid jose knows that all the time he's been the message all the time we've been in the message this is rock solid nobody can even come close the only thing they can say is what we'll do probably next wednesday night because i want to go through uh the only thing they can say is well let us make man in our image and we're going to make our bow the plural pronouns that's all they can say well see that has to be three persons no it doesn't you cannot limit god right you cannot say well let us us it has to be two persons there no it doesn't that's with your human pee brain understanding right which we all have pea brains without the revelation of god right we're all tiny brain we're we're all just human we all fall short i forget to pray i forget to have everybody stand and read the text tonight you know we're just all human we all make mistakes but god's word is perfect this is the complete record of almighty god and not one word can change not one word fails amen so god can say let us and that still don't mean two persons us doesn't have to mean two persons it means two manifestations hallelujah because that's what the bible says right god was manifest in the flesh so that's what the word the word is manifest or appeared so god can have multiple appearances that can use plural pronouns and still not be separate persons because the bible doesn't say that all right now let's go to this thought i'm going to change thoughts now how many have ever were how many have ever heard the word modalism okay so trinitarians will call us modalists and while the definition is okay uh the actual word of the definition the dictionary the teaching of modalism is wrong so if somebody said are you a modalist i'd say no because the bible doesn't say all christians need to be modalists right so we i don't even use the word oneness i just say we believe god is one person because that's what the bible said his person because there's a lot of oneness people that believe tongues are the evidence of the holy ghost right we'll get to that in just a moment now uh modalism here's what it means in the dictionary it means that the doctrine that the three persons of the trinity represent only three modes or aspects of the divine revelation not distinct and co-equal persons in the divine nature so that's a good definition right we don't believe in co-equal persons okay we believe that the uh the three uh three manifestations are just three modes or manifestations of the one person okay so that the definition agrees with scripture but when you study it uh modalism which now remember modalism was declared a heresy in the fourth century at the council of nicaea so remember remember the nicene council 325 a.d constantine brought all these preachers in there he tried to get them all to come in one was arianism and one was modalism well they determined there that modalism was heresy so to say god just changed his mode you know they said that's heresy so modalism just became a bad word since then now again modalism has a lot of truth in it but it's not not all truth so we don't call ourselves a modalist we call ourselves holy ghost-filled christians that follow the prophetic ministry god gave to brother william branham at least that's what i tell people right we had somebody who asked me the other day and i told him that i said i followed the message of god gave to william branham the baptism holy ghost all the signs wonders and miracles are restored and all the mysteries of god are finished praise god who was that i can't remember now all right sorry okay so what's wrong with modalism here's what here's where modalism goes wrong they say that the father son holy ghost are identical in every way well that's not true because jesus says well the holy spirit and father are identical right the holy spirit and father are identical they're totally identical right because the holy ghost is just the father dwelling in your soul right and the holy ghost is invisible did you see the holy ghost when it flew into your soul no it's invisible is the father invisible yes so see the holy ghost and father one of the same but jesus was different right the father and son are not identical because of many reasons okay but the first i'll say it like this the father and son are not identical in their substance because the the son has he had flesh and flesh and blood the father never has flesh and blood never he will always be invisible whom no man can see nor can see remember we read that a few weeks ago for the sunday school two sundays ago no man has seen god nor can see god so god does not have flesh and blood but he made flesh and blood for his image to take it to the cross pay for our sins okay but now church let me say this the father and son are identical by nature there's that word or character did jesus ever sin no did the father ever sin no so they're identical in nature but different in substance amen see church i know we're splitting hairs but listen we got to do that because that's what satan does he gets in these little thoughts and he'll say well they're the same in substance and nature no they're not not the father not the father son father and son are different substance different nature i'm sorry same nature different substance see we have to go down there because the devil tries to squeeze a little bit of leaven in there he tries to hide a little eleven there in that in that dough right so we've got to go down to the very basics of the faith and we have to be able to rightly divide the word of truth but i'm glad we got the holy ghost here to rightly divide the word of truth to us see so modalism says there are all three are identical all three modes are identical that's not true they're identical by nature but not by substance okay all right and second okay i put a little thought in there i'm not sure i put that thought in there that may have been a mistake too and second modalism says the father suffered with jesus that's not true the bible said it please the lord to bruise satan i'm sorry to bruise jesus sorry that's an idea let's go let's read it isaiah 53 i don't have it but it just came in my heart it pleased so god was pleased now not in a way we think oh he was happy his son was dying not that kind of way but in a divine way in other words my plan is being fulfilled my son is obedient isaiah 53 i'm gonna have to just search for it real quick it won't be very hard to find ten all right yes thank you sweetie great job all right first time yeah i was looking at the bottom of the verse i thought but it's at the top of the verse okay verse 10 yet it pleased the lord to bruise him does that sound like he's being punished who could punish god the father who can make god suffer church nobody now we dramatize it right like brother ram dramatized it like the father was so hurt he had to turn away but that's brother bran that's that's him dramatizing okay just like when brother brown would dramatize how jesus uh had headaches and things that's not in the scripture there's no scripture that says jesus had a headache it's something brother man read out of a book it was a historical fiction book it was the prince of the house of david there it is that's not in the bible but brother ram dramatizes so we can we can feel like well jesus knows that when we get headaches he knows what we feel like so he'll heal us that's true but you'll never find that in scripture where jesus had a headache right you'll find where daniel suffered because the visions you'll find that but you won't find jesus suffering with a headache well brother i'm dramatized like the father had to now the father did have to turn away right because the father had to forsake jesus because jesus said my god my god why have you forsaken me so the father had to forsake him but the father didn't suffer because he doesn't have a physical body and god doesn't battle god doesn't have mind battles like we have oh i'm so sad for my son church god don't have my mind battles right see but modalism says all three suffered that's not true see and i had to go look that up but see that proves we're not modalists we're just holding ghostfield saints i mean i'm just one of them sister i'm just one of those holy ghost things what are you i'm one of them holy ghostfield saints i'm i'm i'm in the one of them church right right i'm not a modalist i'm not a trinitarian i'm a holy ghost-filled saint that believes everything the bible says about the godhead you're a good audience church i'm almost just give me 10 minutes here i'll be done if not probably going to pass out because i'm so tired here jose's going to have to pack me out to the van here no remember so jesus became a curse and god cannot be cursed god cannot curse himself now there is one more mystery brother jose there's one more mystery i'm going to share it with us here tonight jesus was the bible said the father sealed jesus his soul with the holy ghost now how then could he remove it that's a great mystery but he could because god cannot curse his own spirit unless this thought just came to me unless just the flesh was cursed that might be it but god god is a spirit he can't curse his own spirit in jesus so maybe he just put the curse on the flesh i don't know that's something left to talk about i'm looking for more revelation on that it's either that either god put the curse just on the body or he had to remove his spirit his spirit from jesus's soul which jesus never sinned jesus never had any unbelief so his soul wouldn't be lost although his soul did have to descend to hell for us so that's interesting that's a great that's a deep teaching there's some more deep things we can get into with with what happened to jesus's body soul and spirit right but the bible said plainly christ was made a curse for us he was made a curse he was cursed for us right the bible said god hath made him to be sin for us but didn't say which part i didn't say his soul was well i'm sorry his soul wasn't offering for sin yeah we're in isaiah 53. okay so that might open it up a little bit more maybe he had to remove the the seal from his soul his soul was made a offering for sin that was in verse 10 too okay good job yep so there i'm not sure yeah that's a great question there it's a great mystery we have to pray about that one the father could not curse himself because you cannot curse god if he's blessed right he he is the blessed and only potentate amen the immortal invisible the king of kings the holy king eternal praise god okay so see knowing all that jesus had to be cursed for us knowing all that modalism fails because the father did not suffer the father doesn't suffer the father doesn't get scared he doesn't get uh he doesn't worry like we he doesn't have mind battles like we have he does the father does not suffer the church said so see that's why motivism fails because they take it to such an uh such an extreme so let me say this born-again christians we don't need labels for our beliefs because they don't have labels in the book of acts they weren't arguing about modalism or trinitarianism in the book of acts so we don't need it right we just call ourselves holy ghost-filled christians and the bible said jesus will guide us into all truth amen now we're not oneness either because oneness has the same idea someone is teachers teach all three are the same and all three suffered but yet it's one person so see they have a lot of truth too but every one of this teacher is a little different that's what and they have they have a church they have a denomination called oneness did you know that you can go join the denomination of oneness it's a denomination is the bride ever going to be denominated what do you think no so see that's why we don't want to be a part of any of the denominational titles either right we just want to have the name mrs lord jesus christ amen i just want to be a holy ghost-filled saint i'm on my way to heaven i'm shouting the victory i'm a rapture sinking holy ghost-filled saying praise god that's all i am amen i'm one of those and my heart is turned uh my i'm a heart of the children and my heart is turned back to the pentecostal fathers hallelujah praise god now but they got five million people in their denomination i looked it up i put that in the book it's called the oneness united pentecostal church injure international five million people brother jose is that what your family family's in are they in the oneness upc okay not one that's okay okay well that's a big church right that's a five million people i don't know if there's five million the message and on the earth or not oh they say three okay that's a probably good estimate and shrinking right yeah because the fewer and fewer that be there find it sadly but their major error is with making tongues the evidence has nothing to do with uh godhead they have a few things wrong on the godhead right but they're major heirs saying you got to speak in tongues you got to get the gift before the all right so giver so silly i can't believe people believe that you've got to have the gift in order uh before the giver uh so silly so silly but don't believe it church just let's stand on the promises of god amen let's keep standing on the promises of god now let's start on let's start on the plural pronouns and then we'll finish then uh next week okay so get your bibles let's go to uh john 14 23 let's read john 14 23. so we know the bible never says god is three persons right and if you have father son holy ghost the holy ghost conceived jesus in the womb and jesus called the father father so that reduces it down to two persons if you're a trinitarian and if you actually actually you're honest with yourself in the bible but the bible never says god's two persons so the father and son now that we have left we have the father holy ghost left and son there so now we only have two persons left if we actually have honesty about the bible but since the bible never says god's two persons god must be one person so you must always look at plural pronouns or possessive determiners as uh they're just ways god can show jesus's flesh versus jesus's holy ghost anointing all right god never said i'm two persons okay john 14 23 if a man loved me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we we so now we have let us i'll get to let us later we have led us in genesis 1 26. now we have we father and son saying we will come unto him and make our abode our with him so we have we an hour sounds like more than one person right but is it does the bible say there's two persons no so it can't be two persons so that's john 14 23. so we have we and hour and church let me just be honest that's hard for me to understand i'm just being honest when i wrote this chapter it was a hard chapter to write but all i can say is that god never calls himself two persons that's when it all boils down to it but see we can't ignore these scriptures and say oh they're not in the bible sisterhood don't ask me that question sister sister virtue don't ask me that question right nature please don't ask me no we gotta look we gotta take every question they can give us right the little girls and the little boys eventually when zion and james get older and the big boys like malachi we gotta take questions right we can't be afraid of them okay all right go to john 17 21 now we see us we have we our and now let's see us another let us john 17 21 that they all may be one as thou father art and me and i in thee that they also may be one in us us okay so we is a plural pronoun and our is a positive determiner oh you know what i think i just got the revelation before uh before service i was up here praying i was actually writing with lydia in the car what is a noun it's a person place or thing so see a noun doesn't have to be a person it can be a thing and what was jesus he wasn't a separate person he was a manifestation or a thing right because the bible calls the holy ghost it the bible says when the when it when it fell upon them it right it didn't say person right it's a manifestation it thing it's something right it's something so a noun does it there it is a noun doesn't mean a person it can be a thing as well or a manifestation praise god amen now i wish i would have wrote that in the book but i didn't amen because that just came today see because a noun doesn't always mean person person place or thing or sometimes animal they say we know god is no animal right so it has to be a thing a manifestation all right now that's just my thought that just came today so i hope that's fresh i hope that i believe that's from the lord i could be wrong but i feel that was fresh so if god is not two or three persons why does he use plural pronouns like us and we and positive determiners like our the best answer i can say in the book is because jesus was both fully human and fully divine yet his human side was not totally divine okay therefore he had to use a separate pronoun for the part of him that was not divine you always had to show the difference between the divine the divine part and the human part so it had to be a thing that was not god amen praise god the body was a thing it wasn't a separate person it was the same person but a different appearance a different thing than the invisible person okay that's that's pretty deep i understand that that's even deep for me of course i mean i'm not very deep person but i'm just saying it's it's hard to understand all right so his body was mortal but god was immortal so let's do some opposites here okay so let's do some opposites jesus was tempted in his human will but god was not tempted so we need different we need different nouns right because this is god's image but god's image can now be tempted god's image is now mortal but god's not god's immortal let's keep doing some opposites jesus died but the father cannot die right jesus is a human flesh body but god is a spirit good good good opposites here we're getting down to some first grade teaching here we're talking about opposites today up down high low mad sad all these opposites so see because of these opposites we needed a separate pronoun to name the thing that's different than the holy person praise god yet jesus was not co-equal with the father because his flesh was not eternal right it wasn't perfect it wasn't divine jesus was not a co-equal separate person from the father he was the image of the father he was the father's it the father's thing the father's manifestation okay i know that sounds a little strange but it wasn't a separate person it was the image of his person and so jesus church he was a a manifestation unlike any others is my mic on okay there never was a manifestation like jesus and church there never will be even melchizedek was kind of like jesus but not really because melchizedek didn't come through a mother's womb he wasn't a little baby melchizedek hey little milk has it god bless you little guy you're so handsome no god just picked up that that that dust and made a body right you talked about that a while ago well think about the burning bush was that the same as jesus no jesus wasn't a fire he was a man right think about the rock and the wilderness where all that water poured out was that like jesus well no jesus wasn't a rock now living water flows out of jesus right thank god amen praise god hallelujah but the voice coming out of the burning bush well no jesus had a body and the voice just had fire so any man the angel the lord no that's angel wings yeah you know shine like the sun jesus body didn't sound like the sun unless he was transfigured right so see all these manifestations were totally different they all could go back to being god but this man stayed the same he stayed human and he came through a woman and he could die the other manifestations couldn't die this is the only one that could die and did die and die church in your place amen freely died in your place so this is why as i close this is why god has to use plural pronouns because this manifestation of jesus body is so much different than all the other manifestations how about the whirlwind god spoken to whirlwind to job was that like jesus no jesus wasn't a whirlwind he didn't get it the bible said he had no beauty we desire him people like to see whirlwinds i like to see whirlwinds they're they're pretty amazing right they're just amazing feats of nature but jesus body he was just there and you look at him and he's just a man just just a boring man until he started preaching until he started praying for the sick and calling for the dead to be raised amen he's just like a regular human no beauty not nothing and so see church let me close with this the reason god needs plural pronouns is because the truth is somewhere between these two extremes of father and son are two separate persons and the father and son are totally identical we need an in-between right so that's why we have to have plural pronouns because the truth is in the middle of the road right it's not on the extreme father and son are completely one it's not on the other extreme uh father and son have no oneness at all well they do have some oneness by the nature okay so two co-equal persons and then total oneness the truth is right in the middle it's not total oneness and it's not two separate persons it's right in the middle so god had to use plural pronouns to show the difference between jesus's humanity and jesus's deity which was god so in other words church the body of jesus did not create itself did you catch that jesus was not his own father jesus's body like your body everybody tap your body your body didn't make itself either right you didn't make yourself your parents made you right right through the act of the act of nature well same thing with jesus jesus didn't make himself the father made him the holy ghost made him amen same thing so see there's not the total oneness that jesus made his own body he didn't his father made the body or the holy ghost made the body so we have to have some place in the middle where we can show the difference between the father and the son okay i've often heard this statement it's true god is not one like your finger so that so that's that total oneness god is not totally one like your finger's one no because the body of jesus did not create itself right the body of jesus was not identical to the father it could die it could it could get sick right it could uh it could be tempted but god can never be tempted all right so god and christ are one but not but not like the trinity says and not like the oneness people say they're only one the way the bible says they're one and that's in their sinless holy nature praise god the father is the invisible spirit the son is the human temple of the father so church we are going to be the group remember the mark of the beast is going to come down to trinitarianism as well if you're a church and don't believe the trinity you're gonna have to take the mark of the beast but god will spare us from that we believe by the grace of god it's such a serious subject but church this subject proves that we will only use the pure words of god and we will not use satanic words can i say it like that because that really that's really what it boils down to if we're not using god's pure words we're using satan's perverted words let's stand to our feet every word of god is pure musicians can come that's what separates us from all other churches we only use the pure words of god to understand the godhead god changes manifestation god changes form yes i believe let us yes come and make our abode with us i believe that we will i believe we but i do not add anything outside the bible to that i must understand us we are using the bible only and i've been happy to do it these last night 20 years here 19 years very happy to do it 2001. oh yes 20 years now okay maybe 20 years in november praise god finally at the 20 mark brother jose praise god and that's what we've done we've stood here for 20 years some of us longer and we've stood on just the word of god and church we're happy to keep standing on it by the grace of god this will manifest who's the children of god and who's not those who keep the word only or those who add to the word so it proves we're the seed of god amen let's put our heads here for word of prayer church i hope this helped you tonight i know it was more teaching a little bit of preaching but i just want to encourage you that this bible is exactly right and we have the pure revelation of the godhead and let me just say like this church with our heads bound we're never going to convince some of these hell-bound trinitarians do you understand what i mean they are their serpentine many of them are serpentine few people are going to find it we'll never convince like like brother said you can't argue with the evil spirit but i'm preaching these things to strengthen your heart the bible calls it establishing your heart say hey okay establishing your hearts and truth praise god so that you have an answer so if anybody ever asks you you can say well my pastor can talk to my pastor about it you may not remember church i may not remember that's why i wrote the book so i could go back and remember but i was saying i can't remember everything this is what separates us [Music] let me god bless the live
