grace you know for in our lives so we're very thankful for that Revelation chapter to read our texts and pray for the tithes and offerings as well we're just going to look at verse 9 today and continue on this thought you know it's interesting where the Holy Spirit stopped us on wednesday night so i'm just going to pick up right there about the grace of the lord and continued on their feeling very inspired to the church ages i don't know about you but I'm feeling very inspired reading this book and it's inspiring my life and encouraging my heart and so many wonderful things that are being planted in our hearts and lives by the seed word of god first night let's read together one two three I know thy works and tribulation and poverty but thou art rich and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan let's just our heads will take a prayer for the tithes and offering as well everything on your heart just make it known unto God surely his presence is near what a friend we have in Jesus have any burdens or cares he's here today as your friend to minister to your needs Heavenly Father we love you this morning we thank you for your mercy and grace Lord we thank you for this reading of thy word you know our works tribulation poverty and yet you call us rich for Lord we want to be rich in spiritual things you want treasures in heaven Lord God not on earth but we want treasure in heaven Lord Jesus and I pray Lord you speak to us through thy word this morning Lord God comfort every heart Lord let us know again how much of a friend you are lord god you're there whenever we need you Lord God we must never be alone we must never forfeit all the blessings of speaking to our friend in prayer Lord all throughout each and every day Lord bless the tithes and offerings as well may they go to further your kingdom Lord we're grateful for each and every heart and soul that's here be with those Lord and may we all pull upon the holy spirit to receive what is needful for this hour bless every live streamers well Lord God may the Holy Spirit administer them as they open their hearts Lord is our brother parade earlier raise our faith Lord God we pray in Jesus Christ's name in the church said amen god bless should be in seated Oh Johnny you come get the basket but here by God's grace thank you sir how many happy to be the house of Lord today thank you sir that's you buddy thank you please go let's look at this thought and we look at the aspect of finances today you know with that thought about poverty so we're look at that and Malachi when you're ready we can switch over here by the grace of the Lord and I'll trust I'll be a blessing to you set my watch for about an hour here and try to control myself by God's grace so let's look at this thought here uh also has update I'm working on the marriage and divorce video I'm about halfway done with that it probably about two or three parts I'm almost halfway done with part one and making a lot of feedback this week I've got numerous emails and phone calls i went from Illinois phone call yesterday and overseas me a lot of encouraging things about people being blessed by the video the teaching ministry and a pastor from South America or South Africa sent me an email saying oh this is really helping me in my little congregation I thought well thank you Jesus you know this want to be faithful to the little gifts and talents you only places in each one of our lives you know sometimes I thought was strange why do you spend all this time on videos you know they're doing any good and then to hear that you know people say they'll never do this in again or they're they're they're they're convicted by this the sense of the Holy Spirit on the video I said praise the Lord of that you know there's a purpose behind it you know I think sometimes we just lose track of it you know so thank God for that I want to back up a little bit on what we looked at on us wednesday night okay so this is part four and i want to back up and look again at the the importance of the church age book i know i think sister Wendy told me she's now her to some series on the church ages pride three or four times Lester hard but it's really that important you could hear it three or four times and it's so crucial it's applicable to every every day of our lives because it tells the story of the church you know being prepared for the coming of the Lord it tells the story and hits the highlights and shows what they all go through by the grace of the Lord so let's look at Part for this morning by God's grace yeah now these are the quotes like I said from Wednesday brother BAM said these meetings were ordered the Lord in nineteen sixty he said he could have been out hunting or fishing or praying for the sick but he felt led to to preach these meetings so they were ordered of God I'm really there order to God so Graham said God place them upon my heart he said I don't get any extra money for preaching these so I thought you know God placed it on his heart to preach it as he placed it on your heart to read it I wonder about that so if you if you haven't started reading it I think I'll just trust the Holy Spirit will place it on your heart to read it and to go through it again by the grace of the Lord Ram said we're going to write in the yellow we're going to write a commentary on the seven churches is sent to all the world if we can because we're in the last days we're at the end time so I had a question was it sent to you it was sent to you praise God BAM said it never dawned upon my heart so much into the last election then I scene where we were at and that was the election of John Kennedy remember in he was nineteen sixty if i'm not mistaken and brother Ram so that's when I seen where we were at and the Holy Spirit began to reveal to me to warn the people and to place this so once brother BAM saw JFK elected he knew oh my the Roman Catholic Church is now controlling you getting control the United States that's exactly what happened in fact our Bible study on Tuesday night was really good and I brought that very point up there we were going through a the mark of the beast and how it's going to be unionized religion it's thus saith the Lord is going to be unionized religion you have to join some type of religious union and I just made that mention about how a revelation chapter 13 is the spirit of Rome and then the end of the chapter is the spirit of Rome in the United States and how to get the United States right here the founding fathers of the USA the pilgrims left Europe to escape the Roman Catholic Church and then they a few hundred years later they let the Roman Catholic Church back in and that's a shame because of the doctor in the Roman Catholic Church there might be sweet sincere people in there but their doctrines thoroughly wrong and it's the the the the doctrine is the cage of all unclean and hateful spirits the doctor now the people like I said my most of them are unaware of it they're ignorant of it but they got to come out of that by God's grace so we looked at that and then brother Branson for some time the Holy Spirit dead on my heart I couldn't shake away I had to go with it so he said I felt led to go to Jeff he'll write this book if i express this and it goes on riding after I'm gone the word will live on is it living in you it ought to be living in you praise God and he said in the name of Lord that's true i did not know all the revelations there in the seven church age book i'm going to skip ahead like I said minute this one over all this on Wednesday let's go quickly larrea I'm trying now to get a proof for it and make books out of it church ages seven books of the church age of seven tapes and make it such we can get it done as cheap as possible as we possibly can so everybody can get it now the Lord tarries and I move on you'll see that the things I've spoken name of Lord will be will be come to pass just as it was said never has failed yet and some of it has to happen later all right now program send the yellow you all seen in my book I like I call it my book it all be drawn out in the seven Church ages which he told me which I stand as a witness to God to be judged at that day of judgment for it it comes from God not from my thinking BAM said if you don't understand the church agency said wait till you get the book you'll understand it if you got any light in you at all immense there must be a magnificent light there must be a bunch of truth in this book praise God if you got any light in you you'll understand these mysteries these things these teachings now here's some new ones Ram said you have astounding picture here tonight that's going in that book of the three years how the Lord is let me draw it out on a blackboard and show just how the church ages would fail and when and how they would go up and down and as soon as the Lord finished that great angel Lorde that light just practically as many people standing here come right here the side wall standing here and people fainting and draw to ride out itself on the wall so he called this an astounding picture is that astound you this morning it ought to because this was the Holy Spirit that wrote this and he said this is a drew these pictures this was astounding because it shows us where we are we're at the last age 1906 we have just very little light left but the light we have is a beautiful light I'll tell you I enjoy walking in that light praise God amen it's a beautiful light there's a lot of light the beginning of the church ages when the church first are slowly got less and less and now we're another time a very very little light but there is still a true a true church of god today amen walk in the light the Prophet said in the future home in the past rather we study the seven seals of seven churches brother veil not working on those now faithfully to get them in book form so they're faithfully working on them have you faithfully read it that's what we're doing now that's why I feel led to preach it I know most people I probably haven't read it so I want to faithfully preach it by God's grace and the Prophet said back through these seven Church ages there were seven hidden gem or ministries I'm writing a book of it and he says in harvest time I'm writing a book my commentary on the first four chapters of Revelation hope to have out pretty soon to be a large book they have a brochure of each age now look here I like this one he said I got a special book coming out pretty soon the lord willing is special to you amen this layer to see the show it's already over that she's already sealed in there and Christ is on the outside amen a special book program tells here each of the messenger the age back to the word the message of their age the message of according to the Bible I've got coming a book out of that the commentary the first four chapters of Revelation read it soon as we get it unpressed and it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt what Luther's message was justification what sanctification is the next process is the natural birth and then come the Pentecostals exactly have your edit he said read it as soon as it comes out have you read it but I said I know you'll want to get them books because they answer a lot of questions that's been in your hearts praise God he said you all seen my book and we all draw it out in the seven churches which he told me which I stand by as a witness to God to be judged at the day of judgment for it come from God not for my thinking so the inspiration came from God shouldn't we endeavor to read it praise God so I want to say this on my notes I hope each believer feels a poll to read this book uh free copies are available to all like I was a mentioned a sister Naomi apologize if I haven't said that but all the books out there on the bookshelf all free other tracks the book sermon books program that's all free when it gets empty I'll fill back up by the grace of the Lord but that's for you that's for you to witness that's for you to enjoy take a book for yourself I've probably taken two or three these in the process of taking them I give them out to somebody that I get another one so that's what they're there for they're there for you to use it there for you to feed on by God's grace so I want to bring this as kind of like a check if you haven't read this book what books have you read that are more important than this book that God ordered and will help take away any shadow of doubt about the word all of our revelations this book will take away the shadow of a doubt about that what books have you been reading because your character is molded to whatever you want to read you'll become whatever you watch or whatever you read you know not everybody can read but God invented reading and languages for a purpose because reading slows you down and reading has been scientifically proven that's why they teach it at school so often of course readings are improving up to slow down your minds you have to really focus on that idea and that thought and you learn best by reading you can of course learn by watching but it's actually better to learn by reading as far as you can retain it longer but it's so critical so whatever you read or whatever you watch that's what you'll become rubberband tells us is that about Abraham Lincoln I'm gonna skip down here Abraham Lincoln grew up splitting rails he was really poor riding in the dirt and so forth and the only books I'm sorry par me and the only books that we believe Lincoln ever had until he was 21 years old was the Bible and Fox the book of martyrs and that's what molded that character he said let me see what you read let me go in your office in your house and see what you read and I'll tell you what you are it's quite a statement isn't it let me go watch let me go on your youtube history let me watch what you let me see what you watch and I'll tell you what you are praise God that's right see everything's with nature and you keep the Bible and look at this he tells the parents and the parents listen you keep the Bible laying close for your children read it yourself be an example so parents Romans last time you read the Bible in front of your children Oh this morning or hopefully last night my man tells it he said lay it close to you let your children see you reading the Bible that's what I didn't have in my younger life for the RAM said but by God's grace I want to put that before my children and if there's another generation may they put it before theirs as well remember all the revelations were thus saith the Lord I've gone this part now three sermons in a row the church changes plus the history plus the word all blend together and the revelation and the vision and interpretation is thus saith the Lord so we'd have to wonder about these things there thus saith the Lord now here's what I want to get some into some new quotes maybe you haven't thought about many conditions of each age are applicable for every age including our age for example by mam says what Christ was in the first age he is to all ages to every believer he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever what he did once he's still doing it will keep on doing i want to skip into this one now it says that the Spirit is speaking to the churches that is plural not singular the spirit did not have John write this down for a local Ephesian Church nor for the first age only it is for all church ages this is for all church ages let every age take heed for what is going on here is only the start that little tree that was plan is going to grow its going to grow through the ages and then this this then is a message for every Christian throughout every age until Jesus comes yes it is for the Spirit speaking now here's one example suffering we've been looking at this we look at this last Sunday and the Sun will be the Sunday before now this special condition of suffering in Samara must be applied to uh every age there's no age free from suffering we almost suffer as Christians there's no true believer free from it now remember like we said last Sunday God might commit you to suffer in a different way than me but we all will suffer for the name of Jesus Christ yours might look different than mine mine of course might be different from yours but we all will suffer no true believer is free from it this is of God this is the will of God it is needful we need the Lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be christ-like and doing it if you don't have the grace to bite your lip and hard times are suffering then you need more grace a man they say like that when we go through suffering we're not to complain or not the murmur we're not to pity ourselves and say woe is me were to suffer with christ-like character love suffereth long and is kind the Bible says notice how organization breeds hatred now that goes in the same idea of bitterness as well it destroys fellowship it makes bitterness that's what mer means is what summer know was full of bitterness a root of bitterness the files many so more and more defilement was coming in every age would feel its cars so that bitterness that that hatred that's suffering see these are whatever happened the beginning we feel the effects of it today because that Antichrist spirit keeps moving and advancing but the Spirit of Christ keeps moves moving in advancing as well hallelujah so see we feel the effects of that sometimes does it can't you feel a little bitterness maybe in people's lives or how about your life ever feel a little bitterness in your life towards your your member in the church or our spouse or like even a few weeks ago we might feel bitter towards God you might feel bitter towards your family or some of your children or something but see that's leftover that's part of the experience of a Christian we've got to overcome bitterness amen now because all the trials are for every age as well so are the rewards for every age as well the Bible said to him that overcometh I grantee the tree of life and I'm skipping ahead this is the future reward to all overcomers of all ages hallelujah now i'm using this quote now from how can overcome now later sia that's the last church age there's going to be some overcomers in there watch here they remember each church age the one preceding it inherits all that the other ones offered I'm gonna believe that if you don't take that church age to help you right now it's really quite awful because and uh then only the first age gets the tree of life which is Christ only the second age is not heard of the second death which is what the lake of fire so see you must you must apply all the rewards to every age and you must apply all the trials to every age as well you experience some of them in a portion in every Church age praise God so those are all the rewards how many looking forward to the rewards of God the hidden manna the white stone with a new name the morning star which is Christ clothed in white raiment eternal life name not blotted out of the book of life name confessed before Jesus's father and his angels make him a pillar in the temple my god Christ right upon you his new name hallelujah and Ra Ra JH grant to sit with christ in his throne hallelujah how many looking forward to the rewards of God amen now those are all to every age if you overcome in your age you inherit all the others but what is its Christ sharing a portion revealing a portion of himself to every single Church age what every believer gets all of Christ amen hallelujah now let's go a little more here this morning i was praying i was asking God you know and I started saying this is my prayer cause I said lord if you could just prove to me that you love me by answering this prayer and then this quote came right to my mind I just preached it on Wednesday night how shall I prove my love to him I'm so I'm praying I lord if you could just answer this one prayer it would prove to me that you love me I've had to say forgive me Lord I just preach it on Wednesday how did how do you prove your love to God by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy midst the trials that he has in his wisdom allows to come to pass now the quote i was thinking of I'm sorry was a different court wasn't this quote forgive me the other court I was thinking of was a different quote where brother have said how should we know that he loves us he said because of his love is elective love the very fact he's called us to the word shows he loves us because God says so for God so loved amen and while we were yet sinners Christ died for us he loved us first amen so there's actually the other quote but this is what I was what I want to get to how can I prove my love to Christ by being joyful and praising him and loving him in the midst of my trial that will prove to Christ that you love him amen in other words we don't get discouraged again we don't backbite we don't complain we don't feel have self-pity and feel sorry for ourselves and say woe is me we def joined the midst of our trial and know that it will work out for God's glory no here's one look at again I want to go on this thought of poverty and finances this morning it's come up on numerous levels as I've gone through out the last few weeks so I'm gonna look a little bit finances and money this morning by God's grace because Jesus says I know thy poverty but thou art rich he said there it is again see him walking up and down the midst of the church like a father he's looking down upon his family he's the head of the household he is the provider who sure who's your provider this morning is it uh is it copy fairlawn city schools like me who's your provider Jesus Christ is our provider he's the protector you might have a nice alarm system or you might have invisible fence or something like that that's not your real protector God's your protector yet Christ looks on at their poverty so there's a bunch of poor Christians in the Smyrna church age and Christ says I know your poverty and he lets them remain poor oh how the untutored believer stumbles at this and church I've talked to numerous people the last year's they stumble and God lets somebody suffer they stumble they say how could there be a holy God how could there be a holy God how could there not be a holy God how could there not be as a parent and you learn as a parent if you baby your children they're going to be a bunch of babies forever you've got some point now let them struggle and suffer and learn hard work and the benefits of of trial and error right they got to let them suffer and work hard like I learned you know that's why sports was a good teacher for me now isn't everybody but we learn like you don't win games by being a baby and being a win you got to work hard and put some effort into it or else the enemy is going to knock you over well that's a natural what about the spiritual if we don't learn how to pray and seek God and overcome the devil the devil is going to knock us out so God lets us go through trials so we'll learn to depend upon him amen how so see they they stumble at that how can God bear to look down upon his his own in a time of need and not just stop at all just give in and lavish everything material upon them how can God do that how can let God let Christians be poor how can God let Christians die well part of it is because it's a testimony for them right your testimony will be expressed all throughout eternity you'll be singing about the testimony remember the 144,000 are given a song in heaven that no one can sing accept them so your trials will produce a testimony that you'll sing all throughout eternity praise God Amen right and no man or no angel no person can learn the song to the 144,000 because their song goes something like this Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a blinded you like me right I once was lost in blindness but now I'm found I'm sealed by the Holy Ghost I see something along those lines that's pretty silly silly my lyrics but you get it they have a song that they can sing that no one else can sing praise God and you've got to have tests and trials that you overcome so that you can have a testimony
