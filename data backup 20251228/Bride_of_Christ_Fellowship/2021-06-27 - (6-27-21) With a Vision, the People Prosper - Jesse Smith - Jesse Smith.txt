========================================

got that song from right that was john wesley john wesley he said live so on fire for god that the world will see the smoking come watch me burn remember they kicked him out of the churches but so he had to go out into the fields and preach the tens of thousands they never thought they could do it but god would anoint their voice to be louder so people could hear oh i've been touched by a fire let them come watch me burn for jesus hallelujah praise god god bless everybody we just like to take about maybe 10 minutes and just show a little slideshow of of uh some of our pictures over the years you know we've had this wonderful fellowship here for about 15 years give me just a second here i got to find the file and i just added you know i showed a little i showed most of it on friday but i knew i had to start friday because i'm a procrastinator sometimes and so i had to start a friday i had to tell everybody i'm going to show up friday right uh and then that got me started on it and that way i could finish it like last night okay so praise the lord so 15 years we're thankful for god's amazing grace i won't be as long as i was friday okay on friday i really took a lot of time and i kind of shared about each picture we'll just probably laugh smile cry you know we'll probably look at some of those pictures and uh just thank the lord for all god's done for us so i i i actually i actually made this in 2016 but i never showed it because i just i procrastinated and i never finished it sorry for having mic or audio trouble here so it's something to do with my mic sorry this wireless mic it probably gets abused as i'm preaching i'm probably like swinging and punching and preaching and i probably abuse it so forgive me uh but anyways i procrastinated i never showed it in 2016 so i thought well here we are five years later perhaps i could finally show it so i started working on it hour at a time so november 22nd 2002 that's me with my long hair there simon had just heard the message uh in september september october november so three months later he said jesse you got to listen this sermon called serpent seed you gotta listen to two seeds and that's what started it so that night that was thanksgiving night that night we drove back to akron he played two seeds for me and i believe the message from that moment on i had struggles i had doubts but that was the moment my heart changed i said wow i've never heard preaching like this the preaching that we preach today by god's grace so thank god for brother simon so long ago as before cam was married you know i was right betsy and dustin had just got married no i'm sorry they hadn't been married no they had that was a year later so two years later we started having that was the very first saturday night house service it was just an outreach it wasn't official church yet brother brooks told tim myers to start having churches see if people get saved so those are the first few people i witnessed to her in a class and one her to the lord sister carrie she's now in florida as a messenger believer tim myers witnessed the sister lisa and they're now message believers in michigan by god's grace and so uh everybody played a part right to win souls how many want to win more souls for god i just said lord send me to send me the soul so i can witness to him like yesterday that catholic man we talked to but he wasn't interested i tried to share you know we have a higher message than the chapel we have a higher message in the catholic church but he wasn't interested so much in that tim myers now he's left the message now but he did believe the message eyewitness to him um and i show him about the water baptism he started out really on fire for the message but just last year he fell away from the message he doesn't believe it anymore like his father-in-law tim humes they don't believe it anymore but i still want to give credit because he had a lot of courage to start these services and he'll always be my brother praise god we we always disagree you know about brother branham i believe he's a true prophet but but tim doesn't anymore that's okay um i'm praying for him and so we would always we it was just so we were new christians on fire for the message we just love to dance and and this is a video we just love to dance and sing so instead of going to the movies and the world and the parties you know we would just come together and sing and praise god we would just sing all night and just praise the lord it was just so wonderful to us we had some baptisms there's devon now divine was the one that witnessed the brother bang and invited brother vang to the bible studies that's when kerry got baptized now these friends they're wonderful but they fell away as far as following the message but they did believe water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ there's brother brooks my first pastor in the message and brother john now in michigan brother brooks now in iowa he sent a text to me this morning asking the lord to bless our services praise god there's brother simon faithful evangelist there's brother randy brother craig taught me all the word we'll get to that a little bit there's brother tim so this was on a saturday while i was off playing football in 2003 they were having house services so that's kind of how this move got started here now a couple years later we felt led to start a church tim had moved down to north carolina brother brooks thought he'd be the pastor but he moved down there and so everybody voted me and i got uh seven votes to be the pastor seven out of seven and so i've been the pastor this whole time so we're thankful for god's grace our first services were in our houses we had wednesday nights that's my house in calgary falls but then sundays we'd have them at john's house because john's house was a little bit bigger so we'd have so we drive 30 minutes south to canton for services on sunday wednesday night have them at my house in calgary falls just real small uh living room we just had services there just we just squeezed as many chairs as we could uh there's brother vang there's brother banger he's giving himself bunny ears there that's why i told you i said i told him yesterday i said we got some good pictures of you brother man we you know we baptized these guys i met this guy on the job baptized him he and his wife they hung around for a few months but then he said i don't want this he went back to video games back to sports uh kind of fell away but when we met him he just ate up the message for a while but you know the devil likes to come in and steal that seed but you know we just keep moving on as you know preston onward the bible jesus said you throw a net out and you bring it in right and some of it's good some of it's good salmon praise god but then some of it's wiggle tails and spiders and slugs and they kind of all crawl back and we're not name calling but we realize all that the father has given me will come to me so all the real saints stay with the word of god that's just a picture of us there our brothers and the sisters there that wonderful night that was at barberton lake and i remember that brother bank and then we found out later you can't baptize there so we stopped baptizing there there's brother bang always that notice bang's always holding the babies okay he's always he's got a real love for the children he's a real daddy that's brother craig he's the one that taught me the word this is at john's house where we started the church at brother john's house down in canton this is on a wednesday night look everybody's tired but uh we started the church with seven adults one two three four five six and then me seven taking the picture we saw you yesterday that was great to see her we baptized coo and yua uh then chang was baptized by another preacher in the name of lord jesus christ we baptize divine there's one time bang doesn't have a child there there's one time he didn't have a child i'm just kidding okay no more jokes buddy forgive me but there's a lady carrying out a lady was a she stole the message a lady got kind of tempted away from the world and fell away but she would fast and shout and scream and praise god it was just it was a really sad thing when she fell away must have never went into the baptism of the holy ghost but we still pray for her and i still email her from time to time just saying you're always welcome to come back i don't hear back but i still email from time to time so there's little baby lydia there's baby male guy just a little bit bigger now just a little bit bigger now 2007 sister who was baptized praise god i still remember that day wonderful day same place we baptized last sunday night we're baptized victoria uh there's brother vang again there's coup and elijah and javon that beautiful day there there's the sisters there bo and zerno bo and zur had a great testimony we baptized them in december 2006. we went down to that place in december i think it was 25 degrees that day and they had enough faith to go down there be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ just just some really real bible faith that's real bible faith when you don't look at the conditions you look at the word and you say i want to obey the word so you know where and i i just heard back i emailed zur a few week on her birthday last week and heard back from her and she's wanting to come back we just got to pray and ask the lord to bring her back by god's grace sister beau of course goes with adam to brother uh samuels in sheffield so we love them by god's grace um okay i'm not gonna play this but we we uh we carried this woman down here in october of 2007 two months before she died we baptized sister marge in the name of the lord jesus christ two months before she died and we counted the privilege to do that uh that's a picture shortly before she passed away maybe a couple weeks before she passed away um and there's again the church at brother uh john's house he was a messenger believer of just visiting and brother sesame he moved away but he was a college student at the university of akron he come for like two years i told him i said brother one day i'm going to baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ but i haven't yet so i'm still waiting hallelujah there's brother vang and nia there's near our first picture of nina there for the cam preached for us there brother john's house uh there's again back at my house all right brother brooks there's brother brooks there my god grace i gotta catch myself there there we go and i show this one because brother james is a he was the pastor at sheffield for many years he started a church in sheffield they're still going strong he passed away a number of years ago but before we started this church i went to james and i said brother we might start a church what do you what what should you what should i know about being a church and he said some of the wisest words he said he said remember you are the church don't count on anybody else you're the church because they rented out a ymca for like 20 years until god gave them that beautiful church where they have now that church that used to be there one to sell it real cheap they got a beautiful deal on it they got the grand piano and everything it was it was just the hand of god and uh and then i asked him brother i said you're an older preacher what would you tell me he said he said take care of your body he said i didn't take care of my body for all those years i've got all this heart trouble that's what he died of he died of heart trouble he said take care of your body he said if i would have took care of my body now and ate the right food he said i could be out on the missionary fields right now and he told me that a few years before he dies that's why i exercise that's why i try to take care of my body i lift some weights just light weights you know but i run and i do tae kwon dokes i want to take care of my body so if the lord tarries i can be preaching when i'm 70 when i'm 80. hey brother bosworth did it i can do it too praise god hallelujah i hope everybody has that same desire take care of your temple it's not your body it's the temple the holy ghost praise god the first place we rented was on mo drive just a few miles from where jose used to live and he didn't even know about this church we didn't we didn't even know it but we were just a couple miles away from brother jose's house uh first rental here let's go to some pictures there's a thanksgiving service brother bang was giving his testimony carrying a lady we're giving a song special that thanks it was a thanksgiving morning i think we had a service that was another church picture now this was when i was when brother cam felt led that i was brother cam's pastor i was brother simon's pastor they drove three hours every sunday to come to our church for about a year and a half then i felt that i said brother cam you need to be a pastor you guys need to start a church over there because their whole church was was driving over to see us three hours every week i was like well you i said that's a good thing but you can't keep that up forever so i said bro let's start a church over there and so we prayed and fasted and everybody voted for cam to be the pastor praise god and he's stood there faithfully since 2009. that's 12 years 12 years he stood like a rock our precious brother there so thank you so uh marge was sister kathy's mom's that sister kathy for a certain reason you know we had a little disagreement she doesn't come to the church now but uh she used to come very faithfully uh but her uh she she urged her mom to be baptized right before she died and that's for the man we carried her down there to baptize her praise god in the name of the lord jesus christ there's just some you know screenshots or shots of worshiping there at that first rental sister wendy giving us something special now she wasn't coming our church yet but she was just visiting there sister lady and all the saints there but tim visited us he's the one that started the whole the meetings right back in 2003 we had him up preach for us 2009 we moved in a different place this was bigger but not as nice it was a very run-down room now that's insulation on top because the sanctuary used to be a wine cellar and we believe the spiritual wine was poured out there by god's grace many times we thank the lord for that that's the view from the pulpit just a little storage room there sunday school the floor was unfinished we just never felt led to finish it once cam and simon moved back we didn't have enough ties to keep that place anymore so we moved into a little smaller location in 2010. we just jammed in this real tiny space there's a sunday school class up there my dad helped build the walls of that first i'm sorry that second third rental location sorry third rental location so i my wife teaching sunday school uh there's lydia lydia has a sunbeam for jesus there she's got a mask on for jesus there's brother bang bo and zur uh cam and uh julia when they visited preaching i got a closer picture brother cam he was already pastored same same group there a little bit better picture brother matt we witnessed to him and there's a little testimony behind that but he's out minnesota now sunday school or some sunday school students there singing and praising the lord and i'm sorry i'm going to go back it was at that i'm just going to share this man okay it was at that church malachi had a dream he was in the sanctuary sitting he moved up to the piano then he moved up to the pulpit so so far we've seen him fulfill sitting in church and moving up to the piano i don't know if that means he's going to song lead or preach so we'll see no pressure i can't stop you can nobody can stop what god is ordained but we've seen him now who would have thought this the fact that our children have music gifts makes no sense because our family doesn't have any music gifs kristen she sings but i'm talking about instruments so the fact that you know we've had you know julia ask us how do your children do those song specials you guys train them up i'm not we're like not really they just kind of all work by the lydia's leading and malachi and kesha the gifts the gifts of the holy ghost in their own lives it's not like we're like watching every moment we just kind of sit back and watch and the holy ghost is guiding them so god has a plan for every life praise god 2013 we met brother jose he's not here today but i took a picture the first time he came he he went he was raised in a church that believed brother branham had to come back before the rapture and travel around the world but he came to our church and god delivered him out of that return ministry and now he's only looking for jesus christ to return so it's a great testimony for brother jose and 2013 brother loris sister karen cain now they've laura since has left the message karen i believe still believes um but we just need to pray for her and then we met brother adam out of the marine corps right god called god say brother adam in the message out of the marine corps through sister beau uh meeting on on a chat line or a chat group online and as a marine he just heard the word and believed it right away so we're thankful for him he was a deacon for us we're thankful for that there's right then before they got married i baptized brother adam by god's grace 2014 we met for the amen by god's grace i love his shirt there must be something real and he was raised in the nomination but when we come this message he found something real praise god so very thankful for that and then see you again praise god very thankful that was a very a wonderful day i still remember that day i got to see all the family and the saints there just a little longer after that a little later after that for the jose and brother amen there there so that little church there before we moved i remember i remember sister sia came and she was really sincere praying i just i loved that picture she was seeking god you know she crossed the ocean to be married to this man and bring forth uh children to the lord i thought what a great testimony there she is on the altar of god praying and of course we had brother we had the brother brother steve sister wendy sister bo praying there after service i just i felt led to take a picture that time i just i really enjoyed people seeking god their sister sia she has always loved our babies one time she took one of my children and she was kind of joking she walked like she was going to take my child home in her van and so i'm waiting when james will let me hold him i'm going to do that same thing i'm saying hey james you're calling home with me buddy she's such a wonderful sister in the lord thanks god and then to 2015 we moved over here uh we had uh sonny brady andy rayburn supporting us you know with the ties we ran out of room in that tiny little hole in the wall where we're having church and so we come out here karen sister karen found this place it was 50 off per square feet and the landlord has kept us at that rate now we have the inflation rate every year goes up a little bit but just finding this place was a tremendous blessing and so it was all messed up you know we've uh loris came and painted for us i remember that karen painted the bathrooms maokai's painting the uh the pastor's office lydia paying the pastor's office uh casey was painting the nursery there everybody doing their little part we took out all the children rolled up the uh the old carpet it was all dirty and soaked and then we dedicated the church where the brooks came to dedicate the church there by the grace of the lord we've had wonderful services since then praise god wonderful times in the lord uh then virtue came on the scene there's nature and virtue came on the scene there that's the baby virtue right there so for some reason i don't have one of baby eden so forgive me i just oh yeah when i was going through all my pictures this week about half of them wouldn't show up on my computer so i don't know i probably have way more but this is the best i could find for some reason they weren't showing up uh sunday school there with the bradys and the raber children uh we're showing how we we brother bam says we hang over hell on every chain of god's promise that means that chain will not be broken that chain will hold praise god our anchor will hold so we taught the children that that and these are all the all the scriptures brother man taught us from the bible they're all chained together to give us a strong chain praise god and that chain will hold us praise god then we had our 13th anniversary i had brother brooks he was my first pastor he baptized me he married my wife and i in the wedding ceremony he dedicated lydia i got filled with the holy ghost under his ministry he ordained me to be a pastor ordered me to be a preacher he's like a father figure and brother craig he was the bible study he just taught me everything i knew right in the scripture he showed me everything right in the scripture uh 2016. wendy's there now yeah and wendy their sister dede from albion casey was starting to get into her gifts of music there brother jim brother loris amen and i austin got baptized in 2016. still praying for him to come back that's brother austin there so praying for him to come back he said he wants to he's on probation out in arizona so we'll just keep praying for him by the grace god brother adam visited that's a great testimony because acacia started praying for him and after a couple years he got delivered from all of his drugs and so we were just planning for him to come out and give his testimony then covet struck and we just haven't been in touch since then but i still want to get him out here cam and simon have prayed for him and the demons have physically left him they physically left him they heard the screaming and everything um so that's my cousin we're the same age we both graduated 1999 same age well that's just a funny one in my wife i just put that in there she was doing the roller blades one day socks i just was joking around with her with that one that's when lydia was baptized because i can't roller blade i'm a little a little scared on rollerblades for some reason i don't i skate i don't roll the blades i just joking with my wife that was when lydia was baptized praise god that's a beautiful testimony uh i'm not gonna play all that okay she was baptized on the same day some beautiful testimonies there that was uh eden's dedication right yeah yeah cause there's virtue so i found some videos uh but i'm not gonna play the whole thing but that was when eden was dedicated over in the other sanctuary there by god's grace uh we 2017 we first visited jeffersonville that's just brother jose and i went alone the first time and that was the time he wanted to be re-baptized because he was baptized the right way but in the return ministry right with the wrong idea and so on that trip i went we went down to the ohio river and i baptized him right there where the holy ghost come down as a pillar of fire i baptized him right there in the name of the lord i was he just wanted to rededicate his heart to the lord that was just a beautiful time there's the uh shim's candy brother ram like those hot red hots red hats and shortly after that we baptize haven a beautiful testimony there to the lord and esther we baptize esther there by god's grace always i just found this one a jose singing song special i appreciate it ministers mother benjamin justin would visit every now and then he got married as a child now the cam's faithful ministry uh benjamin came numerous times and just still praying for him to come back to the lord adam visited a couple years later with his wife and they were so kind they took us out to eat they gave us like two hundred dollars in gift cards you know and uh god had delivered him and there's a case she's one she writes she wrote him all the letters so keisha has a big part in that testimony just always writing him letters and urging him to get victory and he finally did by the grace of the lord now i shared this one because the this was the last time i seen tim myers before he left the message that's the same guy who started our services but that's when i preached for his father-in-law on december 31st 2017 his dad said it was one of the greatest sermons or greatest services they've ever had at their entire church i preach on the waters of separation how you got to get past the outer court holiest of holies and get into the baptism of the holy ghost the whole church malachi might remember that he might remember the whole church was at the altar weeping and screaming and crying for mercy and deliverance it was just a tremendous time but then two three years three years later they left the message so it's just it's striking how the enemy can get in there but we're standing on the truth and we still love them we'll still pray for them 2018 one of our founding members john left there's brother vang and sia but amen different ones saying goodbye put that one up there because there's sister karen i didn't have the only picture i could find of our suppression sister there uh brother jose saying goodbye there's oh yeah there's brenda that's one picture i had a brent i just you know i need to take more pictures everybody remind me after service we need to take some more pictures so we can remember then uh that year brother william got to go uh to jeffersonville we had a wonderful time with brother aaron now of course he's kind of went to the joseph's side now we still love brother aaron steven's brother pray for him but for that time he was he was my biggest amen corner for about a year and a half you all remember his loud voice right so just pray for him and i don't know he went from he was in joseph came to us and went back to joseph so i don't know what happened but we love him and our prayers are powerful so let's just pray for him by god's grace so brother william got to get some red hots did you eat all those brother i i ate a bunch too by god's grace and there we are at the branham tabernacle there's a cornerstone yep eagle but we met the pulpit there no church not to me i don't worship brother branham i don't worship jeffersonville but i like to go where god first vindicated this message because that's kind of like where i can go there and say wow i'm preaching i'm the fruits of what he preached right because the bible says the word of god comes to the prophet and then the prophet teaches others and from out of there comes the word of the lord and i'm just what genera i'm just two generations after god's prophet that he said there or maybe one generation whatever you're going to say but i'm very thankful to preach this message that's why it means so much to me i only worship jesus christ but i like to go and say wow this is where jesus christ worked this is where he brought the revelation there we are voice of god again uh that's right before william left the last time but now he's back two years later so we're very thankful for that by god's grace there's a good picture wendy took this i think i was i must have been out preaching somewhere because i'm not in any of these pictures we had sister connie i had the joy of having her for a couple years but she ended up she she moved up here because she believed our teaching about the squeeze because we believe in the squeeze we don't know what what it will be but the churches some of the churches in florida where she was going they believed they were already in the squeeze and she's like this ain't the squeeze it's not the squeeze there's really no pressure right like like the squeeze is talked about so she moved up here she left everything but then she got sick and uh she started missing her grandchildren so then she moved back so uh but we certainly love sister connie but there's a nice little picture uh right it was right after genevieve was born is their sister randy getting in on the selfie there great picture there remember we had the flooding remember we had the flooding and we went over to the ymca for a month or two that's when brother amen and brother maokai kind of started coming together that's actually when loris left and god brought you guys together to be this team and add lydia and we'll see who else the lord adds by god's grace uh so we met there remember her sister what was her name sister tanya she got healed we prayed for god she couldn't move her arm god healed her arm later that night at home we took the keys to the kingdom and god healed her but then the drive became too much i said sister i said you got to let your hair grow and she says i know i just can't do it and i said well what can you do you know people don't want to obey the word of god what can you do just just love them right but anyways her her thing was was too far she lived in new philadelphia which was an hour and a half and uh just uh unable to come so she said so then we baptized carrots in the name of the lord dedicated genevieve my mother-in-law got to come that's what i appreciate about my mother-in-law although she's been married three times we're praying for mercy we prayed for her on friday night right we sighed and cried for her soul on friday night and the fact that she'll come in here she'll wear a dress right she even wear a dress and come hear me preach just trusting god to bring her to repentance but we sure appreciate her help and naomi sent me these look how sweet eden was eden was kissing genevieve there i thought that's a good ill that's a good uh symbolism of our church right everybody loves everybody at our church right no matter how old how young no matter skin color we love everybody here because we're all christians praise god i just thought that's a beautiful picture there then we had sister connie again for a thanksgiving meal a couple years ago and she was just real shy she wouldn't even she would never look at the camera every time i tried to take a picture of her she would never look at the camera that's how my dad is dude he don't look at the camera neither does my mom 2019 but adam came back that was really great another great reunion with him brother keith randolph yep and then there's brother stephen i had to get a steven picture there like i was great so we got to get a picture brother we got to get sick oh yeah there's lily there's something all right yeah i think that was a brother's picture except lily and jen kind of snuck in there that's okay we like having them in there uh then just we were practicing at our house i think we had a music practice that night just get some oh yeah good testimony here but now this brother came to the message in 2016 through through adam adam demoline my cousin he was shot by a cop on purpose and won the court ruling the cop targeted him on purpose paralyzed him for life he was filled with bitterness simon brought the message to him and the king james bible and he went and instantly got rid of the lawsuit and on national tv he said i've been taught true repentance through the king james bible and this police officer deserves forgiveness just like anybody else and he said all because of the king james version bible and this message that god has sent us praise god and just so you know on friday night he was giving his testimony to my brother sam and his brother-in-law the very hour we were crying out their names in prayer i don't know i don't remember on friday night i was praying for sam sam jr and he just texted me that yesterday he and i were texting last night and he said brother i got to he said i got to look your brother sam right in the eye and tell him in front of all these hundreds of men giving his testimony on friday night i said brother what time was that he said 7 30 that was the very hour we started praying we prayed for 45 minutes on friday night and i said that was such an encouragement so church let's just keep praying let's see if god will save some more souls by the grace of god but i put him in my book under the parable the new book coming out under the parable of the unmerciful servant where jesus forgives ten thousand but others won't forgive i put his name in there as one of the most powerful testimonies of forgiveness for giving a police officer who purposely shot him and i have that i have the whole testimony on youtube if you want to watch it oh yeah and this was a little video i i kind of snuck in there this was a couple years ago this is when amen and started gathering all the kids in there after service just worshiping there's wendy and it was just like the shout of the king came back to the church you know so i just wanted to share that that meant a lot to me 2019. in 2020 this was covet year right coven my brother randy had he did a tremendous job when i got sick with colvin he came and preached four sermons in a row i've never done that and so god really knowing today we're having him back in august by god's grace just love brother randy uh just another one of jose i just whatever ones i could find with church people this is when the walkers left they came visit us they moved out to arizona they were very faithful in our church for a couple years there that's all the girls crying when esther left there so i just put a few more pictures on there i thought you'd like that was right after they announced covet the sunday after they announced covet and shutdowns by the side of it coming for each of us we didn't have any masks on people like why don't you have a mask

keepeth the law happy is he so notice what's the vision here keeping the word if you keep the word you'll be happy praise god but if you don't keep the word you'll be miserable and you'll perish isaiah 41 verse 10. isaiah 41 verse 10. praise god let's read this together on three one two three fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will

here heavenly father we're in your divine presence we're rejoicing in your power to keep us lord god lord jesus you pray in the garden keep those through thine own name that thou hast given me and lord you were praying for your disciples and so lord just as jesus prayed for his disciples lord we're praying for one another we're the disciples today jesus is our head today so lord jesus we just ask god keep us through thy name keep us through the name of the lord jesus christ the power and authority of the lord jesus christ give us 15 more years and beyond should you tarry 15 more years of

we've given extra sacrifices this weekend lord to draw closer to you i know you'll receive them dear god and just receive our sacrifices today father that you might be glorified that our hearts might be happy by keeping all your word granted lord god give us the vision of god that we need in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as being seated praise god i'll set the timer now so i'll try to get 45 minutes here by the grace of god okay so i do have a few slides i want to show so i do apologize about that i unplugged it but then um i do want to show a few slides i just want to look at this thought today um where there is a vision the people prosper because the scripture we read was a negative right where there's no vision people perish well then the opposite must be true right where there is the vision the people will prosper and so i just want to preach just a short little message on vision i was kind of meditating on it all week i heard a little podcast about vision and then i remember some quotes from brother branham uh and so i just had this little thought here about vision so we read our scripture here without a vision people perish so that means with the vision the people keep the word and they're happy in other words the joy of the lord how many how many experience the joy of the lord where you are just you're just joyful to be a christian you're just joyful because god is in your life praise god because we all know what it's like when god was not in our life but if god is in our life then we should have the joy of the lord the joy of salvation praise god and so we experience that on a daily basis now i brought out this scripture to show how prospering was the result of obeying prophecy in other words the scripture the scripture that foretells what's to come if we obey the prophecy then god will prosper our souls we all know third john 3 john says i would that you prosper in health even as your soul prospers so god does want your health to prosper right unless you're like paul and god's trying to humble you because of all the revelations right so in most cases god is going to heal you unless he's trying to keep you humble or take you home right but most of time god's going to heal you he's going to give you good health so you can serve him and that's so your soul can prosper and your soul is the location of the the free more agency and the nature of god your mind is different your mind is your conscience your thoughts and your plans and your ideas and your conscious memories and affection imagination but that's your mind but god wants to prosper your soul which is your nature your character amen hallelujah what the spirit that's leading you and guiding you it's guiding all those thoughts can i say like this it's correcting all those thoughts praise god it's giving you the right things to imagine right it's giving you the right reasons to uh to state for believing something right so the soul influences the mind praise god and john said i want your soul to prosper because if your soul prospers your mind will prosper and your body will prosper praise god because it all starts in the soul the soul of man right the soul of man all starts there because the soul that sinneth it shall die but jesus said i come to give you rest to your souls amen instead of fighting with god wrestling with god wrestling with self we are our souls rest in god our souls rest in the blood of jesus christ amen our souls rest in the finished work of calvary praise god and the subsequent sending or the sending afterwards of the holy ghost praise god and so we rest in god's life within us praise god so this was when they were trying to rebuild the wall in jerusalem after the babylonian captivity ended after jeremiah's 70 years were up and the bible said the elders of the jews built it and they prospered through the prophesying of haggai the prophet and zechariah the son of idol and they it and finish the house i'm sorry this was the house this wasn't the walls yet this was the house praise god because this was zerubbabel so forgive me uh nehemiah was the hot i'm sorry nehemiah was the walls this was the house forgive me uh but now i want you to notice too everybody knows even false prophets know that when when there's a real prophet the people prosper these were the lying prophets all the line prophets in the days of of ahab all the prophets prophesied saying go up to ramos gilead ahab and prosper for the lord shall deliver into the king's hand see now that was a lying spirit but i'm just showing you people want to prosper right the bible said we will prosper the bible said we prosper through prophesying so satan tries to imitate that and he tries to get people to compromise on the word and still tell them you're gonna you're gonna prosper well ahab was not gonna prosper because he has he had a jezebel wife a literal jezebel wife right and we're battling a jezebel church praise god we're battling the protestants and and the catholics although we love them but there's a spirit behind them just remember church just a few of them are going to be saved just a few catholics just a few protestants very few because jesus said few there be that find the narrow road so that's when we're talking about denominations of catholic and fighting them we're not talking about every person but we're talking about the system the antichrist system behind that because the holy spirit said come out of methodists amen come on of luther and praise god come out of the pentecostal denomination and come into the revelation of this hour praise god come into the open book of daniel chapter 12. coming to the open book of revelation chapter 10 praise god the seals are loose praise god the revelations are revealed to us amen with thus saith the lord we have them praise god so see satan tries to imitate it and say you're gonna prosper it's okay if women still preach it's okay sisters if you cut your hair brothers it's okay if you have two or three wives and you smoke and cuss and watch dirty movies that's a lie your soul won't prosper you might prosper from satan's wages but we're not into satan's wages praise god we're into wages of righteousness amen hallelujah we're looking for spiritual treasure lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven not on this earth praise god seek the things that are above amen see satan lies and he'll tell you you're going to prosper it's okay to break the word of god it's a lie we only prosper when we obey the word keep the word for we'll be happy if we do that i didn't i've been so happy since the lord saved me praise god i've been happy okay what did i do forgive me oh i'm sorry yeah it was a black slide yeah then i had my thoughts on there sorry but yeah i think i'll share this one here i just want to you know so i didn't finish all my thoughts because i kind of ran out of time but um we are all called to do and come up with a simple oh yeah i wanted to go through and find all the things we're supposed to do and just make a simple way to remember like heart you know love the lord god with all your heart soul mind and strength home keep your home clean seek first the kingdom of god and only be strong i didn't get to develop that thought but just let you know i want to come up with a simple way to remember like denominations will say like love god love jesus i'm sorry i love god and love your neighbor right that's like a simple way to remember the great commandments right the greatest commandment right but i want to come up with a message one praise god because we have a we have a greater calling than that praise god we want to love god we want to serve people but we also want to escape the wrath that's coming up on this earth praise god in other words we need the rapture in there praise god now and sister joyce she's one of the editors for my my books and and i told her the vision i had for the books i said i you know we don't we don't we don't i want to put all this information about modesty in one place and she said that's a very good vision you have brother and then on the second book i said i want to put all the mysteries in one place where i said it's going to be like another church age book and she said brother you're a man of vision now i'm not saying i have vision for everything but i do have vision for some outreach and so that made me think wow i had vision to share the message and so if that's the vision god gave me if people can see that i have a certain vision then i want to continue in that in order to get the bride ready for the rapture praise god and remember in none of these books and videos have i ever asked for one cent or one like i've never asked for one anything because i don't want it give it to your home church the main thing is make make a place give your whole body heart and soul to jesus amen and i always say god bless you in the name of the lord jesus christ you know may jesus christ be the desire of your heart it's never been to make money it's never been for views or numbers now it is it is encouraging to see how many people watch but our desire is to finish the mystery of god or i'm sorry finish the great commission by sharing the mystery of god that's finished okay now our vision came from the bible-based prophet william branham now as one now look at this the holy ghost took a picture with this man that's how much a man of god he was right when was last time the holy ghost took a picture with you as a as a pillar of fire over your head he's never done that to me this man was a man of god and as evidence this man was raised a paralyzed man raised up and spent the last years of his life telling every person he could that jesus christ is a healer a paralyzed man he was there he is he's writing his books as a young man he was in this wheelchair he was in this wheelchair on the bed for 60 years william upshaw he was united states senator and he come he was in a wheelchair he went to brother rams meetings and the holy ghost said stand up you're healed and a man that was in a wheelchair for 60 years rose up and walked and spent the last years of his life giving out witnessing tracks he gave that's a track you can you can download that he gave it out to joseph stalin uh uh truman president truman his wife every senator every uh representative this was not done in a corner the white house knew about the holy ghost amen everybody knew about this praise god and god sent his prophet why because he has to bless us through prophecy praise god amen and then i met this sister this sister in 1955 was told by brother branham with thus saith the lord you're gonna get you're gonna be healed from tuberculosis that's brother tim hume's mom now she's passed away now but brother man i said go away yourself a week now you'll be a palmore he said weigh yourself another week you'll gain weight she did she went on to get complete health had four more children and he said that's that's in the name of the lord now who can do that when was the last time you did that we did it we didn't that's a prophet praise god that's a prophet who had the gift of discernment the gift of healing and had authority over satan praise god amen hallelujah thank god and god visited this earth with a prophetic ministry so that's where our vision comes a prophet pointing us back here because because denominations point you to their school they point you to their textbook but church we've been pointed back to thus saith the lord amen everything we believe comes right out of the word of god amen and we have no argument we just believe all the word of god hallelujah that's what god's prophet did it revealed the meaning of this book praise god hallelujah and gave it with us saith the lord now we want to recognize where we are where are we in time and the reason i'm saying this is because almost every other church in america will say america is going to have a great revival and they're raw they're lying that's the spirit of the antichrist i'm not i'm not mincing words here most churches that say america is going to have a revival are speaking from the unholy spirit because they're not there's nothing in the bible about america having a revival i showed it to the last time mj was here america is in revelation 13. they don't get a revival america brings on the mark of the beast but there will be a little revival amen a little remnant praise god he said because you've kept the word of my patience i will keep you from the hour of temptation that comes upon the whole earth thank god we have patience in the word of god amen he's going to keep us from the mark of the beast laying down jesus promised it praise god but where are we and this is the thought that came to me this week where are we church we've been given four kind of timelines to know where we are did you ever put that together it just came to me this week it's very simple you've heard it before now there's three of them but we have a fourth because i forgot about the seven major visions okay so here we have three timelines to know exactly where we are we have the daniel 2 image which brother ram said is thus saith the lord that's the timeline right we have the prophetic seven feasts of israel that's prophetic that tells us the timeline of where we are right and then we have the seven church ages which tell us where we are as well also we have the seven major visions three of which i know brother ram said five but he never said thus say the lord three of which i believe are come to pass the fourth is soon to come to pass with those driverless cars that's what i believe and i have coached the back there's two quotes brother ram said the this in the process of coming to pass it's not coming to pass yet there's other times he says it's come to pass so we have to ask the holy spirit what is the revelation that's the revelation i felt god has given to me the best i can understand because brother says we don't even have the highways yet for the driverless cars and we don't even have the driverless cars yet so see we just gotta we just have to we have to be humble and just let the holy spirit rightly divide the word of truth to us right remember church the bible says the way of righteousness will be so simple that a fool won't air in it a fool only a fool could miss the rapture only a fool could miss the truth this is so simple we just got to be honest and not look at pressure from jeffersonville or pressure from the white house and just look to the holy spirit and he'll guide us into all truth amen any simpleton any person who's uneducated can have the baptism of the holy ghost and know what's coming praise god because the holy ghost will tell you things to come praise god amen that's why we got a bunch of people that are off the word i think the rapture's already taken place some of them think uh we're in the millennium already all this bunch of nonsense and they don't have enough spiritual ability to just open their eyes and has this come to pass church if god gave these prophecies god is going to back them up if there was no question about mussolini if there was no question about hitler if there's no question about stalin there will be no question about four or five six or seven amen i'm not sure where that came from praise god now where are we if you read daniel 2 and daniel 7 there's two dreams or i'm sorry there's a dream and a vision about the kingdoms that rule to the end time babylon babylon was the head of gold the chest and arms of silver were medes and persians uh the loins were ancient greek alexander the great the last the legs down to the feet were iron which represent the roman catholic church i'm sorry which ancient rome but then it changed into papal rome right constantine in 325 started beginning marrying the church and state and don't let anybody tell you he was a christian he was not he murdered a few years before he died after he was baptized and everything he murdered his own mom and oldest son while he was away partying history records that a murderer wouldn't i'm sorry christian would never do such thing it's such a wicked thing to do there's no way he was saved uh it's just impossible there's so much more history i can't get into it now but don't ever believe that and marrying the church and state was never a good thing politics and religion don't need to be mixed praise god right because politics will always get corrupt praise god god doesn't rule by politics god rules by the word amen hallelujah the word of god not man's opinions and votes and voting can be fine there's times but ultimately god's word rules all the people praise god people that can submit to the word of god so where are we church we are in the time of rome right rome's ruling not as ancient rome military but now by religion as rome has uh rome has what they call it diocese in every nation i forget diocese in every nation almost under heaven there's a couple of those muslim countries that don't let him in yeah yeah yeah uh but then it seems like the muslim started through the catholics you know it's just it's a strange thing now i'm just giving you a visual to show how long each one lasts look how big those legs are this roman spirit which the legs are the longest part of the body right so see ancient rome came in about 141 bc and so rome has been ruling remember they broke in the east and west right right that's what the two legs represent east and western rome uh in the eur in european days uh dark ages now the feet were iron and clay it's really strange so we have babylon meads of persians grecian roman but the feet and no no no church don't forget that the feet are iron and clay iron is rome so what's clay and the bible said they'll mingle their seed together but they won't unite brother adam told us what it was it was protestants or the clay iron is a catholic he said they're they're proselyting against each other to try to get one another to try to marry in between each other to pull people over because it's the same spirit it's mother and daughter harlots amen right that's what we got today protestants now they're trying to unite which they're gonna they're not gonna always unite right they're not gonna fully unite but they're there together it's the same spirit remember jesus said i will destroy the mother harlot he said then i'll destroy the children of the mother harlot and i'll put them in a bed of death that's why most protestant churches are dead spiritually they don't want the word they want popularity they want membership they want buildings we want membership in heaven praise god we want the new building of the new jerusalem praise god that's the new church we want praise god amen let it come down from heaven and before that of course we'll get the uh millennial temple praise god in the millennium there's actually two churches we want praise god the millennial temple and the new jerusalem that descends like a bride out of heaven amen now see so this is the devil these are the devils that we're battling today that's where the mj i've been battling that since i became a christian that antichrist spirit that's trying to pull me and make us a denomination that's the antichrist spirit we're battling right to become like rome and it's all routine there's no holy ghost there it's and then just dead like a baptist or dead like a methodist or dead like a lutheran or dead like whatever we don't want to be dead christians we want to be living stones amen hallelujah alive to christ amen full of the holy ghost and power amen you see this is the demons we're battling so is rome going to rule to the end time yes sir when the pope came in 2015 barack obama economy your holiness holy father i saw it there's numerous people women that got down there and kisses his ring and everything like that it's worship of a man it's setting up for the antichrist because one one day that pope will be the antichrist either him or another man that office of the pope will be the antichrist because the woman rides the beast the roman catholic church controls the beast and who is the head of the roman gathered church the pope of rome so see church we're to overcome lukewarmness don't ever you feel yourself getting lukewarm you find yourself a prayer meeting or you find yourself someone to repent to if you if you sinned against somebody don't let yourself get lukewarm brother said always keep your enthusiasm always be strong and very courageous amen hallelujah don't let your we don't let your strength run out stay strong amen you have a fountain go to the fountain and draw strength from the fountain praise it's bubbling up praise god amen there's plenty of strength and power it's bubbling up just drink be thirsty and drink on the blessings of god god will inspire your soul see catholics and protestants unite with the us government to lay down the mark of the beast it has to come out of that beast out of the land which we saw was a lamb freedom of religion but turned into a dragon spake like a dragon which is the united states of america the roman catholic church now we got the second roman catholic president look what he's doing he's destroying see how it destroys it everywhere catholicism goes it destroys the nation see how inflation's going way up all the all your gas prices going up you see that your food prices your lumber price is going up see that that's what the roman catholic does they strip the people of all the money to make them beg and be dependent upon that system we don't want to be dependent upon man we want to trust in god amen see they want man worship they just want everybody to worship them and come to them for money and their unemployment checks in the mail uh it's a bunch of devils bunch of devils now also here's another timeline now this is another one i could have added too actually i could have five timelines so i kind of added this one last second we've had every two thousand years god does something great right there's a two thousand in the first two thousand years there's a flood the second two thousand years messiah came next two thousand years the son of man came praise god hallelujah and the rapture's coming so that's how another way we know something great's gonna everybody knows everybody has a feeling something's gotta happen in this world right it seems just like we're just like at a boiling point right it's going to keep boiling the longer we live the hotter it's going to get right the more it's going to boil there's some it's time it's time for something to happen praise god now we don't want to predict the day in the hour because jesus said no man knows it but we want to keep our lamps trimmed and clear we want to watch and pray as jesus said watch and pray just watch him just keep watching and praying you won't miss it if he just said watch and pray and if you do it you'll see it praise god how much how much simpler directions could you give someone just watch and pray for my coming just watch just every day just see if the lord would be would be coming today right and then just pray every day you won't miss it you're a part of christ you're a part of the word how could you miss it when jesus died to save you praise god how could you miss it when he sent his word to revive you to bring you life right to redeem you sanctify you fill you with the holy ghost empower you you won't miss it just watch and pray yeah so this first time nine tells us romanism is the enemy the denominational antichrist spirit is our enemy now this is blurry so i apologize i don't know why i didn't have a better image start here every march uh they have passover right every march jews have passover so they have passover unleavened bread first fruits three days in a row seven weeks later they have pentecost uh one sorry one two three four months later they have uh trumpets day of atonement tabernacles that's what they did every year but this is a prophetic calendar for us all right does everybody understand passover jesus died on the cross unleavened bread jesus took our leaven of sin he took it down to hell praise god and took the keys of death and hell first fruits he rose from the dead praise god he was waved god waved him before the people praise god seven weeks later the holy ghost found the day of pentecost praise god now the trumpets are the jews when god returns because trumpets gather israel for the day of atonement israel is blinded right now they don't know jesus is the messiah but the the two prophets will call them back to that but right now we're in this long summer season of harvest we're right here church we're right here it's almost time for god to go back to israel praise god you can see it they're called they're still calling is israelis back to the promised land people are still flying in from different nations coming there so we are in the feast of weeks now this is different we'll preach on this on wednesday march was barley harvest that was christ wheat was the gentile church ages and then jews are called the first fruits in revelation right so there's three harvests that took place every year the church we are right at the end we are gleaning here at the time of gleaning just finding a few souls here few souls there getting the last harvest in before jesus returns before he goes back to the jews so roman isn't the enemy what else do we learn we gotta glean we or souls in the great commission until the last trump right which is uh the body change the trump of god shall sound the dead in christ rise first and then uh death is swallowed up in life glory that's at the last trump that happens moment twinkling with an eye praise god so we've got work to do now the seven church ages the holy spirit gave this uh picture to brother branham these are the messengers uh to the church ages paul iranius martin columba luther wesley and we believe brother branham was the last church aged messenger because he had thus saith the lord and he pointed us back to the scripture brother brahm was restoring paul's teaching amen so let me just give a challenge here if i don't preach something paul preached you come let me know because i am endeavoring i am laboring i am giving my whole life to just preach what paul preached praise god and i will continue to do that that's my pledge to you that should be your pledge to me and if i ever don't preach when paul preached you come correct me praise god because we're all crying there's all these souls crying out behind the veil of time we're resting on paul's gospel we're resting on the revelation of jesus christ that's our hope that we've obeyed because all men seekers will be judged by jesus christ according to paul's gospel on that day so the light was great the beginning but then all these uh antichrist got in and this was the darkest time the dark ages where the roman catholic church controlled church and state everything uh but we had a little more light at the end time uh the the the day of ref reformers was a great time martin luther john wesley george whitefield mighty men of god there was more light they had an open door jesus said they had an open door in that age and here we are at the end time the last revival before the rapture praise god now i i just showed you this too brother ham called this an open door i just made this a few years ago so the church ages ephesus smyrna pergamos there to you brother ram said the philadelphia church age started the age of the open door he was opening the age of uh he was opening the door of the godhead and jesus's name and the word he's opening that back up saying come on in i am the door praise god right i'm opening up the revelation of who i am i am the alpha and the mega i am the resurrection the life praise god i am the beginning of the creation of god hallelujah the godhead and that's what the that's what jesus says in revelation 3 i'm opening a door to you praise god now i just want to show this again this is what we battled down through the ages christians bowed the deeds and then they became a synagogue of satan then it became a doctrine so they're false teachings like transubstantiation infant baptism it became doctrine right and then jezebel religion was the very depths of this they had names in martin luther's day but they were dead martin luther said he hoped ten percent of his converts would actually be saved he hoped ten percent got saved well i could probably say the same to that too uh the ten percent of all the people we baptized i hope ten percent make it by god's grace that'd be great uh then they were the synagogue of satan the days of john wesley and here we are what are we battling lukewarmness that's what satan wants once you get to that in-between stage where you have a form of godliness but you deny the power but we want godliness we want power we want to speak the name of jesus and power goes forth praise god power to change our lives power to heal the sick power to save souls praise god power to rebuke the enemy amen power but satan wants to create a lukewarm sometimes i'm excited about god sometimes i'm not we need to be hot and on fire all the time it takes a it takes a daily battle but paul said i die daily praise god that christ might be formed in me now this is even deeper because now i show the anointings right there was four beasts in heaven and each one represented an anointing the early church had the line anointing and then the next two church ages had the ox anointing and then a couple of church ages three had the man anointing but we're in the age of the eagle anointing because the eagle's known for watching right watch and pray eagles can go up really high and watch and see what's going on that's our anointing we can rise above the earth praise god we can rise way above these things and see things to come praise god we know the mark of the beast is coming that's why we're making ready to have the mark of god amen hallelujah that's why we're making sure our little ones are baptized and baptized with the holy ghost they need to be marked with the holy ghost praise god that's why prayer meetings you need to really cry out for people sigh and cry for the abominations because god said i'm going to mark those people that side and cry for the abominations amen now i want to pull this out here because we may see this in the next coming years right now laodicea is at 115 years long ephesus is the shortest one so far at 117. so guess what we're gonna probably have the next couple years we're gonna preach you're saying oh laodicea's gotta be shorter so the rapture is gonna have to happen in the next two years but again there's no prophecy on that show it to me if there is there's none and i got some more examples preachers always do this at church i don't want you to be i don't want you to be looking for a date i don't want you looking for any other signs we've received our last sign glory we received the last sign the sign of discernment the sign of brother man's ministry that's the last sign right we received the last sign we don't want you looking for signs we want you watching and pray looking to god praise god you'll be ready if you're looking to christ amen all these preachers try to pop up or build up their reputation by trying to guess the rapture and guess this and guess that it just it just gets the people's lukewarm right because they build them up for a moment then it comes and passes comes and passes comes and passes i'm going to give you some examples how many message preachers will be predicting the rapture the next year since they think this last age has to be the shortest they think brother brandon didn't say that they think so 2022 will be 116 years this age has been oh and they say see it's got to be it's got to be shorter than ephesus because this is a short quick work well that's your own opinion that's your that's your idea that's not that's not a that's not a prophecy 2023 will tie us if the lord tarries with ephesus so i don't know if my wife remembers this but in 2006 people were saying well this is a hundred years since 1906 when the church age started so 1956 was 50-year jubilee and 2006 was the second jubilee people were calling it the double jubilee and so some people were predicting the rapture some preachers like you might get ready might be the rapture it's the second jubilee since the church age started and brother amen i was a little nervous rightfully so right because we are just young in the faith and didn't understand all these people trying to make guesses and everything like that 2013 2015 2013 was the 50-year jubilee when the seals opened from 1963. so some people were saying oh it's 50 years it's a jubilee maybe this will be the rapture uh a bunch of politicians then 65 right 2015 was 50 years since 1965 and they were guessing that one and that 2015 was also the year of the blood moons remember that brother i was all shook up about that see god god is shaking everything so that the only thing that can't be shaken are those who are part of the kingdom of god amen in other words god is teaching us how to stand amen stand on the word stand on what we know as real prophecy he's teaching me how to stand a couple years ago in 2018 some famous preacher from philip of the philippines put oh it's 2018. look it's 70 years from when israel became and they said oh this must be the year god goes back to the 144 000. that shook me up i'm like but now i've seen so many of these i don't get i try not to get shook up anymore they're all right brother brothers they're always guessing like it's not enough just to say watch him pray it's watch and pray plus do your math god don't need my math help i can hardly i got to get on my calculator to calculate the number of years there how can god use my mouth god don't need my math he needs my faith amen he's my love he needs my trust because the bible said he comes to all those that love his appearing amen that's what he needs he needs our love not trying to get likes on facebook like they try to do so we don't live through at all church we don't live through oh it doesn't yeah i won't get into that when i better not get it because i'm going to talk about joseph remember i better not get on that one and i told my william i wouldn't mind meeting him but i know one thing's for sure he won't talk to me about the truth i know that for sure because i said can we meet can we talk we talk on the phone no reply so they don't that that's how you that's how people are when they're afraid that's how people are when they know they have no answers just a simple question is billy paul the promise joseph like brother am said in 1952 they can't even answer that yes or no you can't even give me a yes or no answer how weak is that that's it that's right that's right they try to get you off right they won't even answer like pharisees that's right the pharisees said oh we can't tell who john was he said and i won't tell you either right jesus remember they asked jesus that that's good brother that's real good they won't do it they don't have an answer like i said that man with his speeches how come you don't have a wedding garment on no answer they don't have an answer but we know why do you have the wedding garment on because i went down to the crimson river amen and i confessed my sins i got sanctified and the holy ghost fill my soul now i'm wearing white garments on amen i'm dressed for the rapture i'm ready for the wedding come lord jesus amen i don't need a calculator i need the garment praise god that's what i need like they say the gold coat the goal post keeps changing all right first it was 50 years from 50 years from 1956 and then it's 70 years from 1940 what's it gonna be next church what's gonna be next next is gonna be 100 years since brother ram died whatever what is it what's the magic number there ain't a matching number it's an unknown number there a magic system to it it's love for jesus christ happy are those who keep the law for us it's a spiritual law praise god amen hallelujah so i just want to give you some examples see don't be surprised you start hearing preachers saying that i just got that this morning i wasn't even planning on preaching that it just came to me this morning i started looking at those dates i was like oh whoa i said i need to update this it's been a year since i updated this it's that updated like four or five years now here's the quotes the seventh age a very short age it doesn't say the shortest gathers up into itself for one quick work all the evil the age and yet all the reality of pentecost hallelujah it is to this egg jesus says i come quickly verse 11 so it's revelation 3 11. that makes the last age a very short one laodicea is the age of the quick work it is cut short he never said it was the shortest so be careful deceiving preachers like to do that they'd like to take their own spin on a quote in order to be popular get a few more amens or tickle your ears let's just say what the bible says praise god let's be happy with what the bible teaches oh glory okay so with these three timelines in mind we know our enemy we know we've got to finish the great commission and we know we got to have an on fire overcoming life until the rapture is that right aren't you glad church you have three maybe five timelines aren't you glad about that let me pull another one up there uh oh yeah i just summarized it here's how based upon god's timelines and remember two of these are thus saith the lord right the romans i'm sorry the daniel two and the seven church ages program said these are thus saith the lord will overcome the beast romanism antichrist spirit through the hot fiery eagle anointing and finish cleaning the great commission until the last trump that sound like a good vision for you that's all i see brother amen that's all i see that's my vision that's all i can see all i can see is my enemies are these denominations and i'm trying to just call one out who will come out come out of her my people god still heals cancer god's god's coming for a rapture god sent a prophet amen just trying to glean one where we can ever find one or two people to come out and glean and yet the whole time god's empowering us to fly above worldliness to live far above it and to see what is coming praise god by the spiritual power of god that's my vision now here's another one these were given thus saith the lord as well so there's i believe it's cut off right here because these were so clearly identified even by sinners right all the sinners had to say he died first then he died and then this was swallowed up into communism i found numerous internet articles that say that nazism and fascism were swallowed up in other words communism took over those it became more of a movement nobody can disagree with these so that means nobody will disagree with these when these come to pass that's how i believe god backs up his word i don't believe god backs up his word and you have to kind of wonder is this fulfilled or not it could be could not be it i believe it'll be so obvious to the believer so i believe we're waiting for this google what the google tried to get them running by 2020. they missed but they're they're continuing to advance and then uh this moral problem with women but ram said he saw women dressed in uh only a only a figly phone to cover their midsection he said he saw him dressed like that he said he saw it in a magazine but i just believe it's gonna have to happen more worldwide that's just what i believe because i believe that all these happened in order so i believe these have to happen in order as well and a woman rising to power in the u.s i thought it was hillary clinton back in the day could be kamala harris could be but i still believe these things have to be fulfilled first for some women who rise to power we know for sure it could be some women natural but we know for sure it's a spiritual woman the roman catholic church has to rule in this nation it has to because that's what revelation 13 says the beasts just change its form it was first out of the sea but then it kind of come up out of the sea and come on the land with those seven heads come out in the land of the united states and now it's the superpower you know i've heard numerous preachers this week i was listening to different sermons denominational preachers they don't even believe the united states is in the bible can you believe that's how blind they are and they think maybe it's because everybody's saved you know in america they're gonna have a great revival and so we're just going to be the church well come on and yet murdering 62 million babies letting men and women change their identities of the saying god gave them a female spirit when they're a man that's an abomination it's an abomination god has called us out of darkness into the light praise god amen we're not child of the night and sleeping we're awake we know exactly what god wants us to do praise god we know the vision of this day oh i got two minutes till my 45 minutes is up so i'll try to finish up here and then we know usa has to be bomb but that's that's in revelation too there's so many things getting blown up in revelation i don't know the exact scripture for that so i have to look that one up there i don't know the exact scripture for that one um now here here's where broadband says in 1964. he says uh i said such progress will take place i'll see the automobiles looking like an egg going down the street there's cars on the highways with some kind of remote control they don't have to guide it i see an american family playing checker in the back of a car they got the car right now if they just had the highways to put it on so but i recognize we don't have the highways yet a year before he passed away okay and now do they have the cars well maybe not it doesn't look like maybe they didn't he thought they did based upon magazine articles right but do we have the cars yet not quite yet do we do we have any families of ours playing checkers in the car or anything like have you seen american family playing checkers in the car i haven't seen it yet so that's why i believe brother admitted on a couple occasions we don't have all these things in place yet they're still in the process of coming to pass okay now i'm gonna have to skip through some of this but remember church the word hot if we're gonna be on fire we need to we need to be hot which means have we need more of god each service i know it's hard church i'm a i'm a sinner saved by grace too but each service we got to come to church and say i need more of god today and if you can only amen for the first five minutes give me all you god but i know i can preach a lot longer than five minutes you just stay with me as long as you can or maybe start good take a break and then amen a lot at the end in other words pull on the word of god right because you have you have to recognize you have to i have to recognize that we need more we don't have enough of the holy ghost we need more of it praise god yet we're filled with it yet we're filled in our soul where we need more of it is in our mind praise god to be transformed to change our actions there's my 45 minutes we have to zealously repent and don't tell me you don't sin we all sin or else we're liars that makes us sinners and oh we have to open our life to christ because he said i stand at the door knock and we have to have continual sup with christ oh lord just break the bread to me lord what did you bring today to eat what'd you bring today now what does hot in the greek mean it means boiling hot fervor of mine so when when we say we're not lukewarm see lukewarm they they lose their excitement for the word every day church we gotta have our minds boiling on the things of god like i told you i uh uh sometimes i listen to some of our sermons again so i know what's going on but that actually stirs me up because i see all you worshiping and praising god i get to listen to some of the songs remember what the holy spirit said i listened to brother tim pruitt brother cam or the simon sometimes brother brooks i listen to him too those those those brothers stir my faith praise god that keeps my mind moving on the things of god right and we've got to keep our minds like that's hot keep in your mind constantly meditating on the things of god to be a hot christian now we have to skip some of these but look what brother ram says oh there's i don't have enough time here so let me just i'll just skip ahead i can't go through those yeah i don't have enough time but just so you know in the book coming out i have 30 thus saith the lords six of the twelve prophecies have thus saith the lord i'm sorry six of the twelve mysteries now there's eight other doctrines that investigate the lord five prophecies that have already come to pass and then 11 usa prophecies all the prophecies of united states are destruction they're not going to repent we're not going to have a national revival but they will have a revival to the antichrist so it's going to be a false revival now little churches like ours will have real holy ghost revivals that's what we're having now i've been having it for 15 years praise god i didn't hear you i know you have to if you've been in the word i'm revived all the time praise god but everyone brother spoke was the the god america claims to serve will destroy her because she won't repent now let me just close we know the last anointing before the rapture is called the latter rain that rain has to mature the wheat for harvest but look brother brahm said the rapture church will be an easy thing if you're watching and praying in other words it's just going to be as easy as you come into church today how'd you get the church today you obey the voice the voice inside of you you obeyed that voice and said yeah i'm gonna go worship my lord today i might be tired i might even be a little sick but i'm gonna go and worship the lord because i feel a pull right so you obey the holy spirit the holy spirit said gather more as you see that day approaching and you obey some of you crossed so many miles god bless your hearts for crossing all those miles and you obey the holy spirit it was an easy thing to obey the holy spirit that's what brother brahm says noah's building an ark not only working a miracle he was preparing for a miracle the church today is not only having miracles but it's preparing for america the coming of the lord jesus christ and the rapture of the church to be taken up give me a church ready visualized to see the signs and to see the omnipotent god the great power of god moving amongst the people which the rapture will be an easy thing when jesus comes they'll be caught up because they believe in such see we'll just get caught up into more of the same excitement we have now which we caught up more of the revelation more of the love we have now god is going to lead us to the rapture praise god we'll be caught up already it'll be an easy thing because we're already yielded to the holy ghost right now are there going to be pressures outside yes pressure is without but we have peace within and of course we'll have the anointing for it think about the anointing but the amen head his dad kicked him out he had the anointing he had to decide do i stay at home with all everything provided food shelter clothing or do i stand on the message of the hour he had the anointing to leave everything was it easy i imagine it was easy there's probably some hard mind battles in there right but it was an easy choice to make so we receded with open arms come on buddy come on come to my house right but when it come down to it it's an easy decision because i know the word is right let the world take whatever they want from me let the world have whatever they want you can take the whole world just give me jesus see there will be trials and struggles without but the power of god inside of you will make it an easy decision to forsake everything and prepare for christ's coming see perhaps you know easy thing because of the supernatural we'll see vindicated brought to pass what if we see some of these fourth vision fifth vision sixth vision what if we see some of these happen that's gonna raise our faith even more but even not it's okay if all that happens after the rapture no problem i'm still watching for jesus right now right and church all the latter rain is is a refilling of the holy ghost up here can't be the soul because the bible never says the soul gets refilled you don't okay i don't have time the dynamics of the church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we worked in a small measure while the headstones coming down to unite with the body let's stand to our feet do you remember right after you got the holy ghost how did you feel how did you act what was your attitude oh my that's what you're going to feel like in the latter rain that excitement that power that that enthusiasm that imagination that all things are possible i'm a child of god god lives inside of me i i love this word it's so fresh it's so real i know this is right you'll be refilled with that praise god but then your faith will go so much higher because we'll see the dead in christ rise think about that it's just back to that first time when you got when you were born again by the baptism of the holy ghost see it'd be such an easy thing just to continue in this anointing that we're under right now how many want to continue in the anointing of the baptism of the holy ghost musicians can come let's pray for that there are so many other things i wanted to get to relating to missionary work perhaps maybe this evening or gathering more as we see that day approaching we have to go right back to acts chapter 2 and whatever they had there that's what god wants to restore right back to acts chapter 2. there were some hebrews there were some galions they're speaking right they were speaking in the tongues of the cretians here's galileans with no education speaking in greek and like how do we hear these greek guys they're not even greek how do we hear them and peter says this is that which joel prophesied the spirit of god will be poured out in the last days amen hallelujah and your sons and your daughters see visions and dream dreams praise god sorry about that huh it's okay don't worry about it you can shut it off if you want something if it don't go back no problem but church that's what we want by god's grace let's bow heads for a moment try to keep it about an hour yeah it's look like it's an hour now so forgive me i try to close i need 50 minutes to close i have to remember that i always need 50 minutes to close no god bless you church we love you let's pray heavenly father we're so thankful for the baptism of the holy ghost you've sent lord you've given us power in our souls we're not ashamed of the gospel lord many of us believe here we have the baptism of the holy ghost and father we're thankful for the vision you've given to us with your vision the people prosper and i want to thank you lord you've helped my family and i in our church to prosper all these 15 years we've not grown further we've not grown worldly we've grown closer to you with more liberty more faith more joy hallelujah more blessings amen hallelujah more confidence in the truth more rightly dividing of the word of truth thank you for the vision of the word of god lord you saw the hands lord god that were up earlier lord i just pray for them in jesus christ's name lord may they remain hot for you may their mind be fervent on the things of god do they pray about each decision at home and with the children or lord on the job lord god with church decisions lord god give each person grace to pray and seek your face and meditate on the things of god watching and praying for the glorious appearing of our lord jesus christ help us not to get the calculator out and try to guess it so we can get ready at the last second we want to be ready every second we want to be ready today we'll be ready tomorrow dear god we don't want to guess about it we want to know about it we want to feel it in our souls you said the times and seasons you have not need to write on you because you know that the lord cometh as a thief in the night the lord will know the times and seasons down in our souls [Music] thank you god for this faithful church lord thank you for all the faithful saints that have pressed their way out to the house of god made sacrifices i pray you'll meet every need as we worship here in jesus christ amen everyone needs prayer come up here while we're singing we'll be happy to join our faith with yours and pray the prayer of faith [Music] brother [Music]
