========================================

thank you Hallelujah so I'd like to uh start here by God's grace there in second chronicles 13 again looking at relying on the Lord I looked it up in the dictionary rely means to depend upon someone or something with full trust and confidence so I want to focus on that today as the as the scripture says relying on the Lord abide your relied he depended upon the Lord with full trust and confidence praise God I want to switch over here too and Joshua a visual here and I gotta unplug it here but I want to show this visual here by the grace of the Lord I showed a number of years ago it's been my It's been a number of years but you might remember this uh it's the kings of Judah and Israel we had Saul was the first king and then David and then Solomon and then after that it divided into two separate Kingdoms in other words uh there's a church split there's a civil war right there's a civil war all these days almost all these days of Israel hundreds and hundreds of years almost I mean there's almost a thousand years from Solomon until the Lord Jesus and John the Baptist come on the scene so many hundreds of years of Civil War and division amongst the people of God that's not the way it should be God's people should be United praise God and we should be grateful and we should Endeavor with all of our hearts to be United to one another in Christian love Hallelujah now I don't know if I can zoom in here let's see well let me do this I don't think it will okay it won't let me do that okay but today by God's grace you know I kind of caught the inspiration from uh abijah he was the son of rehoboam grandson of Solomon so I took my text out of abijah because I've been reading like I said through these chapters and I was just and I was encouraged uh by the word of the Lord and so we'll spend some time on uh we'll spend a little bit of time on David Salman rehoboam abijah ASA Jehoshaphat um and then we'll do a little bit on uh Hezekiah as well by the grace of God just some good scriptures here I'd like to go through but how many know that you're a king and priest unto God as well that's what I love about the Bible the Old Testament is all these natural stories like there are natural Kings right they're trying to get natural land you know and that's what people are tempted by today right natural riches right a natural you know Empires and all kinds of lands and houses and and all kinds of things but God brings it over and then in the New Testament we should seek spiritual things praise God as we heard on Wednesday we should speak Spirit I'm sorry seek spiritual riches praise God how many are rich today in Christ Jesus Paul preached The unsearchable Riches of Christ Hallelujah and as I told Simon and I were Simon said that really blessed me brother Jesse when you said when we first heard the message we felt like we were the richest people on Earth and that is the truth we would drive across the whole I drive from Akron to Lima three hours one way just to hear the message preached it was such a blessing it was easy to do wasn't it brother Bank it was easy to do because we became rich men Hallelujah we were poor spiritually but then when we heard the message now we became Rich Hallelujah and it's been enjoying the riches of Christ all these years by the grace of God and so uh I guess I'll detach now in case you left there so you'll probably see the blank screen there uh but I want to look here you've got your Bibles here we'll stay in the scripture so we want to rely Kings must rely upon the Lord so if you have your Bible was the score to Revelation chapter 1 verse 6. I just want to again just quickly go over these scriptures that we Are Spiritual Kings and Priests unto God so Revelation 1 verse 6. I'll turn there as well and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen so we have a spiritual office of being a king we must rule we must put all enemies under our feet how many believe that today amen amen all the enemies you face all the Temptations all the evil spirits can I say like this even the sicknesses even uh uh any Temptation that would come our way we've got to put that enemy under our feet we've got to overcome it because we're made to rule in this life the Bible says we will reign in this life by Jesus Christ Hallelujah the church we all know uh as I've said before you know we can all look in the mirror at the end of the day and we know if we're ruling or if we're in slavery Hallelujah we can know am I ruling over sin or have I become a slave to sin the Bible tells us that we can rule over sin praise God we don't have to be slaves we don't have to be we don't have to live in defeat we can live in Victory how many understand that by God's grace amen and how do we do it we depend on the Lord as the scripture said we rely on God as we're going to see with all these Kings they all had a choice they can either rely on themselves they can rely on their their leagues or their their human friendships or they can choose to rely on God hallelujah now the second verse is Psalms 51 verse 17. Psalms 51 verse 17. I'd like you to read that by God's grace you read it right from our Bibles I turn to it fast praise God now we'll just read verse 16 here for Times Sake for thou deliverest not sacrifice I'm sorry for that desire is not sacrifice else would I give it thou Delight us not in burnt offerings the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit a broken and contrite heart oh God thou will not despise of course this was the chapter when David took another man's wife he took his mighty man's wife and then had his mighty man killed right in other words there could be hardly any more active betrayal than what David did and he said in this case God doesn't want me to go sacrifice animals God wants me to sacrifice my myself amen God wants me to feel sorry about my sins that's what God wants God doesn't want me to give up more money at this point God doesn't want me to give up uh any any Financial things or give away houses or lands God wants me to feel Broken Hallelujah and church that's the same for us hallelujah if we're going to be priest unto God uh when we fall short of God's glory we've got to confess our sins and say God I'm sorry I feel ashamed of myself I want a new start with God hallelujah amen coming off coming off communion we should feel close to God this week Hallelujah if we've had battles and we know the enemies after us but we can overcome and praise God because we're Kings unto God amen Hallelujah so this is what David said David says when I'm broken when I feel awful about my sin when I want to get close to God that's the kind of sacrifice God wants to see Hallelujah now go to Second Peter 2 verse five I'm sorry first Peter 2 verse five sorry first Peter 2 verse five and I'm turning there really quick today wow Hallelujah first Peter 2 verse five he also has Lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ so we worship by getting in the Holy Spirit we worship by getting in the spirit of Jesus Christ and then when we give God thanks when we give God praise we're actually doing priest work unto God God wants us to join the Angels God wants us to sing along with Heaven how many believe that God wants you to join the angels and cry holy holy holy Hallelujah God wants you to to join the worship Hallelujah he's called you to join the worship he's called you to be a worshiper praise God not a complainer right uh not a denier of the truth I want you to be a worshiper hallelujah amen this is what he's called us to be Kings and Priests God has made us Kings and Priests unto God amen Romans 12 1-2 Just A Brief Review here by God's grace Romans 12 1-2 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God so first separate your body from Evil places don't go to the bars anymore don't go to the clubs anymore right and for us we've got to make sure we go to the right places on our phones and our tablets right gonna go the right places the Bible says separate your body if there's a Temptation don't take your body there stay away from that praise God maybe it's a friend's house maybe it's a neighbor's house but wherever there's Temptations you must sacrifice your your freedom to go there and the Bible says when you do that then God will accept you you've got to keep your body out of places where they'll be tempted and then God says okay now you're drawing closer to me praise God amen verse two and be not conform to this world don't let your mind be conformed don't let this world shape your mind like you can see it plainly you know uh with the media the liberal media today shapes everybody's mind right right like just at the with coven they said oh uh they said mass is going to keep you from getting covered and it didn't help at all see that that's how that's how easily they Shake people's minds they don't conform their mind to the truth right or they said uh uh I don't want to get too far into politics but they said Hunter Biden's laptop was Russian disinformation well now they proved it wasn't but people just they accept whatever they hear they get eat they just follow along they go with the flow and church we're not to glow go with the flow of this world we're to go with the flow of the Holy Spirit praise God in other words we don't accept everything the Bible said prove all things try every Spirit praise God the Bible said we're to judge all things with love in our hearts love for God hallelujah that's what the Bible said conform your mind let your mind be transformed by the renewal of it praise God so if your mind is weary if your mind is tired of fighting you've got to get to a place where you separate your body from your from places where you're going where you're tempted you got to get away from The Temptations and you've got to let the word of God change your thoughts change your mind make you feel new again about the things of God hallelujah I just call it an inspiration from talking to Austin on Wednesday night after church Austin said his mind has been renewed and that stirred me up too by God's grace that's what the Bible says we you and I have to put ourselves in a position where we can have our minds renewed and we're again we're joyful again to read the word of God we're joyful to pray Hallelujah we've got to find that place it's our duty to do that church we know how to do it this isn't some crazy mystery we've got to draw night to God and then God will draw an eye to us praise God it's called a sacrifice we've got to make the sacrifice you and I know this is just reasonable this is what God deserves if we're God's people we gotta draw nigh to God we got to give our mind to God our body to God our soul to God we got to give everything to God hallelujah amen like if you were a real fan of the uh of the Ohio State Buckeyes you would have been over there in Indiana yesterday with all painted up in red and Scarlet right or you've been glued to the TV for three hours yesterday because you're you're you're you're you're you're making a sacrifice to your Gods I'll say like that the gods of Ohio State football thank God we weren't doing that hopefully by God's grace I wasn't but see they give themselves holy to that they set aside everything and how much more should we set aside in our lives for the God who sent his son to die on the cross for our sins amen he's worthy of that praise God and friends it's a it's a uh it's a shame when message Believers will go watch uh football games and then try to come to God and then uh try to act like they're worshiping God you can't serve two masters you can only serve one master praise God amen we're in football season so I'll be preaching more on football probably here then when we get to uh basketball season we'll probably preach on that yeah but it's just it's just the obvious sign whatever whatever you're wherever your mind's uh stirred up wherever your mind is excited that's what you're feeding on that's what you've separated your body to but we've got to take our bodies and we got to separate them unto God and we got to give ourselves completely to God that's how we'll transform our minds that's how the word of God will seem fresh again Hallelujah and my mind has been refreshinged by Chronicles I've been reading through Chronicles these last few weeks it's been wonderful Hallelujah now go to uh last one is Hebrews 13 15. then we'll start looking at some of the Kings here Hebrews 13 15. by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually that's why we gather three times a week right we got we're called we are called to yield to the holy spirit let the spirit of Jesus enter into us and it will cause us to continually praise God that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name see if we're complaining or feeling sorry for ourselves we're not doing the act that we should we should be given thanks to God thank God I've got a vehicle thank God I've got food on the table thank God I'm alive praise God thank God that I've got good health thank God I've got the message of the hour amen I can say that today Hallelujah thank God we have these things it's such a blessing Hallelujah and God's called us therefore to do praise to give praise continually come to God's house and give him praise give him praise in your car give him praise in your home everywhere everything that has breath let it praise the Lord hallelujah God wants to be praised Hallelujah now this again kind of goes like uh goes along with the sermons on fighting multiple enemies with Jehoshaphat but you know brother random use many Old Testament Kings to preach sermons some of the most notable was the the king Uzziah brother random preached on Uzziah many times and he called the sermon influences and he talked about how Uzziah was the king watching the prophet Isaiah but when Isaiah went off the scene he kind of found himself in a spot where he was relying on Isaiah the whole time he wasn't really seeking God himself right but then Uzziah had to have his own experience with God hallelujah and so he did have his own experience with God Hallelujah and then Brothers showed us with the life of Solomon program showed how the Queen of Sheba would cross the entire desert just to hear God's God's man preach she she would put everything on the line she'd take every risk just to get In God's Presence Hallelujah and she'll condemn uh the the Pharisees and Sadducees of Jesus day because they wouldn't go to a greater than Solomon Jesus Christ shall have a testimony on the day of judgment because she was willing to sacrifice and she was willing to lose it all she was willing to get robbed and mugged just to hear God's word hallelujah and she'll have a testimony but brother man use that to show that all of us must rally around the gifts of God hallelujah we must rally on where we see God moving where do we see God moving in this church is where we see God moving God speaks to us God anoints us hallelujah God answers our prayer God moves for us God heals us God delivers us God Saves us hallelujah he's faithful where we see God moving we've got to back it up with all we've got Hallelujah amen so there's numerous examples here uh brother I'm using Kings now get your Bibles here I want to go through some scriptures here first Chronicles 10 13. we'll start with the first king and we'll just kind of go down through the chronological order First Chronicles 10 13. so Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the Lord even against the word of the Lord which he kept not and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar Spirit to inquire of it so God actually took Saul off the scene because he sinned against God you know sometimes you wonder why do people die why do people die sometimes it's because they won't confess their sins right like we just saw that with the communion verse last week Paul told the Corinthians many are weak and sickly because you do not discern the body of Christ think about that many people in the church now our church is small right but just think if many of us weren't here because we were sick so let's say we just had you know the first two rows filled or the first the last two rows whatever I mean that's quite a picture Paul said most of your church many people in your church are either dead or sick because they mistreat each other they try to sue each other they got sexual sins they won't confess right they're they're bragging well I like Apollos more than Peter and I like this preacher more than that preacher and Paul said don't you know you're carnal babies amen you're not mature people because you're arguing about who's greater and you're giving into a sensual lust and you're not serving God the way you should be in you care about money more than forgiving your brother and sister praise God you care about like brother said you care about a few stinking dollars more than having love for your your family of God they'd rather have a few stinking dollars than have peace in their lives well I'm going to take them to get my money back because they'd rather have a few stinking dollars right how many rather have peace of God in your heart I'd rather have God's peace than anything else praise God because it's either have God's peace or demons will torment you right so for like I don't know if I thought about the Christmas but I got saved in 19 brother Chris but for those 19 years basically I was running from God tormented the whole time why aren't you serving God now I was just tormented by my own sins you know my own always was feeling guilty always always ashamed and trying to trying to run away from those feelings but none of it ever left until I came to Jesus I repented of my sins and I raised my hands and I started giving God praise and I surrendered praise God and then the peace that passes all understanding swept into my soul praise God and then I passed from Death unto life praise God but what's that is even Believers that serve God for years decades even they choose to live in torment because they won't confess their sins they don't have enough humility to go to a loved one and just say I'm sorry I should not have done that forgive me right you know those words are so powerful we heard we heard it on the uh we heard it on the uh drama yesterday right on the the Giant Killer that last giant giant Pride what were the words he wouldn't say I repent and what do you say uh remember Victoria he said I repent and I'm grateful for forgiveness thank you another good memory and she wasn't even there that giant bride will not repent and it won't be thankful to God for forgiveness right because it thinks look what I've done it's always looking at me may God help us praise God to get our eyes off ourselves and get our eyes on Christ hallelujah amen he's the worthy one he's the one we got to praise he's the one we gotta mind he's he's the one we got to look to praise God and he will direct our past if we rely on Jesus Christ Hallelujah amen so God took him off the scene because he transgressed and then he also went to witches well today if you go into a palm reader right that's the equivalent today going to a palm reader and say what's my future you know hopefully by God's grace the holy spirit will come in there and make the uh the palm reader Scream and Shout you're a child of God and then get out of here hopefully that's what it would do by God's grace the next verse says and he now look he inquired not of the Lord so Saul stopped asking God about his life therefore God slew him and turned the kingdom of David unto the son of Jesse now remember who knows the Bible said for all those years that he was chasing down David right God was running after him God was trying to get him to turn around God was merciful so it was God's mercy to take him off the scene right absolutely God is Rich and mercy the Bible said God knocks at every heart praise God we'll get to that verse maybe today where uh the Bible said the eyes of the Lord run to and fro upon the whole earth so God can so show himself strong in some believer who wants God to be strong in their lives now if I said who wants God to be weak in their lives hopefully nobody raised their hand I mean I hope you can say when I called out to God he answers my prayer Hallelujah amen oh it's beautiful and he inquired Saul inquired not the Lord therefore God slew him and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse now remember David was the opposite of this in Psalm Psalm 27 4. one thing I desire to the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple okay so David was the opposite David was constantly trying to seek God he was constantly trying to find answers for his life by seeking God now is that what you do Church each day now do you have to say Amen if you want you don't want to but each day you see God God what you what do you want me to do today or God why do you want me to do this week hopefully he'll start this week by saying God just guide my week this week what do you want me to do this week what what can I accomplish for your purpose this week see David said that's one thing I desire if I can have anything in life now you finish the sentence in your mind if I could have one thing in life I would have um David said if I could have one thing in my life I'd be in the house of God Amen Hallelujah praise God now it's different if you said uh I thought this you know if there's one battle I didn't have to fight it would be blank that'd be a blessing praise God and maybe God will give you victory over that but even if God gives you victory over that you still have to fight something else praise God right we're either coming out of the battle in a battle or going to the next battle right so we like day and both these were Kings Saul was the King David was the king and church your king now remember church that God can be with you strongly and then as we saw in Hezekiah sometimes God will pull back and see what you're going to do right right he's going to test you in other words he's going to allow you to go through tests that's what God did with Solomon second chronicles one verse one second chronicles one verse one and Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom and the Lord as God was with him and magnified him exceedingly so see God who's with Solomon as long as Solomon was with God God is with you as long as you remain with him as long as you draw an eye to God as long as you come to ask God questions as long as you come to worship God God will be with you praise God and then there'll be times your life when he'll step back and he'll see he'll let you see yourself what are you made of right now what is your character right now but Church don't be discouraged because your in character can always increase by God's grace amen amen hallelujah that's what life is about increasing your character Simon preached on it and brother Brian preached on it too God wants to increase your character what is your character it's the amount of uh obedience decisions that you make that's your character it's your moral makeup so your character is how many times you obey versus disobey now does that help anybody right right I still remember the first time I went to that message or one of the first times I went to The Message Church up there in Sheffield Brother Richard Sanchez was doing a Sunday school and my wife and I walked in there we're with some of the teenagers where I think we're already married at that point yeah I've already married at that point and uh the first Bible study was on Christian character and brother Richard said I want to define character he said character is your moral makeup and from that moment I've always remembered that it's all the decisions where you make the right choice now think about this morning did you make right choices this morning how about yesterday did you make the right moral choices yesterday or did you disobey right right if we disobeyed church that's why we've got a sacrifice that's why we've got the blood of Jesus Christ that's why we got the power of confession Hallelujah if you confess if we confess he's faithful and just to forgive us not sub but all of our unrighteousness he's faithful that's what the Bible says and so God was with Solomon mightily as long as Solomon was with God then Solomon a second wife in third wife hundred thousand I'm sorry 500 and thousands he let all these wives in and the Bible said they turned his heart away from God anything that turns your heart away from God is an idol right yes did anything try to turn your heart away from God this week watch it right overcome it praise God don't let your heart be turned away from God to try to serve some other purpose like I should like I've said before you know some people that have left our church you know as I've talked to them their hearts were turned away towards business more than the word of God their hearts were turned away more towards um family they wanted to be with their family more than come to church think about that these things they become Idols your family they become an idol right business trying to get a better business and trying to get out of debt to you know early and trying to establish yourself all these things they could become idols but there's nothing worse there's no Idol that's really worth spending your time you're giving your praise you there's only one worthy of Praise Hallelujah Jesus is Worthy of all your praise Hallelujah amen nothing is worth it and that's the story of these Kings it's the story of New Testament Kings and Priests as well Hallelujah remember Solomon had so much wisdom no man was ever like him in wisdom think of think of like the parallel today we could have a person where no one has as much Divine Healing no one has as much testimonies in their life but yet they can still forsake their gifts and they can make Idols in their lives and they can fall away from the things of God Kings must rely upon the Lord that's the thought Kings must rely on the Lord so no matter how gifted you are no matter how many testimonies you have we have to maintain our walk with God we've got to continually give God praise and that's why you're here today praise God hallelujah now remember every King was compared to David because he was a man after God's Own Heart and because uh the Bible said God said I'm making a covenant with you David and all your people after you praise God that was in second chronicles 21 verse 12. and there came a writing to him from Elijah the Prophet this is speaking of jeho RAM saying thus saith the Lord God of David thy father blessed I'm sorry because thou has not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah okay so David thy father all right I got the wrong verse no it's verse 13. yeah it is but Alice walked in the way of the Kings of Israel and it's made Judah inhabitants of Jerusalem to go ahorn like to the of the House of David and also I slain thy brother of thy father's house which were better than thy selves all right see he didn't walk in the ways of the the good Kings he walked in the ways of the fathers right a church that's how we're going to be we're either going to walk in the ways of Christ or walk in the ways of laodicea right one or the other which ways are we to walk in we must find the ways of God and walk in them Hallelujah which past should we choose we should choose the path that pleases God that honors God because God has orders our steps let's stay on the Narrow Path Hallelujah Church remember the Bible said it on the Narrow Path very few people find this road so when you're really walking and serving God there's only a few people you can fellowship with about it because there's not many people on this road they don't know what it's like right they're just going with the flow of the world like I like there's this one Pastor uh the kids know who his name is I'm not going to call his name but he's not in the message but he asked me months ago he's like can you just keep in touch with me to keep me encouraged I'm always encouraged when I see you so I sent him these texts over the over the course of these last few months he's like wow I needed that well I needed that and then some of them you don't reply to right because he maybe just can't relate to that one I think one was about dancing you know rejoicing he couldn't he couldn't relate to that one he said oh I wish I could have that you know and there's just some people that you can really relate to and other people you can't relate to right all right right because they're walking to Broadway and everybody relates to them with their sinful lives but there's only a certain people in a church I'll say like this it ought to be the people in this church that you can relate to remember the church the Bible said if you run if you want a friend you got to show yourself friendly if you want somebody to encourage you text you or call you you've got to call them and text them too Hallelujah you want a friend show yourself a friend praise God that's exactly right but there's not many people we can fellowship with like for me I was telling Austin and I do this with Cam and Simon and other brothers I send them voice messages and we just talk about the scripture back and forth because I don't have time to call them like how many times have happened people call me and I'm taking one of my children to the restroom or something like that people want to talk or I'm right in the middle of studying I only have a certain like amount of time before church and I can't take the calls but I can sure get back to your voicemail later now the brothers might from South America might want to talk to me well I can't talk to them right now so I like that and there's only and it's amazing Church in many of those conversations they're studying or preaching along the very same lines that I've been preaching on like uh and then a couple weeks ago I saw a couple months ago it's always a couple weeks ago but it's usually not a couple weeks ago I saw a pastor from one of the chapel churches I said how's it going how you doing and the first thing you got into Church politics that's what he was inspired by it was about the time we had those Revival services so I was testifying we're dancing and praise the Lord and he's like well our churches are trying to break up and uh from this organization and that was the big news now that's fine if you're going through that but like I couldn't I couldn't fellowship with him about the things of God because his things were about his Fellowship was about church politics now we all got to go through struggles we all got to go through trials but we should be felt we should be trying to encourage one another the Bible said we should provoke one another praise God unto good works right provoke one another find a way to encourage one another by the grace of God hallelujah amen so we're they're all compared to David I'll say like this we're all compared to Christ Hallelujah we ought to be like King Jesus everyone's compared to David because he was a man after God's Own Heart Hallelujah let's make our lives after the will of God Amen oh brother Jess Howard Street well I was seeking God I was digging in the scriptures Hallelujah I was trying to answer people's questions I was trying to answer my own questions praise God like this week I was digging in the sermon marriage and divorce and Emma listened to it this week too because we mentioned it on Kristen's testimony that was I was surprised I was like wow I forgot about that that was awesome I forgot about that not going to explain that now yeah I remember what it means and it was interesting and then uh one of the accusers brother random put out a podcast about how that was a bad sermon those people just they're just so far gone we just got to keep praying for them it was a highly anointed sermon praise God highly accurate sermon but it's rough I mean some of those things are pretty rough like I mean like imagine Elijah going up and telling Ahab and Jezebel the dogs will lick your blood would that be easy thing to preach no like my man said imagine going up to a woman and say hi Mrs dog meat right it's hard it's rough yeah yeah but I'm going to preach on this later too Jesus went to the desire of hornetian woman and he said it's not fit to give the dogs meat right now how many would like Jesus to call you a dog I'll probably preach a whole servant on that Jesus called her a dog in other words you uh we say like this you're a lower level of society you don't you don't get the children's bread because you're a lower level Society now what does that get into that ends into a sermon I heard one time I would like to preach it called wrestling with God you're no longer wrestling against flesh and blood all these desires you know like brothers all these Desires in our hearts our sisters the desires we want the new things the new dresses or shopping or whatever it's not wrestling against flesh and blood it's not even wrestling against spiritual Wicked principalities and Powers but it's wrestling against God how many like to hear a sermon on that I like to preach it how would you like that when even as soon as you cry to God and God is testing you to see if you can overcome the test but church he wouldn't test you unless he knew you would overcome praise God hallelujah like when brother Brandon just says he my wife mentioned in the testimony he said God you owe me you owe me an explanation of why this woman died with these young children and brother Adam said God put a black sheep down between him spiritually and wouldn't hear his prayers for two weeks two weeks that's that's what that's what we see in the Bible right God will he'll pull his anointing away from people and we'll just say things like we shouldn't say right but the thing to do is keep coming to God keep coming to because he's trying to teach you something amen watch your mouth and the church said amen can I say this watch your dirty mouth watch your corrupt sinful mouth don't get in the flesh and demand things from God like you or God or you know about it there's great lessons to learn Hallelujah sometimes churches they take years and years and years to learn right like Saul had to learn these lessons years and years and years of Disobedience he finally learned the lesson at the end of his life he stopped chasing David he got his heart ready so he could go home right to be with Samuel man come on but God is faithful in all of it God is loving in all of it God is merciful in all of it praise God you're still his child you're still the one he's fighting for but sometimes he's got to give us trials to fight for us to teach us to obey the word of God now let's go to Second Chronicles chapter 11. and some of these were just a blessing to me and so I hope there'll be a blessing you second chronicles 11. now as you're turning there I want to look at rehoboam and jeroboam for a little bit they're both Kings and Israel's divided kingdoms and I'm reading off a website here of this first part but we'll get to the scripture so go to Second Chronicles 11 17. rehoboam was one of Solomon's sons and king of Judah in the South jeroboam was one of Solomon's former officials in ephraimite and king of Israel in the North okay so rehoboam uh was Solomon's son and he reigned in the southern part Judah so he got the rain where there was the Temple of the Lord right he got the Reign where the priests were think about that he reigned where the ark was right the church was stumbles me sometimes but I realized later what stumbles me is that all those candies brother bang could have had their priests their High priests walk into the presence of the Ark and get thus saith the Lord and yet they didn't do it think about that brother they had the pillar of Fire they had God's Own presence God said I'll dwell in this house that Solomon made and yet they failed to do it now Church nothing spiritually is that any different from us we might not have a spiritual Pillar of Fire but we we know he promised to be here right right Hallelujah and the church said amen like he promised I'll never leave you know Forsaken and then Jesus said brother man and uh uh Acacia you're more blessed if you haven't seen it yet believed amen right now I love these message churches you know some of them say well we saw the pillar of firearies that's great but the Bible said you're more blessed if you don't see it and still believe Hallelujah I'm glad they've seen it I'm glad you know that's wonderful Hallelujah that just means they got more responsibility God actually lets you see those things like Billy Paul Billy Paul saw uh the angel Lord that visited brother Brown I think when he was 16 years old I'm not mistaken I could have been a little later do you remember the exact year and brother man said God let Billy Paul see the angel so Billy Paul would work with him in the ministry and support the ministry and then and then Billy Paul now of course I know he's off the word but angels visited lots of people that weren't on the word Hallelujah but the point was we're all given these experiences but then we got to be accountable to God with them who remembers how many times did Solomon see God twice twice he saw it God in a vision think about that church he's I'll say I just he saw the pillar of fire he saw Jesus Christ but then he let all these women take his heart away from serving God we must not do that we must rule our Dominion Hallelujah we must conquer the enemy we must possess the land Hallelujah I was hoping for a few more amens than that Hallelujah that's okay God's in I gotta be patient Hallelujah they're the waiting upon the Lord shall renew their strength Hallelujah second chronicles 11 17 so they strengthen the kingdom of Judah and made rehoboam the son of Solomon strong three years for three years they walked in the way of David Solomon think about that what a testimony three years he walked where David walked three years he walked like Solomon walked hallelujah how many would be blessed if God could look down and say for three years she walked like brother Brandon walked Hallelujah and I would say like this for three years he walked like Saint Paul walked Hallelujah or Saint Peter three years this man had a testimony for three years but then he forsook it look at the next chapter second chronicles 12 verse 1 and it came to pass when rehoboam had established the kingdom and strengthened himself he forsook the law of the Lord and all Israel with him verse two and it came to pass that the fifth year of king rehoboam shyshack king of Egypt came against him I'm sorry came up against Jerusalem because they had transgressed against the Lord so let me just put this in modern terms while Rambo was seeking God God was blessing him but when he got strong and when he got comfortable I'll say this when he got a little Prosperity that's when he first took God whenever we needed plenty of savings now I'm sure that supplies when we got plenty of money plenty of food and everything everything's going good isn't that use of the time when we fall away from seeking God this is what happened to Rainbow for three years he strengthened himself he put uh he put garrisons up he put up fences around the cities he just made himself strong and then he just kind of got lazy no more battles to fight because then he started transgressing against the ways of God oh I can dabble a little bit into pornography right I can dabble a little bit uh into gossip I can dab a little bit into these uh get rich quick schemes or I can I can pull this I don't have to report this to the IRS I can do this and make a few extra bucks you see when things are comfortable people often compromise that's right but for three years rainbow walked like David and Solomon and church you know brother Brandon says you know the Bible says and we know the song says we'll walk where the apostles have tried how many know that song the day of redemption is there men's hearts are failing to fulfilled be filled with the spirit your land should be clear look up your Redemption is near Church how many want to walk where the apostles walked amen I mean that's kind of like our our end goal right we want to see the latter rain right we want to see rapturing faith but we can't fall away from God and expect it to happen we got to keep drawing closer to God Hallelujah walking where the apostles have tried as I told you Church as far as Supernatural the greatest I've seen is in South America and Trinidad when I made the greatest sacrifices for God at least the far as numbers of Miracles now we don't know how many miracles there will be in the squeeze I tell you to be in America just have rapturing faith Hallelujah that's a good enough miracle for me praise God right Hallelujah but with great sacrifice God will honor great sacrifice he'll honor with great vindication that's what we want we want God to vindicate Our Lives Hallelujah now let's look at a scripture let's go down to verse 7. so rehoboam gets off the word but then God sends a prophet to give him thus saith the Lord to bring him back in line verse 7 and when the Lord saw that they humble themselves the word Lord came to shamaya saying they have humbled themselves therefore I will not destroy them but I will grant them some deliverance and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of shishek so let's let's just rehearse briefly Ramones serving God with all of his heart then he backslides he goes against the word God sends a prophet he repents and then God gives him some everybody say some the Bible didn't say all God gave him some Deliverance this is why Saints you know sometimes people will get some healing but not all the healing right or they'll get some victory in their lives but not all the victory in their lives it's because they've transgressed the word of God and they haven't fully served God with all their hearts now we don't want to be possessors of sub-promises we want to be possessors of all the promises who wants to possess all promises Hallelujah well this is a scripture just like uh FF Bosworth they asked him they said what's the verse that somebody can lose their healing remember that and FF Bosworth said it was Peter walking on the water as long as he was looking at Jesus he was walking in Supernatural Victory right right but then when he got his eyes off of Jesus he lost his Supernatural work same thing today God can heal us but if we get our eyes off the word of God if we get distracted we can get sick again praise God but God wants our eyes on him let's look to the Cross let's look to the Bible let's look to the Holy Ghost let's keep our eyes totally focused on Jesus Christ amen Glory now one thing about Redbone though he had a rough start because he was rough with the people this is a good reminder let's be gentle with people now sometimes we got to be rough with our children parents so don't get me wrong on that if you spare the rod he spoil the child there's times to be rough but there's times to be merciful right so go to Second Chronicles 10 15. you remember this second chronicles 10 15. so rehoboam is the uh freshly anointed king Solomon anointed him before he died second chronicles 10. remember the story Northern Israel came down to rehoboam and said if you lighten our taxes a little bit if you let up on our taxes we'll serve you we'll serve you with all of our hearts and so Ray above said call me the old man let me talk to the old men let's see what they say the old men thought about it and the wise men they said yes you should be merciful a rehoboam should have took the wisdom of the elders now the elders doesn't always have wisdom right Church right there's a lot of older message preachers out of gate got way off the word of God so I would not take their counsel but in this case rehoboam should have took their counsel be merciful these people have been under bondage they've been under a stress under Solomon they had to give everything they're giving their sons and daughters away they've given such high taxes so we can have all these blessings and then what does rehoboam do you remember what he does he goes and asks his friends that are his age his young inexperienced lacking wisdom friends and what are the young friends tell him they said say if my if my father was like uh my father was like I forget what animal he said he said then if you thought my father was rough I'll be like a scorpion to you right so Redbone thinks about it for three days which one does he do he does the foolish thing instead of giving the people a break he makes their burdens harder and harder and harder right so this is a good lesson if you're a kingdom priest unto God look at what people have been going through and sometimes you got to show them Mercy praise God so like for me sometimes I cancel the second service to give everybody a little break okay but I say like this it's never been a burden to go to God's house I've never ever ever one time felt it was a burn to go to church I've never left this church and said I regret going I wish I would not go on God knows my heart I've never said that right it's always a blessing that you play that piano hear that organ and sing praises to Jesus Christ but what I mean is sometimes you get busy in life and you just want some rest well that's why they make Labor Day that's right you got Monday Hallelujah and you got phase Brothers take a day if you need a day serving God is always a blessing praise God but church then we learn from the scripture God had to have rehoboam make this rough decision because God had already pronounced a temporary judgment on Solomon his dad right because Solomon let all these Wives come in and build up their he built all their uh houses of worship God said because of that I'm going to raise up jeroboam and he's going to take half he took he took ten twelfths of the Kingdom there was only two tribes that followed rayabo right right talk about losing what's that 80 of your kingdom maybe more because of his sins he knew better the wisest man knew better than to have all those women and church we're wise men and women today we know better not to go into sinful things and the church said amen We Know Better Hallelujah so see rehoboam got some victory but not all the victory sometimes we'll get some victory but we want all the victory praise God like you've heard people say you know they people say well give me a refilling of the Holy Spirit and we know what that means that means my mind is again ready to see God I just want to see God every day I want to listen to sermons I want to pray all the time I want to Fellowship I want to be around God's people I want more of God hallelujah amen thank God Amen I want to read the church age but yeah all that Zeal right I'm gonna read the seal book you got all that zeal you're back on fire again you got your first love again how many I don't understand what I'm saying I'm gonna go listen that marriage in divorce I'm gonna go listen to trying new God of service without it being his will you got your first love back Hallelujah member Church the Bible says in second Peter 1 3 according as his divine power is given unto us all things that pertain to life and godliness God has given us all things we need to live a Christian life but the Bible says we've got to give all of our diligence so let's just put that up there uh second Peter 1 5. uh Malachi we go back there I think Acacia stepped out for a moment she's probably serving one of the little lambs back there the Bible said in uh II Peter 1 5. and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge there's very cheap there she smiled Daddy's you're like that sermon I'm glad he did Hallelujah I still remember that so God's given you every blessing but to get it it's conditional you've got to give all of your time and energy to it we can stand here and Shout thank God he's given all this time but then thank God he's giving me everything I could ever want but now you've got to give something to get it it's conditional and I heard of someone on this I want to preach this too every time God gave a promise it was always conditional almost every time remember the one uh Solomon prays Solomon said If my people humble themselves and pray and call out to God I'll hear their prayer from heaven and I'll heal the heal their land let me know what I'm talking about that famous prayer If my people who were called by my name will humble themselves and pray I'll forgive their sins and heal their land right but what's the first word in that promise if if right if like I was telling my barber the other day oh yeah yesterday when I got my haircut I was telling them we're talking about abortion and I said I said you know there's I think there's eight or nine states that have no more abortion they've estimated that I think 20 or 30 000 babies lives have been saved that powerful Thirty A Thousand Lives have been saved and he was saying well that might that might mean they just take their abortions to other heirs well they might they might but they might not right and I said either way there's less sin being done in those States so when there's less sin there's more of God is that right that's what God's saying heal their land and I told him I said I'm praying that for Ohio and we got a first chance to vote for it right we got a first chance of vote in November to keep all this trans nonsense out and this abortions up to birth we got our first chance not only our prayers but we got to do with our votes too right right if you don't believe in that then you don't believe that our founding fathers did the right thing by giving their lives to give us these freedoms they could have sat back and said well just trust God to do it we'll just trust God to give us the freedom that yeah well they did trust God when they went and got their guns out too right George Washington just didn't say well if God wants us to beat the British we'll defeat him you know God God will do it all no George Washington went out there and prayed he went out there and led the the soldiers in the battle how many want to be soldiers for God Amen do something about it praise God call upon God and do as much good as you possibly can praise God so God's given you all things but you've got to give all of your desire you got to give all your diligence to God to get him right just like if you're at a vending machine right if you're in a vending machine all those things are given to you but you got to give something up to get it right you got to give something up whatever you want you got to give something up to God it's it's all free right there that's all free but it's all available and God says draw not to me I'll draw an eye to you feels like we're a little tired today is everybody a little tired today looking forward to going to bed early tonight or something like that I was a little tired today huh now go if you would uh First Kings 12 25. I know what that's like Dude I agree First Kings uh 12 25. I step in today so I'm feeling pretty good maybe you couldn't sleep in First Kings 12 25. now one thing about jeroboam I want to bring out if you don't remember this jeroboam was up north he was far away from the temple of God and remember God said there's only one place I'm placing my name and that's at the ark the house of God I'll put my name in other place you can't pray to any other place you can't sacrifice any other place there's one place for our place my name and brother we haven't come and preach it and said there's one provided place of worship that's Jesus Christ amen it's not Jeffersonville it's not Akron Ohio there's one place it's Jesus Christ it's God's own son Hallelujah so listen to that one if you haven't listened to that one lately God's provided a place to worship if I can't point you to denomination if God hasn't placed his name in the nomination he said where am I going to appoint you to he said I can't point you to the Branham Tabernacle we're just as bad off as any of them in other words you can't trust in a church to save you you got to trust in Jesus Christ to save you praise God that's God's provided place of worship Hallelujah so look at this instead of being united instead of jeroboam being united with a rehoboam and with all of Israel he says he was fearful that he would lose his kingdom so what does he do he sets up Idols where the people can go worship and sacrifice to God he sets up gods in other words exactly what Moses said not to do right Moses said don't make any Graven image right and then he goes exactly against what Solomon said do now I'm gonna verse 27 here's what he says in his heart if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord of Jerusalem then shall the heart of this people will turn again unto their lord even an arabome king of Judah and they shall kill me and go again to rehoboam King of Judah in other words if my people go visit this other Church is that right I'm going to lose all my people so I better set up Gods I've always said like this if you'd like to go somewhere else that's fine just leave this church in peace leave us in peace because we want you to be on Beast too Hallelujah I've never asked anybody to come to this church I never begged anybody to come to church now you got to go to church we just want the people that God wants to be here praise God as I've said many times but jeremon got so uh insecure I'm going to lose all my people I better break the word of God and set up a way where I can keep them under my control see a real man of God knows that the people have to let God control their lives they have to choose to let God control their lives I cannot control your life I can reach the word of God tell you probably pray about this but ultimately it's your choice praise God hallelujah it's your choice it's my choice it's my choice the Bible said a an elder leads by example watch my life that's why I try to give testimonies in my life when I went through difficult times I tried to make sacrifices and trusting God and every time God was faithful praise God he's still faithful praise God Hallelujah now verse 28 whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold and said unto them it is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem Behold thy Gods o Israel which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt and he said one in Bethel and the other he put in Dan so here he goes to the he goes with this deception of you know it's too hard to worship it's too far to drive to church church is too long the preacher preaches way too long you haven't seen nothing brother every six hours I haven't reached half of that to you ever I don't even know the longest server I ever preacher maybe two hours maybe I know maybe it might seem long to some of us but that's another brand most of his servants are at least three hours long most of them but see here it gets it gets on the people he tries to make it easier on the people oh it's too hard there's excuses you really can't obey even though Simon said that you can't obey that just compromise all right just just cut out a few Corners here you don't have to obey all the word of God no we've got to obey the saith the Lord Hallelujah now brother Brandon used this verse uh to show removal from the name's book of life so occasions we switch over on a show this again just as a reminder I thought this would be important to show because uh Gerald everyone set up these Idols in Dan and listen Dan let him set it up the people of Dan let this Idol be set up church let me say like this you don't have to let Idols be set up in your life you don't have to compromise you're called to be a king you're called to rule your house the church said amen you don't have to let sinful things come in your house it's your house you're called to rule over praise God Hallelujah like as a leader as a man I can say this is happening this isn't happening Hallelujah I got that right it's my house I'm accountable for my house but Dan let it go oh it's gonna be easier on everybody but also there's the other side part of worship is sacrifice Jeremy was like you don't need to sacrifice so much but part of worship is sacrifice and the church said so here's the tribes that came out um here's The Tragically I'm sorry when they went to Egypt here's when they came out God took out Levi and Joseph and put it Ephraim in NASA I'm sorry put in Ephraim a day no I I got this mixed up pardon me no I took out Levi yeah Levi and Joseph were put out because he went to the priesthood and Joseph's two sons reported and that's obvious now Here's Where We Are we walking out because Dan let those Idols get set up his name was taken off of The Book of Life for Israel his tribe is taken off and there will be no tribe of Dan uh in the 144 000. think about that no tribe of Dan all because his ancestors think about that church some of our decisions impact our children if we're not careful some of our decisions may impact our grandchildren if the Lord's Aries now I know we're all looking for the Rapture who is it but every generation that's fast it's still still going on so we got it like right so you gotta plant your potatoes praise God it isn't until Ezekiel that Dan gets his name back in there what I'm trying to say is if we see items in our lives let's get them out of our land as soon as possible because if we do it proves our name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world praise God didn't Peter set up the idol of I bet we're better than Gentiles and it beat yourself that Idol is like I'm not going to eat with the Gentiles we're holier than them and what Paul had to come around and point out that night on his life you can't have that in your life it's going to struggle you it's going to make you fall that's how many appreciate when the Holy Spirit comes around and shows you your faults the idols you've set up in your life like I said usually it's family uh less money what's the other one I use from the other example maybe it's physicians in the church you know I forget the other ones where people leave oh business yeah they set up these idols and if they're not careful it takes them away from God but we're not gonna let that happen how many how many will not let that happen you've got the power to do it you're a king you're a priest under God not only can you rule over it but you can pray or pray to God to remove it out of your life praise God because you're a priest Hallelujah all right I'm gonna try to find a place to close it's almost 12 here that'd be an hour and a half okay that's that's about my usual hour ahead um yeah I want to go through just a couple more examples how many enjoyed the word of God today a little bit of a review here but I hope it was helpful like I said now I'm gonna get the ones that were kind of even some of those with rainbow and we're really fresh and encouraging to me so I'm thinking wow now I've been pastoring 17 years what is my testimony brother Ben brother Jose I wonder what my testimony is in heaven what does God say about me has Jesse walked in the ways of Saint Paul I hope so for all these 17 years well one way for sure I know I can look at my life and line it up to the word of God I trust that's what it says by God's grace I don't want to be like Ray of Omer Jesse served God you know for 12 years but then after that he kind of left the truth I don't want that kind of testimony I want to testimony that I serve God all the days of my life praise God I did not let idols be set up in my lives and I did not bow down to any other God other than the god of creation the Lord Jesus Christ see like I said the the people they'll bow to their families family is more important than coming to the house of God or yeah here's another one uh they bow to uh they bow to oh we're too tired we can't drive to the this message church is too far away and then they'll go to churches where the women cut their hair and wear pads and makeup you know like well what's more valuable a little bit of sleep or hearing the truth and being around Saints of like Precious faith because you know if they compromise on makeup hair and pants they're going to let all these other things in you know don't you know you should know the parable a little eleven eleven's a whole lot praise God now let's go to our text here second chronicles 13 18. second chronicles 13 18. now what I love about the Kings I've always loved about the Kings is that God gives us a basic overview of their lives right he kind of gives us a summary of their lives like David he did all that God wanted to except in the case of Uriah and Saul Saul served God at the beginning to end but he really wasted the middle of his life and then God had to take him off the earth I just love the the summaries of that because God God's Gonna summarize summarize our lives one way or another it's either going to be well done good and faithful servant or something else let's make sure it's well done good in Fable serving amen like remember brother Simon said on Wednesday some people can see the truth some people can't and he said why is it because God loves us more why does God love us more because we love God more does the Bible say the Bible says to whom God I'm sorry to uh to whoever God whoever is forward to God God is forward to them whoever loves God God will love them so by four Nows God knew you'd love him more brother Austin that's why he called you and Lena beloved Hallelujah see ya all right they help me in Beatrice we can say it about everybody God loves you more because he knew you'd love him more praise God because God is going to give you the desire of your heart in other words if you want to be a wise virgin God will let you have it if you want to be a foolish version God will let you have that like I told that sister from the former Amish church I said she said well God let the Rapture go if I want to go in it I said absolutely not because you're a part of the Rapture the very fact you want to go in the Rapture shows you're going to be in it praise God is that right if you want to be in it if you want to be in the ark don't you think God would leave the dark door open until you got in don't you think of course God knew he knew and no one else would want to get in and then he closed the door but all those that want to get in the ark got in the ark all those that went the Holy Ghost will get it praise God all those who want to go on the Rapture will get it thank God Hallelujah God's got a white robe for you and I Hallelujah if we want it God has a white robe for us Hallelujah Glory second chronicles 13. now we read 18 for our text now I want to read verse one though second chronicles 13 1. now in the 18th year of King jeroboam again abide you to Reign Over Judah and he reigned three years in Jerusalem his mother's name was also machaya the daughter of Uriah of gibia and there was war between abijah and jeroboam and if I just set the battle in a raid with an army of valiant Men of War even 400 000 chosen men jeroboam also said 800 000 chosen men did you catch that abijah has half the number of soldiers as jeroboam Hallelujah anybody ever feel like you're surrounded by the enemy and there's more of them that's with us it seems like but we know the scripture amen there's more with us than With the Enemy praise God because God fights for us praise God brother Chris Jericho yes everyone's enemy in this one yes brother good so the enemies got Jerome was one that said those two golden calves so instead he let the people worship idols instead of going down and worshiping the true God in Jerusalem good yes so he got four he's got 400 000 abides a good guy against 800 000 double with the bad guy jeroboam now when he's surrounded let's look at jeroboam's prayer look at verse 8. and now you think to withstand the kingdom of the Lord in the hand of the sons of David and he'd be a great multitude and there with you golden calves which jeroboam made you for Gods so jeroboam I'm sorry abides is crying out to God and church look what he prays when he prays he gives the exact details that the other sins that the enemies did and then I love it he gives the exact details of how he's walking with God in other words he points out how the enemy has done Wicked but he points out to God he said God in other words remember all the obedience I've given to you is there anything wrong with that I don't think so God honored it Hallelujah did it Hezekiah do that remember when Hezekiah got sick what'd he do Isaiah said thus saith the Lord set your house in order you'll die what do you do brother bang Hezekiah threw herself to the wall and said God remember me I've served you with a pure heart all these years what am I telling you when you're in trouble call on God and bring to God's remembers now God's not going to forget but it helps you bring to God remembrance of all that you've done for him praise God in other words pour out your heart before God like so Farina Lina could say Lord I've left oh I've left all my family I've crossed this nation to follow this man that you give me this bridegroom it's fresh bridegroom and fresh group a fresh bride in other words you call if you're in a difficult situation call on God rehearse your testimony praise God remember who you are of the bride of Christ he says Lord I'm surrounded I have half of the soldiers but remember they set up idols right remember they set up Idols I didn't do that I've serve you with the Pure Heart praise God I didn't go to those dirty movies I didn't cut my hair sisters I didn't go on the pornography Channel Brothers right I didn't do those things I didn't sell out my soul for money I didn't sell out anything rehearse to God your obedience and God it will it will stir up your heart it'll stir up the fact that God has favor for you praise God hmm go down to verse 9. have you not cast out the priests of the Lord now look he goes into more sins that jeroboam did first he built the calves and then they cast out the priests of the Lord the sons of Aaron Levites in a made you priest after the manner of nations of the other lands you got denominational preachers in other words that's what the enemy's done they have Idols they they rejected the real preachers but go to verse 10. but as for us let's all say us ready us the Lord Is Our God and we have not forsaken him so Church what am I saying when you're surrounded in Trials you you cry out to God like this King amen and say remember Lord remember what I've done remember how I've honored you I've done my best I'm serving you now I'm calling on you I need you to move in my life praise God Amen great lessons from these Kings Hallelujah but it's lessons for us we're spiritual Kings and Priests unto God and God hears our prayers too Hallelujah how many how many you could pray that today and say Lord I've served you with a perfect heart of Integrity we can say it by The Blood church we can say it if we confessed all of our sins up to now we've served god with a perfect heart the Bible said about David the Bible said that about Hezekiah sir god with a perfect heart under the blood of bulls and goats what about us on the blood of Jesus Christ perfect just means complete you've given your life completely to Christ Church you have that right as a Christian Lord I've served you with the perfect heart I need Deliverance I did it this week brother Austin I cried out for a specific need and God brought it through Emma we'll have to share that testimony later I was crying in my closet I'm like God I need you to move I need something and I didn't even know how I didn't have no idea what's going to happen like this no idea at all you know why I was crying you know you know I was doing that because I just read it in the Bible the Bible told me cry out to God rely on God when kings are surrounded when kings like brother Jesse the king I'm a spiritual King of my home when I'm surrounded I cry out to God I said God I've served you all these 17 years I preached your gospel 19 years I'm almost at 20. in January I've got 20 years I'm preaching this glorious gospel and brother Chris I wish I could have preach it 20 years longer amen I wish you could have preaching my whole life it's been a joy it's an absolute privilege to serve Jesus Christ because it's joy unspeakable full of Glory it's peace it's Joy it's long-suffering it's victory hallelujah it's all things every spiritual blessing is for you and I praise God amen look what he says we have not forsaken you God verse 10. and the priests which minister unto the Lord are the sons of Aaron and the Levites wait upon their business and they burn unto the Lord every morning and every evening and burnt sacrifices and sweet incense the shoe bread also set they in order upon their pure table and the Candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof to burn every evening for we keep the charge of the Lord Our God but ye have forsaken him and behold God himself is with us for our captain amen oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus Christ is your captain today who's fighting your battles Christ is crisis Hallelujah I'm just a minor King but he's the king of all Kings Hallelujah you and I are spiritual Kings but we're ruling under the King of Kings the Lord Jesus Christ see you can point this out you can tell God God I read my Bible and prayed this week God I went to church this week amen hallelujah I follow the true five-fold Ministry this week see you can cry to God say God I've done this hear my prayer God you're my captain I'm surrounded I feel like I'm insufficient I need you to deliver me praise God and you can point out the lies on the other side that's against you I've done that when I've had people come against me I pray and said God this sister lied and this sister said that Lord and remember me I didn't lie they lied on me Lord I did not lie on them and guess what God Vindicated it by the people coming to apologize repent to me and the church said just like that bring it up in prayer the enemy's done this they rejected you they haven't done you know they've done all these things but Lord I've kept the charge I've stayed through the word of God I've not forsaken you how can I forsake Jesus when he's never forsaken me praise God Amen think about that how could I forsake Jesus he's never forsaken me he's never left me he's always been with me praise God like I love that song I believe that brother Phil put out Jesus I love the bridge of that how could I ever walk away from the one who saved my life oh I'll never be ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ how could I ever walk away from the one that saved my life Hallelujah how could I ever walk away from the one who forgave me of all my sins washed my past away and my children never got to see it thank God Hallelujah thank God I'll never walk away I started with a perfect heart I haven't been perfect but my heart my soul's been perfect Hallelujah because the blood of Jesus Christ has forgiven all my sins amen and church you and I can say the same thing Hallelujah that's why when we call on god let's be specific in our prayers let's remind god of the evils of the other side and let's remind God of all that we've tried to do oh who's your Captain George let's all say Jesus can we say Jesus Jesus Jesus Is My Captain I might be surrounded I might look like I'm gonna fail but no God I've been faithful the best I can I prayed I fasted I've gone to church I've said amen I pay my tithes come on church I pay my offerings you got reasons to believe he'll fight for you praise God amen the thing we do is we've got to cry out to God and you'll see what this is all about this is why I put the sermon title Kings must rely on the Lord he says let's finish verse 12 there can you pull up 12. second chronicles 13 12 maybe hold God himself is with us for our captain and his priest was sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you oh children of Israel fight ye not against the Lord God of your fathers for he shall not prosper he said this is not right this is my own Brethren coming down against me this is not right but jeroboam calls an ambushment to come about behind them so that they were before Judah and the ambushment was behind them so the real the one who's innocent is surrounded before and behind he's just surrounded by enemies there's no way out but there is a way out the devil wants to make him think there's no way out but God always has a way out praise God hallelujah there's always a way out verse 14 I want you to look back behold the battle was before and behind and they cried now what'd they do they Cried unto God they started praying they started seeking God Hallelujah they're surrounded they only have half the number of soldiers they're surrounded before behind everywhere is trouble but they don't have to be that way praise God hallelujah it might look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by Angels Hallelujah I'm surrounded by Angel armies Glory we looked at that a few weeks ago then the men of Judah gave a whisper gave a shout and as a man of Judah shouted and came to pass that God smoked jeroboam and all Israel before abijah and Judah just like just like Joshua you want the victory cry out to God and Shout some praise Hallelujah that's what I did this week I went there and prayed to God to come to church I shouted the praise of God Amen in other words forget about your problems worship God trust in God make your requests on unto God and let God fight your battles Hallelujah hey man I don't know how he does it but like we sang he'll do it again praise God I don't know how he does it but I'm glad he does it brother bang Hallelujah he's looking at our hearts are we serving God with the perfect heart and all that means is you confess your sins daily get Victory and you start getting more good days rather than bad days Hallelujah I'll say that again you start getting more good days than bad days Glory you got lots more good days and they just keep getting gooder right Lydia gooder's not a word to her they keep getting gooder all the time my brother Brooks used to say that Glory they do Church so you keep walking the victory of God so how does it end God smoked jeroboam and these they look at listeners how many of the 800 000 died and the children of Israel fled before Judah and God delivered them into their hand in verse 17 and abiding his people slew them with a great Slaughter so they're fell down the slain of Israel 500 000 chosen men so 500 000 out of the 800 000 died because they were idolaters that's a lot of people that's a lot of carcasses how did abide to get the victory prayed the people cried out to God and they they reminded the Lord here's all the evils that they've done here's all the good that I've done and the church said you need to remind God Church it'll be encouragement to you remind God I remind God lord I preach this message 19 years I remind God of that right I've been faithful how many of you see me skip church and lay at home when I should be at church who sees me do that who sees me complain when I gotta preach and song Lead and teach and do everything like that whoever sees me complain I don't complain because it's a joy to serve God I know that it's a joy to serve God why because I've served the devil I know what that's like it's a joy to serve Jesus Christ hallelujah amen I feel like dancing praise God Amen Hallelujah I dance for the devil but now I dance for Jesus Christ Hallelujah and I'm free indeed brother bang I'm free indeed Hallelujah Glory so 500 out of the 800 000 are slain Verse 18 was our text thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time and the children of Judah prevailed because they relied upon the Lord God of their fathers I better stop there I'm almost getting towards two hours here so by the time we sing Everything it might be two hours now I'm not going to go there but the reason I said rely that word rely is because a couple Kings later Asa has a great walk with God but then he makes a mistake and when he has a battle he relies upon the king of Syria rather than God and he loses the battle in other words he put his confidence in a man rather than God how many want to put their confidence in God today let's send our feet musicians can come in case you put up Hebrews 10 35. I think sister Nomi used this in her testimony I'm not sure sister but I think that you're a third part of your testimony I don't know and we'll have to look back on the podcast the Bible said cast not away therefore your what Your Reliance on God you can't rely on anything else but God praise the Lord we have to have full trust full confidence in Jesus Christ how many want to have confidence in Christ you can see two kings I didn't read the ace one maybe I'll preach that or maybe teach that in the Bible say this is evening but we did preach on abijah abijah reminded god of the evils of the other side he reminded God of his faithfulness and then he shouted prayed cried out to God God delivered him just like Hezekiah remember God I have served you with a perfect heart amen although all that means is I was tempted to go back to the world but I refused I'm serving Jesus Christ Church by God's grace we serve him with the perfect heart we confess all of our faults and remember if you confess all your sins right now you are forgiven right now of everything if you've confessed it now but sometimes God wants to see us with a broken spirit that means we really feel sorry for our sins when we're broken before God how many believe that let's bow our heads here Kings must rely on the Lord Heavenly Father Lord we're just happy to be in your house today thank you for a man like abijah I know he wasn't a perfect King Lord one lesson it gives us reminds me of Hezekiah Lord God when we go through battles Lord God [Music] and we seem overwhelmed there is a way out Lord thank you for reminding your people your beloved bride today thank you for reminding all of us me included [Music] that when we feel like we're surrounded there is a way out there is Mercy in God [Music] thank you [Music] Lord I feel inspired Lord because this week I even prayed something very similar to this Lord I've been faithful Lord I've done this I need you to move thank you for moving Lord God [Music] Lord these are the Sheep of your pasture these are your people I pray Lord that your spirit now will guide them Lord to trust you guide them to call Upon Your Name Lord God may they remember Lord God the promises of God may they rehearse the testimonies in their lives I've served you with the perfect heart I need you to move Lord God I've trusted you I've given you all these years I've given you these sacrifices remember me just like the thief on the cross Remember Me Jesus when you come into your kingdom Lord God Hallelujah Lord I say we all want to be remembered Lord this morning remember us Lord God as we go through our battles Lord God fight for us Lord Jesus just as you fought for abiding Lord totally outnumbered it seemed but not in God's sight you fought for Hezekiah [Music] we thank you God for your mercy I remember you fought for Jehoshaphat Lord God surrounded by multiple enemies and called upon you he prayed he fasted he sought your face and you heard from Heaven Lord God thank you for this sermon today thank you for this worship that we have Lord thank you for our visitor brother Chris the Lord God hallelujah thank you Jesus for this opportunity in your house today we need you Lord God we have trials we're tempted with idols we're tempted to sin Lord God that we need your grace to overcome Lord God we need victory in our battles Lord God we thank you God for your blessings they would be strong in the Lord now may we receive the promise of God may we give all diligence as you've given every good and perfect spiritual gift we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name and the saint said [Music] I'm no longer [Music] I am a child [Music] [Music] let's see that second person [Music] call me to this guy [Music] [Applause] [Music] I never thought [Music] I am surrounded [Music] by Beyond [Music] I am surroundings [Music] foreign [Music] now I'll Stand dancing [Music] [Music] yes I am a child of God I know [Music] let's take the Lord Hallelujah the joy to serve the Lord if anyone desires prayer you're more than welcome to come here we'll continue to Worship the Lord friends the scripture has all the answers for us praise God all these answers we need an Earthly Journey the Bible has got it for us Kings must rely on the Lord how many have confidence in Christ today you put our full trust our full confidence in Jesus Christ today Hallelujah let's sing trust and Obey let's see not him trust and Obey when we walk with the Lord in the light of his word we just have to trust and Obey praise God [Music] is God [Music] [Music]
