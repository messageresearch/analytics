blood of the Lamb and praise the Lord amen thank you Jesus praise God let's take our Bibles let's go to Revelation chapter 4 like to speak on part 4 of Revelation chapter 4 tonight I'd like to only look at the twelve sons of Israel tonight and how they kind of connect to the 12 apostles but this morning I just want to lay a groundwork for that by the grace of the Lord revelation chapter 4 verse 4 and our text will be verses as well by the grace of the Lord Revelation chapter 4 verse 4 then we'll read 10 and 11 why don't we just read verse 4 as a congregation we can all read verse 4 together and then I'll read verse 10 11 let's begin on three one two three and round about the throne were four and 20 seats and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold I'll read 10 11 myself the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship Him that liveth for ever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne saying thou art worthy O Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created amen let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer if ever need on your heart again just make it known unto God Heavenly Father we value this time Lord this time is of utmost importance it's the first day of the week Lord it reminds us of the day you rose from the dead dear God and Father we just gather in your name Lord to give you our worship to give you our love and Lord we know we'll receive the same back Lord in fact Lord we receive it as as new every morning Lord God and you loved us before we loved you while we were sinners you died the righteous for the unrighteous we ask that you speak to us today through your word Lord God used me I'm just a nobody a vessel of clay Lord just used me for thy purpose bless every heart may the ears be hungry and ready to hear Lord and help me as well Lord God to be hungry and thirsting for more of righteousness help us all or do a supernatural work this morning dear God for thy glory for we need to hear your voice Oh God and it will immediately put us in the spirit when we hear your voice so we're grateful Lord and father we give you all the glory honor and praise this morning in Jesus Christ's name and the Saint said Amen god bless should be in seated praise the Lord well it's good to be with you in the house of Lord and I was looking for the Lord to bless us here in His divine presence as we said we're going to look at the four and twenty elders this morning and then tonight we'll look a little bit further at em we'll look at you know Reuben all the way down to Benjamin we'll look at them this evening by the grace of the Lord at four o'clock so I've been enjoying this those series here and I just been listening over and over and over to the Prophet preached these sermons you know from 1961 and the inspiration from this message of course comes from the the new year's service on Sunday morning and it was January 1st 1961 so I keep missing that that's part two of his series on Revelation chapter four so a lot of my inspiration is coming from that message this morning if you like to listen to it yourselves or or however you like to do it okay so our text was verse four and then I read 10 and 11 to kind of give us a little bit more of an insight on these four and twenty elders now the first thought which is I'm going to spend most probably the entire service on this thought is that the Prophet said where the Bible speaks I saw four and twenty elders sitting and I think I'll probably just spend this whole sermon on these three thoughts the Prophet takes the rest of the service he finishes this service with this thought right here that the twenty-four elders are not angels then he defines an elder and then his third point he kind of ends the sermon with his elders rule in the future Kingdom so that's what those are the revelations that the Prophet teaches there through this sermon so I trust it'll be a blessing to you I'm gonna set my timer all right we can begin here so the first thought is the 24 elders are not angels these are quotes from that sermon the Prophet said I want you to notice they're not angelic beings angels are not associated heavenly beings are not associated with crowns and Thrones see they never associated their angels they never did overcome which is interesting because we know they didn't fall to Lucifer's Church split in the beginning so they were able to overcome that but it's not the same kind of overcoming as you and I must do it's a different kind of overcoming because we were fallen beings and they were unfallen right they were the Bible said they were in their first estate right they left not their first estate but we had fallen many of us or all of us except Adam and he basically were born in sin right except for Adam and Eve all of us were born in sin shaped and iniquity come to the world speaking lies but angels were in their first estate and so they never had to overcome like you and I am said if you notice a little a later on the songs that they sang the things they did prove that they wasn't they sung the song of redemption so angels don't need to be redeemed alright they were redeemed men now I'm not gonna read all these but if you want to write them down if you want to study on the word he basically took the word Redemption and traced it through the concordance he said if you want to take some he said digna a Matthew 19:28 revelation 3:21 revelation 20 verse 4 revelation 2:10 1st Peter 5 2 and 4 2nd Timothy 4:8 that will let you know they were redeemed I want to go through that this morning you see and you could just comb it for weeks you see so brother Brandon of course just hitting the highlights because brother Branham and I could do the same thing this morning I coulda took each of these scriptures and preached them and then we could have spent one service on just that quote right there because those are all scriptures that back up that the only people that are redeemed are blood-bought Saints right fallen human beings who are brought back by the blood of Jesus and the Bible says regenerated by the Holy Ghost amen regenerated amen reom powered right anointed for the purpose of God now I want to point out brother man makes this statement next and program gives us a rule for rightly dividing the word of God not interesting this is a prophet and he tells us this is how you rightly divide the word of God he said you must consider every detail in the scripture so before you make a determination you've got to really read over a portion of Scripture and he said you've got to point out and consider every detail so let's look at this quote he said they were not angelic beings they were not heavenly beings they were redeemed men he said see you can consider their dress the way they were dressed you can consider their position what they had you consider the songs what they saying and know that they were not angelic beings hmm so brother Han said this is how you interpret the Word of God you've got to look at more than just one little thought in the scripture you've got to consider everything the Bible says and then when you have that when you consider all that you've got to let the Holy Spirit guide you to scriptures to show you what the truth of the matter is and so that's what the Prophet did there's churches that teach the outers were angels these 24 elders there are angels in brother Graham's kind of hammering and said they didn't consider all these other things we've got to consider all the Word of God amen like you know my friend recently here my friend and I disagreed on women preachers and I said well there is no woman preacher and he said what about Deborah and what about all these I said there's they're not preachers they're just prophesying and so I was basically sharing with him I said you if you go in the New Testament Jesus never called a woman to be an apostle paul said i don't paul said i never allow a woman to have authority above a man and so I'm basically telling him you need to consider all these other scriptures you have to consider the whole witness of the scripture and so because the Bible says you know that a woman can prophesy but the Bible says are all prophets and of course know and prophesying is different than preaching prophesying is foretelling the future preaching is teaching the Word of God it's declaring the Word of God having authority in a congregation of believers it's different from prophesy prophesying can be done any where anyplace but in a gathering of saints there's a man who has the authority led by the Holy Spirit and he he's having authority over the people because it's not his authority he doesn't rule by his thoughts he rules by the word amen and so I was sharing with my friend you've got to consider this and consider that I was praying for him this morning that God would open his heart so buh-bam tells us this is how you rightly divide the word you must consider every detail now look at the details brother Graham points out I just highlighted them in both their seats they're sitting on Thrones and their crowns of gold so I just pointed those out to you you have to look at every detail that's describing some group or individual before you make a determination about which group it is amen now if we jump ahead to chapter 5 though the Bible said that they take the book and the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of the saints and they sent a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us here's the 24 elders saying we were redeemed we were bought by the blood the blood purchased sinners the blood didn't purchase angels the angels were already created right but the blood had to purchase you and I we were strangers and as Gentiles we were active we were actually foreigners to the will of God we were without hope without God lost we were strangers of the promises but the blood brought us near to God amen glory we were aliens we had nothing to do with Jews there were no connection to God but the blood of Jesus Christ brought us back amen redeemed us to God hallelujah now I want to inject this thought here because this is a thought that some people wonder about we must consider every detail on the gentile group from revelation 7:9 through 17 is this the wise virgin or the foolish virgin now just so you know brother Branham gives four quotes on it that I can find there could be more I could be I could be in need of finding more quotes but three of the quotes say it was the wise virgin and one quote sent the foolish virgin and I had somebody email me from Africa and they said how can you teach it I believe it's the wise virgins you teach it was the foolish virgin because brother Graham in the seven seals said it's the it's the I'm sorry how could you teach us the wise virgin because brother Brahim said in the seven seals it was the foolish and I said I just tried to humbly say well because there's three quotes that say it was the wise and threes more than one and there's twice after there's twice after the seventh seal where brother ham said it is the wise version so if he says something here then twice as in later afterwards I just tend to go with that thought so let's go through those the first time I can find it is in 1960 right during the church ages series wrote and said if you want to see the bride come up after that the 144,000 so after the hundred forty-four thousand the bride will come up just continue to read on down now in the seventh chapter and then he reads about what we're gonna read in just a moment he says what does your wife do she serves you in the house you sit down she gives you your food she fixes the clothing she serves you day and night in the house and this one these of all nations the Gentiles which is the bride are before the throne of God with him day and night I'll remember what we said last night and talked on it amen aren't you glad church that every day of your life you get to serve Christ on this earth a lot of church members will serve them on Sunday or if they have a special fundraiser they'll serve that day but then they'll live and send the rest of the week but you and I we serve him every single day we don't take a day off and because we serve Him every day here we'll serve Him in heaven amen because awhile real genuine life doesn't take a day off she does good to her husband all the days of her life amen now we're jumping ahead now to after the church a after the seven seals to this message on questions and answers in 64 - brother branham will the prophet of Malachi 4 be the one to call off the Gentile remnant of revelation 7:9 even though they go through the tribulation period brother Brandon corrects them this is after the the seals he says no no no revelation 7 is where he's seen 144,000 sealed and after that he saw coming up coming back was that great number which no man could number which was the bride so there's the second quote where the Prophet says revelation 7:9 214 is the Bride of Christ not the foolish virgin here is the third and final one that I found brother Branham reads revelation 70 says God is talking about the bride here you want to see another picture of her it's over in Revelation 7 4 through 17 and he reads the text which we'll read in just a moment now here's the only quote where the Prophet said it was the foolish virgin so we remember it's 3 verse 1 which is okay you know either it could be more out there but right now it looks like 3 verse 1 the Prophet said the first thing was that the sleeping virgin had to go through the tribulation period for purification she had to be purged of her sins of unbelief and rejecting the message this she was done in the tribulation period we see they wind up over here revelation 7 between the 6 and 7 chapter now that she had been purged and she'd been given her robes now let's do it the brother Han just said let's consider every scripture in revelation 7 9 to 14 so you don't have to get your Bibles if you want to you can but I just decided to put it up here might be a little easier for you to follow along so this is the text some people say oh this is the foolish virgin I believe it's the wise virgins it's the bride and I have a three scriptural proofs for that but member we have to consider every detail how many want to consider every detail in the Word of God and after this I beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number of all nations and Kindred's and people and tongues stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in their hands and cry with a loud voice saying salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb now we get the first clue because of the white the washed robes they already have wash robes can everybody see that this group is without number there from every nation there's black there there's white there's yellow every nation there they got palms and they're worshiping God and praising Jesus and they've already got their robes can everybody see that and one of the elders answer is send to me so one of the outers one of the 24 elders I wonder which one it was was it Peter who was it John was it John was it Ruben was a Benjamin was the Judah one of the outers said which are they which I'm sorry what are these which are arrayed in white robes and whence came they and I sent them Sir thou knowest and he said to me these are they which came out of Great Tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb now the first point I'm sorry the one thing you need to know is that Oh some people say see it says tribulation so so that can't be the bride but you've got to consider every scripture in the Bible the Bible said all the saints go through tribulation and you can read that in acts 14:22 Romans 5:3 second Corinthians one for first Estonian 3:32 for second Timothy 3:12 says that all that live godly in christ shall suffer persecution so see it's what we got to understand all the Word of God so the first point that proves this is not the foolish virgin is that the foolish virgin would not have their white robes yet and you say prove that to me sure it's in the fifth seal because remember their souls under the altar and the fifth seal they're Jews and they're crying how long how long and the Bible said they don't have white robes yet because they're asking for revenge when will you avenge our blood 1 and the Bible said after that then white robes were given unto them so they do not have eternal life yet in other words the Jews cannot be born again because they're blind to Jesus Christ as the Messiah so they can't be baptized with the Holy Ghost because brother Graham tells us this now listen it is the second resurrection so not the rapture it's the white throne judgment that the souls under the altar are set forth in the fifth seal are given white robes and of course eternal life or the else there would be no point of white robes so see these in Revelation 7 I believe it's the wise diversion because they've already gotten their white robes the wise virgin the Jews and the foolish virgin won't have white robes until the white throne judgment brother Branham says it again he says there's another class their names are also in the book of life and they come up in the second resurrection such are the foolish virgins and the righteous as our spoken of in Matthew 25 in this class also are those who do not worship the Beast or become involved in the Antichrist system but die for their faith even though they were not in the bride not having been born again but they will come up in the second resurrection and go into eternal life amen to further clarify no specifically the words of Matthew 25 it does not say that a shepherd is literally separating sheep from goats but it is as a shepherd dividing sheep from goats so charge do you see the only real sheep the only true sheep of God are those who are born again today amen foolish virgin will meant to be safe but they're not true sheep because they're not truly born again they hear all different kinds of voices they follow all kinds of different voices and all kinds of different ideas in their life because they're foolish to the Holy Ghost they follow they want to they want to dabble a little bit with the world and they still want to have a church membership and that's why Jesus calls them foolish but a real wise Christian once the baptism of the Holy Ghost more than anything else and they will stop until they got it that's what makes them wise amen they forsake everything of the world anything foolish and make sure they are born again amen yes so that's a true sheep of God you're so humble you'll follow Jesus all the way to your own death and resurrection and redemption and baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right he says these are not sheep in this particular area of time the white throne judgment the Sheep err in his fold they heard his voice the word and they found him they have already have eternal life and cannot come into judgment but these do not have eternal life and they are in the judgment they are allowed to go into eternal life now upon what grounds do they enter into life eternal certainly not upon the fact that they already have his life as does the bride but they receive it because they were kind to his brethren they are not his brethren that would make them join heirs with Jesus they are not heirs to anything but life they share no throne etc with him their names must have been in the book of life and not removed now because of their love for the people of God they're recognized and saved no doubt they served and help the children of God perhaps like Nicodemus and gamaya they stood for the children in a time of trouble amen and that beautiful so the foolish version the only thing she inherits is eternal life the only thing she inherits is a white robe and the church said now let me bring it down here to nail it in now this is where it's gonna nail it down these are the last two points so the first one is they have white robes and that that means they already have eternal life they were already born to get on earth and now that they're in heaven now they've got a white robe because they're already born again the second point is who serves the husband but the wife because they serve and the Bible said therefore are they before the throne of God and serve Him day and night in his temple and he the sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them they shall hunger no more neither thirst any more neither shall the Sun light on them nor any Heat so the first point is that the the wise version she is the true wife of Christ and because she served him here on earth now shall serve him eternally in his presence that's right and third to me this is the most powerful one they are now notice in this scripture they are in his temple they're in a temple can everybody say amen to that remember brother I said consider where they are consider what they're wearing considering what they're saying consider everything about them and if you do that the Holy Ghost will teach you the truth amen so they're in his temple now I'm going to just jump past this brother BAM goes that Daniel 7 and shows how the Saints there there was a thousand st. thousand thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand ten times ten thousand stood before him the judgment was set in the book were open the Prophet says see it is the same scene for the thousand thousands who are ministering to him are the bride for who ministers to the husband but the wife Amen so they already have white robes which means they're already born again on earth second they serve God daily day and night so it has to be the life and third they are in his temple and I notice this is my note she's worshiping in the temple the foolish virgin do not live the Bible said they live not again until the white throne judgment and after that there is no more temple for the lamb is the temple in the New Jerusalem amen not to me that's the nail in the coffin right never for the other belief not that I want to kill any believer but I just don't think it's the truth because the Bible said in the New Jerusalem I saw no temple right I saw no temple for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the temple of it so these in Revelation 7 are in the temple with white robes serving God right by the throne the whole time to me that's got to be the wise virgin that's got to be his bride some people might say different but as always I'm open to correction I just like to see some scriptures they men and some something else to to disprove this wonderful truth that I believe that brother Branham said three times to give us the truth on that praise the Lord now this is just a moment but we just have a few moments on this thought brother Ram defines the elders he says what does an elder mean if you take the word elder he said I got all these definitions elder means the head of a city or the head of a tribe and elders a head of something like brother Nevel right now is the elder to this church what is he he's the head of the local body see the mayor of the city would be the elder of this city see the outer of the cities you remember back in the Bible times the elders of the city elder means the head of a city or the head of a tribe now brother Branham in the church age book tells us that elder is the same as a pastor which is the same as a bishop which is the same as an overseer this is why people get screwed up on positions right this is why the denominations get mixed up on call people they call women elders and they call bishops something different than a pastor but the word elder in the Bible and Bishop actually referred to the self same person it's the pastor of the local assembly Butler have said these bishops in the days of Paul they insisted that Paul had given the meaning that overseers were more than the local elder but they weren't overseers were bishops with official capacity only in his own church so a real local elder only has authority in the local church to them a bishop was now one with extended authority over many local leaders so see we can't make a bishop to have authority over anything outside a local church a bishop or overseer or elder has authority in one place and that's in the local church does everyone understand that I have no jurisdiction over any other Church other than this one right here I have no influence I know I have no authority over any other Church than right here because God has set me here as the local elder as the pastor the bishop our overseer that's what the scripture teaches here that's what brother Branham teaches as well so brother Branham had to teach this there's 24 elders and so these elders were all overseers it could have been in case of the sons of Jacob it was 12 sons of Jacob they were heads of tribes amen now but the 12 apostles of course were were bishops we know that now next this is the thought I'll probably spend the rest of the service on so about four to give me 40 more minutes by the grace of the Lord brother Branham ends this sermon his main thought is that elders will rule in the future Kingdom because these 24 elders are seated on Thrones and he says this he says how many was there there was 20 and 4 is that oh my who was it it was the 12 apostles and the 12 tribes of Israel the 12 patriarchs now we're going to take you right down to become in the other lessons and prove that to be right I'm glad you're writing it down the 12 patriarchs and the 12 tribes of Israel now watch Jesus said that okay I don't think there's any doubt in our minds as to who these 24 elders are but brother Branham had to teach his congregation it's the twelve sons of Jacob and it's the twelve apostles of Christ of course we know what Judas brought out and we believe st. Paul brought in we believe that now brother Branham teaches on this he said Peter asked Jesus one day what will we receive we have left father mother husband wife children everything else we've left everything Peter says we've left our wives our children our father mother home's lands to follow you and Jesus said verily verily I say unto you that you'll sit on twelve Thrones judging the twelve tribes there you are that's the redeemed the redeemed elders so we have the Twelve Apostles they were redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ the twelve sons of Jacob were not redeemed during their lifetime right they were under the sacrifice of bulls and goats but they were we know in the heart of the earth in paradise but then the blood of Jesus redeemed them then right they were redeemed by the blood of Christ so look at this is when Jesus says it Jesus taught this twice in the scripture he taught it this is the first time brother Bam's talking about Jesus taught this after the encounter with the rich young ruler he said again I say to you it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God when his disciples heard that they were exceedingly amazed saying who then can be saved but Jesus beheld them instead of them with men this is impossible but with God all things are possible now look at this the disciples in this entry this is kind of ever thought but isn't it interesting that his disciples realize how rich they were they realized how rich they were even in the Bible times because they said how could who can be saved then so see even though they weren't Laodicea they still felt rich is that right he said who can even be saved can we even be saved right so see even they realize how rich we are in church today we ought to realize how rich we are as well we're very blessed we're very fortunate we have everything we need whether we pay for by debt or by cash or whatever you have we can still get most things that we have need of and the disciples were shocked by this who can be saved if it's easier for a camel to get through an eye of a needle than a rich man to get to heaven who is going to be saying no where Jesus saying it's very hard to be saved because of the temptation of money but Jesus assures them with God all things are possible amen hallelujah and he was going to make this possible through the blood now he goes on to say then answered Peter said then behold we have forsaken all and followed thee what shall we have therefore so Peter saying you know the Raheel the rich young ruler won't sacrifice money but we've left everything what are we going to receive and Jesus said verily I say to you that ye which have followed me in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory ye also shall sit upon twelve Thrones this in judging the twelve tribes of Israel you catch that the apostles of Jesus would judge the other twelve tribes and I wonder if the heads of those tribes will be like their right hand man because they are judging so in other words maybe Peter would sit right above Ruben or something like that because Peter the apostles are going to judge all twelve tribes right so that means even in the New Jerusalem there's going to be twelve tribes of Israel oh how God loves Israel amen how he loves his people praise the Lord even though he blind he still was say that his love is going to return he's gonna graph them back in to that holy tree amen all the love of God and he says everyone that's forsaken houses brethren sisters father mother or wife or children or lands for my name's sake shall receive a hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life so now we know what a hundredfold is a hundredfold is ruling over groups of people so if you forsake everything houses lands families that is the hundredfold reward is being able to rule over large groups of people I like it amen so I destruct me when you forsake everyone God can trust you to rule over everyone I just struck me amen see Peter left everything he had life and everything behind there he left everything and because he forsook everything for Christ Christ says now you can rule over everything else that you left amen but many that are first shall be last and the last shall be first praise God I haven't studied on that so I don't know I'm not gonna say nothing about that I gotta study up on that I noticed Jesus preaches this twice he tells them you will judge the twelve tribes now remember they're just common fishermen right brogrammer said Peter was just a brawny big muscled fisherman you know he'd pulled the nets and he would he would do the business he'd do the money in the transaction and he was just a burly man some of them were tax collectors you know me this much money they had their they had their calculator you know of course we just dramatized it today they just had you know the beads that they would do what's that called the abacus they just had the advocates there that's all they did but they were willing to leave the abacus for Christ amen they're willing to leave the fishing nets for Christ these were just common men they were not great men but God chooses those twelve to lead over his kingdom of the twelve sons of Jacob because of all that they left for Christ so Jesus reassures them a second time the first time was after the rich young ruler where they thought who can be saved then and Jesus assured them you will judge the 12 tribes you've left everything you will get a reward for everything you've left aren't you glad Church you've got a reward over there we're not living for that but we're thankful that there is a reward because we've left everything dear to us to follow God's message of this hour amen the second time he has to reassure them is at the Last Supper but behold the hand of him that betrayed me is with me on the table so Judas was right there and true the Son of Man goeth as it was determined but woe unto them I'm sorry that man by whom he is betrayed and they began to enquire among themselves which of them it was that should do this thing and members during that time that Judas took the SOT from Jesus and Jesus said it's he told Johnny said it's the one that I give this out to so everybody else is saying Oh Lord is that you I don't feel like I've betrayed they were all searching their hearts and at a time where everybody's searching their hearts Judas is over there eating instead of searching his heart that's what we should do Church with the whole world is feasting today and making merry today we should be searching our hearts to make sure we're true to Christ having communion with Christ making sure we're pure we would never leave the message for anything because the message is God's Word amen but there Judas is well I'll just take another bite instead of searching his heart we need to search our hearts amen and the very next thing is an ark so Judas must have left and then pretty soon the other having communion can think of it this is supposed to be such a solemn time right this is such supposed to be such a holy time it's Jesus's Supper it's his last supper Don the disciples might not know that and after Judas leaves he must have went out got some more vidoes or he must so go get some more food or something like that help the poor after that they start looking around saying look at look at Bartholomew over there my ministry is ten times his I'm twice the preacher that Peter is imagine they're Jesus just washed their feet Peter said all just wash all of me they were so humbled a few minutes ago and now just a few minutes later now they're arguing about whose preacher who's the better preacher you know actually more Souls got healed under my ministry Peter than yours thank you imagine Jesus he just humbled himself and now they're busy exalting themselves churches shows what will happen without the baptism of the Holy Ghost Oh can't we hope it makes us see how important the baptism of the Holy Ghost is we can have a beautiful service like last Sunday or Wednesday any service we can have a glorious service and if we're not careful the very next service we can be carnal we can be upset of people in the church we can have communion on Sunday night and then Wednesday all upset with brother Jesse or something like that well what happened what happened to love we got to stay under the anointing of God amen look how quickly they slipped in and out of the anointing Peter so homo wash all of me and pretty soon he's saying well my ministry I got the keys to the kingdom what do you got yeah you leaned on his bosom but look how great I am my so Jesus has to stop them and he does it with wisdom the kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them but they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors but ye shall not be so you're not gonna be like them he that is greatest among you let him be as the younger and he there's chief as he that does serve because they were arguing they had a strife among themselves which should be a count of the greatest remember they had this trouble a few months earlier when somebody's wife came up and said master we love you can my son sit on your right left hand and all the disciples got a certain that mother so why she's so selfish right can't James and John I want my sons of zebedee I want them on the right left hand and Jesus said that's not for me to give that's for the father to give see how carnal if we're not careful and that Jesus even says the gen do this they exercise lordship over you like I've talked to different people that have come out of bad churches and they and they always say the same thing the pastor kind tries to control everything in their life they can't send a text without the pastor's approval they can't buy something at the store without the pastor's approval they can't go to a family function without the pastor's approval I'm glad you don't experience that right I don't tell you what to do I tell you to follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost if you want my opinion I'll give it to you but I'm not exercising lordship over you I'm an example to you amen the Lord over you I'm an example to you that's exactly right but see they're arguing who's the greatest right after Jesus humbled himself took the towel washed all their feet and he said do this when I'm gone make sure you wash each other's feet when I'm gone and so this moment the future rulers are arguing about who's greater the day before he was crucified what a humbling experience we're arguing worrying with Jesus but our thoughts are not on Jesus it wouldn't it would not be so sad no no wonder he was called the man of sorrows here is he knows his crucifixion coming and his 12 apostles or 11 are arguing about who's greater and Jesus gonna show them there's none of you great I'm the great one I'm coming to make a sacrifice I'm coming to serve you and so this moment Jesus stops and says for whether is greater he that sitteth at me or he that serveth it's not he that sitteth at meat but I am among you as he that serveth so who was washing their feet who is the one humbling themselves it was Christ Christ wasn't arguing about who's got a greater preaching ministry me or you who's more popular who has more likes on Facebook you or me right who's got a bigger church your church or my church Christ wasn't arguing about that he was trying to do one thing the Bible said his face was set like flint toward the cross he had one emotive objective to take the sins of you and I and then he assures them now look look at his mercy look how merciful is to these 12 or live these 11 apostles he says ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations now remember church Judas didn't continue he continued most of the time but what he skipped out of the last few moments see people can hang on they'll hang on to the last few minutes before the rapture but the bride will hang on every minute amen there's nothing in my hands that want to let go of Jesus's Amen I'm not going to let go I'm gonna continue with Christ all the way till either my death or my body change amen I'm going to continue with Christ because Judas held on for a while but then he let go I could just make a quick money deal here and he sold out the son of man so Jesus serves them you're arguing about who's greater but let me assure you you've continued with me and I'm giving you a kingdom as my father at the point in me remember Jesus knew these guys were going to be filled with the Holy Ghost and then there were all be martyrs except like one or two history is uncertain about one of them but almost every one of them except John was a martyr so Jesus knew they would give their lives for it so he has patience aren't you glad God is so patient with you and I look what he says next he said I've appointed you a kingdom that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom oh my and sit on Thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel and the Lord said Simon Simon I love this Satan had desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but I prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren in that beautiful in the midst of their arguing Jesus says you're not going to be like the Gentiles you've stayed with me so I'm going to reward you and you will sit at my table aren't you glad we're sitting at Christ's table right now amen his spiritual table were feasting on the Word of God and we're sitting at his table enjoying his word and he says not only that but you will sit on Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel because one day you're not gonna argue about who's greater remember they worried about it all the way to the day of Pentecost because member Jesus said that John you know Peters like well what's John gonna do they were he's all worried peter was worried all about John what's John's ministry gonna be like what's he gonna do and Jesus said what is it to you if I Terry or John Terry or if John's alive until I come he said follow thou me so see that's a great lesson if we're worried about other people if we're in competition or if we're feeling less than others we got to get our eyes off of other people and we've got to follow Christ for our lives not wonder I wonder if that brother will be greater than me I wonder if that preacher will be more rewards than I have we're not worried about other people we're worried about what does Jesus want amen what does Jesus want me to do I've got to get my eyes off of myself and others I got to get my eyes on Christ I love this but Jesus Jesus says Satan is trying to kill you Peter but I have prayed for you what's more powerful Satan's plans or Jesus's prayer the prayer of Jesus is so much more powerful amen then all of the plans are the gates of hell Jesus's prayer will overcome all of Satan's plans to wipe you off the earth amen that thy faith fail not and one that wild art converted strengthen thy brother so Jesus had already prayed for Peter Lord don't let his faith be lost keep him strong that is faith be strong Lord let him be able to withstand all these attacks of Satan before until he gets the baptism of the Holy Ghost let him not fail Oh Church don't you feel like that don't you pray for that for other people in our church I pray the same thing for all of you Lord keep them strong don't let their faith fail let them serve you let their power flow through them let them not fail that the hand of God be with each one of you that's a real intercessor he prayed for his own little fellowship there he was praying that their faith that the three and a half years he invested in their lives would not come to naught but that it would have a fruit at the end of it and how many want to see fruit in our lives the first weekend of June will be 12 years I pastored this church I don't want to lose the fruit of all the labor that we put into this church we want to see fruits in heaven because the rewards but because but the Bible says if people choose sin the Bible said they could lose their reward and still be saved so we've got to make sure we keep laboring we keep praying and we keep our faith strong and we don't lose any reward and that we do all that Christ wants us to do Jesus prayed for them that Peter that his faith would fail not and he prayed what all let Peter OH let Peter be filled with the Holy Ghost then he can strengthen the Brethren and Jesus prayer was answered ha ha hey man glory now don't forget this Jesus prayed for you to neither pray I for these alone but for them which also shall believe on me through their word so after the Apostles the word kept spreading and Jesus prayed for them that would hear it through the Apostles that they may all be one I wonder if that's how we feel we're all one here in Christ we all think the same thing about Christ we all want the same thing amen but we're not what we shouldn't think well which something bad would happen to that person I wish I was greater than this person or I wish i had something greater we have to have the one idea for Christ to be glorified in our myths now if you have that burden they'll make you pray more for everybody in the church it'll make you love people in the church more it make you reach out and and contact one another and fellowship together and all these things because we have one idea we have one mind that's the mind of Christ geez this was Jesus prayer that Bride of Christ fellowship we could it be one we'd all be in unity about what God wants for our lives praise the Lord I don't forget this remember this is about how Jesus said they continued with me the Bible says this again in acts 1:21 wherefore these men which have company with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when went in and out among us so see that's what the apostles were they were with Christ all the time and that's what I want my testimony I'm with Jesus all the time oh it's Saturday night what did you do last night you go to the big game now I was in prayer and study that's where I was I was with Jesus right where did you go on Friday night already go for the week and originally on your vacation I spent my time with Christ I was with the word I was in special meetings my life just centered around Jesus Christ amen now of course we know they were scattered right at his crucifixion but they were saying for the majority of the time that whole time before that time of scattering they were always with Jesus Jesus would go in and out to pray remember he go pray by himself to the mountain he come back or he'd walk across the sea and meet them you know on the sea on the troubled season he calmed the storms so he would go in and out but the whole time all the time they devoted all their time to Jesus Christ amen now a few more things here brother Graham said I can prove that there is degrees in heaven and that they'll not all be on the same equal but you'll have equal eternal life so now Jesus is we know Jesus telling these apostles you're gonna be higher than other Christians you're gonna have a higher degree or higher responsibilities than other Christians because the Bible said the kings that there was bring their glory and honor into the city and then he goes in he quotes what we already read where Jesus says you will sit upon the twelve Thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel program said it again see it's another it's exactly the system that Oh that'll be far supreme to anything in that there'll be no sin but yet they'll have rulers and so forth in the cities when everything will be carried on in the way of eternal life and that beautiful church every time you turn on the news or whatever on your phone or whatever you do every time there's another political figure who's fallen into corruption corruption Oh sexual corruption financial corruption ethical corruption they just keep falling but not in this government because this government's called eternal life amen hallelujah not in this one he said all the all these natural governments we have you know the Governor of Ohio and the prezi knighted States whatever you think of him you know that we have our natural government here but there's sin and corruption but in that land he said you know everything will be carried over in the way of eternal life so the leaders there will make decisions out of divine love and they'll never be a wrong decision made it'll be the perfect decision because they've gotten divine Holy Ghost in them they've got the decision-maker they've got the judge in them as we said on Wednesday night they've got the judge on the throne of the heart well how Wednesday seems like so many long time ago doesn't it my here's another quote future home brother madam said each one of these had 12 foundations each one had the emerald and the different stones which represent the 12 tribes of Israel and the Apostles each over that big one solid pearl gate set a name of an apostle and didn't Jesus say you'll sit on the twelfth roans judging the twelve tribes of Israel who set at the gate to judge when they come into the city oh my there you are the kings of the earth entering into the city comes before the Apostolic Judge as jesus promised it hallelujah in that beautiful the kings of the earth and the twelve tribes of Israel will bring their glory and honor into the city and before they get in that city they've got to stand next to Peter they got to go through the judge of Peter they got to go through the judge of Paul of John a Bartholomew all these men that first took everything for the gospel Jesus said you've left everything and looked Church it was only three and a half years right it was three and a half years and after that three and a half years they get the Holy Ghost they spent the rest of their lives for Christ they probably lived a 50 60 70 we know John lived in his 90s perhaps a little longer but look how small their lives was but because they left everything for Jesus it was a great sacrifice in his eyes amen let's make a great sacrifice for Christ amen let's make sure our short vapor on this earth is always given for Jesus Christ let him be the center of every decision let him sit on the throne of our hearts amen forsake everything have you ever sake everything you'll rule over everything hallelujah don't let that world rule over you amen so now he calls them apostolic judges Omaha hallelujah brother Ram calls this a special promise from Jesus in the church age book he's quoting about how each of the seven churches messengers will present the bride to Christ for their age programs talking about this and he says a very great responsibility as well as a wonderful privilege is his lot to these men God's make special promises so the church age messengers have a special reward just like the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ they have a higher degree of authority and honor in heaven because of what they sacrificed on earth that's right just as in the case of the Twelve Apostles sitting on the twelve Thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel then remember Paul was given a special promise that of presenting the people of the bride in his day to Jesus because this is what the scripture says I'm jealous over you with godly jealousy for I've espouse you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ isn't that beautiful Paul preached the message to them they got save they got filled with the holy ghost and because of that spiritually when Paul was preaching them the baptism the Holy Ghost and they got saved it was like Paul espousing them Paul said you're now engaged to Jesus Christ I pronounced an engagement you believed in Christ now you're espoused to him now you've entered into the engagement of Jesus Christ Hey and then because of that because he engaged them to Christ he will now present them to Christ amen program said so will it be with every messenger who has been faithful to the Word of God for his hour and age it will be so in the last day it will be the same special reward that was given to Paul amen now watch the humility of brother branham he's again talking about Peter how he said I left mother father he quotes this scripture again now look what he says he says you'll set and judge the twelve Thrones so the twelve tribes Israel now look how humble brother Aaron is he says now you know I don't want to do that so he's talking about how the Apostles are going to be judges over the twelve tribes or Branson now you know I don't want to do that and really from the bottom of my heart I don't want nothing great or classical you know what I want I just want to look at him I just want to see him so see as important part as we end this services is to let you know there are degrees that we must be faithful but no true Christian really wants to be the greatest one because if we do that we just go right back to the Last Supper when they were arguing it back there we don't want to go the Last Supper you want to go to the marriage supper the lamb amen you see now we know whether we just read brother Brandon gets the response reward but he's so humble he doesn't even listen how I serving God he's not doing it to get the reward in other words like this church we are not trying to earn eternal life we already have eternal life amen we don't do how it works because we want to be saved we works because we are saved amen that's what our calling is in life not to focus on all I'm striving for this I'm I'm striving to get the reward we're striving to love Jesus more and the works that we do we do through his faith right through his love through faith in his name and it's the love of Jesus working out through us because we've already got eternal life but I'm not sitting behind you know my desk studying saying well I can preach harder than the preacher up in Sheffield or Alby I'm not in a car or I know this message gonna be there's gonna blow out the people in the south that's not what I'm preached setting for I'm just asking Jesus that's I pray last night give me the food to feed your sheep that's what I asked for not trying to make ourselves anything but to do what God has called us to do because I love God I'm willing to serve God in this way because he has saved me I want to serve his people amen quite a difference isn't it the one who's gonna get it doesn't want it he does he says I don't want to special reward like that I remember the voice when he went beyond the curtain of time he said you're lifted up higher he said you're gonna be judged first you were a leader in life and he's like I don't run a special reward I don't have to be different and God always exalts the humble amen God always exhausts the humble he says you know what I just want to look at him I just want to see him he tells the story of the african-american man his name was he was a slave but he got saved one night in one of their meetings in there I must been in there their property and the the boss said what's his you said you was freezin yep come on over the office I want to talk to you a while so he went over there and said Sam I heard you was free you know you're my slave I said yes sir boss I know that last night the Lord Jesus set me free from the penalty of sin and death glory oh we need to feel like that hallelujah he said I'm free boss the Lord saved me he said you really mean that he said yes I do he said what if he wasn't a slave what would you do I'd spend the rest of my time telling my brethren he said all right if you go down he said if you go down with me the court this morning I'm gonna sign the ticket the Emancipation Proclamation I'm gonna set you free to preach the gospel to your brethren and after he preached for many years his death come to him he was lying sick to die and a lot of his white brethren came in to look at him so they looked at him and he was lying there like in a coma and while you woke up he looked around and seen them said well haven't I went over yet and he said I was dreaming of something that I just got in the door they said to me now Sam so he just came into heaven Sam come on I'm gonna put I want you to put on your robe in your crown and so sam says don't talk to me about robes and crown don't talk to me about robes and crown just let me stand and look at him a thousand years now a man program said I think that's just the way we all feel isn't it we don't want no crowns no great things only thing I want to do is just look and that's all if I could just look at his face that would pay me back for every effort hallelujah glory just to look at him and see him I'm trusting believing hoping try my best someday I'll get to see him amen isn't that beautiful the man who we know by the scripture and by the vindication of the Holy Ghost by a pillar of fire with is thus saith the Lord messages the message of the hour the very one who is the messenger doesn't want to be the leader but he's going to be because of his humility Amen that's glorious and church that ought to pay us back for any little thing we give up for Jesus just to look upon the real face of Christ I know this is the closest thing that we got on earth but one day we're going to see the real face of Christ and it will pay you back for anything you forsaken for the fear of Jesus any little thing of the world giving up this temptation or giving that of that addiction or that that temporary pleasure anything you give up it'll all be worth it to see that lovely face of Jesus I got four minutes so let me close to this thought here brother branham gives us is such a it's such an example of the Holy Spirit striking brother branham he's preaching on all this and then all of a sudden he says he says let me show you a type from the Old Testament of this how elders will be given rulership later on and brother man said look at David portraying Christ see when David was coming into power the first thing he had an awful time coming into power yet he had the anointing on him yeah the anointing was on him and a lot of people thought he was just a little renegade little guy that was different trying to tear it up something but there's some men know that he was coming King they stayed right with him yeah brother I mean you couldn't get them away from him as they walked on who's he talking about the mighty men David's mighty men how many familiar with the mighty men there was thirty of them so brother names typing David as Christ and the mighty man he's typing as these twelve apostles or eleven you know twelve with Paul we know that he said one day he stood up there on the mountain looked down and seen it as little but loved a little city besieged by the enemy and he stood there remembered when he was a little boy he should take sheep out through there and drink that water it was real water we spoke of it not here long ago the waters of life and there is he said David said think I used to drink out of that little well you know the story and his least desire was a command to any man he had brother two of those men grabbed their swords and fought through 15 miles of Philistines chopping them from left to right to get him a drink of water out of that well they knowed he was coming in power yes sir one time one of them to save him jumped in the pit and killed a lion single-handedly they were warriors and when he come in power you know what he done he made each one of them a ruler over a certain city but ma'am said see see Christ there so David did what Christ did I'm sorry Christ was David was prefiguring what Christ was going to do see because jesus said he that overcomes shall rule over a city the overcomers today so now brother Ram brings the mighty men to our day we're supposed to be the mighty men we're supposed to be the ones that are holding on the Christ because we know he's going to rule this earth amen glory the cow inspired that is we cease coming in power Jesus will rule the world German the United States and all must fall every nation must all the kingdoms of the world has become the kingdoms of our God and of Christ and he'll ruled and reigned on them that's right didn't the Bible say that remember the Thyatira church age we preached on this remember this jesus said he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will I give power over the nation's this is in the fire to your church age which was the fourth church age which was the darkest age of all of them ours is the most deceptive but brother man said Thyatira was the darkest the Bible calls it the depths of Satan so in the very depths of Satan those who had overcome the Jezebel religion amen jesus said you have power over nations amen and rule them with a rod of iron so not only does Jesus have a rod of iron but he must give a little rod of iron to all these rulers over nations you understand and that striking that's really something as the vessels of Potter shall they be broken to shivers he said even as I received of my father now I'm just taking a real there's my hour but I'm just gonna make a quick thing here let me hit the scripture here now there are coming oh this there was groups of mighty men how many know that overall 30 there was three overall 30 their names are joash beam Eleazar and I couldn't find the third one but under that they had other men that were in groups of three benaiah was with another one I forget the other guys name but let me go back to the scripture there here's where the Bible said he had all those mighty men who strengthened the cells with him in his kingdom and all the Israel to make him King according to the word of Lord concerning Israel isn't that how you feel don't you want to make Jesus King in Akron amen don't you want to make Jesus King on this earth race God don't you want Christ to be the president right or the king we want Christ to be king there's a royal wedding yesterday but I tell you there's going to be a royal rioting at the rapture at the Brat at the rapture of the bride of Jesus Christ that's the royal wedding I'm concerned with amen let me be a part of that wedding amen how do you how do you know we're just that's really because I'm getting dressed today praise God amen I'm going through all the motions and I'm learning all the traditions and I've got to act like this I've got to stop doing that I got to make sure I say this I got to make sure I got that predestinated ring of unmerited grace on my finger I got to make sure I've got white robes I've got to have eternal life amen Barry he will be king Christ will be king on this earth hallelujah and I'm gonna stay with him until he's King hallelujah and I'm gonna back him up in my old little humble way that I do and this is the number of the mighty men whom David had joash beam and hatch my knight the chief of the captains he was the chief of all of them he lifted up his spear against 300 slain by him at one time after him was Eliezer the son of dodo that a whole height who was one of the three might ease isn't an interesting David had three that were higher than other didn't Jesus have three that were higher another Peter James and John well I just struck me right here there's Revelation right there the Holy Ghost pouring forth revelation right here three that were higher Peter James and John member he took them to the mountain he took them to raise Jerry his daughter from the dead hallelujah faith hope and charity now as I said I read through this this morning I couldn't find the other one but there's one more that is one of the three Mighty's now here's the one that brother BAM that I can back up what brother BAM said but nya was set over David's guard because of how mighty he was later in Solomon's rule he slew Joab and became captain of the hosts so what I'm saying is binaya is the only one I can find that has his reward recorded that I found brother Branham said these men David rewarded them later on and he no doubt no doubt he did but now is the one where we can clearly see that David later set benaiah over his guard and then Solomon said him as ruler over the entire army but nya that's why I thought I think I cam named his son by night after banai he's a mighty man he was not one of the three Mighty's but he was a mighty man so see that because of their faithful service because benaiah faithfully served David before he was King he was exalted to a higher position on the other side can everybody see that and let's stand to our feet I'm gonna read what this is the last quote he says I don't have the quote in front of me but I'll pull it up why don't I just pull it up here so everybody can see it let's stand look how brother branham applies this for us today where he says it he said we know he's coming in power so the least of his desire is a command to who who is it to us look at this this I'm driving to work and brother Graham says this and I just start laughing and almost crying because I'm a little bitty Timbuktu preacher we got any other little bitty Timbuktu civilians out there a little just a tiny butt Graham said the least of his desires is the command to us Jesus wants me to represent him in a little bitty Timbuktu where there ain't 50 cents of money where there ain't nothing or a poor bunch of people brother Graham said but that's a desire of Jesus hey man and Jesus he said oh you don't have to get so many you don't have to go to this just let me know that Jesus wants me to go that's all I need to know don't you like that I just started laughing like I said I'm gonna started crying because I felt like Jesus Christ was speaking to me right there I'm just a little tiny Timbuktu preacher in a really tiny church we don't have millions of dollars to build churches like all these other churches we don't have big numbers and things that astound people but if it's Jesus's desire for me to be a pastor at a little bitty Timbuktu Church then his least desire is a command to me well Olivia after five fifty or a hundred or 200 or 250 that's not how a real servant speaks they'll do whatever Jesus desires as long as it's his desire and then he brings it down to our sisters if Jesus wants me to do different act different like these sisters and things if Jesus doesn't want me to cut my hair if he wants to do a certain thing then bless God it's a privilege for me to do it there you are we know he's coming into power no matter what the world says if I have to lay aside every weight and the sin does easily beset me let me run with patience the race set before me let me look to the author and finisher of our faith Jesus Christ coming in power and the church said amen now I want you come up here by God's grace we'll close with that no matter what Jesus desires church it ought to be a command to us how many feel that way that's how I feel today these elders were just they were gonna have to suffer for a while but the reward would be so great later on just like David's mighty men they they suffered they were estranged but after David came into power things got better and that's how we are we've got to serve in our humble little little bitty lives and then later on Jesus will make us rulers over nations how many believe that we've got to forsake everything on this earth praise the Lord let's just bow our heads how many raise your hands say help me Lord to forsake everything maybe I'm still struggling with you know we know we all go through things we struggle with bless those hands my hands are up to Heavenly Father Lord we love you today we know you are coming into power every day I think about it Jesus every day I think about oh I wonder if this is the day you're gonna come so I beat my body and bring it under subjection I get on my knees and pray and read my Bible even when my flesh doesn't feel like it when life gets hard when we get discouraged Lord from time to time [Music] because the Lord we know you are coming back one day all creation is a witness of it the Sun the plants how they come back every year after death it's all witness Lord God that you're coming back not only that but you've come into our hearts by the Holy Ghost your God and we have the resurrection power inside of us Lord God where we've seen you move we've seen you do things we can never do on our own and we give you glory for that now lord help us to hear your

wrestling with who they're gonna serve may they make the decision to forsake everything and follow you dear God those of us adults Lord and still wrestle with things Lord may we lay aside that weight
