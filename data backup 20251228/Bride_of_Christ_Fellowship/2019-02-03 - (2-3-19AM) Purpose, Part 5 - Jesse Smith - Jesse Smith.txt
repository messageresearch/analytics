open up to Acts chapter 11 verse 22 we'd like to continue on this series on purpose by the grace of God this is part five Acts chapter verse 22 X 1122 by the grace of the Lord I trust you've been enjoying this little series here by the grace of the Lord ah I think there's very few things that are as important as finding your purpose in life how many could say amen to that so this is a soul issue right this is an issue of the soul your soul has to find out the will of God for your life brother Ram said it's a mystery every person must seek God for the will of God for their lives and as we looked at last week you know God drives you to his will or your purpose and then once you find that purpose that purpose drives you I'm glad to be driven by the purpose of God today not driven by a fleshly purpose or a man's idea I'm driven by the Holy Spirit today so I'm very thankful each Christian can have that confidence when you've met the pillar fire praise God he meant acts 11 22 then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem and they sent forth Barnabas that he should go as far as Antioch who and he came and he had seen the grace of God was glad and exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord for he was a good man and full of the Holy Ghost in a faith and much people was added unto the Lord let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer if you ever need on your heart just making known unto God let's pray together Church you can pray in your heart I'll pray out loud hear my heart as well Heavenly Father we love you Lord God we've gathered in your name Lord we're your chosen seed Lord those of us who are believing the full word of God and we're thankful that this word has been revealed in the end time Lord God or you've predestinate us to live here Lord God and father we go through many battles but Lord we know if we've got the King's sword in our hand Lord and victory is assured for Lord your sword is your word and father your sword can never fail Lord so we thank you for the word of God in this hour speak your people today I pray you meet every need Lord that's my intercession before now dear God that you meet every need may your presence be felt may you speak to every hungry heart Lord God and we'd ask that you be glorified honored and worshipped today be magnified prepares for thy great coming this meeting in the air Lord God our destiny is in the sky Lord to meet our bridegroom there so father prepare us again once more by your word in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless yous being seated praise the Lord you can switch over lady I have some quotes I'd like to share today by the grace of the Lord also I just wanna let everybody know that I'm getting really close to finishing up the book here on our website I have links there to our videos but there's a special tab there says there's the book restoring Christian modesty so it's if you click on that little link you can also get to it if you click on that slider which I'll show once it gets back there so if you click on it it'll go to that page that's linked right there and then it just has a picture and it's going to try to be available March 1st by God's grace I'm just working on the date and everything like that but I'm really excited about that they can be used as outreach I started this in November 2017 so it's been a little over a year and it's nice to see it finally come to a conclusion you know so I'm very thankful I hope you're I hope you're as excited as I am if you can and of course the church would like to buy everybody copies so if you belong to our church you don't have to go buy one you can just I'll just get you one by the grace of Lord remember it's an outreach book so as you read it you'll see I'm not mentioning brother Branham until the last chapter and that's when I say where do you get all your teachings from and I say I got it from brother Branham my brother Graham got it from Jesus right the message did not come from brother Branham he preached it but the message is the Word of God ah that came from we just want to make that distinction because there's many today saying I've heard him say it they say the tapes is the word and the tapes is not the word the tapes point to the word and it actually exalts the tapes above what they ought to be although we thank God for the tapes we don't worship the tapes the tapes is not the word the word is the holy spirits message for us today so we just want to make that distinction and it's an outreach book like I said so may the Lord bless us here and God's divine presence I'd like to look at part five here and I'm just going to set a little timer so I don't go too long you know we kind of ended son or Wednesday service we did a livestream service because it was so cold we didn't gather here at the church but we kind of ended by looking at three scriptures that talk about purpose and this was the first one you know Acts 1122 where Barnabas a missionary he would revisit he and Paul would revisit the churches they started and in leaving them he would leave these words he would say cleave unto Christ make this your purpose of your heart so Cleaves be so established he's so glued to Christ that everybody knows which side you're on hey men stay that let that be your purpose of your heart I don't want to cleave to anything else other than Christ be cleave to him second we looked at David David said the purpose he said I purpose that my tongue would not speak any iniquity I thought that's a good purpose for us to write so all these purposes work for us as well because you don't want to talk evil then try to come to church and act like you're holy now if you make a mistake and you ask God to forgive you yeah now you're holy again but we don't want to be a hypocrite and say oh I can I can act however I want outside and then as long as I look okay at a church as long as I wear the right clothes everybody thinks I'm okay the Bible said we want to have unfeigned faith that means we don't have to pretend we're not pretending to anybody here what you see here is what you see at my home which is what you see at my job that were just a Christian everywhere we are every day of the week amen and Daniel the third one was Daniel or Daniel said I purposed in my heart that I won't be defile with the Kings meat and that's a great desire if we could have that purpose today the purpose of my life is not to be defiled and Satan's Eden I don't want to be defiled on my phone I don't want to be defiled in my conversations I don't want to be to file in a church I don't want to be defiled anywhere I want to be completely connected to Christ that I live a godly life everywhere I am amen and so we ended with those thoughts there on Wednesday night and I hope that was a blessing to you I like to look at a few more scriptures on purpose because I just went through the Bible I typed in purpose and I just did a study and then went searching for quotes that match those scriptures and of course listening to different sermons so I let's look at purpose a little bit you know if you go to Isaiah you don't have to turn there of course I tried to make it a little easier actually just saves a little more time if I just put them up there if I have the time Isaiah 1 verse 10 hear the word of the Lord ye rulers of Sodom give ear unto the law of our God he people of Gomorrah so Isaiah's prophesy against Sodom and Gomorrah isn't that interesting how Jesus said as it was the days of Sodom so will it be in the days of the coming of the Son of Man so even in Isaiah's day the worshipers in Sodom they were bringing worship to Jehovah Jehovah says that God says that he says what is the purpose is this multitude of sacrifices unto me they weren't bringing just a few sacrifices to Jehovah they were bringing multitudes these people this people didn't stay at home and you know and just avoid worshiping God they came out to church they gave all kinds of sacrifices they killed many animals but gee but God or we say Jesus is spirit or God God said what purpose is all this what's the purpose behind all these burnt offerings I'm full of the burnt offerings of rams and of the fat of the beasts and I delight not in the blood of Bullock's or of the Lambs or of the he-goats what a what an awful thing to have to receive from God through a preacher through a prophet all these people are worshiping and the Prophet comes up and says thus saith the Lord I'm not receiving all your sacrifices what's the purpose of all this sacrifice and they would say Oh to know God to love God to love Jehovah but Isaiah has to keep prophesying to tell them the problem the problem he says his wash you and make you clean so they weren't clean they were bringing sacrifices but they weren't clean oh my we can all come right people we know people come to church or sometimes ourselves we can come to church and offer worship and sacrifice but if we're not clean it's not accepted amen we got to be clean we got to be forgiven we got to have our robes washed in the blood of the Lamb he said put away the evil of your doings before my eyes ceased into even a liquor look at the insanity of this they would do evil all week and then come and worship on the Sabbath and bring their offerings and think that God's going to receive it and God's like not watching you all week you're doing evil you come and praise my name and bring the animal sacrifices you do all these things what's the purpose of Saturday worship if you're not worshiping me on Friday and Thursday amen oh my stop doing evil in other words get a victory get delivered from addictions get delivered from problems you don't have to be a slave to sin we're free by the blood of Christ but you got to accept that freedom amen programs that you can scream at the altar cry pour gallon of oil on somebody but they won't be healed they won't be saved until you accept it we've got to accept that we're free praise God we don't have to be a slave we don't have to keep doing evil we don't have to be addicted we can be free in Christ's name Amen he said see here you got to learn to do well you've you've learned how to bring a public worship to God you've learned how to come to church and act like you're worshiping God but you haven't learned to do good all the rest of the week that's not the kind of life I want church praise the Lord we don't want to pretend life and you know we you know and let me say like this you can learn anything you want to learn if you were anyone to learn God's Word you can do it I'm 38 and I've been learning for my Taekwondo class I've been learning to memorize some of these things now guys help me had a lot of page Saamy now Kai's got like a photographic memory he can read over something and he's got to memorize him like how do you do that so we're finally been going over these things on the drive there and finally after a month I understood one of the Korean words and Malachi's like yeah you got it I'm like it took me a month to get it but in other words the search that's just so like one example if you really want to learn if I really want to learn to live closer to God we can we've just got to sacrifice anything outside during the week that's keeping us from drawing closer to God we got to be in God's presence all the time see they knew how to bring a sacrifice they learn to come to church and make it look like it was okay and everything was fine and dressed holy but when they got home it wasn't that way he said seek judgment relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the widow and that's that's always my prayer and I pray it from time to time Lord show me the people that are poor that are among us that we can help out and help me to visit the fatherless when I can show me children that don't have a father that we could visit them the Bible said visit them in their affliction plead for the widow Lord show me widows that don't have anything that we can help them we can give them a job or give them a love offering her give them something that should be our desire that's seeking to be a blessing that's seeking to be like God God sends his rain on the just and the unjust and God wants us to be just like him he said come now let us reason together saith the Lord though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool if you'd be willing and obedient so see they could bring they were so beaded - doing public worship but not obedient to all the other times the rest of the week he shall eat the good of the land but if you refused and rebelled you should be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it how is the faithful City becoming a harlot it was full of judgment full of righteousness large in it but now now where this impacts us the murders is people that gossip in message churches that's what churches that's the kind of murderers churches our folk filled with now maybe not physical murders but people that will attack somebody's character attack that pass or attack that you know we just want to attack sin we just want to attack the devil the serpent romance that's striking the people praise God we want to try to not make people look bad but we've got to call outs in the the Bible says rebuke them that sin before all so there's God away there's got to be a way to do it and if the way to do it is with the right heart amen with the right spirit with the desire to help them like this week I've been talking different people you know and it's it's a it's a hypocrisy if I come here and preach against something and I don't talk to the person I know that's doing it it's hypocrisy that's why when I mentioned things about tapes I've reached out to that company I've reached out to those group and I've sent them quotes I've reached out to them I'm trying to help them praise the Lord and so the same is true for us it doesn't do us any good to speak against somebody if we don't have the love in our heart to try to help them out amen but see they could bring all kinds of sacrifices they could come to church they could do all these they could pay their tithes and offerings we'll say they could do all these sacrifices but God was looking for people that would judge the right judgment that would have the right spirit that would learn to do well do things of God all throughout the week I think God's still looking for those don't you jesus said the father's seeking true worshipers amen the next book Isaiah Jeremiah he has the same thing now look at this church they made such a great effort they ordered in incense from Amazon all the way from Sheba I just say like that they they imported all this incense Oh make a special sacrifice to give this to God and then God uses Jeremiah to say it's still the same thing what purpose do you come here with all this incense from Sheba and the sweet came from far country your burnt offerings are not acceptable nor your sacrifice is sweet unto me see God is not so much interested in this the public outward worship God wants every day to be a worship God wants all of our dealings with people in the church with families and and strangers and friends God wants all of our dealings to glorify Him we've got look at every situation of our life as a learning opportunity I hope help me Lord to learn how to be more loving to my wife or my husband whichever are my children help me Lord to be more loving at school help me to be more loving to my brothers and sisters it must be a constant learning how many want to be a learner of Christ so you can ship things in from around the world oh look at I got this here special offering for Jesus but he's looking at your heart he says what purpose is this and if people are going to great lengths to impress God here with their outward worship how much more today if they did it in Jeremiah's day how much more today remember the Bible said they will run to and fro upon the face of the earth they'll fly from America to Europe they'll fly from Europe to Africa trying to do God a service oh look we sacrifice all this unto God it's with the wrong spirit God said what purpose is it what purpose is it it's got to have the right spirit behind it it's got to have the right attitude behind it ask me a daily learning has to be a learners attitude as a Christian that's right so you see as I read the board purpose throughout the Bible these get inspired to me I hope there has been inspiration to you as well by God's grace lamentations he said the same thing now this is of course jeremiah lamenting for the city of jerusalem that's going to be destroyed the lord hath purposed to destroy the wall the daughter of zion he has stretched out of the line he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament they languished together her gates are sunken to the ground he had destroyed and broken her bars her King and her princes are among the Gentiles the loss no more her prophets also find no vision from the Lord not so because they rejected Isaiah Jeremiah and you can think of all the prophets that was sent to Israel because they rejected them because they not really examine their purpose for coming to church and their purpose for serving God the purpose for their sacrifices God finally says because you won't listen to my purpose then my purpose is to scatter you and destroy you of course we know he would never forsake his people Israel that's pretty that's pretty humbling and I really don't hear any amens which it makes sense right this is not a fun that's not a fun scripture that's not a it's not a rejoicing scripture but it does show how God is looking at every one of our purposes and if we won't take God's purpose then his purpose will be against us I don't care if a church says we're a messege church that doesn't mean that they're always going to be according to God's purpose we've all seen people that say they're in the message and then live contrary to the Word of God well God's not with that any more than he's with any denomination it the the question is what are you doing with Jesus Christ right now what are we doing with God's Son Jesus Christ so see they couldn't find a vision purpose because they rejected all God's preaching they they're seeking God they can't even find what's my purpose in life what does God want me to do what should my job be my preacher or not my song leader my deacon what am I see because they've rejected God's purpose they don't get a vision from the Lord they don't know what they're called to do in life what a blessing it is to know when you've been called by God and you know God's purpose for your life amen boy what a blessing amen brother and we'll say it later he said everyone that doesn't know they're just drifting from place to place just drifting just drifting wrong not going in a straight line not knowing where they're going the Bible said when you redeem the time the Bible says you walk circumspectly which means exact you're walking exactly where you know you're supposed to be going amen glory you're not walking because well this person said so or that person said so you're walking it exactly you're walking the perfect will of God you're walking the narrow road because God put you on that narrow road amen hallelujah there's a little bit more purpose in worship scriptures that kind of came up so let's look at these here now this is what I kind of mentioned there and I've been mentioning off and on I think I think the purpose behind this purpose series if I can say it like that it's that every one the church will know your purpose like brother Bram said he said if you got a gift of God he said you ought to be just as interested in getting it in order in the house of God as the pastor isn't his and you can ask my wife and children I'm I'm pretty interested in making sure I'm right I'm a good pastor all the time I give to preaching and studying and praying I try to make sure I got my gift in the right position and each one of us must be just as interested in getting your gift in its place in the house of God as I am we in other words we should all have the same desire to be in our position so look what look what the Bible says Paul and I'll Paul's a prophet so this is a prophet verse here's the rest of the congregation at Corinth Corinth rather Paul says what what if I come to you speaking in tongues what should i profit you except I shall speak to you either by revelation knowledge prophecy or doctrine so he said if I come and speak and unknown tongues it doesn't really profit you unless there's one of those four manifestations right now now we know the Corinthian church was very zealous for gifts I don't know too many message churches that are like Corinth that are overly zealous on gifts too much speaking in tongues too much prophesy too much interpretation do you does anybody does anybody know there's not too many that I know of maybe in other countries and maybe in different parts of the nation and so brother Graham does make a point he said they were immature church but they were still a true church and later in the church age book brother branham uses this as an example of how that this church today should be so we can't let one quote from the 58 I think it was or program said see their Corinthian churches of much immature church we can't we got to balance that quote with the quote from the church age book they got to be balanced they got to be understood in their context so he says how is it brethren when ye come together you every one of you have something I just highlighted that half I emphasize that when you come to church when I come to church we've got to bring something remember not like Isaiah's day and Jeremiah's they were they just brought it for show you got to bring the love of God you got to bring an obedient life so everybody came to church they had something that's something to give now we're all going to go through hard times where only reason we come to church is to get something right we're so down and we're so discouraged we just want to get something out of service open hot different Church how different was this Corinthian church they were so on fire they were so excited about God everybody brought something to church amen ohana didya glory look at that everyone in the church that would mean vain that would mean Jose I'm not gonna call the sisters names I'll call the brothers because they can handle it you know they're okay with that I don't want embarrass any sisters so of all the brothers brought a song a song or this brother brought a doctor in all Maya the Lord showed me a doctrine this brother brought a tongue this brother brother revelation Oh God revealed something to me in a dream last night this brother brought an interpretation oh this is what God told me your dream was about this was the interpretation that I think the Lord revealed it to me now wouldn't that be a happy Church how many could say amen to that everybody in church brought something to church and Paul said the same thing I mean I got to bring more than unknown tongue I got a profit you somehow everybody has something to bring now look at these quotes Branham says from the church age book now they the Pentecostals are all saying and trying to prove that they have it all or they have enough yet it is the what I'm sorry yeah is that the truth compared to this 20th century church to the first century church go ahead do that where is the power where's the love where's the purified church that withstood sin and walk with faith toward Jesus where's the unity you can't find it if this church has all it needs why were they crying out for more of God in the book of Acts as though they didn't have it all and yet they had far more than they have today so the Pentecostals are will say the messenger whatever you can say the latest message any church that says we have it all and isn't crying out for more of God is not like the original Church because the original Church went through trials and they cried out for more of God oh can you say amen to that to see we got to come to church and not sit here and just you know not understand what we're supposed to do wisdom tells us we've got to come and craw for more of God it might look different for some than others but let's be honest with ourselves this is what the early church had they cried out for more of God in the book of Acts like they didn't have enough and we've got to come to church every time saying Lord I need more I need more and I'm willing to cry out for it not just go through the motions but I'm willing to cry out for it praise God what does that look like you might cry out worship you might cry out and prayer might cry out during the preaching of the word say Oh God hallelujah but see the early church wanted more of God they were because they had God amen they wouldn't more of God because they were learned again amen and they so they wanted more of God because they had a portion of God but they wanted more of God amen church I hope somebody's hearing me this morning by the grace of God you love the Lord this morning hallelujah now look at this and this is what I'm trying to avoid brother Branham says this I'm trying to avoid this Paul saw it coming but he warned them about this subtle priesthood so there's preachers or tape players either one now because tape players call themselves preachers which that's fine if they want to do that Paul warned them about a subtle preset so ministers that would come and take over with their false doctrines he knew they would implement a way of worship that excluded the people from any part in the Holy Spirit ministry isn't that striking Paul knew this these are called wolves Paul calls them when the wolves come in they try to divide the preachers from the people and say well only the preachers have the anointing on them and we don't really need a ministry from the people listen I hope you believe this but we need your ministry I need your ministry everyone that's a home church here we need your ministry Christianity is not a one-man show or one pastor show or one pastor and three associate preacher show everybody should be moved by God everybody should have a ministry everybody should be led of the Holy Spirit but see the false priesthood will say it's only for us at the pulpit or it's only for brother Branham on the tape or it's only for just preachers that they get you know whatever you understand what I mean they're trying to get the people out of it so the people don't have a ministry and even right today among those who claim to be free how many free and full the Holy Spirit I am are you free amen are you follow hallelujah there's not too much freedom in the laity and the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flock just sits there and tries to absorb it like I said there might be some service that you just try to absorb the preaching but the true church the true pattern of the book of Acts is for every person to have a ministry everybody operating with the holy spirit is that true so the people just sitting there trying to absorb it he said this is a far cry from Paul who said that when all came together all had the leading of the Spirit and all participated in spiritual worship Oh in that glorious what's-what's program I'm talking about he's talked about this right here every one of you have to saw he said when you come together how's the brother when you come together every one of you has a song now that doesn't mean if you have a gift of sing like we know our sister when he sings and brother Jose sings and different ones my wife sings and you know our children sing that doesn't mean every time you come together you have to sing a special that's not what that means but let me balance that out but if you have a gift of God and you just let it go for a couple weeks or three weeks is that as are you just as interested in that gift of singing as the pastor is and making sure his preaching gift is in what in line with the Word of God you see you see how we want to just you see how people just want to coast but if you've got a genuine gift of God Jesus said you've got it take that gift and invest it don't bury it in the earth don't put it under merit under all these other jobs I got to do in other things no don't don't bury there dig it back up and take it and invest it if you have a gift this thing you should practice singing during the week you should make make a reminder make a simple reminder on a piece of paper and say practice a song once a week to stay in the channel that doesn't mean you have to sing it every week but I've got to preach sometimes three or five times a week I got to stay in that channel praise the Lord I'm thankful I have by God's grace because it's all God's grace or if you got to give in tongues like we know our sister Naomi does oh you've got other gifts gift of healing that we need to pray it's a God if there's anyone sick use me this week and not just on Sunday morning but pray that on Saturday Friday Thursday try to find the mommy what the mind of Christ see we got to find the mind of Christ when they came together everybody had of Revelation everybody had a song everybody had a leader leading of the Holy Spirit praise God what am i trying to do as a pastor I've been here almost 13 years faithfully what am I trying to do I'm just trying to get help people catch the vision that's the vision this is the vision we're returning to the book of Acts church this church started Corinthian started in the book of Acts Paul Paul started the Corinthian church in the book of Acts there a book of Acts church yeah they're a little overboard on gifts but Paul said writing for this he said everybody's got one just let it be done decently and in order and he said pretty soon a sinner is gonna come in and somebody's gonna manifest a gift and tell him a seeker of their heart and that sinner will fall down and say surely God is among you ah after we desire amen that's what I desire but everybody brought something everybody has something everybody has something to bring that's their purpose so what is our way of worship buh-bam said they'll try to change the way of worship is our way of worship is to let brother Jesse or brother brother cam comes next or later this month just let him have all the leading of the Spirit I hope that's not our our worship because that was the question God asked Israel what's the purpose of all these sacrifices you came to church you got up you washed your hair you brushed your teeth put on your tie you put gel up a jump hair well what's the purpose of all this worship unless God's will is done amen what is our way of worship and I know church that's why I'm not trying to get discouraged I'm not discouraging anybody here I'm saying this is the vision this is where we're all going toward praise God we are moving our churches moving toward that way no matter how small doesn't matter the number Jesus said little flock it doesn't matter but I feel that the Holy Spirit that's this is the direction we're going where everybody's letter the Holy Spirit everybody has a gift of God everybody loves Jesus Christ everybody wants to manifest God's presence that's the direction I want to go I don't want to go that direction we're only the preachers got an anointing I want to go in this direction where everybody has a leadership of the Holy Spirit hallelujah because that's what the message says that's what the Bible says and so our worship must be purposeful look how look how much Jesus magnified Mary's worship remember Mary came six days before Jesus crucifixion to anoint him notice anointed on the sixth day before crucifixion six is the number of man the number of and it can be anointed man because Adam was anointed with the Holy Spirit when he was created Jesus gets anointed six days before he dies oh I'd love to see God's numerology don't you you can see the meaning behind this amen but look what Bob Arum said and Jesus said let her alone Mary for she did this she anointed him unto his burial see this woman so grateful that her sins were forgiven until she spent all of her money she had you know I looked that up church it was one year's income so if you make thirty thousand if you make forty thousand if you make fifty sixty seventy however much you make eighty ninety one hundred she brought a year's income bought the alabaster box and broke it and poured it all on Jesus and you just said all kind of what purpose is this waste for you think do you think paying $10,000 or send a missionary to the Philippines would be a waste no I'd be a great that'd be a great sacrifice oh they spent $20,000 to to read through outreach and and win souls for God is that a bad thing I think that's a good thing if it's done with the right intentions don't you church a whole year of her wages six days and brother branham said she did not even know what she was doing that's how that's how we need to be amen we need to be sowing the holy spirit don't we don't even know what we're doing we're just led by God amen we're just led by God to worship and love God and make sacrifices and serve God I'm just led to go annoy and worship Jesus I don't even know what I'm doing I just found the leadership with a heart we need some Holy Ghost those things like that amen hallelujah and you've probably been like that before what I'm saying is we didn't let that continue we didn't see that increase she's just anointed and she's out of her mind she's in the Christ mind amen she spent all of her money that she had and took an alabaster box broke it poured the oil and just ordered the room with fine smell this myrrh that she had anointed him for his death now see she did the service not knowing what she was doing she was so grateful to God notice she was grateful that Lazarus was raised from the dead when she that's her brother thank God you raised my brother Lazarus from the grave but brother man said what she was really thankful for was being forgiving of her sins George we all be so thankful to be justified by the blood of Jesus amen she'd seen a miracle we've seen how many seen in America anybody raise your hands ever seen a miracle praise God but that's not why she did it she did it because she was thankful that Jesus had forgiven her sins oh it ought to be joy unspeakable to us this morning Church being forgiven have the shirts are going to heaven there ought to be joy unspeakable for the Bride of Christ ha ha Laurie amen did he know what she was doing I'm so caught up in the Holy Spirit I really don't know what I'm doing I'm just worshipping Jesus oh my god help us Church god help us to be true worshippers how I'm gonna be a purposeful worshiper well one time just get so grateful to God and see what happens to us let's just get so happy so grateful so thankful to be justified forgiven see what happens Oh hallelujah see Judas said what purpose is this you're wasting you're wasting a whole year of your work you've worked for a whole year you're taking that money and your tummy you're just gonna pour it out right here on Jesus remember he's anointed on the 6th day before he was crucified that's because number 6 is the number of man as we've been looking at there's 6 pieces of armor on the armor of God praise the Lord 6 is the number of fallen man of course but also anointed man and Jesus said she hath wrought a good work upon me she did it for see there's a purpose behind it she did it for my burial and then Jesus promised this will be unforgettable this was such a loving act of worship she just want to show how grateful she was I'll spend a year of my wages now I can't imagine that that's I've never done that I've given a whole year of my wages in order to magnify Christ or just anoint Christ just tell Jesus how much you love him and Jesus said the preachers will never forget about this there was gonna preach on this woman she made such a great sacrifice so see sisters don't don't feel bad all gi-du just be grateful to Jesus you know don't feel bad you don't preach or don't feel bad about this or that just be grateful and worship Jesus God will see it God sees all of our worship now just as a reminder remember the Passover lamb was it was taken on the tenth day was taken in the house and kept to the fourteenth day the 14 day of Nisan it was killed and you can find that in Exodus chapter 12 so on the tenth day the Passover lamb was selected which is Christ I think Christ in Jerusalem I'm not sure that's why I put a question mark there that was the Monday and then Friday he was taken and crucified Saturday was the feast of unleavened bread Christ was conquering hell and on the 16th he rose on the third day I could be wrong on that but that's what it seems like now this was the day then-mayor and anoint Jesus six days before the bout was that six days before Passover one two three four five six on that Saturday on that Sabbath day she comes in anoint Jesus the next day Jesus he's anointed right he's anointed he goes and they have Palm Sunday they say Hosanna Hosanna save us save us hosanna in the highest and then he stays then the tenth day he's what does he do he stays in Jerusalem this whole week so the tenth day fits the type there where they take the lamb they got to judge the lamb they got a watch they got to work with the lamb examine the lamb and then they take it in on the tenth day so Jesus was taken in to Jerusalem on the tenth day of course we know the Lord's Supper was on Thursday then Friday he was crucified and it fits the type so Mary had a perfect idea here to prepare him for his barrows bear was coming up seven days later seven days later so she had to anoint him in order to be have the sacrifice ready to go into Jerusalem and be accepted and then to be kept in the house of Jerusalem so not even knowing it she was just so grateful to God just one to worship God with a pure heart she felt light into God's plan for the Passover lamb mine in that striking when your hearts just in love with God and God lets your worship just fall right in his perfect plan just had to be at that right exact time just at the perfect time I was so grateful to God I was so happy to God I just want to show my appreciation to God you know fall right exactly in the perfect timing of God now getting back to this edifying Paul Scylla every everything be done to edifying this is the act of building up this is someone who promotes another's growth we're getting back to our purpose now when you edify someone here at the church you help them grow in wisdom piety happiness or holiness that's what the Bible said let all things be done unto edifying so I just made this so according to 1st Corinthians 14 26 every one of them brought one of these five things either brought a psalm a doctrine a tongue a revelation or interpretation that would promote growth and other people by making them more wise pious happy or holy now as a preacher I get to see this quite often I'll preach a revelation or a doctrine you know I've never spoken in tongues I've never gave interpretation sometimes I sing a song then people might like it I don't know I haven't heard one of those lately but I know doctrines and revelations I've preached have helped people and it's given them more wisdom piety happiness made them more holy if they obey it you got to obey it remember like jesus said you can rejoice for a season but then when offenses come you get offended you know so see this is what the early church brought and this is the vision church where you and I are this church of Akron this is what we need to do we have need we need to have this vision this is where we need to go and the church said all right good I heard a few amens from our church this is where we need to go your worship that you bring you have to bring something most of the time right I know if you're battling or struggling at least bring yours I guess yeah bring yourself at least that's the first thing just to get to the house of God this is a hospital at least if you're sake just get to the hospital not for visit physically sick and contagious you better pray about it first you know what he's spreading your germs around here but have you got leading of the Lord then you come in other words what I mean is don't get in the habit of well I missed this time I'll miss I'll skip next time pretty soon you're never to be in church now that doesn't affect most people here most people here are very faithful Saints we thank God for that but see this is what I was saying on Wednesday you have to have such a purpose in our hearts that I'm gonna company I'm gonna pray all the rest of the week Fridays Wednesday Thursday Friday said I'm gonna pray that I can bring a psalm to church or see if God will anoint me to bring a song to worship or I'm gonna pray and say God do you want to give a little doctrine and maybe if your sister maybe just mentioned to brother Jesse brother Jesse have you ever seen this quote before not try to preach at me or teach me but just maybe God gives you a word I never studied I like to study that that doesn't happen too much but sometimes sisters will send me interesting things I like looking at him or her tongue maybe God would have me speaking of tongue or revelation maybe God would reveal something to me I never knew before and we got these nice little slips out there we don't want to forget about him but you can just put a little testimony check on there and share a little revelation that God gave you now make sure you got two or three witnesses that's right because you don't want embarrass yourself and put a revelation on there it comes out that it's wrong later you really want to make sure it's God but how many times and we read a testimony we're so encouraged oh thank the Lord sister Connie what a wonderful testimony Oh Wendy thank the Lord God gave her testimony see maybe God gave you a revelation of something and when you do that when you bring something when I bring something to the house of God it actually promotes or builds up your wisdom now you're more wise because of that I like this one I'm more happy on Monday because of what you brought to church and that hat that's happened many times some people have sang songs I've just so been so happy or rejoiced when people hear testimonies you know God let the paper work for SIA and they only go through you know if they're I don't remember the names of that what's the name of that green that just makes me happy that's a testimony you know maybe to them it was a revelation or maybe God interpreted their situation for them but see these when we just share these things when we bring something the house of God it promotes growth it encourages happiness it makes you want to live closer to God amen hallelujah Laurie it's you know it's like that little it's like a little illustration of Legos right I teach first grade I see kids do it all the time they just want to build a tower pink mr. Smith look at my tower like that's pretty tall wonderful but then that's what our spiritual life should be God give me another brick give me another tower or give me another height let me go to new heights build up my wisdom build up my faith build up my happiness make me more Harley build me up in the Lord Jesus Christ they say Jesus look at look at what you've done in my life that's what we'll say Jesus look what you've done into my life thank you for building me up amen hallelujah brother hamster the holy spirit watches your life and then he go reports it to the Father now we know they're the one himself same person but he's dramatizing it Oh Lord look what you've done in my life I thank you for what you've done you build up you've got me to get many victories thank you Lord now part of me which wants to make a picture of this I want to just slap it on the wall maybe I got room up here maybe R where would be a good spot maybe right under here under the Lord Jesus I feel like that's what Jesus is encouraging us to do we need to bring something to church well the parent said what a far cry today's church is from the early church where not only the preachers had a leading of the Lord but everybody had a leading of the Lord that makes me happy that makes me smile I just can't help it I look forward brother banging to that time okay I look forward to that time when we're so close to the coming of Lord that everyone God is getting he's restoring his book of Acts church and everybody's company Church with some type of leading of the Lord oh my would that be glorious but it takes a sacrifice throughout the week and on Sunday and on Sunday takes a sacrifice all week where we learn all week or what do you what song do you want me to sing what doctrine are you dealing with me on what what revelation what dream have you answered her what tongue or interpretation you want to give it's been a long time since we had one of those but that's okay everybody knows what I'm saying that we need to find a Leedy leadership of the Holy Spirit that will promote the church in these areas that's what I'm interested in I'm not interesting to come to church to fighting against the church up north or fighting against the church I don't want to fight against them I want to fight against the devil and brother Branham said these gifts clean out the church and fight off the devil the gifts church or keep the church clean clean from what satan's defilement amen that's what I'm interested in the church being undefiled walking in the purity the piety the happiness of the Holy Spirit the hope church I hope you'll take this as you'll receive this say this is a vision this is part of the vision we we want everyone the church to bring something to church that will promote and build up at other people I hope that hope that sinks right now down into your heart I hope the Holy Spirit writes that upon the fleshly tables of your heart because that's what's on my heart that's what the Holy Spirit wrote on my heart we don't want to bring a critical many churches have this now not our church God has really clean out our church you I mean you that's been here you know the testimonies God is really not our church but see many churches have that people bring a critical or unbelieving spirit and we've got to be hungry for God's Word you know we got to come if we if we're bringing something that will be to God will be hungry also to hear from God Oh you love Jesus man just I can't stop smiling today I'm just I'm just so happy this is what God is leading us to do now we just got old man we just got to act on it and I'll keep your mind you don't worry I'll keep reminding you I'm gonna keep preaching this every now and then I'll bring it back up preaches a few years ago I'll bring it back in a few years again because it's my duty it's my job to promote your growth so you keep growing that's my job feed the flock of God who saw that on Wednesday to remember Peters ministry went from fish sting to feeding first he was a Fisher man for three and a half years and then jesus said now feed him you went fishing now feed him and that's my job now I went fishing for some of you like amen and bang and I guess Devon and I tried to do doing Devon rather I tried to bring him in but see now you got to feed him once you fish him thank God got the fish now feed him actually go from fish to lambs I guess now let I mentioned this a few months ago remember this quote I don't know if you're not now he said you're sick in trouble can you imagine I'm sorry could you imagine why how how you would want to take my place standing here now and know that here's some between five and six thousand people perhaps setting here in every eye on you and in there you can feel the cold waves of a skeptic spirit and everything moving in now how many have been by the ocean side and felt the tide come in I felt that just recently last year we're out in California some Island I forget the name of it my mind would remember I always forget but we we saw the tide was out like wow look at the waters out but then you felt it coming in you felt that warm area or the cold air rather this is my brother branham experience and church this is what all the preachers have to deal with too right and you might have to bow this like if you're at a family convention or a family gathering or something maybe a certain family will arrive everything is good in the Holy Spirit then a certain family member who arrived and it feels like a cold whoosh there's a certain person our job every time they walk into a meeting if it's happy meeting all of a sudden goes whoosh and cold waves of skepticism company it's nothing about the during church it's nothing but the truth but we shouldn't bring in cold skeptic I'm not on a be here we should bring in a warmth a warm spirit loving spirit open spirit to receive open to receiving from God open to giving to God everybody has something so brother am said when when unbelievers are here it's like cold waves coming in and I hate the cold water I'm the last one in the cold water at the ocean I know I'd rather just stand up on the sand I don't want to touch that cold water how much more do I not want to be in a church where cold water come are you with me just like you you don't wanna be in a cold service everybody's would you just finish up already what do you mean he's the same if only we were in brother branham's day then we could have some holy ghost movie I don't want that kind of that that's a cold cold wave I don't want the cool wave I want the wave of warmth where all things are possible Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen that's a warm wave of faith coming in I know he's here I know he's faithful I know his runner can't failure I know he loves me Amen I know he's the same today brother Ram said keep Majid I got 6,000 people and I feel the waves of cold coming in they don't believe they don't believe Christ is there they think it's some mind-reader Satan Russell's demon powers are moving in so they move in like a cold army marching slowly into the service to try to make it a cold cold service but the remnants of their cold he said the Christians warm amen glory amen you ought to know how you feel just cold wave after wave then here comes faith moving in and then here comes a cold wave moving in waves channels just like the radio whatever television television is waves and materializes as the waves are brought in on a certain kind of crystal or whatever it is I hope you're sending a wave of faith this morning that's what I'm trying to send to Jesus a wave I believe I believe if I'll pray for somebody I believe I'll answer the prayer I believe God will answer these prayer requests we wrote down here if not then it was just a cold wave of icy cold demon demon powers moving in well I don't know if I should pray for this or not see how that's a cold a cold wave that's a it's a unbelief attitude we've got to be warm we got to say Jesus forgive us now Lord answer every prayer we know all things are possible we know we have access to the Father through the son by the blood of Jesus Christ so does the and so does the power of Almighty God materialized vision materialized in front of you just like radio just like tells me if God has called you to do so you believe that it does it's proof I'm going to ask you to be just as quiet as you can and don't stir around because you're certainly an interference to the ways he says now we got to balance that out you know because we know people sometimes have to get out and use the restroom but what he means is you got to sit there and be reverent if you got to use the restroom go use the restroom but come back and be reverent like brother BAM said teenagers passing notes and joking around and chewing gum and popping jokes and popping gum whatever see you'll break up the waves we're trying to get ways from God this morning aren't you trying to get away from God a wave of faith a way of of anointing a warm wave now programs do the prayer line I'm skipping this to get right to the quote he said now she she said now right now you feel a real sweet warm spirit if that's right raise up your hands cuz you are a Christian so unbelief is this cold I don't want to hear nothing about it stop talking about it who are you what you're barking up the wrong tree all those cold waves of unbelief but faith waves are warm and they build you up and they make you feel at home and they make you love being at church like you love being here because Christ is here he said you ever see a picture that light that pillar of light fire the pillar of light in the picture we got it here it's taken all over the world we got them right here at the building now you ever seen it alright that lights hanging right between me and the woman right now I'm looking right at it that's why it was warm there because the Holy Spirit was there how many want the friends the Lord here today warm not cold skeptic upset frustrated critical unbelieving but believing warm happy thankful full of the wisdom of God full of the mercy and the love of God that's what we want today now that's another quote about that so bro Graham tells us now there's a lady she's prayed for God told her she'd come she cut sheet I'm sure she'd get to come and get to see me here just keep believing that's lovely if you can keep that up that real wave of faith coming off from the audience then that's good so you keep that thinking now just keep believing don't doubt keep it in your heart now you've got to keep doing it so all throughout the surface I hope God is is teaching us that for this service but also for Wednesday - you've got to keep I know it's and I know stuff I know stuff I've sat there on the Pew - I listen to preachers you've got to keep that attitude like oh god is here all things are possible Christ is here to help people Jesus can do something I believe this is going to be a good service God's going to move and then the service God's gonna help somebody you've got it we've got to keep that attitude that's the way we keep the warm waves flowing did you see that a couple years ago I saw it on Facebook these these men and women scientists were so happy they had this machine called a wave machine they just push this button and it makes a natural wave and they were so happy they're like oh my we've been doing we just made a perfect way just like the ocean and somebody put under there on Facebook they said they think they're so great guys been doing that for 6,000 years like we made a wave but church in all reality that's what a lot of people do today they just do a man-made wave while they try to pretend like we'll try to get this thing going let's try to get this wave going Oh Lord Jesus but a real wave of God is produced when we come to God's house we bring an offering right we bring we have something to bring we have a leadership of the Holy Spirit and we're just so grateful to come to God's house we're just so grateful to worship Him and that my friends produces a wave of faith how many can say amen to that so when you're walking you see van you just hug his head hug him around the neck and shake his hand say good to see you brother god bless you you don't avoid him and try not to shake his hand get away from me that creates the wrong wave you create a wave of faith because you're happy to be here you cry out to God because we don't have enough of God that's why we cry out from all our Amen I'll tell you I'll have enough of God when the rapture gets here until then I'm gonna keep crying out for more of God again I knew yeah that's what we've all got to do brother answer the early church cried out for more they had the Holy Ghost but they still in the crowd for more because they needed it and we need it too by God's grace that's why I invite everybody keep coming anyone that can come pray early before service prayer meeting every Sunday 10:30 everybody's welcome to come everybody Wednesday night prayer meeting at 6:30 everybody's welcome to come I've announced that for over a year now so but whatever however you get in the wave of the Holy Spirit however but see we're gonna have to bring something we have to produce a wave of faith keep believing keep trusting in God's Word remember brother BAM it talks about the only thing to do is bring the right atmosphere then for the dances to put on your old music that makes dances and everybody get thinking what a good time they're going to have and dance and so forth they'll be having a big whoop upping time put the right kind of music on the piano the organ and everybody the atmosphere that Jesus Christ is there and going to meet everything that they have need of something we'll go to taking place atmosphere but that's the hardest thing there is to do and that is to get the people in the atmosphere the atmosphere worship the atmosphere believing and the church said every church every time I come to church I got I'm doing the hardest job I could've possibly do some people might have shoveled dirt all day that's that's a hard job dig a ditch that's a hard job but brother and said the hardest thing to do is try to get people in the atmosphere believing oh let's search let's believe how many will believe by God's grace I'm almost done you'll give me a few more minutes almost gone an hour the hardest job there is Bill Graham said as I get people believing pushing out these warm waves letting the warm the warmth of the Holy Spirit the love of God flow out and not issuing cold one cold cold cold God's not here guys he's not gonna do anything nobody nobody's in the right spirit no I'm in the right spirit I've got faith I believe Jesus Christ is here I know he's the same yesterday today and forever I need to go pray for this person I need to do this I need I have a leadership of the Lord that's what we need is a leadership of the Lord now I'm just gonna skip right to this I'm gonna skip a few quotes because I'm already at an hour and I don't want to wear myself out yeah look at all those quotes I got 12 quotes there 14 okay I'm skipping right to this guy right here I'm skipping right to this guy you like that guy he at 56 years old just like brother branham I'm gonna remind you of that if you haven't seen that before brother man makes a staggering statement about Abraham Lincoln about his purpose in life to me it just staggered me I'm like wow I was thankful I was listening to it because I've been studying on purpose and he makes a important statement about Abraham Lincoln's purpose in life doors and a door he said I was reading the story 100 days of our noble one of the greatest presence I think the nation ever had was Lincoln not because it he comes from Kentucky the same state his brother branham but because he was a great man he was deprived of an education but yet was something in his heart some purpose God chose a man with no education to free all the African American slaves well the only way he could do that would be to get an education but he has none how was he gonna do that then is he gonna sit back and his lazy labor to see and lazy boys say okay God go do it no it'd be the same as Joshua you go possess the land footstep by footstep every day Lincoln you go possess the land see God put something in Abraham Lincoln's heart that he just couldn't get away from it was his purpose in life he had 56 years glory to accomplish his purpose amen only 56 but if he could be faithful with this then God would exalt him and reward him in heaven hey man I believe God will by God's grace hallelujah there was something in his heart some purpose what is my purpose in life he sound like a man of vision see he saw what we hear what he was supposed to do in life he saw it way off I like people that's got something they're fighting for not just lay around and say well every what comes along that'll be alright it sounds like Eeyore right we got a lot of yours around the world around the message maybe well God ever does anything in my life maybe it'll happen or what are you doing about it what are you doing about it he said o beat up and add it and Lincoln never let his education stand in the way he had something to do and I think just the Christian preachers ought to be the same way find your purpose and go do is that what the quote says just the preachers Oh every Christian ought to be the same way find your purpose in life and go do it your purpose will never break God's word never every member of this businessmen's chapter and just not well we'll have a breakfast once a month maybe we'll do that once a month that isn't it or once every Saturday we'll have a breakfast he said have a purpose in life something you're going to do let's God has placed you here do something about it every member of just some churches every church you like that Lydia you like that quote every member of every Tenex that includes everybody right everybody needs to know their purpose know their gifts invest in them and bring that sacrifice unto God bring that offering unto God God place you this is if there's a revival in town that revival is there for a purpose let's get something out of it let's do something about it and I'm a firm believer in this every service we have is a revival service because I've been down in the dumps Church and I'll come to church I've studied and prayed I'm still battling fighting all these battles everything and I'll leave churches I leave Church revived amen and that revival will take me to Wednesday so I get another revival hallelujah every service is a revival that's why I act like it I come to pray before service every service because it's a revival to me if I thought it was time to cool off then I wouldn't pray as much anymore but we have to smear to keep ourselves what in constant revival because you're either moving towards your purpose towards God or away from God that's that's just the way I feel led to live my life now let capitis has things very close to Burt Britannica I don't trust Wikipedia okay I trust Britannica little more little because all the fake news it's hard to know who to trust other than God's Word the Bible and God's prophet it's hard to know who to trust but as the youth Lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with front to your life so see God already put this in him I really don't like you know just working with my hands you know see he was God ordained him to be a president that was his calling in life and so no wonder he just didn't I don't get excited about the chainsaw I don't of course it happened but I don't get excited about that acts like my dad or my brother why are you crazy you think you're good enough to go to school and you think you're smart enough to be just act like your dad just act like your brother now I've got a different purpose in my life oh you think you're better than us no God just put something in my heart I've just got a different purpose in life some of his name family members thought that time he was lazy Oh have you ever seen Abe he is so lazy he is the laziest worker out there and there's a children's book written by a historian and that's what they would do they would heat whatever he could do while reading he would do it whether it's chop wood clean wash the the wash the food break up the follow growl whatever he could do he would do it try to read at the same time that lazy boy why does he only want to read and write and get educated education z' of the devil see how people it's how people are just so unbalanced see how they're so unbalanced they just want an excuse not to go to school and work hard and the church said program said you find a Christian that's somebody that will work hard no matter whatever they're doing they'll be the best at whatever they do all she does is read and scribbled write and cipher and poetry he'll do anything to get away from manual labor and it wasn't even his fall so he he was just manifesting what was inside of him glory hallelujah stepmother said hmm you know we're like Phil's physical labor too much and think church if he did not follow the purpose of God in his life we're with african-americans be in our country today where would I because no my mom was Indian and Spanish and Mexican or whatever the combinations are I can show you the DNA but it doesn't really prove it hold I guess where would I be I might be in slavery today if he didn't follow his god-given purpose which was so different than everybody else in his family to the connection he was going to be Emancipator but the channel for God to do that wasn't like Moses to bring him out and go against the government the plan of God was different to place him through the government the church said Moses he come out with the staff and he just tore up the government but God didn't do it that way Abraham Lincoln side he did it by knowing him and sending him into the government when he grew up as a man he had less than a year of schooling and was one of the greatest presidents ever Amen hallelujah he was an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning this is Wikipedia C he read all that he could read he reread the King James Bible glory Aesop's fables I'm not so big on those John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress my wife likes that book I never read it Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe I don't think my children liked that one very much at least that was kind of boring I think uh the life of Washington say you read about George Washington they had glory and the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin whoops oh I went to pilgrims progress sorry oh there's a link on that oh that's what it is okay sorry there's a hyperlink on that slide I didn't he realize that now the Britannica says his stepmother encouraged him in reading and yet the original source of his desire remains something of a mystery I just thought I'd highlight that amen brother Graham said the will of God for your life is a mystery and so the will of God still remains a mystery for to them they don't even know I was Abraham Lincoln well I was like this they don't even understand the mystery but we know the mysteries that he could free the the african-americans he can free all these men and women around our nation that's why he was born that was his purpose in life and he accomplished that purpose by honoring God amen see to them it's somewhat mysterious well I wonder why he likes learning and reading and writing so much what we know excusing they going he's gonna break down those natural walls and those natural prisons he was gonna break all those down that men and women could be free that's right he would walk miles just the borrow book he said the corn his own statement his early surroundings he had nothing around him to excite ambition for education he said still somehow I could read write and cipher in the rule of three but that was a ha I don't know what that means the rule of three apparently the young Lincoln did not read a large number of books but thoroughly absorbed a few that he could read I can't read a lot but what I got I'll just know I'll memorize that it's a good thing he only had the Bible praise God it's a good thing that one of the Bible in fact this was this says the Bible was the only book his family ever owned actually that's what this says Britannica Oh God knew how to do it God knew it somebody's gonna set Mane's of people free he's got to have one book oh it's the Bible hallelujah amen if I need somebody that's gonna set millions of people free let it be I'm gonna give them only one thing and that's the Word of God amen and that will set slaves free hallelujah that's the same thing that will set us free today is the Word of God amen when we meditate and give pre evidence to the Word of God we get the Pacitti today's the opposite we got to limit the books we read and focus on the Word of God now this is the fancy version of the Emancipation Proclamation have you ever seen the original it's a piece of yellow paper just hand written out front and back and they doctored up like this you know to be to be nailed all around the country I love that in that beautiful here's a man had no education and God ray is up this man out in that Kentucky log cabin raises them up and puts this ambition I've just got to learn for some reason I just got to read I've got to have the ability to read and write and be a lawyer and be smart and educated there's something inside of me pushing me to do this everybody else making fun of me call me lazy I've just got a burn to do have a purpose in life brother Branham said don't sit there and do nothing he said having ambition in your life know what God has called you to do now it's hard to see there it's really hard but he says in the in the this 22nd day of September of the year of our Lord our Lord 1862 a proclamation was issued by the President on States containing among other things the following and the first day of the next year January 1st 1863 all persons held as slaves within my state or designate a part of the state that people aware of shall be then in rebellion against the United States shall then be thought or henceforth and forever free amen on the January 1st everyone will be forever free who's been a slave before amen he said I'm proclaiming this why does why is he lazy why isn't he working he's got to learn how to read and write so that someday he can lead the country and set all the captives free a different purpose than most people Abraham Lincoln two months before the war ended he told a painter he said the central act of my administration the Emancipation Proclamation was the greatest event of the 19th century oh my goodness the greatest event was setting millions of people free how many agree with that I think I agree I often check the dates on what was the dates of John Wesley wasn't that 1700s that was the start of the church age I think I'm not mistaken oh yeah so the greatest name of the 1700s was God's messenger John Wesley coming on the scene or the 18th century rather the greatest event of the 19th century Abraham Lincoln setting the captives free amen and then the greatest event of the 20th century was God's prophet setting the bride free yes Amen did you remember the solemnity similarities they're born a hundred years apart 1809 1909 they're both born in a log cabin in Kentucky they never officially officially required membership in any church they're not tied down by denominational Creed's both their first and last names can say to contain seven late letters Lincoln's mill name doesn't have seven letters they're both elected to Congress well he was elected to Congress 1846 brother Branham got his commission he was elected to be the Prophet well we got the Commission on the angel in 1946 a hundred years apart and that's striking Church Abraham Lincoln died in 1865 at 56 years old brother Ram died in 1965 at 56 years old Lincoln was assassinated by a group of Jesuit followers Catholics the car that struck brother branham was killed killed him had three Catholic boys in it both of them have their faces carved in mountains Oh hallelujah don't you love that honey can say amen to that oh it's such a similarity let's stand our feet so church is it true I believe it with all my heart it is true the greatest event of the 20th century was God opening the seals by doing that all of the mysteries of God now the book can be open and now the Bible can be understood the way it was supposed to be understood Lincoln the greatest event of the 19th I believe William Branham the greatest event of the 20th century because now Saints can be freed in the Holy Spirit hallelujah after at the end of his ministry brother band says see that's what I'm in Arizona now there's many people sitting here stood right here in Phoenix and heard me tell you from this very platform thus saith the Lord how many members is it now something's fixing to happen now I went back and found this right before the sword came down in his hand brother Brandon told these people in Phoenix he said in the name of the Lord something's going to happen and I found it was January 14th 1963 listen to a programs real solemn he's real serious he's not real ah but he says he said I'm here in Phoenix tonight in the name of the Lord I would not try to explain what's happened many of you that's taking the tapes be sure to get that one what time is it sir that was just before I left home a vision sent me here yes I don't know I'm not a tape salesman I don't stress those things we get them and we got to take business around the world remember the Bible said prophets speak in the name of the Lord where did the CIO's do buh-bam tells us who know I'm sorry this is the same quote before the seals were opened right before he has the vision I'm sure right before he sees the seven angels right before he gets the Kings sword he tells him about sirs was the end time and he said after all of my life of seeing visions I never had anything like this before in my life and I don't know what it is I'm just here but he sent me here I don't know what it means I'm just here this is a literal prophecy Church this is a prophecy right here I'm here in the name of the Lord program tells him two years later he said to see I told you it was thus saith the Lord he said I don't know what's happening when he says he tells them a name of Lord God sent me here I don't know what it means I'm just here and then that sermon brother Bram talks about how he saw seven angels the sword came his hand said go home and open these seven seals that are given and here they are the true mystery of marriage and divorce and the serpent seen all these things that's been fuss about its thus saith the Lord what is it quickening power coming to the church to make her ready that the hour approaching quickening power oh god help us to receive it help us to believe it how many believe it I'm near sending warm waves out today I believe it with all my heart the quickening power of the word is here the greatest event brother Jose in the 20th century glory was God sending his prophet out west to get this sort the Kings sword and go home and break every seal and cut out every bit of doubt about the Word of God anymore amen oh there's no doubts about marriage and divorce there's no doubt about the seven seals of the church ages there's no doubts we've got thus saith the Lord but see it's all about no church this is where it gets to us for our worship it just depends attitude if we're just coming to church to come to church it's not it's not gonna have the quickening power we've got to constantly examine our motive and objective are we bringing the right kind of worship are we bringing something that's letter the holy spirit to church like I said it's okay we're just trying to sit there and absorb something from time to time but more often if we're really walking the spirit we should be able to bring something to the house of God how many want to do that by God's grace god bless you praise God let's bow our head that's here I was just so amazing to me that he had a purpose in life the RAM said don't lay around every Christian in every church ought to be that way find your purpose and go do it if your purpose is words of wisdom and you've seen God give you words of wisdom then please pray for that purpose get focus on that purpose if it's the same songs get focused on that God anointed me to bring a song this on doctrine or the Jose's brought me some good doctrines over the years if it's on tongues like our sister Naomi that may be her prayer request today interpretation if you've ever interpreted dream that might be your prayer today your focus right help me to find my purpose and go do it we don't want to lay around to have a purpose in life something that you're going to do Lincoln just said I'm just I just feel led to learn led to read these books I just feel led to do this know what I'm called to do there's something inside Oh God hopefully each and every one here to know what God has called you to do I know I'm called to preach I've asked God I've I prove God God said prove me see if I won't answer my own work I know I'm called a preacher I believe that no one has to beg me to preach nice to say we gonna get to church on time every Christian fine be that way like Lincoln find your purpose have any father we've heard a pure word today or I'm not saying that because I preached it saying that because that's it's the Word of God it's your word now I feel your holy presence dear God I've tried not to interject any my thoughts more trying to give illustrations from I'm thinking [Music] or this was my greatest desire as a pastor I prayed it many times but Lord that our church would be a part of this rapturing faith movement Lord that we could come to the full the fullness of the book of Acts Church I believe that's your purpose for this church [Music] that's been my prayer all these years so father my prayer today Lord is that each person would get a revelation of their purpose in life and they would go do it as your prophets go do it help us and lord help me help none of us just lay around and not do anything Oh God when you've given us these talents in our lives then let's not bury them under earthly desires and cares oh I gotta take care of this maybe we just put that gift first here God knew who put that talent first seek you first and all these other things will be added unto me granite Heavenly Father I know this is a deep message I know it's asking a great responsibility of our church here but I believe they're solid people here they proved it to everybody Lord these faithful members here they proved it they love you they're gonna serve it we're not walking away they believe the Lord help each one of us more to know what we're called to do and bring something that will promote growth promote happiness promote wisdom promote holiness in the lives of the saints together thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord what I believe was the greatest event of the 20th century when you open the seals and now we have this quickening power of this word Lord to me is just as powerful when I see it working in my life I see it begin to beginning to work in my children's lives [Music] recognizing some of their gifts talents recognizing it and other people in the church Lord God o God let each and every heart Lord God know their purpose and do it I believe you'll help them Lord that's my prayer now help them Jesus help me of each one of us Lord God to find our purpose in life thank you lord oh we just love these solemn times these times of real sincere worship Lord Times we can feel your presence the seriousness of it the sacredness of it it's such a special thing Lord God don't often feel this all the time every day [Music] lord I just pray well once again please write that scripture on the hearts of every person here in Braddock Christ fellowship the Lord when we all come together may every one of us have a song a doctor in a tongue a revelation and interpretation and all things may be done to promoting growth may we help each other to grow in Jesus nice name the church said hallelujah I would encourage your church to you feel led to the Lord like you have a gift or something like that or just write it down I've been writing down my goals since I started writing the books you know a book there and it really helped me out it really helped me out there's

life God took him as 17 years old sister Ford had 85 years her children said there would have never been a better mother husband said there could not have been a better wife than her let us find our purpose and do it with all that we have how do you raise their hand and say help me Jesus to do that how many would cry out in prayer just say Jesus help me to find my purpose in life nor the early church cried out god I cry out Lord God nope your people Lord of this humble assembly in this humble time Lord gone this dark age I just cry out Jesus than every person find their purpose o God that
