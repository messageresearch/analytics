========================================

thank you Texas 25 or state you got it you say man one two three and let them make me a sanctuary's word I have some slight descriptions we'd like to share did you get a chance to listen to Wednesday night I'd encourage you to listen to Wednesday the first sermon in the series here see how many uh we get through we ended Wednesday night we're looking at the high priest and how we had to offer uh blood in the holiest of holies in order to forgive all the people praise God and when we know in the New Testament Jesus did that by offering his own blood in heaven for us aren't you glad for that praise God Amen now Church really really this should take away all of our fears of failing this should take away all of our fears of going to hell because Jesus Christ presented a blood sacrifice for us praise God Jehovah Jireh provided himself a sacrifice praise God a sacrifice for you and I amen I hope that makes your heart forward of God's love amen amen and uh let's continue on this thought here by the grace of God the Tabernacle Moses now the Bible says before Faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should be afterwards be revealed wherefore the law was our school Master to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith so the law uh was incredibly detailed we know there were 613 laws in general and many of those related to the ceremonial law the laws related to the Tabernacle of Moses or the temple yeah Tabernacle Moses rather the Temple of Solomon um it was incredibly detailed I can only scratch the surface I mean every color in there every detail every socket every every Blossom every single thing you see as a type it's all pointing to the work of Jesus Christ it's all pointing us to Christ and so the law was a school master so you think of a teacher you think of someone who knows a lot no I'm gonna I'm the exception I don't know a lot praise God but most teachers know a lot amen their teachers are supposed to be knowledgeable and strict and and help you learn uh the Bible said the law was a Schoolmaster to bring you to Christ so uh we look at the Old Testament was pointing us to Jesus Christ all these details point us to Jesus Christ so many details uh so many uh uh things you can read in the Bible and scratch your head and not quite sure but if you go to the New Testament you'll find all of it was pointing to Jesus Christ why that we might be justified which means declare righteous as one ought to be praise God Amen so this this means here that that the righteousness of Jesus Christ here was shared with us it was a Divine exchange Jesus took all of our iniquity all of our guilt all of our shame and we inherited by uh by The Exchange We inherited his righteousness praise God and he justified us because a sacrifice was provided for us amen we could not bring our own sacrifice God had to provide a sacrifice for us and when we accept that sacrifice and I'm saying this when Heaven accepted that sacrifice then we were accepted with it praise God Amen Hallelujah that's what Justified us the fact that we believe and we're trusting in Heaven's sacrifice that was sent down to earth and we'll get to that Lord willing today now after faith has come we're no longer under the law praise God because if you if you break one thing you're cursed the Bible says right uh so we're not under the law like a school Master right like some teachers you have as long as you do what they say you're on their good side but you do one thing wrong now they hate you I ever had a teacher like that I've had a few like that all of a sudden they'll just flip on you and they'll be against you but but the Bible says we're not under the law that way anymore you break one law you're guilty of all we're not under that we are now we're not uh slaves we are children unto God we are God's children just like you would never you would never think of getting rid of your children you never think well I don't not what I don't really want this child or I could do away with that child you always love to embrace God because they came out of you amen that's how it is with God God doesn't look for opportunities to get rid of us God's trying to keep us God's trying to help us grow God's trying to help us to be real sons and daughters amen amen and so the incredible detail of the law was to show us the incredible character of Jesus Christ like I said I can only scratch the surface of it no I just want to review a little bit on the purpose and pattern I want to add a few things God had Moses built this Tabernacle so he could dwell with them right uh and and this is what God wanted God wanted to be right in the center remember the picture I showed it to you Wednesday uh God one let me just go back I might as well go back this okay I'm gonna slide 63 up let's go back to the beginning God wanted to dwell with them there is and I know it's God God would dwell here so God wanted to be at the very center of their lives that's right that's what it is today Church you know love loving Jesus should be at the very center of your life amen don't make it the outside thing the last thing you get to make it the very first thing amen amen make it your motivation make it your love make it your strength put Jesus Christ at the very center meet with him every day so he guides your full day praise God and make sure you do a morning and evening sacrifice amen start the day with him end today with him break up spend the whole day with him he was he wants to dwell with us praise God that's why he added this Tabernacle place there so he could speak to them dwell with them Hallelujah be with them and that's what he wants in our lives he wants to be with us constantly amen Hallelujah so look at that Wednesday that he wanted to dwell with them now 63. yeah and notice also commune now here's where it was you talk with us now most of us don't hear voices some of us do like maybe Brother Ray from time to time and he's not here but uh you know just know people that sometimes hear the voice of God so you have to understand there's there's a certain kind of communion God has with you in other words God will show you when he's speaking to you and you'll learn to understand okay this is God speaking to me here and normally church it's completely different than our human thoughts that's why when the Bible says be transformed that transform is the same word as Transfiguration on Mount Transfiguration so Jesus was standing like a man like brother amen but then when he was transfigured he was as bright as the sun that's the great difference between our thoughts and God's thoughts amen when God speaks to you glory when God communes with you it's the difference between regular and Supernatural praise God Hallelujah that's the reality of God communing with us praise God because God says I want to meet with them I want to dwell among them so I can talk with them so I can fellas it with them so I can know them and they can know me praise God Hallelujah to know Christ that's what Paul said that's the greatest thing to know Christ and him crucified Hallelujah wake up now we looked at the five applications I'm just gonna add a little bit more I'm not gonna do any really review I'm just going to add more on it like I said you can easily listen to the sermon uh I'm sorry it cut off two-thirds of the way through so I'm sorry about that the softwares I think it's the software because I bought a new computer so it's got to do the software but sorry about that but we just want to add a little more now Israel's approach to meet with God was quite plain I want to just look at this thought though uh that the Tabernacle had outer curtains and also one gate or one door and remember all this pointed to Christ so when you would come here if you were a worshiper you could not get in if you were unclean and you had to be honest if you were dishonest and you had touched something dead and you tried to get it and they found out later you'd be killed yeah because God said you defiled My Sanctuary praise God you don't you don't come to God to file you come to God God has a way for you to come you've come by getting his cleansing work on your life praise God Hallelujah so if you had no sin this is what you'd see you'd see this white uh this white structure a white fence and that was your meeting place with God praise God but you didn't come there uh just without being cleansed you had to be cleansed before you'd let be let in praise God now the outer curtains the Bible said uh were hangings of fine twine linen of a hundred cubits long for one side so you would see it on the side back there in the picture you'd see white all the way around so goddess house was the White House amen because white represents the righteousness of saints praise God that's what the Bible says for God hath made Jesus to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in Christ amen praise God in other words please we Christ shares his righteousness with us praise God he became our sin he shares his righteousness with us and the Bible said in Revelation 19 at the battle of Armageddon Jesus comes back and with his army his armies his bride her and she's arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints you and I have no no righteousness of our own our righteousness is like bloody filthy rags and we have no righteousness of our own the only righteousness we have is what God will share with us amen amen which he will give to us as a gift for repenting and believing in his son Jesus Christ so the white violin represents the Holiness of Jesus Christ right and so the outer curtain of course there were 60 pillars total and now Church you know you see in the scripture here each pillar had sockets of brass and hooks uh and fillets of silver and I don't I forgot to get a picture up here to show you but if you have to look at the intricate details uh you would see that these pillars were made of wood which is humanity would always represent represents Humanity okay just like that uh like uh Paul said Paul said there's four kinds of vessels right gold silver wood and Earth so wood represents that that third one like Judas is scared it's still for burn right it's to be burned represents the humanity now each one has grass sockets and Brass represents sin has already been judged when uh when the when the people complain when Israel complained the Wilderness uh God told Moses go get a brass serpent and they just have to look and live they didn't have to do anything else they just had to look at God's uh God's servant and they were healed they didn't have to memorize the scripture right they didn't have to recite a Creed they'd have to pray 10 times but they just had to look and live Church you just gotta look to Christ and live amen amen sometimes there's no we got to memorize scripture to train our bodies and my husband just for salvation you just gotta look and hold yourself Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus look forward to his face just revenge of your sins just look and live and God will do the Reckless work if you just look to Heaven praise God Hallelujah and silver speaks of redemption because every man had to pay a shekel of silver in order to redeem his soul every year to the Tabernacle that kept the money flowing and it gave them you know the funds they needed to support all the work of the Tabernacle and God specifically said silver shekels for the Redemption of your soul so you're reminded that your soul was purchased it was redeemed your soul was rescued from Death unto I praise God and so see each one now you can spend the whole service just on this aspect right and I'm not going to do that but I just want you to see some of these aspects of it when you come to the Tabernacle you'd see white the righteousness of Christ you would see the humanity of Christ amen you see Jesus as wrath remember when Jesus comes back to Revelation uh the Bible says his feet are his brass that means he's already judged a sin praise God the Bible said he's trotted the right wine press of the fiercest and Wrath of almighty God he already walked through the fires of Affliction so we don't have to praise God Amen he's walked through that difficult fire he's walked through the wrath of God so we don't have to and then he gave us a white God praise God he took away our dirty garments and closed us with life his own righteousness praise God so we see that he defeated our sins for us amen amen what a blessing praise God so you can see all these types now remember there's only one gate or one door there's only one way in to the Tabernacle and notice it was a it was a hanging so the gate was a hanging and they'd have to move it to the side it had the colors of blue purple and Scarlet again fine twine linen so they'll give you the righteousness of Christ it has the pillars and I'm not going to focus on that but there was one way in right and Jesus said I am the door of the Sheep so this one entrance so there's always going to be one way in praise God all that ever came before Jesus were thieves and robbers the Sheep did not hear them but Jesus said I am the door if any man enter in he shall be saved and go in and out and find pasture right now David I live church that's what we should come in when we come to the message when we don't come through William Branham we come through Jesus Christ amen William Brandon was just pointing us into the door amen but Jesus is the door praise God you know I always listen always listen uh to these guys that leave the message and I hear their testimonies and it's so sad they were raised in message charges to essentially worship Brothers he said they wouldn't even the one guy left and now he's criticizing brother but he he said he was raised just to listen to things he never read his Bible because they were told when Roman reads the scripture that that's the only interpretation that you can have of the Bible now we know about a man grew in his Revelation right like the white horse rider so many examples you could give but I thought isn't that so sad in other words these churches were making brother Brown the dog my brother Brandon was just like the wood you were just Humanity but that wasn't the type brother man is not the type of the door Jesus Christ is the type of the door Brother Brad had no righteousness of his own Jesus is the only one who have righteousness so thank God we come through the door the right door praise God amen no doubt they came through a door but it was the wrong door to the wrong phone it was to go pastures not the Sheep pasture praise God Under the Sea patch how do you know we got a bunch of sheep around me a lot of I hear the Sheep bleeding praise God I hear the voice of sheep I see the character of sheep I see the humanity of God's people who are all defended by the one Shepherd that's Jesus Christ amen one door no church I'm saved not because of what I've done but because I've come to the right door if you walked in that Tabernacle you and God forgiven you would know I'm saved I'm forgiven because I came in the right door praise God man I didn't go to anybody else's door any other impersonator's door I just went through God's door and the Bible said if I go through Jesus the door I say hallelujah that's the confidence we have in Christ people can say what they want they could call me a Judas they could call you whatever they can say anything they want but that doesn't take away the fact that you know you've gone through the right door praise God be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost In other words repent come through the gate amen go through the outer core and the inner core and you shall reach the holiest of holies amen hallelujah now anyone can look if you looked at the scripture yesterday I had to say a lot of free time it was actually quite strange we had stayed at home to hold out didn't do any errands yesterday it was one of the weirdest days of my life it's kind of said oh why time to look about the sky and it was so beautiful blue yesterday if I was doing it most beautiful Blues you'd ever want to see yesterday hopefully you can get some of that today it's a little overcast though but blue you know this this this uh this uh this hanging here was blue purple and Scarlet so blue represents heavily so we're learning about Jesus when you come to Jesus you're coming the Heavenly way right because that's what his color is blue you come to him he's the Heavenly way also there's purple which represents royalty when Jesus crucified when they put a purple robe on him to mock it oh here's hilar key lrk purple always that's royalty so when we come uh Jesus way we're coming the way of the king uh we're coming the way of Heaven's cave praise God hallelujah Heaven's King and Scarlet represents he bore our sins because Isaiah says though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be white as snow so we see this is the way in knowing that God sent Jesus from heaven and this is the Heavenly Kingdom's way to Bear our sins our sins will be done away with our sins will all be parted if we come God's provide a way through the one door the one day and Jesus is the dog oh thanks so much and takes away all the feeder Church yeah yeah when you see this what because this is all pointing to somebody not pointing to me it's all going to Christ the word amen remember these are better promises we are beautiful promises but we have better promises than that praise God Hallelujah now I want to add a little bit more just to prove I felt like I should prove a little bit more on this and maybe go a little deeper so inside the baptism of the Holy Ghost we'd say inside your soul the word of God is written upon the fleshy tables of your heart so now you have Heaven's will inside your heart praise God I believe that's a little buzzer that goes off but Iran says if you got the word of God and something goes against that it's a little buzzer Ah that's not right that's not that God put it in your heart to save your life I'm sorry brother to save your life to protect your life now the man I said was the original seed and I I thought about that why did I say that and so I got the scripture on that and then the rod is a resurrected life a resurrected testimony now here's where I knew I knew it was a c but I had to find the scripture until yesterday Exodus 16 31 the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna which means what is it and it was like a coriander seed white the taste of it was like the Wafers made of honey so that's why the Bible says You must be born again of The Incorruptible seed the word of God Amen so see Manna is like a seed and your soul is a place that's likened unto having a seed praise God and of course this was the original seed for there it is the original was Manna From Heaven this is a scene from Heaven praise God God's nature God's character a seed from heaven where does it live listen your soul praise God Hallelujah no the rod of Aaron I want to add a little more on that rate gave me a good thought and uh after service I'm like no I never knew that but let me look that up the Bible's at number 17. now here's where we get Aaron's Rob now just to give you a background of the story Cora and Nathan were some famous men in Israel and they said you know what Moses and air we're just as holy as you we'd like to go in and offer incense we wanted to go in the Holy place and mo said no no no God's chosen us you guys you guys are going to take care of the Tabernacle Furniture you're just gonna pack a carrot the God has called us this he said no he said no no no we we're just as holy as you are and Moses fell down on his face and cried out to God and God said have every one of those men bring their rod and say he said the one that brings forth fruit he said that's the one I've chosen to be my minister right you know the story right God and Moses said if these men die regular death then God didn't send me I think God swallowed him up in the earth if I'm not mistaken yeah yeah so all these other men die poor days and all these men died but when they went in the the holiest of holies the only Rod they brought out the only one that had in life was Aaron's rock and Aaron's Rod here brought forth buds had blossoms and yielded almonds and Moses brought out all the rides before the Lord under the children of Israel they looked and took every man this round and the Lord said to Moses bring Aaron's Rod again before the testimony to be kept for a token against the rebels and thou shalt quite take away their murmings from me that they die now so see this was an issue of people complaining against the the prophet and the priesthood right now Aaron's Rod types Christ because Aaron was God's chosen minister so is Christ God's chosen Minister and he proved it by the power of Resurrection amen thank God that church in all men here it resembles a peach tree uh but I want to read this part here the reason it's given a special account it's putting forth it blossoms is so early generally generally uh February sometimes even January okay so in other words all friends are the first to Blossom and when Aaron's Rod got the prince of God it didn't bring forth peaches or anything like that or Outlaws it brought forth almonds they brought forth the first fruits Hallelujah and every man in his own order Christ is the what first fruits afterwards and it's coming Hallelujah so God had to have almonds come out because it shows that here this Aaron's preacher would be would be recognized with the resurrection Aaron would have the connection to the Everlasting God the god of Resurrection praise God Hallelujah Aaron had the connection to the resurrection now also it's interesting too is uh God gave Jeremiah a vision and he said what see us now Jeremiah chapter one he said I see a rod of an almond tree then the Lord said unto me thus well seen for I will hasten my word to perform it so all men can offer also represent God's watchfulness to perform his word in other words God's word churches ought to make us so happy today God will not delay the Fulfillment of his word amen just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it's not going to God watches over his word like he brings forth the almonds he brings the first verse in other words God is going to bring his promises the best the Rapture is coming I don't care what anybody says God is going to make sure God watches over every promise and it will come to pass in his time Hallelujah that's what the Almond represents I'm going to watch over my word you can Bank on my word my word will happen before anything else happens amen praise God in other words church God is always on time encourage us don't be frustrated if we have to wait right we just have a we have to sign that song says just a few more weary days and then I'll Fly Away it's just a few weary days God's Eternal God's outside of time God's not looking at your talking God is looking at his timepiece Hallelujah and he Likens this almond why did Ayers rod bring almonds the resurrection God was performing his word God was going to perform his resurrection power through the ministry of Moses and error out of Egypt what's that Resurrection he said well now I bring my son out of Egypt out of Egypt haven't I called my son Amen in other words you never forget about us son was dead and sins and transgressions his son was dead Israel was dead in the Abominations of Egypt but God had called his son out come out of there come out of there come into life praise God [Applause] no they waited 400 years or some say 430 the Bible says that there's a little extended time here although we had to wait 430 years God was hey God was hastening to perform his work that's right so never be discouraged God's timing is always perfect he's going to watch over it like the old amen notice he says the Almond in February or January that months before the first of the first fruits way before it's months before God always sends that reminder I'm watching my word my word will come to pass look for that first fruit that proves I always keep my word oh thank God amen amen in church if you remember that almond was even on that Menorah too what's that Menorah that's the type of your life and the Seven Church ages almonds were on there blossoms were on there does the bible say that we're a part of the Church of the firstborn amen praise God the dead in Christ rise fire Satan Hallelujah that's not Menorah River says the seven Church ages all men are on that menorah because we're the Church of the firstborn the dead in Christ will rise first how many believe that God's watching over his word God is going to bring it to past Church also Aaron and his sons would bear Israel's iniquity type in Christ bearing our iniquities as Heaven's high priest that's what numbers 18. so after Aaron's Rod budded the Lord said to Aaron thou thy Sons thy father's house with thee shalt bear the iniquity of the sanctuary in other words they had to deal with the sins of the people the bear the Bible said that to Bear their own sins on the down the on the day of atonement Aaron had to First go in there and make atonement for his sins before he could help the people oh and not a good lessons amen but in other words before you can help anybody you gotta ask forgiveness for your sins because the Bible said of our hearts condemn us we're not going to get what we asked for yeah say what a great lesson what a great lesson see and that church that's what we're here to do as well as spiritual Kings and Priests we're here to Bear people's burdens come up beside them and help them say Hey Brother here just come under my shoulder God's made me strong for this season you come I'm going to help you out by God's grace is that right bear bear burdens pray for them if they're battling suicide give them Words of Life praise God if they're bowel and depression give them words of Hope God's gonna change his situation around God can turn it around God will do great things you can trust God's gonna bring you up praise God Amen bearing the iniquity of the sanctuary number church that's when Daniel got that Revelation about the 70 weeks he got it after confessing the sins of his fathers and Israel for 21 days he confessed their sins see Barry not that you're guilty but it's of your father's sins or mother's sins but the fact that you're so burned over sins you just want God to forgive sins and you want God's will for your life oh hallelujah what do you want God's will today amen glory then the Bible say Jesus was wounded broad transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities Who Bore our iniquities Christ did the whipping of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are here let's say I'm him we stand together I'm Healed I'm Healed today praise God I'm Healed my wife is healed amen I'm just believing praise God with his stripes we were healed praise God only all we like cheaper going straight we've turned everyone his own way and the Lord had laid on him the iniquity of us all so again Christ like was the anti-type of Aaron oh he had to Bear the iniquity he took care of our sins Church our sins are put away amen oh thank God Amen okay that's a little I want to add on that part now also the Tabernacle represented Jesus's body I don't know if you do this I've heard this is a good thought I forgot about this but I heard it before John 1 verse 1. in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and he would and he was clothed with a Vester dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God so Jesus is the word now I don't you remember this I heard this song Go the word was in verse 14 the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us now the word dwelt means Tabernacle to set up a tent praise God so Jesus the logos created a tent he constructed a tent in the womb of Mary praise God Amen hi area the worm was made flesh and dwell Among Us here's what the actual Greek means to fix one's Tabernacle have one's Tabernacle abide or live in a tabernacle or tent to dwell so the word fix his Tabernacle and dwell Among Us praise God hallelujah I love it it's the only time it's used in the New Testament praise God it was he was made flesh and grown Among Us God set up his beautiful Tabernacle and that was the body of Jesus Christ didn't Jesus say the same he answered and said unto them destroy this temple in three days I'll raise it up then the Jews said 40 and six years was this temple building will thou reared up three days but he spoke of the Temple of his body Hallelujah so we see God wanted to dwell amongst his people and so he built a tabernacle it's totally different this time he didn't have all these men work on it like bezelio and Moses and Aaron this time he had a conceived by the Holy Spirit In the Womb of a virgin amen amen Hallelujah where God constructed that Tabernacle amen God made that sound God made that egg God brought them together praise God God knit together this Tabernacle in Mary's womb God is the author God of this Tabernacle and then God said I'm going to come live in this Tabernacle oh Hallelujah not for a little while not off and on but I'm going to dwell in it praise God continually Oh What a Beautiful story beautiful lesson we get now this is a long chapter and I just feel led like I just want to read it here most of it it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins wherefore when you cometh into the world he says sacrifice and offering now is prepared that I'm sorry that word is not but a body thou has prepared me in birth offering and sacrifices for sin thou Hast had no pleasure now look God would forgive them when they get into animals but it really wasn't God's pleasure okay a body was prepared for True sacrifice Jesus said lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will o God a church if only each one of us could say that today Lord I'd come in today I'm living this life in 2022 not to do my will but to do your will praise God in other words I'm looking in the word of God what is the word of God say for us and Laramie to do for God what does the word of God say for Jesse Smith what is God's will for my life God show me what's written of me in this book and let me do it praise God Amen that's a real Southern dog of God hallelujah I come to do God's will I don't come to do my will and when I don't do God's will quickly let me know of it convict me of it and let me repent of my will and let God's will be done but Jesus never failed we can't be that perfect but we can strive to do that because you're all striving for something right girls striving to what are you striving for well gotta get this I gotta get that I gotta feed them I gotta do this but we should be striving for the will of God Amen Above All Else above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin not what it's not neither has pleasure therein which are offered by the law then he said lo I come to do thy will o God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second he took away the law that even established Grace amen by which will we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ what's for all Hallelujah I'm gonna read that again we are Sanctified through the body of Jesus Christ once for oh praise God it is a one and done work praise God I don't have to go given more sacrifices it was one and finished hallelujah amen the effects of Calvary are still available today all the benefits of the Cross and the resurrection are here today we must be Sanctified and praise God and Jesus will wash us and he'll give us all that we have need on praise God once for all every priest stands daily ministering an offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away but this man after he'd offered one sacrifice for sins for not just for emphasis or Smyrna or pergamos authority or Sardis or laodicea or Philadelphia but forever for learn to see us the same blood has never left his power amen it is not lost his power we have access to the blessings of the blood of the dead because there was one sacrifice once and for all and its blessings last forever then what do you do you sat down on the right hand of God that's when you know you rested you can sit down Hallelujah he defeated death Hallelujah hell Satan every demon and he goes up to heaven gives us blood Hallelujah laces brother on The Mercy Seat and he sits down and said now forever I'm reigning over sins I've forgiven their sins the one and only sacrifice my people are sinners my people are forgiveness praise God Hallelujah God help us to never doubt that our sins are totally done away if we doubt our sins are taken care of then we doubt Hebrews chapter 10. praise God forever once and for all forever my sins are done away with once and for all and forever oh Hallelujah from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foot still so he's waiting all these enemies will be to be put under his feet for by one offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified see this one offering will make you complete forever praise God just let the Holy Spirit sanctify your life amen amen let it sanctify you let it clean you out every single day amen see this one offering perfects forever them who are Sanctified cleaned out and set aside for service praise God wherefore the Holy Ghost is also witnessed to us for after that he had said before this is the Covenant I'll make with them after these days saith the Lord I'll put my laws in their hearts and their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more Church no more God remembers our sins no more man now where remission of these is there's no more offering for sin having therefore brother so how should we react to this the Bible tells us the Bible says Brethren come boldly and enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus we don't have to act like we can't get close to God we don't have to feel like for lesson don't trust your feelings amen amen now if you got the feeling you sin and you say sorry you repent of that but your response to being having once and for all sacrifice God is perfecting your sins forever about it putting him away for giving them your response was should be entered boldly into heaven through the prayers that God places on your heart what's my response to Jesus for giving my sins I should come to him daily to pray [Music] not weekly but boldly the Bible says this is a this is a New and Living Way this is not an old um this is not uh it's not an old way this is a new way praise God the old way was like Adam he's high he sent him he's hiding God's like where are you Adam I'm hiding because I'm naked who told you we're naked who told you not sure that's what we gotta get away from we gotta get away from hiding I mean if we say we got to come to the Bible says enter boys say God forgive me straight to me try me again created me a pain heart amen give me a victory over these uh addictions or victories over these these trials that I'm facing give me Victory I want to come bowling I'm coming a new way praise God and the Bible said he consecrated this way of prayer for us through the veil of his flesh in other words when Jesus's body was ripped and bleeding and torn when his body was torn open [Music] and he died and paid for our sins the Bible said God read the veil from the top to the bottom um showing that now the way is open one sacrifice has forever been accepted in heaven praise God Amen Heaven has accepted it there's no more separation between you and the father you just got to come boldly now praise God before you could come but you couldn't even get to the second round but now because of Jesus we're all Kings in priests we can all Minister spiritually we can all come directly in the prince of God and know that he Delights in our prayers amen oh Hallelujah thank God it's a New and Living Way Church power of the Tabernacle how many believe that by God's grace let's not be afraid to pray praise God let's not forget to pray because this is what we're invited to do now that we know there's one sacrifice forever that's been accepted once and for all amen and forever perfected those who are Sanctified praise God see through the veil his flesh when his flesh was torn God tore the Veil signifying we can come boldly before God's throne having a high priest over the house of God let us draw in here where they what true heart and full Assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast fast the profession of our faith without wavering for his faithful that promises amen see so what what whatever you profess about God keep that profession amen I know God loves me I know Jesus died for me praise God I know the Bible says every promise of God is yea and amen praise God oh don't lose your profession they the wind up on the moon showering you in their strength don't let the devil take your profession away come boldly before the throne of grace keep professing the right things you're drawing nearer to God you'll feel so much closer if you just come before God's presence with the right profession Hallelujah the full Assurance of faith we enter that we enter God's Presence by the blood of Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah God is faithful churches to our needs amen God has not forgotten about you I preached out last Sunday night when you feel like God's forgot you God said no I will do it done I will take care of it I won't forget about you praise God I will do it with all my heart and all my soul praise God Amen let's hope that's that profession of our faith God will do it he's got to trust in God so God rent the mail now let's look at just briefly the representation I don't think I have a hold on on this one but the Tabernacle represents your body as God's Tabernacle right in Exodus 25 verse 90. uh according to all that I show thee after the pattern of this Tabernacle after the pattern now Peter says Before Peter dies he writes this last letter before he died yeah I think at me as long as I am in this Tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance now look Peter says if I preach to you and I remind you the things of God that will stir your Tabernacle of in other words that will bring the glory of God back Hallelujah we don't raise our hands but all of us are probably felt where's the glory of God where's the glory I used to feel where's that original seal I used to have for God where's that excitement I used to have for singing over here in the word of God where's that Glory the Bible says God will serve up by reminding you of his promises Oh I thought Peter said as long as I'm in this Tabernacle I'm going to serve other Tabernacles amen knowing I must shortly put off this my Tabernacle even as the Lord Jesus Christ has showed me he said I'm soon to die all right I went to that funeral this week of my friend who passed away at 64. and I told the family you know what I told him and they were very grateful to hear that the man died he was he died on a Friday night uh last Friday night or two Friday nights ago he was just working out in the shop when he had a massive heart attack and died right there didn't get to say goodbye to anybody but they said uh they said he was such a good man he loved everybody he was Mr Fixit I got to tell him I have to look at his son and his wife in the aisle I got tears rolling down my face and I said the day before he died I got to tell God honors men like you I got I put my arm around him and told him that you've been faithful to your wife you've been loved your children your grandchildren he would pick up his granddaughter at six a.m and take care of her from 6 a.m to noon and they would go do jobs he was a maintenance guy at a uh what do they call him and they have all those trailers but trailer parks he'd fix all the problems of the trailer parks you imagine on this trailer you can fix everything in there you go in there everybody's house and fix it everybody loved it I got to tell the family I said and I said when I drove away I felt like I just told him he was gonna die as I said you have lived a great life you've been faithful you you've trusted in God I don't know how amen church God gives men warning before before they meet before they go home praise God I'm going to say judgment obvious warning before they go home praise God that's one time I know well the other time was my high school coach we knew he was going but this is one time I walked away I'm like I just talked to him like he was going to die he died the next day so may God help us praise God Amen that's why church I always want to talk about Jesus I didn't spend that time we couldn't talk about hunting it's not like hearing hunting stories we could talk about other things but something just came on me God anointed me just to talk about heaven amen and the blessings that God has in store for those who are the children of God thank you so see your body is like a tabernacle now look once Moses finished setting up the whole thing the Bible said a cloud brother a cloud come down of Glory a glory Cloud came down and fill the Tabernacle praise God this is just like a baptism of the Holy Ghost you set up the outside the the outer Court holy Place only some Voice once you set it up God is all everything set in order and it's all the same Goodbye by the blood God's glory comes out and fills the housing oh right so here's the Tabernacle outer core holy Place Holiness then the fire come down just like justification segregation baptism of the Holy Ghost just like a baby being born water blood Breath of Life just like Israel even Egypt Egypt Wilderness Promised Land the Earth notice flood Jesus blood fervent heat Ezekiel new heart new spirit my spirit a weed plant blade ear full corn and Jesus is the way the truth and the glory life amen the glory of God Amen boy I know he slipped down to my soul praise God I lived in the center for 19 years I never had the glory of God but once I repented got Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost God's glory come down and now the greatest pleasure of my life is to enjoy that glory amen to live in that glory to speak about that glory to sing in that glory to weep in that glory to witness in that Glory come pray to that glory amen Hallelujah to live in the glory of God the anointing of God on your life that's right and yet it's so humble Paul had that glory on him and yet he was Shipwrecked three times with five times being with rods three times yet he had the glory on it the church said that's why they don't encourage you last week many are the afflictions of the righteous the Lord will deliver you out of all of them because his glory is on you amen oh thank you Jesus hallelujah praise God that's why Paul and Silas can start singing about the glory in the prison house at midnight that's why church that's why we need to say Lord make us more mature so in our trials we'll sing to you in our darkest in our darkest presence in your darkest mind matters and your darkest places Lord help me to learn to praise in that situation so the glory of God can return praise God to my mind and my body my mind and my body didn't Peter say the same guy that said I got to put up my Tabernacle I want to serve your Tabernacle I want your tent to be all stirred up with God's glory he said having not seen Jesus you love him in whom though you now you see him now you have believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory see the glory comes down praise now the glory of God on our lives amen how does this come it comes after the trials of your faith now we should pray God send it in the middle of the trial praise God right right help me to have that joy in the midst of my trial that's something be let brother amen sing a song that will bring the glory back let brother Jesse preach something that'll bring the glory back and remind me and stir me up of God's blessings on my life foreign [Applause] [Music] like that Pastor said last week you heard him say it he said I just saw Jesse one time I knew he was a Christian it's the glory it's not nothing I did I just had my tie on I remember I was I was on my knee I was shaking all the kids hands and then this big guy this big huge guy like Paul is he'd come up and he's like what's going on and finally I got his son I said nice to meet you jikori what's your name oh I'm Paul I'm a pastor so I'm just just dressed like this shaking hands with little kids and you can still see the glory of God on me Church you might be you might be helping out your child to hide your shoes and God's glory can still be on you man you might be changing a diaper and the glory of God is on you oh yeah the church said trust your mom's gonna say Amen to that Hallelujah you can have God's glory on you at all times that's the purpose of God sending the glory to your Tabernacle would manifest the glory and show everybody that there's a living God there's something different living in that tent thank you Jesus life lives in that time fire listen that's it she's got a fire he's got a fire there's something Supernatural there's a light that shines in that place in the Holy place thank God but at the same time the trial of your faith is more precious than gold that perishes they'll be tried with fire that you and I might be found unto the praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ so all these fiery trials are getting you ready to appear spotless when Jesus Christ returns all these trials are washing your robes right Hallelujah open your overcome Every Lie from Hell praise God every discouragement it's preparing you to appear spotless before the land and so we want to we want to love Jesus so we've never seen him and we want to be full of the glory of God Amen sounds like a good song Restore the me the restore to me the joy of myself it is joy unspeakable I love that song Amen Hallelujah that's what we gotta have praise God the joy of the Lord and the glory of God in our lives now it also represents your approach to God I just want to end with this one here I didn't even set a timer so yeah I'm sorry um Peter again look Peter again talking about the Tabernacle he said your body's a tent your body's intent Peter says you're also Living Stones now we fix your Solomon's Temple It's Made of Stone it's not made of of cloth right it's not made of goat skins It's Made of Stone yeah so it's like getting unto the Millennium right the millennial Temple you are living stones build up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ so you are part of a building you're part you're you're one stone church you and I are one stone

you remember looked at this a while ago on the Colossians series remember that I've only got three sermons I just keep getting all these thoughts I gotta preach I feel like he delivered us he rescued us out of the power of darkness and had friends on us in the Kingdom of his dear son now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin so see sins you rule over sins you rule over the world you rule over your flesh and you rule over the devil and you show forth his praise and glory showing forth himself for his Christ in US willing and doing of his good pleasure yes indeed even now we're seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I know you're getting tired I'm just starting to get sweaty so if you're getting tired I'm gonna I get more awake as the service goes off I'm a servant I'm minister so it's kind of honest I got to be reminded about Destiny don't worry about it don't worry about it I just start getting warmed up feeling good now and he's made us priests yes priests unto him offering the spiritual Praise of Sanctified that's why it's so important to come and sing to God your brothers and sisters that's your duty you were born to do that God loves to hear your voice none of you saying worse than me so don't be afraid but just sing to God Amen sing to God it's a sweet offering unto God Amen when you say when you praise the Lord When you pray it's an offering it goes up to God God receives it that's what he wants you to do you should be doing that all the time God has pleasure in that praise God worshiping him in the spirit and in truth interceding and petitioning for brother Randy for brother Phil Kings and Priests unto our God no wonder the world does not appeal to us and we are all peculiar people it's Alice in the good works amen we've been recreated in him to be children like unto our father oh come on bro just Wednesday night is that extra Taekwondo practice sorry I gotta I gotta meet at the priesthood I gotta meet at the house of God and offer sacrifices to God oh come on you got to work another shift right oh you got it working you gotta miss church oh sorry I'm a priest unto God I know there's times in seasons for their second shift people in here that's why I'm talking to Austin about I'm just saying when you know it's the devil well you know I said that we're trying to steal your metric praise God oh no I'm God's called me this is my time God is give me this time to worship Him intercede for others and petition see brother Bill was real glad he prayed for him because the MRSA left how that happened was you interceded for amen his wife should have kind of calls to church no doubt maybe they pray but how many sinisters do they have in their lives God won't hear their prayers because of the sins that they have so whose prayers did he hear for my prayers I don't know about another church I'm just saying many times there are churches or sins like that in churches all right okay now this verse remember the Bible That's so small I didn't mean to do that but the Bible says may God sanctify you wholly that means every part your spirit your soul your body may it be preserved blameless under the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ okay so just like the old the Old Testament you have a body and the outer Court was like the body that you have okay three parts your human spirit is like the holy place right and then the Soul is like the holiest of holies ever understand that three parts and God wants his glory on every part on every part Just Like That Glory filled the house and the Bible said Moses and Aaron couldn't even minister in them they couldn't go in there because the power of God was on Earth that's what our lives should be like the power of God the glory of God on our lives Hallelujah and sometimes I'll come to church but amen I'll just share this I'll be a little tired Sunday morning and all of a sudden they'll hit it like what somebody hit last week There's a real Snappy upbeat song and I just it just lifted me right up out of my tiredness in other words the glory of God came back amen amen I needed a I needed an upbeat song brother and then God will lead you right to that song and go oh don't worry it brings the glory back praise God wants his glory on your flesh praise God God wants the glory in your minds you're thinking about the things of God I want you watching YouTube videos about God wants you listen to podcasts about God who just passed 500 dominoes by the way we're getting out there to different countries people thank God for that and thank God that there's a good alternative that the glory of God can remain on us praise God Amen he wants the glory in your soul by the grace of God now so that here's here's you you're the New Testament believer here's Israel now do I have any emotions on this okay remember Israel that Waters of Separation you need your first repentance Israel then had blood sacrifice and washing we have justification and water baptism you accept their sacrifice and price if you get baptized in water Israel had light bread incense we have sanctification by knowledge the word and prayer Israel had communion and fellowship with God we get the baptism of the Holy Ghost to say rocket science this is God in simplicity praise God now here for every service church every service this is my this is the lesson the lord gave me on the water separation how many fellowship with God every service amen where God talks to yourself the only way it's going to happen is if you first confess all your sins before every service or say like this even during then so from that point on whenever you confess it now you're going to get something out of the service George the reason people don't get anything out of church is because they fail to come the way the Bible says come they have sins that they they've hurt people they haven't repented of it they've done all kinds of evil things in their homes they haven't repented of it and they come to church and church we I preach about the blood of Jesus and baptism and don't move anybody or don't move those people that are in sin removes you if you're a believer you think about Jesus as the cross his love ran red are you watching the blood of the Lamb have you come to Jesus for the cleansing power it moves you because you confess all your sins and now this this worship means something the cross means something because you're sprinkled from an evil conscience amen no Hallelujah you haven't been touching dead things or you asked God and God forgave you of touching dead things amen we all do a church we all come on church I share a few days we all touch dead things we all say dead things we all do good things we don't think nothing but we must confess everything if the cross and the sacrifice and the Waters of washing are going to move us amen into the praise of God Hallelujah I know it does because remember when I preached on son of Manson of God said David I know it does because that lie went out from message churches saying we're we all have the son of man anointing that lie went out about nine years ago brother I never agreed with that but what I do I pray I call the presence of God and I'm coming to church and I get fellowship with the Lord and the Lord gives me verses that proves that God is speaking to my soul in other words God is giving me thus save the Lord when I come to church and he's speaking to me and I know they'll say the word we are not the Bible said are all Prophets do all speak with tongues you are all workers of Miracles see what I'm saying when we come the right way God will speak to us off the Throne of our soul and it'll give us truth it'll give us not save the Lord God communion with us and we just approach God to the Rivalry praise God that's just one example think about all these Joseph random false doctrines these message preachers they're the grace of all time see each time God gave us the word on that it was thus saith the Lord Scott was speaking to my soul and now I know I'm not a prophet I don't have Elijah's anointing on me but I got Jesus anointing on me [Applause] and the spirit of Jesus will produce the life of Jesus Amen sure see what I'm saying what if I would have came to church with an attitude against brother amen or Andrew against Jose or attitude against Lydia see I would not this would have meant nothing to me and ought to preach something false to kind of get at Lydia I'm going to try to get at nature or try to get a Victoria character I gotta Vendetta against him and then I never would have heard the voice of God in here I never heard because I didn't come God to provide a way that's why at the Baptist Church last week that's why I'm preaching about repentance nobody can even get here that's right not even one person not one person wanted to but he's battling Suicidal Thoughts to see he hasn't confessed all these so you can't even get here I invite all those people to come and prepare they don't come up why something's hindering them they haven't dealt with all the dead things in their lives does that help everybody I know it's repeat for our local church y'all preached in 2017. Austin and Lena to see that this is why the cross means nothing to people that's why that's why the Mysteries and the bread and prayer means nothing to people because they got sin out here God won't even let them in until they confess their sins [Music] then I'll I'll study and pray I'll pray I'll study for hours brother I'll pray and people don't even get some people get nothing out of it why because they're not even they're not even in here how are they going to hear the voice of God but thus save the word whether they're not even in here how are they gonna they're not going to do it that's why Church always confess all your sins come in the friends of God [Music] the Bible says get your mind right pray sing worship Hallelujah feel the prince of God become a part of this service Hallelujah so when the word of God speaks you know God is speaking you with thus saith the Lord that's God's communion with you let me see where I'm at uh okay it's one of 12 10 11 12. okay stop reach our half let's let's bite the musicians I'll never stop there okay I'll say the next one for next time musicians can come back downstairs let's say to our feet I got it looks like just a few slides without taking another hour so I better stop right here let's stand if we can here the Tabernacle of Moses how many can see your life in the Tabernacle Moses you're chosen by God Church God set up
