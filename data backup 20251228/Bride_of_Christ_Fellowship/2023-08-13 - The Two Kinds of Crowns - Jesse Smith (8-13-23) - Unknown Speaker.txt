========================================

chapter 1 to verse 12 this will be the first Crown called the endures Crown the one who can endure James 1 verse 12 of course this is most of our crowns here in laodicea East in America this will be the crown that we're striving for by the grace of God James 1 to verse 12. let's read that if we can verse 12. let's read that on three ready one two three blessed is the man that endureth Temptation for when he has tried he shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord hath promised to them that love him praise God the endures Crown let's read about the next Crown Revelation 2 10 the martyrs crown Revelation 2 12. sorry 210 right Revelation 2 10 pardon me let's read that on three one two three fear none of those things which Thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried and ye shall have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life amen may God as blessings to the Ring of his work and maybe seated praise God so I have a few slides to show here by God's grace and I have some scriptures here as we said just one service today I imagine you know we're kind of exhausted a little bit from yesterday and again we appreciate all the efforts and especially to the mothers and anyone who cooked and bought food and thank you so much for feeding all those people praise God it was kind of a surprise we had so much left over but God knows all things and I was extremely nervous but God worked it out it's been a long time since we had a wedding so we're thankful that we got through it by God's grace I was telling I think we talked yesterday it seemed like it would never get here and then it just went so fast where was it it just kind of but we thank the Lord for his grace and mercy so this thought you know I just was kind of inspired I wanted to get to this on Wednesday I didn't get to it Wednesday we looked at uh that thought were not all giant Killers but we are all Overcomers we looked at part two and uh focused on the lives of King Saul who could have been a giant killer but but failed because of fear and then John the Baptist who was not a physical giant killer but Jesus called him the greatest a believer of the Old Testament Hallelujah and we looked at the attributes of John the Baptist he was such a faithful man a diligent man he fulfilled so many scriptures I couldn't even get to all the scriptures uh but brother Graham said God loved that Spirit of Elijah because it was so obedient to the word of God and God loves the spirit that's on the bride it's the Holy Spirit praise God because she lets herself be washed in the waters of his word hallelujah amen so my inspiration though to get to this thought was this picture my wife bought me the Clarence Larkin book I think last year and um this is a page he has the Judgment of reward so the Bible said all of us will stand before the Judgment right but for us it's a judgment to reward not a judgment to whether you're saved or lost or that's at the white Throne judgment but our judgment comes sometime around the marriage supper of the Lamb during the tribulation period when the bride has been caught up into Glory praise God and so I don't know what point I don't know if it's imagine it's after the presentation of the Bride you know uh Paul said I'll present you as a Chase virgin so each Church H Messenger will will present The Believer from each age Hallelujah will be standing there with brother Branham hallelujah amen amen uh we'll be standing there being presented as the bride to Christ but and brother Brown says at some point you know we'll sit down and we'll sit on a long table and we'll all we'll sit with the ones we labored with praise God hallelujah amen they said Jesus will come around and serve us communion Hallelujah just like uh Melchizedek came and served communion to Abraham after the battle was over Hallelujah so I don't know if rewards will be given out beforehand or after but we can expect rewards and as I said on you know Wednesday you know we're not laboring for the rewards we're laboring for Christ amen amen and if and if you know I said this kind of in passing but if you have a competitive Spirit we'll make that com competition against the devil or make it against your flesh praise God but we're not competing against one another we're not trying to be greater than a previous Church age or greater than that person or that person what we are in a contest praise God right we are in a race we are in a competition the Bible says run the race as if you'd be the only one who'd win praise God yes if there's only going to be so many saved out of a city you be one of those praise God make your calling an election sure the Bible says hallelujah approach your salvation with fear and trembling now we know most churches don't do that most churches when they come to church they don't tremble at the word of God right they don't tremble during the song service they don't tremble a prayer but the Bible tells us there's times that we have uh fear and trembling in the presence of God hallelujah and God hasten the day that we have some more of those by God's grace hallelujah amen your life can sometimes get so easy or or we can uh get so distracted with the carers of the world the Bible says that Jesus said the cares of Life many times distract people from having good and honest hearts right they don't uh weed out all the cares of the world as Jesus said in Matthew chapter 13. so we have to make sure that we constantly uh rededicate Our Lives to the Lord hallelujah and then we approach salvation with fear and trembling Hallelujah that's why many times I like to lay at the altar you can break your seat before service or after service but we need a time where we feel absolutely sincere with Christ amen where it's not a game we're not playing church but this is eternal life we're talking about praise God and we got one shot at eternal life Hallelujah we've only got one opportunity to live praise God and so this picture when I just saw I was instantly inspired I thought wow I need to preach on this um I don't know how Larkin taught this I don't know if he taught there were Five Crowns I don't think so one two three four five I don't know if he taught that uh this doesn't say Five Crowns he just says this is Judgment of Believers for their Works remember all these works are based on your appreciation Hallelujah yes or if you want to make a competition against the enemy or you know like Paul said I'm fighting but I'm not beating the air but I'm actually I have an enemy and I'm trying to hit the target praise God hallelujah taking down the kingdom of darkness the Bible says but here we see uh this course will be at the Judgment seat of Christ and that's talked about were you familiar with these scriptures I just thought it was a really inspired uh picture here you know the Bible says in First Corinthians 3 that the fire of this day so there's some type of fire here at the Judgment seat of Christ um and also the great white Throne judgment because the Bible said the fire will determine what type of works we had I would say our God is a consuming fire hallelujah amen so at the Throne of God will be a fire Hallelujah and it will prove what our works were were they motivated by sincerity or selfishness right now the Bible does say like lot uh that you can have salvation like King Saul you can be saved but lose your reward that's what we don't want to have but yet we will rejoice yet we will rejoice in those who are saved even if they have no reward because they've had eternal life right they're not they're not being tormented uh they're not being uh annihilated for a year however many years it would be we would Rejoice that they were saved praise God amen we'd be sad and they didn't have uh some type of reward the Bible said Jesus will wipe away tears from our eyes so there will be some emotion there will be some reason to cry uh even Beyond this realm there will be some reason but we will rejoice in any person being saved but imagine if you don't want a person to be saved something's wrong with you you got to come back to this altar all right if you wish to see anybody tormented in fire or or or Tormentor at all he said you've got to get back to Calvary praise God yes but we see I like this picture you know the Bible says you know we'll either be vessels of gold or silver but the vessels of wood and hay will all be burned up so this is like the this is like uh we'd say that the kingdom of Saul it was all burned up because remember he did he he won a lot of battles remember we looked on Wednesday on that he beat the the uh the malachites I mean Philistines he had all these victories but he'll lose all the reward because of what he did to David and what he did to the priests right he'll lose his reward the Bible said he could have had the kingdom forever but he didn't keep the kingdom with an honest heart God help us to keep the kingdom with an oddest heart and uh and not uh not go after our brother or sister but let's build them up praise God yes that's what King Saul did right he went after his precious son-in-law he was trying to kill his influence and hurt him you know and kill him uh but by God's grace at the end God brought him back Hallelujah I like how some of these uh pictures here you know they listen Jasper's artist stones and all these precious stones in other words uh the reward that you earn here and all the all the good works we did with good intentions those will be preserved aren't you glad hallelujah amen aren't you glad Jesus will remember every time you tried to do something for his name Hallelujah each and every work when it was a good work a selfless work it was an act to glorify God he'll remember it remember the Bible said about corneas the angels of God had seen his memorial stored up in heaven Hallelujah so the Angels would be able to walk by this vial or this bull and then maybe it said maybe it was a bold it said Cornelius on the side and he said there's a memorial for you in the presence of God amen amen Church there's a memorial for you in the presence of God God sees your prayers God sees your fasting God sees your owns God sees your ties and offerings God sees all that and he's keeping track of it praise God Amen Hallelujah so I I don't think he's you know Larkin's saying there's Five Crowns but there's at least five scriptures about them so we'll go through these of course I I just love his pictures I love how he's a I'm a visual person uh the Rapture right Christ meeting the church at the air go some somehow connected to Heaven here judgment for the Believers and the marriage of the lamb and then uh go down for the Revelation okay I'm not sure what that's referring to but of course we don't agree with Larkin on everything he wasn't a prophet like our Prophet brother Branham but I just was inspired by this and I thought I'd like to preach on this one time and I didn't get to say so um preach on it today of course this is the most deceptive day brother random said uh the samuran church age um was uh the the most darkest age uh the age of the Dark Ages because very few people had Bibles and it was the age where uh they'd had Jezebel religion brother said they were Christians were almost snuffed out but God brought a light out of Darkness called Martin Luther praise God hallelujah so that was the darkest age but we live in the most deceptive age and that's what the Bible says the Bible says deception will wax worse and worse so I'll tell you the church and there's ever time we need fear and trembling it's right now praise God because most people will be deceived in the thinking they're saved when they're not saved right amen the Bible say yeah all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution we've been through this in numerous times I'm just going to say it remember brother said his worst persecution was the last three years of his life out in Arizona because he's been rejected by all the preachers out here in this desert like I've never suffered in my life rejection no limitations no one no one wanting to hear the word of God he said that was his greatest persecution the most he'd suffered in his life so church when you and I are are are uh when when we're rejected by friends or that's probably our level of persecution at least for now right we all look forward to the squeeze I'm certainly look forward to it well we all know this please is coming praise God we don't look forward to it our flesh certainly does not we look forward to the Rapture praise God but no one looks really forward to suffering but the point I'm trying to make uh is that as far as now in in laodicea our greatest persecution will be uh from those that have rejected us because of the stand we take but the Bible said evil men and seducers should wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived Church we've got to realize that we've got to look at every preacher not as just maybe a servant of God but we got to realize most of them are seducers right we can all name them right Joel Osteen TD Jakes right Benny Hinn we can all name those that are seducing people into false Doctrine right but we got to remember that these are there's many more seducers most preachers are seducers right right they're trying to seduce you to give them money right uh some even more wicked things than that right it's a type of sexual sins and all kinds of power and uh of course satanic Powers they're trying to get over people influence and all these things but that's that's the uh the prophecy of this day it's only going to get worse so that's why I have to search my heart every preacher has to search their heart and make sure they're doing this for the right reasons I'm trying to give you sheet food as brother Brandon said I'm trying to point you to the Bible praise God I'm trying to help you make your calling election sure I want to be in heaven right with you praise God amen amen and I know I'll be judged more strictly than you will be as a preacher that's why that's why I try to live a pretty strict life Hallelujah if I know I'm going to be judged more harshly than I want to live I want to be very careful about the decisions I make right the things I say I want to be real slow before I make decisions unless I absolutely know uh the the word of God the will of God so we know we're living in a very deceptive age I love this quote for other random it always comes to my mind when I think about this he preached Satan's Eden that was his last sermon preached at Branham Tabernacle and remember church in the morning service he let brother Neville preach and he said I felt led of the Lord to let brother Neville preach why didn't he tell brother Neville press play that's my one time to inject that in there okay sir so think about the last time he was a robin Tabernacle he let the five full ministry preach first right he said I'll take the evening service look at that humility right right and bro remember there's closer brother Brown saying he says whatever he said I'm not the pastor now other quotes say he is the pastor but there's quotes from brother Brandon from 1957 the Hebrew series he says brother Neville is the pastor here he said I only own the property he said whatever brother never wants to preach that's between you and him so see look at brother bear as a prophet he could not assert authority over the local pastor right but yeah and then the pastor couldn't serve authority over the prophet and tell him what to do right so each one has their position has their place right my brother I'm talking about the Antichrist system here he's quoting II Thessalonians chapter 2 the Son of Perdition the Antichrist he says the devil then people worshiping Satan in this day thinking they're worshiping God but they're worshiping him through a Creed a man-made denominations and Creeds that's brought the people right down to the greatest deception the world has ever known of no matter how much the word of God promised for this day is preached and Vindicated they still won't believe it they won't believe it thank God we believe it yes yes amen thank God but we got to remember we're on the side where everybody's gonna think you guys are insane you guys are uh racist you guys are homophobic we have to remember that the side we're going to be on right and we're none of those things I'll say this we're full of love hallelujah we're the only ones that are full of love amen amen the real kind of love the love of Christ and church we know the majority of people that go to church are deceived and likely lost but brother Brown says he said it but if I went all my day thinking about that and burdened for them he said I'd go crazy I'll Define that quote for you you know if you put all that burden on you to save each and every one of them when you but we know very few of them will be saved yeah yeah but if you focus on just that all the time he said he would go insane right just like you said with the the children from India remember we went to India and she tried to sell all uh I'm sorry he took all the cash and he'd go buy candy and he gave out all the candy to all the little starving uh little Indian children and he said his heart would just bleed he'd come back home he's like how can I he actually blasted the Americans how can these Americans throw this food away in the trash when there's children Starving in India he blasted Americans right for just throwing food away so we got to be careful praise God yeah right we got to be diligent now of course we can't send our food over to India right our spare food but we can say love offerings over there right when we know Believers I don't know any believers in India but if we ever do we could do that but it's just it's this great hour of deception that we're living in and we've got to be uh ready you know we we can't we can't put all the burden on ourselves right God in other words God will bring us the opportunities that he wants us to uh to fulfill God will help us feed the poor God will help us uh do whatever he's called us to do bring those opportunities to us and we will recognize it praise God why because we can't be deceived right the elect cannot be deceived but this is the greatest deception the world has ever known is right now so how do we how do we discern deception you've got to have the truth praise God Amen how do you discern a counterfeit dollar study the real dollar s so what does that mean for us study the word of God hallelujah amen stay in the word of God absolutely now I found this quote this morning I forgot of course I preached this whole I preached the whole churches but I forgot about this quote but Iran said what is a crowd he said it's it means that you have a domain Hallelujah you are a king if you're crowned and we are sons of God when we're crowned with eternal life how many have it praise God amen amen have eternal life already Jesus says amen we've already passed from Death on life Hallelujah he says make your he said make you priests and Kings unto God is that right so there you are so we have a spiritual domain we've got to rule over right now in our lives think about that think about how many people come to message churches and they lose their domain they stop ruling over their spiritual lives they let something take away their Church time they rob them of their prayer time unless something Rob them of their Joy Rob them of their peace amen they don't handle their Dominion like they're supposed to praise God oh man brother said set up garrisons in your in your spiritual life he said those are garrisons of prayer amen outposts and Lookouts for the enemy that's how you look out for the enemy you stay in prayer Hallelujah So when you say in prayer you stand to the anointing and then you can spot the enemy when he's coming praise God Hallelujah so church if we have eternal life now brother man said we're already crowned which I take as an anointing you're Anointed with eternal life I don't know I can't prove it by the Bible but if m is born again I I I don't know in herself I'd see a little Crown like hanging there maybe floating there and or so I don't know I I think the crown means it's the anointing of the Holy he goes it's the seed of God that we're sealed with unto the day of our Redemption praise God but we know later there is a visit or I would say a physical spiritual Crown coming praise God with a glorified body and we'll get a glorified Crown praise God amen now there's two kinds of crowns brother tells us this in chapter four the Sumerian Church age he's quoting uh Revelation two and I'll give you a cry to life it says not even a cup of water think of that not even a cup of water Given In The Name Of The Lord fails to receive a reward I know brother amen bought some drinks yesterday he did it in the name of the Lord right all those drinks I give you this in the name of the Lord how great shall be the reward to him who gives his life as a martyr for the name of the Lord Jesus you can either keep living a few more years or decades or you can die for the name of Jesus Christ which one would you do deny Christ and live a few more decades or keep Christ and lose your life now of course the believer knows if I lose this life I gain another praise God Amen I'm getting eternal life amen he said perhaps we can get a small idea if we compare this crowd with the crown one in a race Paul says know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain so here we got the competitive idea we're running a race praise God and we're trying to obtain a crown we want to win glory amen we don't want to lose we want to win Hallelujah amen we're not losers right we're winners hallelujah praise God we're all they're young man we're not going to quit we're not going to give up we're not gonna let somebody else win the race we're gonna win the race praise God amen brother man breaks into the Olympic history a crown given to the Winter Olympic race was a Garland of olive branches but the crown spoken of in Revelation given to a martyr is the crown of royalty see you're a part of God's royal family amen Jesus calls it the Crown of Life the one Crown is for those who have striven right that's our Crown by God's grace at least now we're striving for the crown praise God the other is for those who have given both crowns are Incorruptible they will not perish hallelujah amen the winners of the worldly race of life will soon lose the joy of the planets of the world their Glory will fail but those who give their life for God either by daily striving or shedding their blood as the crowning sacrifice of their lives will be given the Crown of Life praise God you remember when Johnny's family were coming I brought my gold medals in from when I was a state champion you know I do with those I went and hung them up in my garage a couple years ago well guess what they look like now they're all rusted and worn out and I thought what a great reminder you say brother Jesse you'd put your state champion medals and just let them rushed out well eventually they're going to rust out anyway I mean yeah you want me to put them in my casket with me if I go to the Grave make sure you put all those uh Metals around me Lydia before I go to the Grave what good is it gonna do me it's a great reminder that all Earthly crowns fed life will never fade hallelujah amen and there's a greater race we're fighting for praise God nobody calls me up and says are you the state champion from 1997 is that you I walk through the store oh are you the one that did that no nobody cares nobody cares it all fades right but when we get to heaven thank God Amen we'll be shaking one another's hand and hug you another saying God bless you my precious brother like they told over him if you would not have it I would not be here praise God Amen let's do something to get somebody saved hallelujah amen they run up and say my precious brother Hallelujah I don't recognize you and the voice said that's the woman you baptized when she was 95. and now she looks like she's 21. Hallelujah so there's tons of crowns you you and I are going for the he endures crown we've got to endure the trials of life very few now people have asked me this question what about um you know a year ago there was those uh I forget the name of it um the Muslims were cutting off Christian's head you remember that a few years ago it was on YouTube and everything all over there and people ask me like they're not message Believers will they go on the Rapture I don't know which Resurrection they'll come up in but I know they've got a Martyrs crown I'll tell you that's real faith to die for your sins I'm sorry to die for for believing in Christ and they know it's going public and they know they can get out of it they just deny Christ and even if they didn't know the message they knew Christ amen right they might not know about water baptism or or the godhead or anything like that but they knew Jesus Christ was the Savior praise God and think about that church that was enough faith that they could give their life for Jesus Oh My how much faith we should have having the Revelation that we have by the grace of God amen amen how much we should be able to endure because of what we know praise God right you should be able to help us right whatever our next battle is whatever whatever our next struggle is it should be able to help us and encourage us I'm I'm a Child of God I'm a message believer praise God God is uh we're a part of the restored bride of Jesus Christ I can get through this because he chose me to be his bride amen amen amen I can endure this trial Hallelujah because he endured the cross for me praise God and I'll say like this if foolish virgins can give their natural lives what could bribe you what could wise virgins do by God's grace they can endure praise God you can endure whether you have cancer whether you have Alzheimer's or whether you uh you get in a car accident whatever happens we should be able to endure because we've got the same life hallelujah amen eternal life there's two kinds of crowns the program tells us now there could be more like I said now let's look at the martyrs crowd so when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was was shed I also this is Paul of course talking with standing by and consenting unto his death and kept the arraignment of them that slew him now what's striking to me is that the name Stephen means crowned Hallelujah so the one whose name Crown was going to be crowned with the martyrs Crown the first one to be crowned with the martyrs crown it's so fitting right in other words God chose that name for a purpose praise God yes he would be the first one crowned with the martyrs Crown in the New Testament right we know there's Old Testament Martyrs as well but he was the first one the first martyr remember the scripture says of Antipas now brother says we have no history on him but we have the history that Jesus gave us hallelujah and the fact was he was a Believer where Satan's seat was I believe it's pergamos if I'm not mistaken he said I know that works and where thou dwells and even where Satan's seed is and thou hold his fast my name and has not denied my my faith rather even in those days where an antipast my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth look at that now that's really something even and we'd say like an Earthly head course for Satan God has to have Believers there right right now you want to talk about people with a lot of faith how about the saints that live in New York New York City I'm talking about like brother Ivan Karen in the family right they I've gone there three times I don't really want to go back just the street conditions and the traffic and you know all the things that happened in New York the violence and all kinds of things like that but it takes a person of special Faith to live in that type of environment praise God right like it takes a certain faith for us to be in this protective place right and we've got to overcome lukewarmness right whereas they in New York City they might have to battle more persecution like outward persecution right and we yeah and then you know with all the you know the adult stores all around and just you know it's everywhere right all sin temptation is everywhere they're in New York City down there in the Bronx but look here Antipas was just one of those Believers but Jesus had chosen activists to be a martyr like what the Bible calls him he said that's my faithful martyr praise God oh my God we can obey God's word he'll call us faithful Hallelujah Jesus calls us faith faithful praise God in other words we're faithful to God's will for our lives amen amethyst is a calling of Christ was to be a faithful martyr so as far as we know you haven't you're not having been called to be faithful Martyrs we've been called to be faithful endures right amen can I be faithful and endure this the trials of life that come The Temptations of life that come can I Faithfully endure them and glorify Christ Hallelujah but look he was right in the midst of we'd say Jezebel religion my brother Satan's eating for that day he was right there but he was faithful unto it and notice Jesus said I know you're worse I know what you're going through I know what it's like to be a martyr right Jesus right God's the god martyr we'd say he was the god Prophet is God martyr right of course God is Spirit can't pull can't die in a spirit form he died the flesh form Hallelujah but here this these are men that received the martyrs crown and they have a great reward now here's I I showed something similar to this a while back when brother William was here that's all I remember about that service I know it was on a Wednesday night but here's how all the died James the Greater was he's the one who wrote the book of James James the Lesser stoned to death that was his his lot in life Saint Jude was filled with arrows like you see I mean in the world I seen movies like that they just filled him and he stood he said true to Christ Phillip was crucified by soldiers Thomas was thrust with the spirit that's why I don't like when people make fun of Thomas and call him doubting Thomas remember he's the one that traveled the furthest to take the gospel he was the missionary that traveled more miles than anybody else how many miles of these people these preachers traveled by foot that make fun of Thomas today he only died it because that was his calling in life and each one of us doubt who doesn't doubt right right you could call me doubting Jesse but now I'm believing Jesse each one of us doubted at some point yeah yeah it's God real is God can hear my prayers God gonna forgive me this is God Really Gonna Save Me we all doubt Saint Paul was beheaded in Rome Saint Peter was crucified upside down Saint John was the only one who died a natural death the Beloved Matthew was stabbed with a sword Judas is Garrett courses traitor committed suicide St Simon crucified Bartholomew Flay and beheaded I'm not going to tell the details on that Andrew was crucified on an x-shaped cross and Matthias was crucified in Judea some people think Matthias didn't do anything well he lived such a Godly life they crucified he was so close to the Holy Spirit now think about all these men and then put Antipas in there Stephen they got a special crime the martyrs crowd Hallelujah Church did they earn it how'd they earn it by being faithful reminds me of the three three Hebrew children right right all as we know is that we're not going to bow to Satan's Eden miracle coming or not all I know is I cannot bow to the things of this world just got to stand and if God's going to deliver me praise God but if not I'll I'll promise as I'm done to deliver me my angels into his holy presence amen I'm delivered one way or the other Hallelujah what faith these men had and they get a special crown Hallelujah let's look at those attributes that Larkin talked about I mean that's just some notes I had first of all the crown is called the Crown of Glory now verse 3 speaking of preachers neither as being Lords over God's Heritage but being and samples to the flock preacher doesn't boss you around tell you what to do uh not do any work himself he's the example to the flock that's why I like when sister Beatrice lets me sweep out there by God's grace I want to be an example right I want people to follow my example serve others praise God and I I need you to do a better job by God's grace I will by the help of the Lord and when the chief Shepherd Christ shall appear he shall receive a Crown of Glory that fate is not away amen hallelujah so if as ministers we're examples to the people Jesus has a Crown of Glory he'll give to us but notice he says it's beautiful scripture I couldn't leave this one out likewise he younger submit yourselves unto the Elder yeah all of you be subject ones and I look all of you includes me right there's times I have to submit times I wanna go along with the Saints and be clothed with humility for God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble and we know Pride goes before the fall yeah right hallelujah how the Mighty Fall River on Wednesday night right how the Mighty Fall David sang now under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit Jonathan of course he was very faithful Saul not so much but he was still Mighty when he was obedient to the word of God how the Mighty Fall why why it's all fall because of pride Samuel said when you were little on your sight you were victorious when you become great in your sight you became prideful and that's when you fell so we see it's a Crown of Glory now the word Glory I didn't I thought I had the definition in their Glory oh yeah sorry it's way down there all right so I'll go back up there what does glory mean it means a crown of Splendor or brightness magnificence a crown of Excellence a crown of dignity I like I like all these words a crowd of majesty kingly Majesty now let's get past some of these in other words it's a crown of the most glorious condition you could be in the most exalted State you could possibly be in the condition of the blessedness into which is appointed and promised that true Christians shall enter after their saviors return from Heaven praise God in other words the highest state of existence is what the Crown of Glory is hallelujah we think we're having a good time now wait till we get our crowns Hallelujah it's a Crown of Glory Hallelujah like I heard a preacher say you if you thought I danced a lot now wait till I get to heaven praise God the half has not been told Hallelujah if you shouted or screamed or praise God the half hasn't been told and what we're gonna enjoy over there it's an even higher state of blessedness Amen a higher state of Glory a higher state of enjoyment praise God this is what we read frog text here blessed is the man that endured Temptation Now isn't it strange the devil makes us feel like we're cursed when we're being tested but the Bible said blessed blessed and who goes through temptation we all feel it right we all we're so blessed right now because your faith is being perfected you're being tried in other words I'm proven to the devil like a joke I'm proven to the devil what you're really made of Hallelujah you're really made of Faith Hallelujah you shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord has promised to them that love of how many love God today amen well that you have about faith the Lord that if I love him he's promised me a crowd of life he's going to put he's going to put a crowd on your head and it's a crown of Dominion right for the millennium and also for the future home and then who knows what's after that right or what I'm sorry who knows what that entails all eternity but it's a absolute promise if you can just make it through if you can just persevere if you can just get through the season that you're going through Jesus promise if you love me I'll give you a Crown of Life hallelujah amen the third attribute is called a crown of righteousness now remember righteousness is simply just doing what's right having moral character integrity doing what's right Paul says I fought a good fight I finished my course I kept the faith that's the scripture I read in my track coach hours before he died I didn't know he's gonna die I knew he was close I just opened up my Bible and that's what I read to him he read the Bible 25 times as a Catholic man we all have a fight that we must win praise God we have a course we got to keep running praise God we have a faith we have to keep and henceforth so afterwards if you can finish the fight again if you can finish the course if you can keep the faith Jesus has a crown of righteousness laid up for you which the righteous judge shall give me at that day what the day of Rewards right because we know we all know Revelation 5 where the 24 Elders they cast their crowns so see they've already got their crowns he said and not to me only Hallelujah I love that I love that part right there amen not to me holy but unto all a Double L praise God all of them also that love is appearing praise God we're all looking forward to Jesus we're all looking forward to seeing his holy face praise God Hallelujah and because of that the Bible said he has a crown of righteousness waiting for you amen so it's glory it's life it's righteousness this is the crown that he puts on us praise God think about that I'll never sin again you'll never sin again amen because you your crowned with righteousness you have a Dominion of righteousness and then also the Bible calls it now this this is a little slightly uh different here for what is Our Hope or Joy or crown of Rejoice what is our crown of rejoicing he says are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming for ye are our glory and joy so he's speaking to the Thessalonians uh Thessalonians right that's Thessalonians Paul says these believers they they crown of rejoicing so again I don't know if this is a physical crown or just like we said anointing on the person but one reason we will have rejoicing is because of the lives that we've impacted praise God because of the lives that we touch amen God help us to touch lives amen amen amen God help us to pray and say God which life you want me to touch this week praise God who could I be a blessing to this week who can I encourage on their walk with the Lord like I told you last week I had a man email me and said I was just ready to leave the message until I then God directed me to your YouTube and podcast channels and he said no I'm staying in the message I said well that's what I was called to do amen that's what we were called to do right we're called to strengthen people's Faith Hallelujah the Bible says strengthen those things that remain hallelujah amen amen praise God whatever you have left strengthen it praise God make yourself stronger encourage yourself in the Lord don't get weak or get stronger praise God Amen why would you get weaker when there's so many blessings in the word of God hallelujah we got over 1100 sermons from Brother Randy got my sermons you got other preacher sermons why would we get weaker we should get stronger praise God oh my he's got a he's got a crown of rejoicing for us that is coming praise God and also I think this is the fifth and final description I don't think I don't think there are separate crowds I think they're just descriptions of the same crowns either one the the one for striving and the one for giving your life know you not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain that's why we've seen that song now sometimes we laugh at it but I'm running for my life every day I'm running for my life so sometimes we feel like we're just bowing the enemy all the time right so we gotta we gotta run for our lives I'm running the race to be the winner praise God not running the race to lose I'm not running for second place we should be running for first place Hallelujah so run that ye may obtain the prize and every man that is striving for the mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible Crown but we an Incorruptible crown that's where I go back to that story of James Browning he said I ate too much fast food uh he said that kept me from uh preaching as much as I like so that's one example be temperate put good things into the body God gave you right amen strive for the Mastery and thank God you know you he's corrected at the end like he said but we're all guilty of that I was guilty of going to Too Much fast food right so he says strive for Mastery have self-control in other words let the Holy Spirit have control over your temple praise God Amen let him control what comes in into your temple praise God because we're trying to win a crown hallelujah we're trying uh to win the prize amen we're trying to to please Christ we're trying to uh to hear him say Well done good and faithful Runner praise God amen you endure the Temptation you endured the trials of life so come in and receive your reward come in and receive your crowd hallelujah amen oh it's beautiful so according to Larkin I just thought putting these together just makes it look really good it's a Crown of Glory a Crown of Life a crown of righteousness when you win souls and encourage Souls it's a crown of rejoicing praise God Amen and it's an Incorruptible Crown amen think about that church whatever good God has you do here whatever you put into the kingdom of God it will never be forgotten nobody can take nobody can ever take that away I remember then when we were state champions a couple times they said you're a champion and nobody can ever take that away from you well that's true but then next year there's another champion you're not always the champion right yeah you're just Champion that one time but when you're a Christian there you go when you're a Christian you you're a Believer you're a conqueror for all eternity praise God Amen you overcame every Temptation every devil that trapping scenario that the enemy set for you every Thorn and every care of this world you overcame all that and you're you're an overcomer for all time praise God remember as the Holy Ghost build Saint you're given a place of prominence the Bible says you're not being judged you're sitting with him in the Judgment praise God you're a part of the Judgment team I'll say it like that you get to be part of the Judgment team that's for the Overcomer who's filled with the Holy Ghost praise God now I want to rehearse this there's a section on this in my book it's the uh the parable of the pounds I'm gonna turn there Luke I think it's 19 if I'm not mistaken I didn't write the chapter down I forgot about that yeah there it is praise God Luke 1911 uh verse 11 through 27. yes it says then he said therefore a certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return and he called his ten servants and delivered them 10 pounds and sent them to them occupy till I come Hallelujah so each servant got the same amount of money right now that's different from the parable the talents they got different amounts and so there's different applications right so in this one though we're all given the same opportunity it's not the same I'm sorry that's different than like preachers preachers preachers will have you know certain levels to get five talents two talents one Talent you know uh some brother you know even with any sister your your gift of Miracles might be a five Talent gift a miracle but somebody's got a one-tailed miracle right and that's true but in this Parable this is speaking of everybody has the same opportunities right to serve God Amen and remember some of them uh some of these servants hated Christ right that would have been the Jews they didn't use their talents and some of them didn't invest because they feared uh Christ they thought he wasn't a a fair person they thought Christ reached where he didn't sow and Jesus has your own mouth will judge you anyone that speaks against Christ their own words will judge them right somebody emailed me about that said well Jesse what about every Idol word you're coming to account for I said well that's true for some people that's I don't think that's true for the bride of Christ why because there's no condemnations then they're in Christ Jesus yes Amen in other words Every Idle Word you spoke you asked God to forgive you of it right is that right I said I think that that warning for Idle Words I think that's for the Sinners yeah because the blood of Christ takes everything away if not then it wasn't big enough oh it wasn't great enough but the blood of Christ is great enough hallelujah amen Hallelujah takes away every Idol or think of the idle words we speak now God be merciful to us right the complaining we do whatever whatever whatever Idle Words we speak the blood of Christ forgives all that that's why I told the brother I said I don't think that applies to me so you might be different with me you might call me a heretic that's what I believe I mean what the Bible says praise God I believe that but I also believe the Bible says there's no condemnation praise God nobody can lay any charge to our account Hallelujah it's God that justifies if God's for me who can be against me praise God anyways so we see with this this Parable everyone has the same amount of opportunity Jesus said in verse 26 for I say unto you that unto every one which hath shall be given and from him that has not even that he has shall be taken away from him all right now program says this and Simon read this that's why this sermon was all my thoughts since I heard Simon preach it and I wanted to preach a full sermon on it so I hope it's okay brother Adam says in chapter 4 all too little time is spent on laboring for the Eternal rewards of God the recompense of God is too lightly esteemed if we believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body and the Eternal Kingdom of substance then we ought to lay up in heaven those good Treasures that are available to the faithful Saints now we know the treasures are like a rod of iron we know the treasures or the Morning Star we'll get to that a little bit we know Treasures are ruling over cities right but brother Adam says they are actually substance rewards so that means there is a crown that's an actual substance that will go on your head it's actual substance right so we're actually laboring for real things amen amen this is not imaginary praise God that's right this ain't some mystical dreamer some hope so this is an absolute will be hallelujah amen this is an absolute promise of God and he promises it to all those that love is appearing amen how many love Jesus today amen now I want to count all these rewards that all of us can get this is not just for preachers Not Just For Men it's for every single one of us if you withstand persecution and endure Temptation you get the reward Crown of Life if you give give a water in the name of Jesus or disciple you get a be cautious that you know in my house I'm very careful I think the Lord I think the Lord is very careful to remind me when we have guests I always try to give them a glass of water after I offer them some water because I want to fulfill that right I do it in my class as a teacher as well you know Bible club we do it I just mean to be aware of that like I'm here to serve other people praise God I have to be hospitable that's one of my requirements for a a bishop or a Bible calls an elder or pastor I have to have that so I want to constantly remember that what can I give you are you thirsty can I get you some ice water the Bible says if you receive a prophet or a righteous man you get a prophet's reward now program said that's you know come in handy right so if you're around a prophet that Prophet can pray for you but it's also true for us even listening to program sermons remember I told you that story about Elijah Gibbs he's a pastor in Connecticut he was born with some type of a foot defect and he walked with a limp but he was going to be a preacher he was a young man he just kept listening to Brothers tapes and he was listening to a brother random tape and brother Ram told this person on tape exactly what was wrong with his foot the man on the tape and that was exactly what was wrong with Elijah Gibbs and he said the Holy Spirit pushed his chair over and he fell flat on his back when he got up his foot was completely made well a church to me that's a prophet's reward right there yeah yeah because you listened to a prophet you get a reward amen hallelujah there's lots of people that have experienced that Angie Brown and I don't know where she goes to church now but she would call us for prayer requests for years and years and years she was here listening to a tape of brother Brandon like in that in that moment the presence of God comes down why because you're Drawing Near to God right we've had people healed right in this congregation right in this service we've seen it a couple weeks ago right whenever you draw nights ago [Applause] the prophets real and George I just believe there's a reward I'm just thankful to believe God sent a prophet and the I believe there's just a reward of living holy in other words message made me live holier than I ever lived before and to me that's a great reward amen because I don't live under the condemnation of living a worldly life I'm separated from that and I get the reward of having a clean conscience before God amen amen Hallelujah that's that's the only prophet's reward I get Hallelujah I'll take that Hallelujah I get a lot more rewards than I'll have cast out Devils heal the sick in other words all the bible promises all those great rewards praying in secret getting reward we saw that with Cornelius there was a memorial in heaven when you pray that way same thing when you give alms you get a reward for that it's in heaven there's a memorial in heaven with your name on it when you plant oh this is for creatures I imagine because that's the context plant and water the gospel you get a reward City there's a reward for that I didn't fall asleep in time leaving family members possessions for think of the Lord get you a reward remember the highest rewards is permission if Jesus Promised Peter you'll get a hundredfold in this world and the world to come church that's what I believe people would get healed just having his shadow pass over there I believe God was rewarding him for leaving his his wife and family God would just let his shadow where's my shadow here's my that's just right under me but if Malachi fell under my shadow think it's about the power of Peter's testimony God honored him so much you just and that will heal you Just Like a Prayer cloth right that just represents this was a faithful search amen and God's Gonna honor your respect for that Prophet amen that sermon of the Lord amen now let's see one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18. okay 18. 18 rewards we all can learn it's the parable the pounds we're all given the same amount right we can all pray can all read our Bibles we can all fight the good fight of Faith amen you can all make a dinner for those who cannot repay you you we can all lend to someone and hope they don't pay me back right pure and undefiled religion is visioning the children that don't have a father Hallelujah and widows that don't have a husband when they're in their Affliction that's real Christianity serving God just giving God your will Lord the reward for that praise God Amen willingly you just willingly serve God ly service to God in anything get your reward that's why I say I want to love preaching I want to love song media but I am a love song leaving whatever we're called to do like your sisters love cooking sometimes right at least I know it's a lot right especially yesterday the day before but you love it right you love it why don't you love what people tell you you did a good job cooking yeah how about did they say you're the best cook in the country would that make you feel good Graham said I'd like to come over to your house sister you probably you're primary you know your brother your primary to the best cooker in the country right but you do it with your heart you'd like to do it praise God yeah anytime you diligently seek God there's a reward for that amen you know see I feel sorry when people say well I'm seeking for the Holy Ghost but I didn't get it and they're discouraged Satan has actually tricked them out of it because they should know maybe they don't know this maybe it's immaturity but they should know I'm diligently seeking God there is a reward for that nice in other words I'm drawing closer if I draw an eye to God he'll draw a knight to me praise God but see that's just discouragement that young believer's face or whoever's going through trials like that right but we should be encouraged you're spending more time with God Amen if I could I'd give you a spiritual pat on the back praise God keep it up keep drawing closer to God God is with you Hallelujah if he wasn't you wouldn't try to be getting in his presence the fact that you're drawing onto him that means he's drawing you like Solomon through the suit of I praise God Amen draw me and I'll run after you Lord that's what's happening you're feeling the pull you're feeling the draw of the Lord Jesus Christ there's a great reward for diligently seeking God fasting in secret get you a reward Cornelius again that's what I want to uh remind people too I've had numerous people asking about the Holy Ghost remember cornelius's house the Holy Ghost fell while they were preaching and the Bible said they magnified God and they glorified God right during the preaching think about that some people get the Holy Ghost right when the preacher preaches about Jesus it talks about the Holy Spirit somebody could get the Holy Ghost right there and you'd see it and you'd hear it like Peter said you're in God's presence right now praise God each one of us are in God's presence now because God's word is being preached hallelujah amen amen giving food drink shelter clothes to a Christian or visiting one when he's sick or in prison yields some and entrance into life eternal According To Jesus I don't know if they had repentance before that but in the story remember they're surprised that when do we do this for you Lord we didn't know your people was actually you a part of the word I love my brother Anderson brother I said you're a part of God I'm a part of God but he said none of us are all of God we all have a part of God I like how brother said I'm not all of God because people make him all God there's a second one like that brother I'm always blasting the Jeffersonville movement okay son I'm trying to watch myself that's only two in this service okay so I just I guess I battle it all the time so that's every day I get comments you know I gotta just let it go and I love this one loving your enemies blessing those who persecute you praying for those who despitefully use you gotta let yourself be you sometimes lending with hope of no repayment yields a great reward among the title being called Children of the highest who are the highest most exalted Believers those who land and hope nobody gives back money right who are the children of the highest bless others when they curse them out that's the children of the highest these are real children of God they bless those who persecute them they love their enemies may God help us to always say God bless you to our enemies right God bless you now of course in my mind I think God bless you with the repentant heart right right because they're under the the influence of the enemy or else they want to be fighting against me they want to be my enemy right they'd be my friend because I'm their friend providing for a Christian's physical necessity so giving somebody food shelter clothing yields a Heavenly reward upon someone else's account the Bible says we have accounts in heaven Paul said Philippians because you gave to me it's now on your account in heaven that's what that Violet Cornelius there's an account in heaven with your name on it so don't compete against other people but run the race praise God run the race against soar up Treasures in Heaven and I love this I love this list these are all the rewards of the seven Church ages I can put them in one place so I can see all those and really encourage us so what what rewards do you get if you overcome and later this year brother said you would bye if you can just overcome now in 2023 in laodicea if you can just overcome all these temptations that we go through every day you get a huge portion of reward Hallelujah just like all the church age members praise God right right amen where'd you get you get the eat of the tree of life that's got to be the Holy Spirit right amen Christ you escape the second death you eat the hidden Manna you get a white stone with a new name within you get power to rule over Nations goalie you get the Morning Star the white Raymond you have your name remaining in the Book of Life Hallelujah the Lambs one you're a pillar of the temple of God you have Jesus new name you have God's new name and the new Jerusalem's new name written upon him and you're sitting with Jesus in his throne oh that's what I call the reward praise you guys amen just one of those would be a great reward right but we get all of them if we can just overcome the trials that we go through amen you can just defeat the Devil all these blind battles if we can just overcome these my mouths and it may be persecution later maybe rejection if we can just overcome these trials the Bible calls them light afflictions and the church said amen if we just overcome these light afflictions there's great Eternal rewards for us I'm almost done so what do we know Jesus is watching right yes I forgot to put the scripture up there but the Bible says God is Not unrighteous to forget your labor of love he sees everything Hallelujah he remembers everything that you've done amen hallelujah he's watching you he knows your heart he hears your prayers he's watching brother says but now this in this special promise to the True Believers of all ages God's had to God is declared he will give them rewards of great Beauty and eternal duration let the wealthy look down on the poor and that how he feels sometimes people drive by with their big Dodge Charger or they drive by I drive slow so a lot of people flash me some inappropriate signs when I'm driving now I'm not claiming to be the best driver either maybe I make mistakes but I get a lot down on me for some reason maybe I'm not a good driver but I'm trying to be a good driver but you know how the rich are you know they drive by or you by their house and they just think they're the greatest people ever they might look down on his church but just remember also there's other there's another person who's looking down on us that's Jesus it's a different kind of looking down amen hallelujah it's looking down with love hallelujah amen let the wealthy look down the poor let them give large some to the church that it may turn that in turn it might honor the by placing a marble plaque or some statuary in their honor unplug public display that all may applaud right we've all I've been to Dedicated I work at the school they always have dedication Services well this is going to be an honor of so-and-so this is going to be honor and so and so let the world have their honor right but someday the God who sees and knows all once more will once more commend the Widow for giving her all though it might be but two mites and he himself reward with the treasures of Heaven I thought about this hey they gave a tenth away right well they would get the same reward if somebody had a thousand and gave a hundred away is that right yeah so it's Jesus tells us it's the percentage of what you give away and I'm not telling anybody to go into poverty but I'm saying that Jesus is looking at your heart when you give right and we also want to be led by the Holy Spirit when we give and I'm not passing around the offering basket again I've never done that I'm telling you I'm telling you and reminding you give to those that have a need of it when you're led by the Holy Spirit when you see the opportunity this woman gave two mites a might was 3 8 of a penny and I don't know what a penny was in that day I don't know if like they call like a day's wages or certain I've spent a while since I looked at it with the talents and everything by the word she gave six eight six eighths of a penny away that's all she had and Jesus said she gave more than the thousands or millions of dollars that the Pharisees gave in the treasury because it's based upon your percentage and church really we just want to give all that we can for God yes right amen because what about you know you know some people look at the scripture and that's true but what about the other scripture in Proverbs where it says a wise grandfather leaves an inheritance to his grandchildren what about that one well if I gave it all away I can't be wise and give to my grandchildren right so there's a balance you got to follow the leading of the Lord what God's leading you to do and of course the nice thing is at the end of your life of the Lord should Terry you can give it all away because you can't take it with you right like I heard the brother say uh you've never seen a U-Haul truck behind a hearse right we saw one the other day we saw a funeral presenting going I didn't see a U-Haul truck taking all your Treasures to the Grave so we got to give our all I love this Jesus sat over against the treasure look he's just sitting and he was just watching that that's why I love that quote brother said Jesus is just watching everybody he's watching when that basket got passed around today now don't feel bad if you didn't give because sometimes I don't give you know uh I can't give every week because I only get paid but I'm just saying in our lives Jesus looks at each one of us and he's watching how do we I love that the sick Church right he could have been teaching in the in the The Sanctuary but he's watching how we give to the Lord I love that and then he points out to his Apostles here's a good example here's two examples this is the right example this is the wrong example he's watching you Church Hallelujah right he's watching me and Jesus sat over against the treasury and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury and many that were Rich casting much and there came a certain poor Widow and she threw in two mites which make a farthing and he called unto him his disciples and saith unto them very thus in you that this poor will have cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasury for all they did casting of their abundance but she of her want did cast in all that she had even all her living I don't know anybody at least yet maybe that I remember that's cast in they've given away every single thing they've had that is a real sacrifice yeah yeah we don't know anything about this Widow now remember Widow was the worst place you could be you don't have a husband taking care of you don't have a son widows were the worst one of the worst places you could be just watched her and let her give sometimes Jesus is going to watch us and let us get when even when it hurts even as your account gets left Hallelujah remember he's looking down in love the rest of the world looked down and oh I'm better than them look how great I am but Jesus looks down in love he's gonna reward all that we do for his namesake remember Church Jesus wore a crown of thorns and then he's the one that gives us the crown Crown of Life the soldiers played a crown of thorns and put it on his head and they put on him a purple robe and they said hail King of the Jews and they smote him with their hands they slapped our King we know Jesus wore Thorns so we could wear eternal life he became our sin that we might be made his righteousness Hallelujah remember the scripture says where'd the first Thorns come from they come from the Garden of Eden Thorns were the result of the curse of sin so Jesus took our curse upon himself that's why he wore the Thorns right he was crowned with all of our sins he was crowned with all of my iniquities Hallelujah he took that Dominion upon him did he not he took that Dominion upon him so that he could pay the price for all of our sins Hallelujah the Bible said Christ has redeemed us how many people redeemed today you feel bought out of the pawn shop amen you're out of the pawn shop praise God hallelujah amen you're a part of your father's Kingdom Hallelujah I'm redeemed from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for his written curse it is every one that haneth on a tree he became a Blessing of Abraham might come on you through Jesus Christ what a blessing praise God Amen he was cursed so you could be blessed they curse him with the crown of thorns so he could bless you with the crown of everlasting life Hallelujah that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith what a blessing to church I just want to end with this because this is something we can all do right now all right we all can't go cook food right now right you know can't all go start fasting I guess you could start fasting right now man what we can all do right now is pray that's how I want to end the service brother man I was listening to souls in prison yesterday but Ram said even Abraham crying if I can find 50 righteous on down to 10 righteous and God said yes find 10 righteous then he breaks you know program ends or he spends actually the last half of that it's like a three and a half hour sermon trying to encourage the sisters right because in JCPenney remember he saw all the women that looked like they were women from hell with all their makeup and blue and purple and everything on hanker and he said look like canker so he spends the last half showing how it's a woman's World sinful women but then the beauty of a Godly woman he says let me tell you something sister just a minute you might be old-fashioned but you got something these queens has in God you've got something that she can never have think about that they can never have it right you might be old-fashioned or dressing dress up like a lady they might say look at an old Holy Roller don't you worry she's got something that that old Queen that's got all the world looking at her out there she hasn't got it she can never have it she's lost eternally she's doomed you got morals in other words you've got righteousness amen you've got a crowd of righteousness Hallelujah amen they can never have that think about how many men Beyonce I'm just gonna name some of them Jennifer Lopez Kim Kardashian think of all these men that they've sent to Hell program says right from Brother Adam's day he says you've got virtue we've got virtue but that woman else chosen to Hell the blind walks into it but now you've got something you sisters you really got something this morning praise God that's right you got a crowd of Life hallelujah amen they know nothing about that they're crowned with adulteries right they're crowded as whoremongers that's what they're crowding with God of Mercy but they can't praise God it's got eternal life got a great reward praise God when they persecute you or they make fun of you are there people scoff at you the way your hair looks or your dress looks when they scoff at that Jesus has he has a reward because looking down to reward you exactly right and here's here's where I want to get to you know you might not even be even on a church book there's no church book here sir you can't sign you can't join our church here but it might be I love this it might be your righteous life and I believe this is true that's holding the wrath of God from the world today sisters and brothers right we saw and this this example the example is locked lot and his two daughters were holding back the wrath of God on Sodom your life is holding back the wrath of God on Ohio and we got some Pennsylvania Saints their lives are holding back the wrath of God why because we're righteous through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
