========================================

thank you [Music] foreign during the year Lord put on my heart and uh and we trust it'll be a blessing to you we're going to go to Second Corinthians 11 3 and then Romans 11 33 for our opening here as you can see tonight we're going to preach on the perfection of simplicity wait I thought simple Simplicity was simple there's a Perfection of simplicity sure is we're going to take it right through the word of God and begin to tie some of these things our our topic tonight will be two women crying out so we have the Perfection of Simplicity and then two women crying out and we'll be depending on the great savior to help us out this evening uh Second Corinthians 11 3 it says but I fear less by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtility so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ all right so the devil is always in the details as far as trying to get you to yearn for more than what is revealed to you right and obviously we have a message that revealed God hidden in Simplicity we'll deal with that in a moment here but notice if Satan can conrupt you from the Simplicity of Christ he's he's done got you like he had Eve right so he says for if he cometh he that cometh preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached or if ye receive another Spirit which you have not received or another gospel which ye have not accepted uh you might be well bear with him all right now I appreciate brother Jesse having confidence in me to be here without him being here that means a lot to me I appreciate that but yet if you actually see what it is by Design God has now left the laity with a different preacher so this is where you count on those things that you have been taught that Holy Ghost buzzer inside that would tie right on with the word uh you would actually be standing on your own two feet so to say and uh this is where we really start taking a little idea about Simplicity and what Simplicity is because Simplicity is something that has actually been transformed to a different image in this day all right so we're going to spend a little time on this and uh there there's a little a little beautiful thought within this if the Lord help us get there so they didn't put up with it did they they preached a different gospel a different Jesus they didn't want nothing to do with it Hallelujah all right Romans 11 33. Romans 11 33 and then we'll say a word of prayer let you have your seats oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god wow so the wisdom and knowledge of God is deep how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who hath known the mind of the Lord or who hath been his counselor or who has first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen so we can only consist and survive just because of Christ Hallelujah that's why we're made manifest right to be the Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour so uh if we think we're gonna get something up on God that ain't gonna happen right but we're working with this idea the Perfection of Simplicity uh we'll see where the Lord will take this let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer our most beloved Lord Jesus Christ how we love you we appreciate how good you are Lord and as we once again come just crying out to you Lord God that you'd give us a Grace and a mercy Lord surely as On Any Sunday evening the devil might fight with uh fatigue or something like that but we're asking oh God that you just allow your spirit just to remain in the room oh God allowed to be strong in our midst oh God because we don't want to be babies oh God you're your Prophet told us we can't be babies but we should be what we should be trained soldiers Lord so with that we come to the house of God tonight wanting to know more about you Lord wanting to understand you a little bit better so we pray oh God you take these lips of clay take this mind o God and bring a thought that will help the children of God tonight and Lord will surely be glad as the word unfolds so surely be in our midst we love and worship your Holy Name Lord Jesus Christ and the church says together amen you may be seated so once again we'll be working tonight with the Perfection of Simplicity uh to women crying out notice here in Isaiah 35 8 it says and then Highway shall be there and away and it shall be called the way of holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the wayfaring men though fools shall not air therein my aren't you glad that God has revealed to you the way amen it is a way of Holiness in this untoward generation right but the scripture in looking at simplicity he talks about the way that we should go and that he would make it so plain that a fool shall not air therein Hallelujah so you see the way to this Rapture though it be hidden it is available amen aren't you glad that when the message was ministered to you in whatever form it was that you had ears to hear that word amen hallelujah you added something that Drew you to it amen you knew it was right you knew it was for you you knew that it was the unfolding of God to your generation Hallelujah you heard it right now the path to this Rapture also cannot be that difficult right we realize it's really as simple as receiving the baptism in the Holy Ghost amen Hallelujah the wise had oil right but she was wise all right now we're going to begin to work with Simplicity and the reason why we're going to work with Simplicity is because it over abounds in churches that you actually put the work on someone else instead of doing it yourself and what we understand we're just talking about organizational spirits and so forth but it was actually Satan's great plan that he would fool the church by making men want to conquer the laity they would be perhaps smarter more social they'd be have an anointing or be or be some great somebody and the church would therefore forfeit their rights to what God had for them and try to place it on a man instead of actually living the purpose out for why they're here why is that important because as we see we all are to have the gifts of the Spirit the fruit of the spirit amen we're all supposed to have the shout of a king in the camp amen there should be a God moving in our lives continually amen Hallelujah and it's nice to see it it's nice to be a part of it well that's why we're going this direction this evening to begin to unfold a picture to you about true Simplicity and what Simplicity is now the Bible has this picture so painted in there it's so beautiful so God give us strength to bring this out but I want to start here it's really small but and God is hiding in Simplicity in 63 412 he said God is so great he can make his self simple that's what makes God great to me is how he can make himself simple and that for doing himself he hides himself from the smart and the wise oh my God I don't want to be smart and wise let's take a little balance in a moment now just think of that he hides himself from the smart people and reveals himself to the humble people see how he changed that he hides himself from smart people but reveals himself to Humble people very good very good the Bible said in Isaiah 35 even though a fool should not air in the way it's so simple and as law as you try to figure it out and study it out you just figure away from God every time you do that you just get yourself further and further away quit trying to figure it out just believe what he said did you get that just believe what he said we have literally in the message had 57 years of people trying to figure it out right they figured out that the seals mean this the Thunders mean this Hallelujah that what that this is a really prosperous church because they do this this that and the other and everyone is trying to figure things out his Mercy over his Mercy not over just you it's boundless the areas that you can go and there's always something new will he return again well will brother Branham have a mature return Ministry or will he not and it's really made such a confusion that they've actually shown that they're just trying to figure something out but I would say this they're actually figuring out themselves away from God because he said right here you just believe what he said so if we actually want to know what true Simplicity is the Bible will tell us that too won't it Hallelujah now watch it says that's all there is to it just believe it and then he then he hides himself from the wise and shows himself to the simple man can't be that big right now remember who's going to make the Rapture the wise versions many people have demonized their understanding of scripture the understanding of the message on account of misinterpretation of these things the Bible says in Matthew 25 that you're a wise virgin but if I read that wrong I will say it's a shame to be wise see it Hallelujah now what this bursts forth we want to be simple so what we've been taught is just trust your pastor just trust your preacher let your preacher do a most of the praying let your preacher do most of the directing but when brother Branham actually talked positively about First Corinthians 14 where everyone had a Psalm everyone had had an exhortation everybody had something they were going to give in brother Branham actually said that was a positive thing when it was used in the right manner everybody is supposed to contribute in the house of God Hallelujah that was the point this morning every joint supplyeth amen we should know where our gifts are at we should know where God is moving us at and we should be able with that to exhort and strengthen one another that's nicolaitanism and where it destroys what it what it conquers the laity but the laity must come to a position of simplicity where they understand how it's really supposed to work you can't demonize wisdom and have a wise virgin doesn't make sense now does it but brother Branham will Hammer wisdom over and over and over again but how is he meaning that because what we've been taught is that that means that you know what you can't understand your Bible right I've had people they say to me they say brother cam where did Brother Branham say that do you see what they're doing so if I'm going to do this if I can only say exactly what brother Branham said then I got to stay out of the book of Nahum you better watch out there's only certain places I can go in haggai I can't touch much of Zechariah either they're trying to fit people into some mold when that whole word is Christ and is available for teaching exhortation and strengthening to the Bride of Jesus Christ you see how it's going but when you watch this see how the definition ties in it says simple right there it says what what does simplicity really mean what does single really mean to be simple is to be single consisting of one thing Now watch how he brings us out it is uncompounded unmingled so to be simple is to be unmingled [Laughter] Hallelujah God loves one he said be ye separate touch not the unclean thing so if you really want to be simple stay away from that which you're not supposed to mingle with to be simple is actually to be only consisting of one thing what should we be what consisting of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and its leadership in our lives amen now watch this this is I love this so he says it's combined with anything else as a simple substance a simple idea a simple sound if you keep on defining it it means sincere harmless not complex or complicated we can intellect not wise or sagacious silly uh oh so you may that there's a good simplicity and a bad simplicity I try to make everybody think don't I even on a Sunday night Hallelujah let's look in the scripture let's begin to take a look at this all right Psalms 116 6 it says the Lord preserveth the simple I was brought low and he helped me that sounds good that's as simple I want we want to be simple to God Amen to let him reveal himself to us amen now here we go we're going to go now 62 725 greater than Solomon is here he said then there's nine gifts that's locally in the church speaking in tongues interpretation tongues gift of wisdom knowledge prophecy and so forth them nine spiritual gifts that operates through the church but then there's nine or five office gifts that God puts in the church and oh how we love to see them all operating wow isn't that something we should say well I love to see it operate too amen one of them is Pastor teacher and those things then the others comes along in confirmation gifts are to magnify and God's just got it so even a fool will not be excused will he God makes his gifts his nine spiritual gifts I can preach a whole sermon about that I spent I spent 10 sermons preaching it last year oh I love it you know your Prophet said he said that your that the gifts moving through the church would be just like his gift it's first that's First Corinthians 14. 24 25 26. amen when someone unlearns come what he said if all prophesy one is convinced one is Judge of all and then the secrets of their heart being made known they were what they will have a true say God is with you your brother Brandon says another place he said if the gifts of the Spirit is there he said you will bypass many things Hallelujah that'll make you want them think about all the hard trials that you have in your life that's why God has gifts for the church nine spiritual gifts because when they get single or simple to God God can bring them out and manifest in the church many things that you have to bypass instead of having to go through many trials that you shouldn't have to see why the devil don't want you to have that Hallelujah so but look he said it's so simple to receive the gifts that a fool could narrow there wow it's so simple the way God has made them and I like that so the even the nine spiritual gifts moving in our life are simple he made it so simple what have we done then have we complicated it what have we done the more simpler you become the greater you'll become before God that's right don't never try to lift yourself up when you do you're bringing yourself down see he that exalts himself shall be abased notice how he ties that in he ties in Simplicity once again with not lifting yourself up so what is true Simplicity is being single to God Amen not trying to add yourself in the equation but coming before Christ or coming before Christ God and saying not my will but thine be done amen taking the mind of Christ now let's continue let's now begin to move here for time's sake let's go to Proverbs 7 verse 7. perhaps one of the deepest books in the Bible is the Book of Proverbs we're going to spend some time in Proverbs tonight and we're going to show you a little picture with this okay We Trust will be a blessing to you Proverbs 7 7 because we say oh I want to be simple but simple has become an excuse to not read your Bible to not pray to expect everyone else to do the work for you right the place I'm at is a pastor I'll just say this and I'm in a visiting church so I'm not going to tell you things that I'm finding I'll tell you I preach stuff like this about being civil [Laughter] but but I have come to find out that I'm tired of trusting other preachers narratives because if what they're telling me is right it should produce that's right it shouldn't produce no love it shouldn't produce um the organizational Spirits it shouldn't produce that so then I come back I've had to come back and I'm now testing the narratives I literally spent I've told you it's already probably I said I spent two three hundred hours studying the seals out all over again just because I'm like okay what's going on here I want to know and you know what I told my church study it out I'm not the only one here that can study I'm not the only one here that can pray it out because I want to know what truth is if we've had the seals delivered then what's going on and why are things like they are well when we come back and find out a lot of it comes back to what trying to figure things out Hallelujah when you look at the simple truth of it it's a little bit different than what people say this but if you tell them that you better watch out Hallelujah that's for the cam coming from no point in Ohio for you amen hallelujah Proverbs 7 7 and I'd be held among the simple ones well this has to be good this is about simple people Glory I beheld among the simple ones I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding wait so you can be simple and not have understanding why was this message given to us not that we would be void of understanding but that we would have understanding that understanding is revelation amen that's right Hallelujah now watch this it says passing through the street near her corner and he went the way to her house in the Twilight in the evening in the black and dark night and behold there met him a woman with the attire of a harlot and subtle in subtle heart she is loud and stubborn her feet abide not in her house ah here we have somebody simple but they don't have any understanding and because of that remember our topic tonight is two women crying out here a woman is crying out uh of course you see I have written here she has the attire of a harlot Hallelujah there is a harlot brother sister in Revelation 17. amen she is after simple ones too she's the mother of Harlan and I'll tell you what she has daughters too now that word simple there it means Simplicity or not yet or to be a naive simple foolish open-minded she was simple and she didn't have understanding you know why people cannot move forward with God is because they're told all about the seals but they don't understand that what it's really showing us is how the devil fights us through organizational spirit and if you don't have that understanding your Void of understanding you will be void of understanding and you will fall for it Hallelujah think about this perhaps the biggest church in America in the message they have Halloween parties they have fall fellowships where all the kids dress up like ghouls ghosts and and pumpkins and whatever else they want to dress up to how did it come to a spot that people that believe what we believe they're doing things that are contrary to Common Sense when Halloween is nothing more than than a Catholic holiday that's joined with many Pagan thoughts hallelujah it's good to be simple but we must have understanding Hallelujah there's a harlot that is out to get all she will she'll rule for one hour your Prophet said amen so notice I'm showing you a negative side through the scripture to show you what true Simplicity really is it is to be single but what if I mix it it's not single anymore see it Hallelujah all right now let's look at Proverbs 9 13. I'm showing you the spirit of God and the spirit of antichrist if you can catch it let's just get it right out there amen hallelujah Proverbs 9 13 it says a foolish woman is clamorous right right you're always talking it up right she is simple and knoweth nothing well I thought it's great to be simple the simpler I'll be the greater I'll be with God not this simple she's so simple she don't do what she don't know anything so she's capable to receive anything now watch this for she sitteth at the door of her house on a seat in the high places of the city to call passengers who go right on their ways there it is this woman who knows nothing is simple and she is calling to who who so is simple let him turn in hither wait a minute I thought this was great to be simple ah what's the Lord trying to tell us here now watch this and as for him that wanted understanding it's good to be simple I would say but we must have understanding Hallelujah she saith to him stolen waters are sweet and bread eaten in secret is pla is pleasant but he knoweth not that the Dead are there and that her guests are in the depths of hell this woman that is crying out she is also looking for simple people she wants simple people that have no understanding they don't understand remember even as it's spoken said my people perish for a lack of knowledge we don't read the the Bible to become theologians we read the Bible to put the word in our hearts amen Hallelujah we don't listen and study the message so that we can meet lingo talkers or to appear like we're some know it all we want we listen and follow this message to put the word in our lives amen so that we can know what is right and what is wrong and want to the issue is what the one that's almost right laughs remember if it'd be so close to see the elected if possible not right is not what we're worried about because we see that we are worried about what's almost right that's why discernment is given to tell what is almost right which takes lore doesn't it see that of course clamorous there talking about this woman and noisy has a mouse speaking great swelling words a vanity and blasphemy wow that sounds exactly like the Catholic Church doesn't it imposing of infallibility works of superior irrigation whatever that means merits Miracles wealth and riches and very pressing and important uh to gain proselytes to his religion the priests and Jesuits are compared to noisy clamorous croaking frogs now when you read the managed commentators every single one of them knew that this was talking about Rome but the vast majority of the people in the message never heard that at all I'm just saying something because what I'm saying is we've been so placed in laodicea that we really don't seek out the word like we should we really don't pray like we should we lean on Church experience instead of positioning ourselves in a position where God can fully reveal himself to us right I told my church that said study these seals out I asked later I said who don't study it out brother Simon did a little bit did something I was saying glory to God because when he started studying now he's like brother Kim I see exactly what you see I was like hey man so I always offer that I offer my church I said you want my notes I said you don't want to put the time in it because it takes time it takes time to go through all those quotes you want stuff I'll give it for you bring a jump drive we'll download it right on there in seconds you have a lot before your fingertips because it's good to understand and know what is going on I just had a big a big name preacher just tell me uh just a while back he said well we understand that brother Bram said a lot of things that are wrong what do you mean by that was he a man absolutely but you be careful when and I said well then what is right and what is wrong who's the judge of that see how this really affects our faith well that's what the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost should be in the preacher congregation it should be in this brother this sister Hallelujah if you're a sister that doesn't mean you can't read the Bible it doesn't mean you can't study it and understand it it just means you have to stay in your position as you do Hallelujah hey we can talk about proverbs 31 women all day long I know we got something here Hallelujah let's continue I'm getting you this picture Proverbs 14 15. Proverbs 14 15. the simple believeth every word is that a good thing or a bad thing well remember what Proverbs does Proverbs will show you a good side and then I'll show you a bad side it'll show you a bad side and then a good side but see but that's not good the simple believeth every word every word of what somebody tells them but The Prudent man looketh well to his going you know what that word Putin actually means wise Hallelujah do we want to believe every word yes but it must be the word Hallelujah who dictates that this fella that fella right while back they come in they said they said the message is the absolute and they said because brother Branham had the angel of the Lord with him his opinions are better than ours I said brother do you drive a four he said uh well uh I already had him because brother Graham said Fords are better I got one today so I can preach this they said well well uh well you know it don't mean that I said so this is what it means to you then it means that the message is the absolute for whatever this person wants to tell you it is and all he could do is call me Nathan and Cora I can see it praise God let the Holy Ghost go from glory to glory in every single life amen because a buzzer goes off and you're like wait a minute how do if I don't catch you somebody better catch it because no man's infallible Hallelujah so we have to make sure when we believe the word that it's the word because as we see that this is com this is being compared to the woman Rome this harlot this is actually pretty staggering The Prudent man looketh well to his going so the wise person is going to okay you're telling me that's the truth I think I'm going to study that out I'm going to take a look at that amen and he got the Holy Ghost you're gonna be all right aren't you if it's a word you'll see it if the words you'll confirm it it puts a lot of emphasis on the laity to come a little bit higher how we look at things amen oh it's great to have anointed preachers it's great to have people that know a lot man glory to God I love that a lot of them people all over the world amen but I'm preaching about something that's going to activate the laity Hallelujah because you know those simple gifts right back there and all the amazing uses that they have I'd love to see that in the church amen I know it's common amen oh we look for a time brother sister well sin will not be able to enter that door amen that's the holies of holies that's what we're looking for will it come to the symbol absolutely but it will be the same symbol who are single-minded to Christ all right so there it is your definition of prudent it means cautious circumstance practically wise so a prudent man is going to look in now think about it if someone tells you if I tell you that that Ford Explorer is a good vehicle and you need to get that are you just going to go get it because I tell you that I got a quick note it says Lincoln good job man he passed it you are practically wise Hallelujah but what are you gonna do my you might you might like brother cam but I think I'm going to look into this a little bit so you start looking at the fort well I found this this that and the other hallelujah it's really it's really easy to waste time on Amazon that way now isn't it Hallelujah hey they got robots making up reviews for you oh my Hallelujah but watch wisdom says well maybe I should look into this because just because it's working for them doesn't mean it's going to work for me Hallelujah just because this preacher is sticking around he's doing good looks like he's in the message if he tells you this is right we should always check into it make sure it's right amen that's a challenge Hallelujah continuing Romans 16 17 says now I beseech you Brethren mark them which caused divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned and avoid them hmm this is really hard to pull off and and brotherly kindness age we're careful we're trying to be wise about these things for they are that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ but their own belly and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple wow so how is he going to turn it now for your obedience has come abroad unto all men I am glad therefore on your behalf but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good and simple concerning evil Hallelujah remember wisdom is the ability to know what is the cause between right and wrong and to know which decision to make because of that right so that's comes right back down to afford right you can choose a far because I tell you to but wisdom tells you well I better look a little bit more into the matter because there might be something better out there for me Ma and then you'll make a better decision then when when my car breaks down which is not not this one but if a car breaks down then you say boy I should have done that one we've all done it you buy things sometimes say oh I should have bought that instead what was I doing that money's out the door Hallelujah so what Paul tells them is I want you wise unto that which is good but simple concerning evil if it's evil just have the Simplicity about it and say nope I'm not having anything to do with it David said I hate evil single that's single so as we see true Simplicity is not to see how lazy you can be towards the gospel neither how much you can learn memorize or figure it out true Simplicity is how humble and single you can become to God in order for God to build you up with his wisdom Hallelujah now watch us Proverbs 15 28. the heart of the righteous studieth to answer all right so if someone's righteous when they're given something if they don't have an answer they're going to go study it out they're going to make sure that you get the right answer right but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things I'm at a spot where the sister where I'm just I'm all into wisdom I'm all in understanding of stuff because I love it I love it because you know what I want to be at a better place that through yielding to Christ I can bring forth the word better to to whoever I talk to if I Minister the gospel whatever it is I want to bring forth something that will strengthen them in wisdom I think that's good isn't it right I've seen this happen so many times I can't tell you how many times I've seen it and as soon as we read this you'll know exactly what I'm talking about so what the heart of the righteous will study the answer watch this he that answereth a matter before he heareth it it is folly and shame unto him now notice that he that answers a matter before he Hearth it so what that means is and I've watched this just I watch this happen all the time someone and this is where parenting comes into you this you see it's a lot with parenting is that your child might run over you and they said so and so did yes and what you do as a parent if you're a wise parent you say is that right so and so but if you become trained on it like this with Folly and shame you'll hear that matter and you say I knew it was you my son and you just go right off after it but then sometimes if you ain't careful you'll find out later that they didn't even do it to begin with you watch this happen so much in the church oh brother Vang obviously you know if you hear Brother bang I mean Mercy he's mean then all of a sudden you take that and then you begin to treat Vang like he's me happens all the time now brother Vang look at that smile that's a million dollar smile you can't get by that [Laughter] Hallelujah but you see so many times as a pastor I have been I have been convicted numerous numerous times on saying and doing things I've never done all because someone wants their opinion in the way they think things were and Things Are and they wanted to say it like that and then I have somebody that heard that matter and they'll come over and jump me like I'm some evil serpent and I say well you know it didn't happen like that right uh but what is it it's finally insane they're not wise wisdom says let me hear the matter and then we'll then we'll make decisions then we'll do things okay let's watch this let's continue to look at wisdom Proverbs 22 3 a prudent man practically wise for seeth the evil and hideth himself all right but the symbol passed on and are punished ah so we want to be prudent we want to be simple but we want to be yielded to God because these simple ones they don't foresee the evil think about it we're coming on a squeeze right here we've got a squeeze coming up Hallelujah we need to foresee the evil and hide ourselves right in the collapse of the Rock Amen find the safe place amen in Christ While others will tell me brother cam it ain't coming in my lifetime here it is hallelujah I I told a fell the other day he's all worried about his IRA and I'm like I really ain't got no plans for that because it's all going to disappear pretty soon anyway like that and he's like all right well my IRA I'm going to do this this that and then that Hallelujah he don't care about the evil coming he ain't worried about preparing for it he said it'll get better someday but that's not prudence he's trying to be simple thinking that the system will will continue to go on without without the crash but it was made to crash our Prophet said it's going to crash amen it's going to go down Proverbs 27 12 a prudent man for seeth the evil and hideth himself again but the symbol won't pass on and are punished hey wait that's the same exact scripture but once in Proverbs 22 and one's in Proverbs 27. we better be prudent practically wise I'm going to show you in a little bit here where this is going Proverbs 14 18. the simple inherit folly but The Prudent are crowned with knowledge all right so there is a type of Simplicity that we want nothing to do with God is what what makes him great is he can become so simple but he never loses the characteristic of God that he is hallelujah because he is all God he is all wise because he's all God he's omnipotent he's omniscient he carries all the attributes of God but yet what makes him special is that he can become so simple and he can bring wisdom on a level that can be what that can be brought to you to you so you can understand it hmm all right the simple inherent Folly but The Prudent are crowned with knowledge there must be a con a connection between Simplicity the simple bad and The Prudent all right now here we go let's begin remember that woman was crying out where we have another woman crying out Proverbs 1 20. wisdom cryeth without she uttereth her voice in the streets wisdom does wisdom is crying out to you wow 21st verse she crieth in the chief place of concourse in the opening of the gates in the city she uttereth her words saying how long ye simple ones will ye love simplicity she's calling for simple ones too and the scorners Delight in their scorning and fools hate knowledge wait wasn't that the bad simple they had no understanding they had no knowledge they didn't know anything so we can be simple and attain to wisdom and that wisdom is the wise version foreign Hallelujah you know what I can I can just quote stuff uh but sometimes it's just better if I read it that definition of wisdom means The Right Use or exercise of knowledge uh jumping on Daniel it is the faculty of discerning or judging what is most just proper and useful and if it is to be considered an acquirement it is the knowledge and use of what is best most just most proper uh most conducive to Prosperity or happiness wisdom in the first sense or practical wisdom is nearly synonymous with discretion it differs somewhat from Prudence in this respect Prudence is the exercise of sound judgment in avoiding evils wisdom is the exercise of sound judgment either in avoiding evils or attempting good so discretion holds you from evil but wisdom holds you from evil and promotes good my Hallelujah you know why I'm saying this stuff because when you read The Book of Proverbs you read the book of Job you find people that I mean just remember these are the people everybody calls cavemen these are people oh they didn't have phones they didn't have Google they didn't have blah blah blah but look at the wisdom that was coming from these people right job had three miserable comforters and job took their wisdom and said you're a miserable comforter it's not that their wisdom was wrong but they were applying it wrong their whole attempt in their wisdom was to show that job was a sinner not fit to not fit to live I mean that he was some secret sinner some evil person but when Joe brought it back around he said if I was in your shoes I would be trying to build strength in me I would be trying to build up the man that's that's down Hallelujah so wisdom without discretion is is no good so it is sound judgment in avoiding evils or attempting good see why wisdom is so important that's why brother Bram said he said it's the first gift of the spirit of the nine spiritual nine spiritual gifts that has to be there he said because the wisdom will judge all the other ones but wait a minute it's a gift of the spirit not how wise you can be it's how wise he can be in you Hallelujah all right all right it continues Proverbs 9 1 wisdom hath build it her house I told you she was a woman I told you she has hewn out her Seven Pillars seven of them I wonder what that is she hath killed her Beast she has mingled her wife she has also furnished her tables she has sent forth her maiden she crieth upon the highest places of the city what is she crying out for who so is simple let him turn in hither amen as for him that wanteth understanding she saith to him come eat my bread and drink of the wine which I have mingled forsake the foolish this is my parentheses same Hebrew word is simple and live and go in the way of understanding so there's a good simple and there's a bad simple but what now notice who is crying out to you tonight wisdom is crying out to you that you could be more wise in your decisions that you could be wise to avoid evil wise to bring forth good there is a Divine form of that that God wants to manifest in his assembly yeah absolutely all right so down in the red there he says we'll just go there it's the commentator is Gilbert he says though it may be these Seven Pillars May denote in general the firmness and solidity of the spiritual building the church the continuance of its power of God or they may have respect to the seven states of the church in so many periods of time to last to the end of all things signified by the seven churches in the Book of Revelations I love it even the mayonnaise had it figured out those sevens always ring right back to the seven Church ages oh it's beautiful all right first Timothy 3 15. how many pillars seven so but if I carry along that thou mayest know how thou Artest to behave thyself in the house of God which is the Church of the Living God the pillar and ground of the truth who's the who's the pillar it's the church it's the ground of Truth too Hallelujah that's what makes the church the church is it has the truth it has Christ there Christ is the truth all right Proverbs 8 1 it says doth not wisdom cry and understanding put forth her voice now think about this if the local bodies were in perfect condition we would be giving wisdom to one another and we would be really benefited of it we would be avoiding a lot of things Hallelujah does not wisdom cry understanding before the voice she's standeth in the top of the high of high places by the way in the place of of the past she crieth at the gates at the entry of the city at the coming in at the doors unto you o man I call and my voice is to the sons of man this is serious oh ye simple understand [Music] wisdom and he falls be of an understanding heart here for I will speak of excellent things and the opening of my lips shall be right things for my mouth shall speak truth and wickedness is an Abomination to my lips hallelujah look at the effort of God to bring wisdom to his church Hallelujah my my wisdom versus faith he says and so the wisdom that I want you to get straightened out on before we start there is a wisdom of God a wisdom of God is stay with his word but Satan and his wisdom tried to twist the word so that's the wisdom I'm speaking of there's a certain amount of faith that goes with Satan in order to accept Satan you got to believe Satan so there is a perverted Faith to a perverted thing oh my God hallelujah to believe a lie you got to have faith to put on that lie [Laughter] I told you it's deep hallelujah thank God for a seventh angel Hallelujah so there's a perverted faith for a perverted thing now notice that's why the scripture says Paul said you know let us let us lay these first foundations right and if God permit let us go into Perfection you know fade towards God and and repentance from dead works and all these things like that so you've got to start somewhere the scripture says desire the sincere milk of the word right being babes but then what but then strong meat belongeth to him that has discernment he's able to discern between Good and Evil Hallelujah so how many people actually should be getting meat I pray you say right here Glory Hallelujah that's why we have an issue because if deep word goes to babes they choke on it if I give my baby Judah I give him big hunks a mistake that boy is going to be coughing hacking and throwing up right but Paul had the same issue he said in time when you should have been the teachers you have need to be taught again that be the first principles of God so what is this gospel supposed to do it's supposed to become such a love in your life that you receive it and then ye are able to Proclaim that gospel too amen hallelujah God help us all right continue he says in anything that would try to twist the word of God to make it say something that it doesn't it's the wrong Spirit see offering wisdom against God's wisdom so we're going to refer to it as wisdom and not Satan's faith Hallelujah so you have what wisdom crying out and then you have what you have a false wisdom that's so close but it's false all right you know one of the scariest parts of the church age book to me as he said he said that the people who had their names in The Book of Life he said they were part of the message of their day and he said but when this time comes he was talking about he's talking about this squeeze that's coming he said the vast majority of them will have their names removed from The Book of Life because they will deny the truth at that time I want to be that I'm not that glory amen hallelujah we better use some faith on this not faith for Satan faith for the word amen Hallelujah so people that want if they have their name in the book that doesn't mean it can't be blotted out we know there's a Lamb's Book but we're showing what we are right now we're showing what are we going to do with the word what are we going to do because he's showing us what we can do now think about this if wisdom's crying out where do you have to go where she's at she's got the table spread she's got all set up brother Brandon said that wisdom is the word it's got to be the word of God so see I'm not preaching anything contrary to what he said because this is the word of God see watches Psalms 19 7. the law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul that's that's the truth right the testimony of the Lord is sure making wise the simple Hallelujah so the more wise that you want to be get more word now this is you know I preached it here before about the the wise virgin and the foolish and when you go through the Bible you have them joined all the time in the same in the same scriptures why is foosh why is foolish why is foolish Proverbs wise foolish why is push you have the same thing here you have wisdom and simplicity where's some Simplicity because God is trying to show that receiving Christ is not saying glory to God God sent a prophet I'm here I got to make it now I got the Holy Ghost I believe God sent a prophet I sit in church no no no no no we are just starting a journey amen and moving what through the stature of a perfect man we've got to complete the work amen let me say it like this we want to be so simple in God's Simplicity that we can have nine spiritual gifts here you've seen the quote oh brother cam I think that was before the seals that don't count you better look into some wisdom Hallelujah because it goes to church age book too if you look Hallelujah Psalms 119 130. the entrance of thy words giveth light it giveth understanding unto the simple so you can say I'm simple I need understanding because wisdom is crying out to you you see what that's why the devil tries to make reading the Bible boring because all he's really doing is perverting what this really is remember the spirit is to energize the word that isn't just when a preacher preaches Hallelujah there's your Messiah message right there Hallelujah the spirit wants to energize the word but he cannot energize the word if there's no faith put on that word Hallelujah it's like like I told the Saints the other day they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength renew it if you wait on God there is a potential look up that Hebrew word renew it means to bring back to full capacity you ever been so tired so are out you don't know what to do he said right there that you can wait on him and he'll completely renew your entire strength how many people have been through that you know what I'm telling you I'm telling you that there's so much power in this word of God and don't worry we're coming into it we're coming into it I ain't coming here and saying hey I'm renewed right now no I hobbled in here because I played dodgeball yesterday [Laughter] Hallelujah but there is a potential that is laying right there that you can have a complete that's not I mean that's a renewing it didn't say that he's well he's only going to renew your mind he's only going to renew your body no it's a full renewal both body and mind whoa Hallelujah let me do we believe his word or not Hallelujah because if it says it it doesn't amen so God how can we remember we try to change God to fit our program but we've got to change ourselves to fit his program amen that's what makes the gospel work Hallelujah so the word brings what understanding to the simple Proverbs 1 2 to know wisdom and instruction to perceive the words of the understanding to receive the instruction of wisdom Justice judgment and Equity to give subtility to the simple utility to the young man knowledge and discretion Hallelujah you know what the serpent did he was subtle Hallelujah but wisdom will give you the right subtlety Watch what it says to give subtlety to the simple men of weak abilities weak capacities shallow understandings in cautious credulous and easy imposed upon these by attending to what is here and contained may arrive to a serpentine subtlety oh wait a minute didn't Jesus said that you should be wise as a serpent but harmless as a dove nicer than that serpent Hallelujah you know they're always them serpents are always trying to do tricks on you trying to get you all caught up did you know that God can move you in the same way to get their souls right hallelujah amen because you find out they weren't serpents after all they just needed someone that would yield to the subtlety of Jesus Christ Hallelujah it says though they are simple and harmless as doves they may become as wise as serpents May attain to the inexquisite knowledge of divine things and know even more than the wise and Sage philosophers among the Gentiles hallelujah oh that sounds like I could have a stuffed shirt no that's not what we're after we're after a gospel that will produce this word amen now think about this in Proverbs what does it also say it says he that is wise win his Souls God's wisdom the wisdom that's crying out for you to come unto her Hallelujah I hope you're having a good time this stuff I just love it I hope you're all right because I am all right Proverbs 19 25 uh Smite a scorner and the simple will beware foreign and reprove one that hath understanding and he will understand knowledge all right so if you smite a scorner the simple is going to beware but if you approve one that has understanding he will understand knowledge he'll understand it so he won't do it again or he won't do what he's seen done as far as 21 11. it says when the scorner is punished the simple is made wise and when the wise is instructed he receiveth knowledge in the age of YouTube and everything every now and then the the post a video or something you know something silly is going on right you might have somebody bad mouthing the cop next you know they're in jail you've got the right type of Simplicity on you you don't realize you ain't gonna do that why because you watch when someone is punished and you learn not to do what they did and then you avoid evil Hallelujah why do you think God puts things in your path right he puts things your past you can learn by the things that are happening in your environment Hallelujah we've got to be almost done here yes almost done Proverbs 127. when your fear cometh as desolation and your destruction comes as a whirlwind when distress and anguish cometh upon you then shall they call upon me but I will not answer they shall seek me early but they shall not find me for that they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord they would none of my counsel and this they despised all my reproof therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices we should always consider the Lord in all our decisions right in everything we see right for the Turning Away of the simple simple there means wisdom shall slay them and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them but whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely and shall be quiet from Fear of evil amen hallelujah we live in a dark and evil age amen and wisdom is crying out to us to make the path plain Hallelujah hey think about it we got a third poll coming with five identifications amen we got a lot of rain fixing to fall amen we got spiritual gifts ready to strike the church now think about it they're already here you are born with them amen but God is what trying to get his church in position to receive that's a humbling thing about this is because you look at yourself and you're like you smack yourself because you're like oh God he made gift so simple that there's no excuse I don't have them who am I so yes we're good amen so that Turning Away of the simple wisdom has called the simple to turn they had turned but it was away from her prosperity read carelessness not outward Prosperity but the temper which it too often produces the easy going indifference to higher truths is that which destroys oh my Hallelujah there's two women crying out now I could have spent a lot more time on on the the bad one but we have to be able to discern between the voices remember that's a lot of that stuff's natural but it's speaking of the spiritual that we must receive and James 1 says what I say a lot when I'm here that says if you lack Wisdom ask God who giveth it what liberally Hallelujah but let a man ask in faith foreign you have to believe that God wants you to have it and that he's going to give it Hallelujah she's healed now Seven Pillars brother sister let's stand up we're good thank you Hallelujah well we love the Lord Brother sister we're so glad we could have a day together in the word amen tonight is tonight was in it was a moving on the individual level you know because it always comes to pass that you know what we can hear that we're the bride we can hear glory to God we can we can we can run through a troop and leap a wall we can do all these things but then when you look at something like that you're like but God wants me to have such a move of wisdom in my life in simplicity that I can be wise as a virgin for Christ ready for this rapture I know we're going to need it brother sister I know we are I believe that's why it's the Cry of the heart amen it's one of those Mysteries that's locked right in Proverbs you see two women crying out choose the right one this one looks like a Harley she is a heart you better stay away from her boy Hallelujah stay with the word amen hallelujah we love the Lord amen one fighter musician we're saying a word of prayer here and uh we'll we'll do a little singing there and if anyone has needed prayer still be happy to pray with you uh we're so blessed to be here today and uh we're gonna say a word of prayer as we speak here our most beloved Lord Jesus Christ is we're just bring a little simple message oh God but Lord how how it's so great to watch the word expound upon itself Lord and to see the picture you're trying to get your children into oh God is that they could express a discernment of God not just to know what the evil is but to know the good is and oh God you said that when the church can discern the two spirits in the framework of the church and know who she is oh God she'd be an invincible Army Lord so we're looking for those things even now but Lord we don't come to you asking for eloquence we don't come asking to be smart or to figure it out we're just coming oh God because wisdom is crying out Lord and Lord we want to receive what you'd have of us oh God it'll come through your word it'll come through your heart Lord and it'll raise us in such a way oh God that will be able to to stand right there with the word of God and make the right decisions as we're coming to this as we're joined to you we're joined to your spirit God knowing first we must receive this Holy Ghost oh God it may go from birth to birth in every life and Lord we're just so glad that we could be here today Lord I pray as I leave this place oh God that Lord you would raise this church up stronger than ever before working for your Will O God that the presence of God would be moving mightily as they discern that false spirit in the midst of God and as a yield To You O God and begin oh God more and more to let you Prevail in their midst oh God that Souls will come to you more and more and Lord they will be ready for this translation of God bless our brother as he goes oh God across the seas protect his way oh god well God keep him from harm keep him from Evil oh God and Lord provide a straight path before his feet oh God surely we love these Saints oh God we're just asking oh God that that brotherly kindness shall remain oh God especially the more we see the day approaching and the precious Holy Name Lord Jesus oh Jesus amen amen hallelujah thank you
