when the reading gathering is a man raised the Lord oh the joy the Lord is our strength amen let's take our Bibles here tonight I'd like to preach a little thought that I mentioned on Sunday I like to preach on doctrine the saves I like to preach on that tonight let's go to first Timothy kind of a little thought I felt like the Holy Spirit quick into my heart there so I believe it's first Timothy just a moment while I find a note here first Timothy 4:11 first Timothy 4:11 first Timothy 4:11 we like to read 11 down to 16 by the grace of the Lord be there say Amen these things command and teach let no man despise thy youth so this was the scripture before I was praying about deciding to pastor I just opened up my Bible the one time I've ever done that and my eyes fell right on that scripture right to verse 12 but no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believers in Word in conversation in charity and faith I'm sorry in spirit in faith in purity till i come give attendance to reading to exhortation to doctrine neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery meditate upon these things give thyself wholly to them that thou profiting may appear to all take heed unto thyself so he's talking to a preacher a young preacher named Timothy take heed to yourself and unto the doctrine so see there's really just one doctrine really there's just only one faith take heed to the one doctrine continue in them for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee if you can preach the right doctrine and live it and apply it to your life and preach it and the people receive it everybody's gonna be saved oh my what a responsibility church let's just bow our heads if you have a need on your heart let's make it known unto God by raising your hand Heavenly Father Lord we're true the word the climax here of the service Lord we've loved worshiping you we're so thankful you're coming back again Lord God Satan will be bound a thousand years will have no tempter then after you come back to earth again oh how we longed for that Lord how we get weary sometimes in the battle of over temptation but Lord as we heard on Sunday we've got keys Lord to be able to lock ourselves into Christ and and Lord flee resist the devil and he flees from us thank you for those keys or we're looking forward to that coming Lord prepares tonight Lord with this little message Lord it trust to be a blessing to the hearts of the people anoint me Lord anoint your people for thy glory in Jesus Christ name and the church said Amen god bless you just being seated praise the Lord I'd like to call this doctrine the saves it's kind of a simple thought here tonight I was preaching on Sunday under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and it just kind of got quickened to me a little bit here you know I just heard you know and I don't mean to be I'm not critical or anything about just her different preachers say you know they kind of kind of a harsh on doctrine you know the for example one that I heard is the message is not a doctrine it's a person and so that kind of saying we don't need doctrine we just need the person of Christ so I think I think some things need to be taught through the scripture and I think we'll understand that I want to get back to that quote because I I agree with it to a point but I don't think that is actually rightly divided I really don't think that's right Lee divided so we started here with our text Paul Paul thought the Lord was coming in his day how many know that he thought he was coming in his day John thought he was coming in his day Peter thought he was coming in his day all the saints thought he was coming his day and now Paul you know he's writing to Timothy and he tells Timothy give your attendance to reading exhortation and doctrine okay exhortation of course is communication with the Saints exhorting edifying communicating to the Saints and doctrine simply know what the word doctor means what word first comes your mind anybody got an idea kind of like that yeah it means instruction instruction the word doctrine literally means instruction in the Greek now that oughta maybe if you remember I don't I don't say you have to but when we were preaching to him the wisdom series with proverbs and Ecclesiastes and I'm still not done on that by the way I preached a whole message on instruction growing increasing understanding increasing instruction right so we'll get to that too but Paul's telling Timothy you must give yourself to doctrine pay attention to reading pay attention to speaking pay attention to instruction do not neglect the gift then he says take heed unto yourself and then he goes back to the doctrine watch your life make sure you live the right life and make sure you're instructing the people the right way and that's been my own desire is to instruct you to be ready for the rapture right if you're not called to the rapture though then mom I'm gonna instruct you to be as why era's good if a foolish virgin as you can be right because we love everybody you know we don't know who's who but we love everybody but instructing to be as wise as you can be and to be as much as a virgin as you can to Christ right be as pure as you can to Jesus Christ amen and I realize that brother Branham says there's three kinds of believers in every Church how many understand you got that they got quotes like that and we know Satan doesn't sit out there in the nomination so much he actually tries to target the real bride amen remember we heard that quote last week where where brother Branham said I said Branham Tabernacle will lose your strength how are they gonna lose their strength he said through gossip one person getting the wrong spirit on him and saying something bad about somebody else he said that's how they're gonna lose their strength but he said there'll be some saved out of Jeffersonville he said there'll be some going the rapture out of Texas or Colorado or New York and we see that by God's grace so I want to make sure I read that verse 16 again take heed unto thyself so preachers must really watch their own lives and unto the doctrine the instruction that they give the church continue in them for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee so a preacher must understand salvation before the people can the preacher has to be saved first in order to point people to salvation a preachers gotta be filled with the Holy Ghost first before he can point people to the Holy Ghost right he's got to be born again and so that's true as well with doctrine now let me go really read the the definition of doctrine it's the Greek word did a Scalia which means instruction doctrine learning teaching instruction doctrine was so important that Jesus's last Commission was go forth into all the world and do what teach nations to observe all that I command so doctrine and teaching are kind of go together you cannot teach the word without giving doctrine you can't you have to have boat you is the one in the same teaching is doctrine if you're teaching on how to pray teach you on how to fast teach you and how to receive the Holy Ghost there's in steps and instructions you must do in church of your spiritual even teaching how to get saved is a doctrine because what is it involved repentance how do we be saved repent and be baptized that's instruction that's doctrine so we do not even have salvation without a doctorate amen you can't you and I can't even get saved unless we have a doctrine that's true every sermon any preacher ever preached was doctrine hallelujah and see that's what I've heard preachers make it sound like it's not that's not true every sermon that was ever preached that told you to do something or or appointed you to do something to instruct in you anything was doctrine have you ever heard a sermon that did not instruct you to do anything I hope not I hope not here I know I heard someone I was in denomination to just about different things you know different politics and stuff you know movies and entertainment sports hopefully in the message hopefully in our message Church our sister churches hopefully every sermon you've heard has been instructing you to do something you know many times with our sermon church is instruction on how to live a more sanctified life its instruction how to repent or when to repent or what you need to repent of it's instruction in those areas every sermon has instruction in if it's a real sermon you can't you can't say well I'm just preaching salvation and there's no doctrine here wrong got the wrong idea you got a confusion right there has to be some instruction I want to be saying oh just what must I do just be saved does that sound like it's right no just believe what do you mean believe even the demons believe but what makes what makes our belief different from the demons because we repent and we be baptized right and we humble ourselves that we obey we obey the Word of God amen because we know what the Word of God instructs us to do praise God because hearers are not justified only but doers doers of the instruction that's been given to us so I hope I've already remoulded your whole thought about doctrine within the last 2 minutes of this sermon every sermon is doctrine and you cannot be saved you and I cannot be saved without doctrine program said doctrine is based on God's Word not on experience people can have experiences of everything he talks about going on the jungles and women sacrificing their babies with sincerity and witchdoctors drinking blood out of a skull and people saying they have all kinds of sensations and all these things he said that's not doctor and he said you can't base your doctrine on experiences it's got to be based upon the Word of God program said this and I found the quote in 1961 brother have said any man that has not a doctrine not a ministry hallelujah a preacher isn't even a preacher unless he's first got a doctrine that's what your prophet said and the church said that's what my prophet said you're not a preacher unless you have a doctrine some type of instruction if you're not getting up here to tell people what to do you're not even preaching you're supposed to point them and tell them what to do let's say you just get up here and you go over the events of the rapture you know the shop Boise Trump and it's really not you know and if you just tell the order of events or let's say you just tell the order of events of Jesus's resurrection or something like that that's wonderful but that's not really doctrine yet we got to bring it down to have you received the shout have you heard the shout and what do you need to do to hear the shout amen what steps do I need to do to know that I've really heard the shout and I trim my lamp and get in order and I go out to meet Jesus amen with my lamp trimmed in here what an instruction you see so yeah I guess you could have a message preacher you know just preach all these maybe all these types of Christ with Joseph and Boaz and all these you could do that and that's wonderful and just like the numbers like the numbers series I've been preaching that's wonderful to have all those numbers but how does that apply to you like we saw last week one thing that clearly applies to us is the complete worship of seven we can worship more with our complete hearts amen we should be worshiping with our complete hearts we should be under the sit number six we should be an anointed man or woman for the kingdom of God that's because that's the only real humans that are on the earth everybody else is just a beast that's anointed of the spirit of the devil but we are the real humans real were the real redeemed son of Adam's race amen hallelujah we have to fulfill that six and you look for the number five you must experience God's grace amen and we know the instruction to do that in acts 2:38 we know the instructions to receive God's grace but every preacher that doesn't have a doctrine doesn't have a preaching ministry and that's a direct quote by the way so you can look that up now I must say this to brother Ham said a church without a doctrine is just like a jellyfish hey brother Jes you're preaching too much doctrine you got to preach more on the word or you got to preach more on the gospel well fine I'll leave my doctrines behind and I'll just change our church to the jellyfish Church the jellyfish fellowship we're absent without a doctrine he said the church is just like a jellyfish and that's a direct quote it has no backbone so we've got to have backbone in it so my dad said you've got to have backbone and you don't have backbone without doctrine so what do we need doctrine and now also backbone but teeth also so you got a backbone you've gotta have teeth because the Church of God must eat the bread of life God give us a back mow so we can stand up against Satan and then give us teeth that we can chew and feast on this word amen glory oh we don't you too much doctrine you're too much instruction Oh nonsense that's either a prideful spear ignorant spirit or some type of other spear critical spirit maybe something like that a church without a doctrine is a jellyfish last time I checked Eagles lambs doves lions all got backbones is that right church hallelujah we gotta have a backbone we got to know what we believe we got a know where we stand number without the fivefold ministry you'll be carried around about every wind of false doctrine carried from this idea of that idea of that idea we need a solid backbone Church that's not a jellyfish amen that knows where they stand that believes every word and lives by it amen they have instructions how to get ready for the rapture praise the Lord you want the Holy Ghost pray up and he gives all the steps so one thing for sure we can say our instructions are pretty easy last time I put together that telescope I'll tell you about is about 50 steps instructions well the Holy Ghost is pretty easy repent me baptize pray until you get the Holy Ghost that's pretty easy Church pretty easy instruction manual and the church said this isn't a fool will not air in this instruction amen a fool Isaiah 35 said a fool won't miss the way of holiness and the highway of holiness praise God the way of holiness because we know a highway has two lanes but the way of holiness is going up and the fools go down right a fool not err foolish version will not air this even though understand virgin to the word now in that series on wisdom and which I'm still working on proverbs 1:7 the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction so now we know if these these things are not repented of now we know what kind of message churches they are if they say they don't need more doctrine they're foolish virgin because foolish despise instruction fools despise it that's proverbs 1:7 and church even if we can we can preach all the doctor we want but if we don't apply to our lives we're just as foolish praise God or just as foolish if we don't become better Christians through our services we're just as foolish as any other person hearing it doesn't make us justified but doing makes us justified amen proverbs 4:13 take fast hold on instruction so that means a real strong grip hold on to what you've been instructed to do from the Word of God by the Holy Spirit hold on to it with a tight grip let her not go for she is thy life now now we're starting to get somewhere when you hold on to instruction I got to do this this this so please God when you hold on to that you're close to life now you can't separate instruction from life instruction leads to life praise the Lord a few years ago when I taught third grade we were given instructions on how to bring life to the with the chickens eggs and the incubator I think they bought us an incubator and I had to follow directions to bring forth the chickens out of the incubator if I followed directions it brought forth life amen hallelujah and we don't want incubator chickens here we want a real eagle egg that's been under the real mother eagle amen and the dead because they take turns dad will sit on for a while mom will go out and eat then they'll switch and mom will fly out or dad will fly out and go get something to eat if they switch they take turns on the Eagle but you see instruction brings life hallelujah prouder 6:23 for the commandment is a lamp and the law is light and reproofs of instruction are the way of life are those scriptures not coming up buddy are they is it not working okay yeah if you pull them up there that might help by God's grace so for she's my life so instruction is she's my life and proper 6:23 and the reproofs of instruction are the way of life that's proverbs 6:23 proverbs 4:13 6:23 the wise love to be instructed fools despise it preacher don't tell me what to do like I don't know already sounds very foolish doesn't it fools despise instruction they can't be taught my brother said a mule can't be taught anything new but a thoroughbred can be taught something praise the Lord we need to be able to come to church and be taught and instructed on the Word of God amen that's just plain Bible instruction doctrine the wise love doctrine fools hate it they spot despise it praise the Lord let's go to John 7:15 if you got your Bible John 7:15 I mentioned this earlier is everybody feeling okay tonight already feeling fine praise the Lord I'm feeling good Robert 7:15 and the Jews marveled saying how know of this man letters having never learned jesus answered them and said my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me huh Jesus Christ had doctrine the Lord Jesus Christ peace preached doctrine yeah and church he said it wasn't even his it was borrowed amen it was loaned it was taught from his Heavenly Father hallelujah amen mark 1118 here's what real doctrine produces mark 1118 this is why no doctrine so important I've never ever thought once in my life doctrine wasn't important in fact I've always known true doctrine proves you're in the right false doctrine proves you're in the wrong mark 11 18 now at this point Jesus had already cursed the fig tree with the spoken word and then he comes in this is the second time he's cleanse the temple member he cleaned it at the beginning of his ministry and he cleaned it at the end Alpha and Omega amen they getting it in hallelujah so we know God's gonna clean the church at the end for us to praise the Lord we all need a good cleaning out that's if you want to be in the rapture now I like to be in the rapture Lord clean us out so he's already exercised all these spoken word and all this and then a verse verse 18 and the scribes and the chief priests heard it and saw how they might destroy him for they feared him because all the people was astonished at his doctrine this guy instructs us to do pretty strange things get out of the money other church get all the other lakhs of days ago spirits out of the church get all the greed out of the church and he thought it so much he drove him out with a rope and cord praise God what kind of doctrine is this guy he really wants a clean church and they're astonished at his doctrine praise God but he didn't get his doctrine on his own he got it from the father and Church that's what we can say too we're not preaching brother branham's doctrine we're preaching Jesus Christ doctrine that he gave to brother Branham let me understand that it wasn't like program thought of this thought of these new thoughts and then it was written on the Bible no brother Branham was restoring what the original doctrine wardi was amen he was restoring the faith of the Apostolic fathers jesus said in John 8:28 I do nothing of myself as I speak the fog I only speak what the father has taught me amen in John 12 jesus said my father gave me commandment what to speak everything Jesus taught was from the father in John 14 10 he said the words I speak unto you I speak not of myself a man in John 14 24 he said the word he here is not mine but the fathers that sent me now go to mark chapter 1 here's here's the one I was looking for this is the one mark chapter 1 1 21 this is where I cast out demons in Capernaum in the synagogue there's a man with an unclean spirit don't we have that today too people come to church with unclean spirits in the church god help us to cast everyone out by the Spirit of God amen all right we don't want lying spirits we know what lustful spirits we don't want critical spirits we don't want prideful spirits and we cast them out in Jesus Christ's name Amen and we've seen it recently like I said with the Critical spirits I've seen God do it amen God does that and that's the power of his doctrine amen glory mark 1:21 now through 28 now he said I'm gonna skip ahead verse 25 and Jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of him and when the unclean spirit had torn him he cried with a loud voice he came out of him and they were all amazed in so much they questioned among themselves saying what new thing is this what new doctrine is this casting out Devils is a doctrine in the church said to operate in the power of God you must know the instructions of God like bro man taught us before somebody can be here they've got to confess their sins or that Devils not going to move what is that that's instruction that's doctrine how many want the doctrine of God amen what new dot we ever seen preachers cast out demons like this before what new doctrine is this this is the doctrine of their heavenly Father come down to earth in his earthly saying hallelujah and now he sends us forth just as the father sent him forth fill them with the Holy Ghost and send them forth as I have my father sent me so send I you praise God and let me sit on this church so God has sent you out to your field each one of you have a field of ministry right Church and he has sent you the same way if you filled only ghosts he sent you the same way to take the Word of God take the power of God take the doctrine of God and manifest it in your life hey man ha ha ha thank you Jesus glory for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits and they do obey Him what new doctrine is this so power and doctrine go hand in hand I hope that makes sense does that help everybody ok I hope so by the grace of the Lord let me read a few quotations brother Branham was kind of a talking to a Catholic priest lately he said the mr. Branum are you a non Catholic or Protestant I said a Protestant he said then you protest us I said no sir I do not protest the people it's the church the doctrine of the church remember Timothy said be careful or Paul told Timothy be careful there'll be doctrines of devils Devils can teach really slick right Devils can make it sound so sweet like you're in the bride age here in the Millennium already and there's nothing you've never yet and you can't even sinner or you've got a second soul now and now you can put away your old life and get a new one and it's alright oh it sounds so slick and it's so sweet but it's a lie from the pit of hell amen doctrines of devils now we are in the bride age in your soul but we're still living in Laodicea that's right he said are you then you call yourself a Baptist or Presbyterian no sir just a Christian well where do you form your own form of doctrine to be a Christian you have to have a basic form of doctrine I said that's true brother says to be a Christian you've got to have a basic form of doctrine a head you are so you're not even a Christian without Doctor and amen nor are you a preacher without a doctrine you can't be a Christian without instruction and you can't be a preacher without instruction that's scorned a brother branham of course the Bible too he said that's true he said I get my form of instruction it's the Bible well that's the history of the Catholic Church I said the apostles were Catholics he said yes sir I said all right I'm going to admit that that's right I said then why don't you say stay also with the scripture he said you see Christ getting the church power to change the scripture anytime they want to now that's where that devil slipped right in there they said oh the scripture is our doctrine but Christ gave the church the power to change the scripture and brother Graham picks it up he picks up that lie he said well then you've changed and you've got it what you got today he said then you've changed and got it what you got today he said yes sir I said then I want to ask you something then Christ must not be pleased with it because of on upon the first church he poured out the Holy Ghost that he healed the sick raise the dead cast out Devils and done great mighty miracles under the doctrine of the first Catholic Church and it hasn't been seen in the Catholic Church since they changed the doctrine hey hey brother Branham says the the original apostolic faith is called the doctrine of the first Catholic Church that's a great wave came to bring back to us the doctrine of the first universal Church we are a Catholic Church we are a universal Church but only Universal through the blood of Jesus Christ and the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you don't have that or the either one of those a brother of Christ the Baptist all he goes you're not yet a part of the universal Church you might get it on the day of judgment you might get in as a sheep gets in right at that the white throne doesn't you might get in for being into the Bride of Christ but until then you're not really a part of it only those who are born again only those who have the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ that's the universal Church oh that's right amen tells us this he said I do not agree with organization because they would say we believe this with a comma he says I'm sorry he said well we believe this period that's all wrong see if you end your doctor with a comma we believe this Plus as much as God wants to add to it but when you say we believe this period and that's all then you shut God right out of it see and that's the way the organization's do they end it with the period so every denomination ends it with a period and God can't reveal any more after that now jerks we got to be careful the message we have we we have all of our doctrines but how many know there's going to be a revelation come and program calls it's the revelation of the rapture he said the bride is waiting for the revelation of the rapture there's a rapture to come it's a revelation he also calls it the latter rain that's the revelation we're waiting for is the revelation of the latter rain that will change our bodies in the moment and a twinkling of an eye so after all my rapture doctrine shout voice Trump changed it's wink of an eye glorified body theophany where you get up after all that I put a comma and I'm waiting for latter rain amen I'm waiting for faith that falls to receive it and then to be changed on Eluga I'm waiting for that I don't put a beard because I'm waiting for a ladder rain face hey man that's exactly right now I hope you understand that you got to balance that statement - for example with water baptism let's make it real simple I believe the Lord Jesus Christ baptism is the only Bible baptism comma well I don't know if you need to come on that one we might take a period on that you understand what I'm saying what could be added it you and I we have searched the book of Acts there's no other baptisms other than the Lord Jesus Christ so understand you understand what I'm saying like you know we don't want to put a period on God but there's some doctrines where there's gonna there's not gonna be any any change to that understand but there are doctrines that we need more revelation on right like the shout voice Trump I know for sure the voice and I know for sure the Trump because they haven't happened yet and if they haven't happened yet then we still need more revelation of them praise God in other words we need to be in the spirit of prophecy when they come to pass and that will only come by staying with all the word that God has revealed to us amen so hope you understand that I agree we must end our doctrine with a comma but we got to be careful what we mean by that oh well maybe there'll be a new baptism and and we'll all have a new water baptism when brother Branham is raised back and he flies around the world in a jet knocked yeah that's false you see you see how you got to be careful you want to be careful with that statement too we we just need the wisdom of God now this quote applies to organization right so every move of God must keep an open heart for more revelation of God's Word amen you and I let's keep an open heart for more revelation of God's Word especially in our daily lives for example if you have a gift of divine healing you and I must be open with the comma to receive more instruction on divine healing so we can grow in our ministries they men or like a mother or a father well I know all everything about being a mother period no don't what appeared there put a comma there God may reveal something to you that you maybe never heard before or I'm the perfect father I'm a perfect pastor period I know everything about it no put a comma there so we can grow and learn and we can be humble about it and say God perhaps there's something I'm missing I know there must be if the rapture had taken place I need more you momentum says this in question is an answer 61 program said the Lord gave me a vision remember when he went out in Chicago before 300 Trinitarian preachers and they all agreed to all wanted tapes on water baptism and they agreed to come down to the tabernacle but they never came well they have said he the Lord told me and gave me a vision and told me where we'd be and what to do I said there before 300 Trinitarian ministers and I said now if I am so wrong in this doctrine of water baptism some of you men stand up here and show me where I'm wrong by the scriptures without your textbook if there is no such thing as a serpent seed or something like that then I've been teaching just come here and show me by the scriptures nobody move rather have said it was a quietest group of preachers you've ever heard in your life this prove and disprove water baptism this proofs over and seen by the Bible crickets okay good there's nothing that there's no scripture that disproves water baptism in Lord Jesus Christ there's no scripture he says nobody move because it can't be done haha that's true not to be different but it's just the truth it's the word no one can debate that that's the Word of God no one can do it Church do you realize that nobody can obey our doctrine our doctrine is so sound it's nothing but thus saith the Lord amen there is no debate about it it's the word and there's only one word there's only one faith there's only one doctrine and we've got it amen there's no debate now they'll debate with us but as long as we stand on the word there's no debate about it because you add to it you can't take away from it and we believe just what's in here that's it hallelujah program said it can't be proven wrong the serpent seed cannot be proven wrong oh so we say I approve brother branham wrong I approve the serpent seed wrong I prove that Godhead wrong it can't be done you're gonna see fella or sister here to see it cannot be done you can't prove God's revelation wrong you're not going to prove the Bible wrong because jesus said thy Word is truth that's right now let's look this year brother branham said he came back to restore the original Pentecostal preaching without doctrine does that sound right no he said he came back to restore the original Pentecostal doctrine so I don't know what people crow I don't like that word I don't know what their current about saying we don't need doctrine I don't understand that they must have missed these quotes and we're just giving the benefit of doubt they must have missed the quote but what I have said in Messiah 1961 how was the book of Acts roast are reading it he says a light before the going out this open door that said before the church watch and see if it doesn't come some of these days God will send the Elijah just as certain I'm standing in this pulpit he will send and that Elijah will shake the people right back to the original Pentecostal doctrine I'd like to use one of you in as example but I'm not but I like to come over and shake somebody but the man said his ministry is to shake you to the original Picasso doctor a man to shake people so they'll kind of wake up a little bit from their slumber and realize I've been instructed to rock in the whole time I need to be instructed the way the Apostles instructed them amen the man said that came to shake his ministry came to shake you back to Pentecostal instruction oh yeah hey man I said like this God shake me again amen shake me sir I've been fooling with the doctrine every word of it every chapter every verse every line amen shake me enjoy the Pentecostal doctrine is in my heart and soul praise God hey man shake me up move change things in my right do what you must do until my doctor matches the Bible amen and many of us have experienced that how many lives how many of your lives have been shaken by hardships trials tests and shaking you to get right with the Word of God happens to me all the time brother Aaron I'm wrong on this I'm wrong Lynette God's got to shake me to get me back right but I love him for it that proves I'm one of his children if you can meet if you can't be corrected you're a bastard child but all those that he loves those he corrects and our doctrine cannot be proven wrong can't be debated in the Feast of the trumpets now I don't understand all these statements but I'm just gonna read the ones that I do and between the six trumpet and the seventh trumpet there's a prophet to appear before the Gentiles to call the people back to the original Pentecostal doctrine and the two witnesses of revelation 11 appear to the Jews to send them to Jesus while the church is being taken up all of them prophets amen the word Lord cannot be broken brother branham's ministry was calling us back to the original Pentecostal doctrine I have a few quotes where brother Branham connects the message to doctrine now before I read those let me go over that statement again I've heard it said the message is not a doctrine it's a person well it depends which quote you use in the rapture 1965 brother Branham said the message is the scriptures that God is presently fulfilling right now the message is the scriptures that God is fulfilling right now so in one sense the message is doctrine it's the doctrine as the teaching that God's doing right now is God telling us to go build a natural ark right now and float down the Nile like brother himself if Moses would have tried that it would have been out of season it's the dot so the message is the doctrine now you might say the message is the Holy Ghost inspired doctrine you might say that a member of brother is not the message because I said this before and program said it he said I may not do it but this message will forerun the second coming of Jesus Christ and he said this message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world the message introduces Jesus Christ the message introduces Jesus Christ the message introduces Jesus Christ so what is the message it's the word for this hour it's the instruction for this hour praise God I hope that's plain now I've gone I've gone to this this before and maybe you have you caught it before I hope you caught it before sometimes people make every quote brother Branham said they call it the message it's not he was a man when brother Branham preached the Bible that's the message when brother Branham said my daughter's going to take my place as a prophet that was not the message or when he said Billy Paul was my Joseph that was not the message okay are you with me church that's not the message the message is the Word of God that God's fulfilling today and that message introduces us to Jesus the Holy Ghost amen yes that's the right understanding so I would say the message is the scripture the the biblical doctrine that God is fulfilling right now and it points us to Jesus Christ can I can you give me a second let me pull that quote this message will introduces Jesus Christ to the world is that okay can somebody say Amen so I know I'm not wasting your time I think I heard - okay praise the Lord I just want everyone be fully assured of this here all right I know it's in the look away to Jesus yeah here it is program said I do believe that we're so close to the rapture that would never die was old age that's see every believer always think the rapture is gonna take place in their life he said yeah at 54 years old I'll never die with old age until he's here brother man thought it would be before he got old and died that that's because that's because that's you know you know why they feel that because Jesus is living inside of them and because he's inside of them I feel like he's gonna come I feel like he's gonna come the rest one's gonna come because a part of them is already here yeah that's why we feel like he's gonna come in all day because a part of him is already in us amen see unless I'm shot or killed or something another some way kill just old age won't kill me until he's come and I believe that now remember 2009 was one hundred year anniversary and I want to say this I've never said that before but according to Scripture according to what he said 30 years ago 33 years ago on the river down there in 1933 rather what he said everything has happened just exactly I may not do it but this message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world as John the Baptist was for one to send the the first coming so is the message to forerun the second coming and John said behold the lamb of God which takes away the sin the world see so it's it's paralleled in every way and I know it the message will go on and the message is going on in Bride of Christ fellowship amen how do think the message is going on today not jellyfish fellowship but Bride of Christ fellowship amen because you don't have a church unless you got doctrine and you don't have a preacher unless you got doctrine so that's paragraph 52 look away to Jesus was that helpful by God's grace I hope that helps somebody now here's the quotes about him he makes it sound like message and doctrine are one in the same trying to do God a service in 1965 November 27th we have false impersonators rise up what's they to do to deceive the Bible said they would as generous and Jambres withstood Moses so will these in the last day see they do the same thing come right along impersonating it just exactly be careful watch the doctrine of the Bible how are you going to know Janus and RAM jammers you got to watch the doctrine of the Bible what's the message that follows those signs still the same old school message he said forget it so nervous no matter how many miracles the nominations have watch the doctrine behind it watch the message behind it and if it's the same old word same old Billy Graham or Roberts thing speaking tongues just be saved to live a good life if it's the same old thing forget about it look for someone who's got the message of the hour amen let's tell you not just live a good life or try to get rich and be prosperous all these things but the other thing is that the real message is get ready to meet him we're going in the rapture we're meeting him in the air ain't it that's different Billy Graham didn't preach that all robbers didn't preach that brother William man go and preach that and that's what we preach amen that's the message it's a different message it's not the same message as those brothers preached spiritual food and new season July 1865 but the Lord gave me what I should do in my message but then he said do the work of evangelist make full proof of your ministry for the hour arrive when they will not endure sound doctrine so that was brother Rams message was to preach the word to preach sound doctrine sister got here it just blows my mind sometimes people say we don't need doctor the message is doctrine because the his message was to preach sound doctrine apostolic doctrine Bible doctrine rapture doctrine Holy Ghost doctrine amen that's the message instructions on how to marry the right way right how to baptize the right way be filled with only ghosts how to use gifts how do all these things that's the message instructions on how to please God amen well Graham said if that hasn't come now what his commission has come to pass he says every church denomination has turned me down can you imagine I believe in not could turn down by a few churches he's turned on by every denomination they wouldn't endure sound doctrine so program says my message is sound doctrine but after their own lusts though bring their own teachers in and they'll be turning the fables and they will do great things that exploit like Janice and Jambres that would Sid Moses but their folly will be made manifest praise the Lord here's another one brother Branham is ordaining brother Capps as a preacher in 1965 it's April 18th he said that's bow our heads and pray for brother Cavs dear God the Temple Post has moved again and has seen the spirit of the quickening life working in our brother I pray God as he feels this from above that says that he must go we lay hands on him as your elders lord and give him the right hand of fellowship and lay our hands upon him and pass the blessings of God upon him that you'll anoint his lips his thinking his entire being and may take this message of the gospel to every crack and corner that's your calling to it granite Lord give it we give you our brother as a servant of yours in the name of Jesus Christ Frances amen he says preach the word my young brother be in season and out of season reprove rebuke with all on suffering and doctrine god bless you brother so brother Branham ordains preachers and tells them take the message and preach the right doctrine amen it's one the same doctrine and the message are one of the same true doctrine sound doctrine he says with all long-suffering and doctrine pray God all right let me read one more I got a couple more this is from 1965 this C does not air with a shock just about okay it's just about six months after that I had my first baptism down here on the river when the light came down in 1933 it's Spring Street many of you people what might want to go down and take a look at it at Spring Street in water right the riverfront and there's where the angel Lord appeared in public first and at two o'clock one afternoon and the voice came from it saying as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming your message were forerun the second coming this is 30 years later and Here I am tonight still proclaiming that message and around the world it's went and I'm glad to be back in my hometown tonight to represent this Lord Jesus Christ that I still love with all my heart each day he grows sweeter than he was the day before does anybody else have that testimony here tonight does Jesus grow sweeter each day than he was the day before oh that's beautiful he's 60s 56 years old he said each day Jesus gets sweeter than he was yesterday I can say amen to that I read Psalms 22 this morning I cried like a baby in my prayer closet Jesus said I'm a worm I'm not even a man he said all my bones they stare at me I thought oh God if Jesus was a worm what am i and I was getting out of my car at work and I saw a little worm there I thought man that's me I'm lower than that because Jesus said I have no I'm not a man I'm a worm because all the sin was placed upon him his bones severed him so he's on the cross and he can see his bones and they're staring at him ripped to shreds why'd he do it he did it to love you and I he did it to save you and I and I go my prayer closet I could hardly I just got to cover my face because of God's holy presence because how great and how loving is Who am I I'm nothing who is Jesus Christ he's God amen hallelujah the god of this message i'li the god of this holy ghost' doctrine that we preach amen each day he grows sweeter than he was the day before I've never changed one iota in my doctrine he said I preached the same message since 1933 I've never changed one iota in my doctrine the first thing I started with I still believe the same thing tonight he's the same yesterday today and forever and I can say amen to that I started preaching in 2004 I haven't changed one iota my doctrine I still preach the same thing brother Branham preached there might be some little miners there I'm working on and trying to understand the Feast of the trumpets and all these things like that but I've kept the faith with all the major doctrines why because there's only one doctrine amen that's the doctrine of the Bible and we don't change it one iota that's right he's the same yesterday today and forever now I have a message that I'm responsible for amen okay so I have a whole lot of Scripture but I'm gonna try to bring this down too close here here let me read a few more the indictment 1963 remember I said that on Sunday what were the preachers indicted for their false doctrine program said and today I indict this bunch of ordained ministers in their Creed's and denominations they are crucifying to the people the very God that they claim they love and serve crucifying Jesus Christ afresh the ministers I indict these ministers in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ upon their doctrine remember indictment is a true accusation it's a proven accusation so preachers can be proven to be wrong rightly accused because of what what they taught about the Bible what they instructed the people to do that's why I say don't put TV in your home you better not that's an instruct setting a wicked thing before your eyes if you got a smartphone you better not put evil things in front of your eyes or else it's time to get rid of that thing it's become an evil thing to you praise the Lord that's instruction don't you do it you'll never be born again and taking all the trash out of your house amen now I can say a few things here maybe I think I will their parent says usually when that happened that's God telling me to do it but recently that we've seen some people fall away from the message I've seen some people personal friends and things like that fall away from the message and come to find out years later after he's all the all these years it looks like they've been sincere I come to find out after all these years certain people in the family would let TV and movies filthy movies into their home and watch him on the weekends and then after all these years fall the way I'm talking just like Lion King or Disney movies which are filthy anyway and the church said okay good praise the Lord don't bring Disney in your home right I'm talking about and one particular and that the reason I'm saying this is because I've talked to the person about it and they repented of it after I preached on it so I know what I'm talking about I'm talking about the movie Titanic where they a woman strips down and she's completely naked on the camera there and men and women and women and men making love and all kinds of what is that that's adultery that's seeds of hell that's seeds of sin and yet claiming to be in the message for all these years and then we come to find out recently they fall away for the message and this whole time demons have been living in their homes and for so many years brother bill they could they had brother Bruce so for so many years they could pretend to be so sanctimonious they could even shout and scream and cry brother William for so many years you thought oh these people are the examples of the church come to find out demons have been dwelling in their home all these years well no wonder they can go and take off their skirts and put on short shorts no wonder they knew that because demons have been laying their trash has been rotting in their hole for decades and they didn't do nothing about it what we need is a clean outhouse that's unleavened with saying Amen that's the only way the Holy Ghost is going to get into your home if it's it all cleaned out people can act pious it's like the Pharisees and said I believe the message I believe the message the only way you believe the message is if you believe in the doctrine of the Scriptures amen and you don't take any sin you don't win anything come in your home but you live godly righteous and holy and the doctrine you become part of the doctrine amen the doctrine lives in you praise God amen and I know that from personal experience from talking to people on the phone at the altar about coming up for prayer I know exactly what I'm talking about so if you let dirty shows come in shame on you you're not gonna be born again that's called instruction get the trash get all the trash out of the house you got sexy clothes to own your home sisters get it out Wright brothers took out those old dirty magazines old videos you like of simple things old dirty music get that out of your home you'll never move on with God until everything's out that's the instruction of the message of the hour and the church said that's the Bible unleavened feast there can be no leaven in the home so I just thought I hope that was a help to somebody hope that just just trying to just try to let you know the reality of it you can you can fool people for decades but pretty soon by their fruits you'll know them and like I preached here a while ago if people like and I preached it right to that person's face I just felt letting the Holy Spirit's one of those times I just felt like John the Baptist growing up right under prophets Herod's face and say you're the man because this person told me about it right before the sermon that they're watching the Titanic and all these sexy movies like that and I felt that righteous signa nation look I'm gonna preach it anyway I don't care what they say I don't care who they are this is God's Word we're talking about here this is the message I walked right up in their face and preached it I said if you watch dirty movies the sex on them and all these things like that you're probably not even saved I said because lot was saved but when he looked at this homosexuality the Bible said it grieved him and yet these people that say they believe the message they watch sex scenes and it don't even grieve them they're probably not even saved and yet acting like they're saved acting like their leaders acting like their there's somebody to look up to nonsense righteousness holiness godliness a love for purity a love for sanctification a love for clean out the house a love for an unloving home that's what we need today jesus said he that loves me is he that keeps my commands amen glory and I know I hop on that a lot but I got to I'm trying to cheat I'm trying to keep the church clean I'm trying to keep my life clean I'm trying to take heed to myself that you and I both be saved and I did that one time I family you know some other family was at a service this was different service and I knew my family walked in there with makeup on their face sister Naomi sometimes it's hard to be a preacher and I knew it and sometimes it's hard to when you're family sitting right there and the Holy Spirit puts on my heart to ball out their makeup and I'm back there in the office studying Lord are you sure my family's out there with the message or I'm sorry my family's out there with makeup on and short skirts sure you want me to preach this but about the time I get the call out start tapping the foot pretty soon to get under the anointing I don't fear anybody after that I got a wrestle it out in there and I've said it to it's a Jezebel spirit to wear makeup it shows there something false on the inside it's a false face it's not even real I just stand there and spit in the family and pretty soon part of it after the servers that come up and my brother or the different ones the families took my hand and they say everything you said was absolutely the truth I said hallelujah now do they change their ways you bet they didn't but they couldn't argue they couldn't argue with this doctrine amen because you can't argue with it I preached on tattoos and my family members got a tattoo he said you're right Jesse I'm wrong and that the the the other children are telling them see dad you should not I got a tattoo a tattoo is a sin in the mouths of babes thou has perfected praise Amen God give us a backbone amen honey what a backbone for Christ let me try to close this magis I love the Lord amen I know you do too or else you wouldn't be here let me close the only way you would know Jesus's first coming was by doctrine because there was no specific portion in the Bible in the Old Testament that had all the details the details were not just all in one book the details were scattered all over you had some details in Malachi you had some in Genesis you had some in Habakkuk right yet some in Haggai Zechariah Isaiah the Deuteronomy you have all these details the only way you would have been recognized Christ coming was to take all those scriptures and putting together and a doctrine and teach and be able to say he's front he was born in Bethlehem right he's born of a virgin Isiah and put all the other put all of them together and have a doctrine have instruction and then you would know this is the very Christ and the same things true in his second coming you got to put 1st Thessalonians 4 together with 1st Corinthians 15 you got to put that together with Malachi 4 or 5 and 6 Elisha coming before the end of the world you got to put it together with Revelation 10 7 even brother branham's ministry you have to have a doctrine on it you have to show instruction how Jesus said Elisha truly shall come first and restore all things it takes doctrine it's not just one scripture where you oh now I can prove with the random this is brother as ministry know well I can prove the rapture because I don't one scripture no you need a doctor and you need instruction from all parts of the Bible that all line up and you can say this is the true teaching this all proves this instructs us to know Jesus Christ's second coming praise the Lord now I'm turn to Matthew 13 I got a couple more things to say and you can better believe I'm going to that meeting there with the sisters and I'm ready to ball out some sin there - by God's grace on a first take heat of myself to make sure my heart's right but I know one thing if people are cold and lukewarm and on fire we it's pretty simple according to our doctrine it's pretty a simple Accord on instruction what's going on sin sin has got into the house sin something dead has come into a house that's why people get lukewarm get cold on God backslide sin some death some trash has been allowed to come into their house and they didn't get rid of it don't you just love the simplicity of the gospel it's so simple okay it's just so simple God makes it so simple so we don't miss it now Matthew 13 this thought just came to me I've been writing in my free time I've been writing a text for another book about the twelve Bible mysteries that program talked about and serves us at the end time but I believe it's the yeah it's the sixth yes the sixth the six mystery in Matthew 13 45 remember there's a Sevenfold mystery of the kingdom of God and that Sevenfold mystery reveals all the truths of revelations about the kingdom of heaven the sixth one is the pearl-grey price again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls who when he had found one pearl great price went and sold all that he had and bought it so this parable speaks of seeking so he was seeking many goodly pearls see that he was seeking many things he was seeking all these different things but when he found the one pearl of great price he stopped seeking all that and he saw the one pearl of great price see with doctrine with doctor we've got to seek one thing we've got to seek what does God want for us what is God instructing for us right now we're so tempted because Google is like a search engine and everything we want to find out go to Google go to Google go to Google but God saying you got to stop searching for other pearls and you got to find the one pro great price and seek after that if my life is there's questions about my life there's questions about this questions about that we've got to stop seeking for other pearls and we got to find the one pearl of great price the instruction of God's word amen see the six parable is about what you search for the fifth parable is about possessions he went and sold all his possessions to get that treasure in the field so the sixth one is about what are we searching for and this is the age of the search engines of Google Google and Bing and all these other ones that you search for this is the age of searching goodly things searching all these things but we've got to search God's word for the instruction for this day instruction search for God what am I supposed to what do I do next I've done this this this what do I do next search for the instruction it's right here in the Word of God here's my last quote I hope you like it I wonder if you've been waiting for this quote you'll find I guess we'll find out after this we'll see who shouts amen the loudest in 1961 brother Epson you must be born again but man said this now I thought it'd be a good idea maybe that I would lay aside my New Year's message until tonight so he's preaching on New Year's Eve the morning and go back in some Sunday school scriptures and take a text and talk for a while on one of the most vital subjects that I know it's a doctrine that our Lord first preached oh thank you Jesus amen who knows Jesus's first doctrine that he ever preached does anybody know Jesus first doctrine just say it out loud anybody not well I stumped the class tonight I did think I can do that i stumped the class but read said one of the I'm going to preach on one of the most vital subjects that I know of in the Bible it's a doctrine that our Lord first preached the first doctrine that Jesus Christ ever preached who knows what it is do you know now I like how you're trying sorry but no that's not it I appreciate the effort he said now God bless his word and I want to take the subject this morning on Jesus Christ first doctrine what would be the first thing Jesus Christ would ever preach for instruction city and sister you must be born again but have said the first doctrine of Jesus was you must be born again that was his first doctrine Jesus let's send our feet amen the first doctrine ever preached by God himself in flesh was you must be born again and appreciate to a Sanhedrin preacher named Nicodemus and he still don't understand it now how am I gonna go back in my mom's belly let's see maybe that skin stretch is really big I'm not sure maybe there's a way to stretch I don't know and Jesus like are you are you serious you're a master in Israel and you think you're gonna enter into your ma your mother's womb again so what is have to give him instruction he says verily I say unto you except ye repent which kind of goes along with it you must be born to get so that's the first instruction Jesus doctor you must repent amen we must repent say we're alone turn from our evil ways not seek to be involved in the things of the world but turn from the things of the world and be fully involved in the things of Christ you must be born again his first doctrine and church let me say this if you haven't caught it yet without Jesus first doctrine you're not going in the rapture but with Jesus first right with his first doctrine if you receive Jesus first doctor you've got a ticket to the rapture we're not going in the rapture without doctrine and people are saying well we don't need all the doctrine the message is not a doctrine oh you're not getting in the rapture without the doctrine of Christ is that right Church I guess I just got a little bit uh was it wrath and indignation about that because I love doctrine there's nothing I love more than the doctrine of Jesus Christ because it's instruction for me to the way of life instruction leads to life and what is life the Holy Ghost high powers we already read in Proverbs keep instruction and you'll go in the way of the Holy Ghost life amen Oh hallelujah I felt the anointing all week this week hallelujah I knew this is the Word of God this is the truth we need God's doctrine brother bearers brought us back to the Pentecostal doctrine and without that doctrine we are not going in the rapture how many thank the Lord for that let's give the Lord balls a little Bramson is one of the most vital subjects is the baptism of the holy ghost that's the ticket to be a part of his wife be born again not be born to the flesh and water again but be born of the Holy Ghost I hope this sermon has been a help I hope you see this is doctrine that's saved God's doctrine is doctrine that saves you fills you and ultimately raptures you okay now church there's about a thousand quotes on doctrine I didn't get I didn't even scratch the surface of it I just tried to limit it because there's so many I tried message doctrine or apostolic dr. and all these things like that my message but I hope I hope everybody can see if you can see that we need doctrine can you give me a Amen praise the Lord and I'm not speaking evil of anybody here tonight but I'm giving warnings especially those that would say evil things against God's doctrine and I think it's just a misunderstanding kind of like that summer we preached on the jeffersonville right sweet people but our doctrine only comes from this word of God and then the true test of it for right is if we love everybody anyway right program said I'd rather have the right spirit than the right doctrine but guess what we can have both Paul had both I've heard people say the whole time they say well I'd rather have the right sphere than the right doctor making it sound like they don't even know the right doctrine Church we know the right doctrine we got to have the right spirit to the right spirit and the right doctrine and if you've got the Holy Ghost you will have both because the Holy Ghost leads you into all truth you can't say well I got the Holy Ghost but I don't quite understand doctrine you can't say that because the Holy Ghost guides you to the right doctrine I hope everybody can see it so they could everybody see it tonight I've tried to just be real plain I just tried to be real straight with you I hope you can see the importance of doctrine by the grace of God I wonder how many times I said that word in this sermon doctrine but my prayers that it was no matter how many times I said it that it was written upon your hearts that the doctor yet you follow the doctrine of the Apostles [Music] forgive me I got one more scripture see I'm a pastor I can do that second John 9 and 11 bear with me he pulled up their second John 9 11 9 10 11 whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God you don't even have God unless you have the right doctrine he that abideth in the doctrine of Christ he hath both the father and the son you can't have Christ you can't have the father without the right doctrine if there come any of you and bring not this doctrine receive him not in your house what about all that love I rather have the right love right spirit the right doctrine what about all that love see it's got to be balanced out we got to balance out all these quotes because this scripture says if you don't have the right doctrine don't even let him in your house somebody keeps preaching that returned ministry stuff or whatever whatever they preach two souls or whatever they preach don't even let them in your house and look you can say I've got the right spirit because the Bible says so I love them but you're not coming to my house if you're trying to promote false doctrine you're trying to bring Devils into my house I love you I've got the right spirit neither bid him Godspeed for he that biddeth him God speed is the partaker of his evil deeds [Music] I'll stop right there we're so thankful for the original doctrine by God's grace let's just thank the Lord thank you Lord we want to abide in the doctrine we want Christ we want the father we want the Holy Ghost amen the one person of God help us to dwell on this doctrine then we dwell in you amen Heavenly Father Lord we just bow our heads tonight we're grateful for the word of God Lord you know my heart I've got nothing against anybody but I've got something against false doctrines that would say we don't need doctrine and yet we've just read your word where it saves the preacher and the hears and we don't even have you we don't have the Holy Ghost unless we got the doctrine of the Holy Ghost the message thank you Lord Father I'm unworthy I'm nobody we're all nobodies you're the great somebody you're the great Savior the great Redeemer the great crater the lover of mankind hallelujah the great writer of the doctrine hallelujah amen thank you Lord and you said go into all the world and preach the doctor into every nation and here we are in this nation preaching the doctrine making disciples of this church a disciple means a learner help us to be learners Lord God of the message doctrine so we can live the right way keep all sin out of our homes and not pretend to be message believers but love sin but to hate sin and love righteousness amen glory help us to not be jellyfish help us to be real strong backbone lions amen backbone Eagles hallelujah backbone Lambs Lord God Alleluia a lamb with a back dear God thank you Jesus Lord last I pray help us all to receive the first doctrine you preached on this earth to Nicodemus my prayer is that everyone in our church would receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost Alleluia the most vital subject Lord God the token the highlight Ministry of the prophets message was a doctrine that you preached first on this earth hallelujah it's our ticket to the rapture it's our reservation for the rapture to be born again to have eternal life living inside of us thank you Lord God hallelujah thank you Jesus the greatest privilege a man or woman could ever experience that eternal life in their soul as your Bible said Lord that you are the firstborn among many brethren you were the beginning of the creation of God those of us with the Holy Ghost are a new creation a
