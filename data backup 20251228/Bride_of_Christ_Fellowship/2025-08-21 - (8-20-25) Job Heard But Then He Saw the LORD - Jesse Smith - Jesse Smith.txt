========================================

I was studying this morning before work and I thought uh well let me look over my notes and his notes and I thought well maybe I I recently made a video on Job I think last Saturday. So I thought well I'll just preach on Job and I'll kind of tie in this thought that brother Brian preached to us and I'll just continue on Job. Praise God. There's a couple comments I got on YouTube saying uh you don't know how much I needed this. I needed to hear about Job and how it related to my situation. Um, and if you were blessed Sunday by Brian's message and David's message, then I thought, well, I'll just continue on that thought. I'll just trust the Holy Spirit. Uh, you know, Brian doesn't listen to my sermons. He doesn't watch my videos. So, he didn't know I put a Job video out and the next day he preaches on Job. So, uh, two witnesses. I just like to see that you like to see that. We like to see God giving us the same thoughts. Job 20, I'm sorry, Job 42 verse5. Pardon me. So, I'd like to preach on this thought. Job heard, but then he saw the Lord. Job heard, but then he saw the Lord. Job 42:5. Let's read that if we can on three. One, two, three. I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine seeth thee. Amen. May God bless the reading of his word. You may be seated by God's grace. So that was the message title brother Brian preached on Sunday was in inspiration I have heard but now I see. So I'm taking out the inspiration I'm just putting it in there. Job heard but then he saw the Lord. Hallelujah. So uh all of us you know uh are familiar with the story of Job. But at the end I want to kind of bring out just a fresh thought that was fresh to me uh by the grace of the Lord. Um, we don't know many Jobes. I don't know if I know hardly any Jobes. Um, what we find is people that have a partial relation to Job. They can know like they can know one fraction of what Job went through. But there's at least uh five uh parts of Job's suffering that I don't know anyone who suffered that other than the Lord Jesus. Right? Because no man ever suffered like Jesus, right? Uh but he was holy. He was God in the flesh. He had the word nature, not a sin nature. Uh so that that's different because he was totally holy. Uh but we are not. We're born in sin, shape iniquity, come to the world speaking lies. But there's a five there's five layers to this suffering. And uh although many might claim to be like Job, very few actually are. And they don't really understand all that Job went through. Now, I'm not saying that to be critical, but I'm saying that uh let's not uh try to put pity on ourselves. &gt;&gt; Let's not try to let's not let the devil allow us to think we're suffering more than what we are &gt;&gt; in a rich free nation like we live in. &gt;&gt; Okay? In other words, this this ought to make us reflect and like, wow, I don't have it that bad. &gt;&gt; Like Austin shared some videos with me a few weeks ago of bombing in Gaza, right? And that shook up Austin. And he's like, "Wow, my problems pale in comparison to what they're going through with homes destroyed, whole entire communities in rubble, not knowing where your lunch is going to come from. No more electricity. Imagine how sad we get when the electricity is out for one or two or three hours." &gt;&gt; So hopefully this message brings us another perspective on it. But he's got at least five layers. The first one is that he suffered not for a day, not for a week, but months. So it's Job 29:2. I'll need a case to kind of be real fast here, fast typing here tonight by God's grace. Then I can read it and you got it. Oh, that I were as in months past. So it was more than at least two months. So he'd say at least 60 days at least, maybe more. It wasn't a year. He didn't say years, but months. months had passed where he had had soores all over him. Now, that's a that's another layer. But the first layer is suffering for months at a time with no breaks. Hallelujah. That's why I I've told this before publicly. I'm going to say it again. Brother Mike McCloskkey in that condition in his wheelchair because he was shot where he was shot in the back. He's have ner he has nerve pain 247. It never lets go. So imagine you got a cut, right? and your it was deep and your nerves are just it's it's throbbing. That's the word. Thank you, brother. That's 247 for him. You'll see if you're watching the live stream, every now and then he'll go like this. He'll go like like that because just the pain. Uh he just has to adjust himself. But what I've told him and I even told him again last night, I said, "Brother Mike, I don't know anyone who has more faith than you." Now, that's just my opinion. And here's why. Because he forgave the man who shot him in public. It's it was on TV. I can share the video with you. They wept and cried together. And then he held the Bible and he says, "I I don't want any charges against him because I've learned what forgiveness is by the King James Bible." &gt;&gt; And then despite after that, he still suffers every single day and refuses to quit, refuses to give up, refuse to get angry at God, and all he wants to do is love on people. And when when we get a little hurt or we get go through bad times, we get all discouraged and run out just, you know, just discouraged, frustrated, and yet we don't have all this constant pain that he has. So to me, that means that man has way more faith than me. Hallelujah. Because he's suffering day and night, year after year, 24/7 with no relief. &gt;&gt; And yet he's still and and brother brother Rod, he's gone into like Home Depot and Lowe's, prayed for sick people, and they're instantly healed. And yet God chooses not to heal him yet. Now that confused him for a while. You know, he thought about that for a while, but he's just learned to accept God will do what he wants to do in his time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that's the first layer. Not weeks of pain, months of and the worst pain because of the boils, right? In other words, every time you try to lay down or move around, there's pain because you have open source all over your body. open source. Okay, so that's the first layer is months. The second layer he lost all of his children. That's in chapter one. Imagine having seven children, you know, seven boys, seven grown children and they one day they're here, the next day they're gone. Lost all of his children. No more babies to hug. Now, we know there probably weren't babies, but that's what the the point I'm making. No more children to hug on. having seven funerals. Anybody ever had seven funerals at the same time? See, so this is this is beyond anything you and I could understand. And church, this is all before he saw God. So that that's that magnifies Job's experience even more &gt;&gt; as far as I'm talking about his trust in God. We now you and I say we trust in God. We trust in God. How much do we trust in God? &gt;&gt; It's not to be discouraging, but to to try to encourage us. Let's trust God more. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If he could trust God in his experience, then we can trust God in our experience. &gt;&gt; And and remember again as we sang earlier, we could we have a Bible to trust in, right? &gt;&gt; Job didn't have a Bible. &gt;&gt; He just had the constellations, right? He talked about Orion and uh Pleaides. I can never say that. Do you know how to say it, Rod? &gt;&gt; Pleaides. Thank you. &gt;&gt; I'm a teacher and I need to be taught. Hallelujah. That's the truth. Third, he lost all of his wealth, all of his animals. So, think about your bank. Think think about that number in your bank account. Take that down to zero. You lost your cards. You lost your the bank's destroyed. You have you you have no way to get anything back. There's no FDIC that will pay your money back. It's all gone. Okay. And then his health, his health was that fourth layer. As I said, boils everywhere. Okay? I've never had boils like that. I don't know anyone who has had boils like that where they're just surrounding you all all over your body. Now, the boils leads to the fifth and final layer that he rarely got sleep. So upon all that, you know, we would think, well, at least at least you and I get to sleep during the night. He hardly got any sleep. So, get ready to pull that up there. Uh Job 73 and 4. Job 7:34. So I am made to possess months of vanity and weariesome nights, not restful nights. Oh, thank goodness the We say like this. The baby finally slept through the night or my 5-year-old finally slept through the night. Right, Z? He does a good job every night. But you know, we we get upset if we have a couple nights we don't get all the sleep. Chris and I were texting about that. I wasn't getting good sleep last week. Chris said, "How you sleeping?" I'm like, "Much better, brother. Thank you." But Job didn't have restful nights. He had weary nights on top of everything else, the other four layers. When I lie down, I say, "When shall I arise?" And the night be gone. So as soon as he's down, he's like, "I'd just like to get up." In other words, there's no hope for rest and the night be gone. I'm full of tossings to and fro until the dawning of the day. And remember church again, God said he was a perfect man that is skewed evil. In other words, he really didn't deserve all this. &gt;&gt; God was not angry with him. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; God was not wroth with Job. &gt;&gt; It was a test of his love and character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, did he have daily sins? Yes. I've gone over that. I'll just go over it briefly again tonight. He had daily sins just like you and I. But he constantly applied the blood. &gt;&gt; Just a reminder, Ro, as Rod has told some of you, if you got a tough situation, apply the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Chris. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. And that's exactly what he did in chapter one. It said he got up early every morning to sacrifice. Yes, sir. Good question, brother. Yes. Job 7:13 and 14 when I say my bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint. So at least we can say, "Well, at least I can lay down tonight on a nice mattress I just bought." Or somebody gave me a nice mattress. Finally, at least I can lay down on a nice mattress. Job could not say that. Then thou scares me with dreams and terrifies me through visions. Now again, he's got it wrong here. It wasn't God that was doing that. He's he's applying this to God. And that's one reason God rebukes him at the end. But church, let's give him some grace. He said a lot of wrong things, but he wasn't sleeping well. &gt;&gt; The Bible said he was full of confusion. &gt;&gt; How many people have ever stayed up for days on end? Not me. I've never have. If you stayed up days on end, Brother Chris. Well, by the end, you're like, you know, if you're not taking drugs, by the end, you know, you could be so confused and then all the pain and then the funerals and then having no no money. Think about people that wander Akan or they wander San Francisco. Very similar type of mindset. So, I just say like this. It was just God's grace that he didn't say the wrong thing. &gt;&gt; Something that he could not be forgiven of. And thank God, God has kept you and I from saying things we wish we never said. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And our trials are less in comparison to his. &gt;&gt; Check out uh in your Bible Job 3:17. &gt;&gt; Even he felt this pain, church, not just on his soores, in his bones. My bones are pierced in me in the night season and my sinnus take no rest. So the ligaments or we'd say the blood vessels, uh the joints, everything was painful. There wasn't a spot, brother Austin, where he wasn't having some type of a physical pain. Soon as he laid down, it's like, can I get up? Soon as he's up, I wish I could lay down. And then when he got to sleep, he had bad dreams. So again, who do you know that's on this level? Nobody I know. So let's take courage from that. Praise God. Hallelujah. Let's take courage. And remember, this was this was a test given to the greatest believer. We'd say, or I'll say like this, maybe a better word, the most humble believer, the most obedient believer of his day. And he went through all this and still never cursed God. And he still had never seen God. &gt;&gt; He'd only heard about God. Oh, but what's the Bible say, Brother Rod? Faith cometh by. Amen. Job had faith because he heard the word of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He never seen God. He never saw a supernatural miracle. We'd say it's some great thing. He never talked to God face to face. He never saw the theophony of God. We'd say, "Hallelujah." Now, he had visions, right? Oh, yeah. He did have visions in the midst of the trial. That's right. He did have, but we don't know what he saw beforehand because at the end, he says, "Now I see." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. Now, I see. So, before he didn't see the picture the right way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is a a test, a true test of faith that he went through. And that was the whole test. Brother Chris, Satan said, "Well, you're only you he is only serving you because you're blessing him. You're packing his wallet and his bank account. That's the only reason he's loving you." And then when that failed, he said, "Well, he's got good health. If you take away his health, he'll curse you." Now, Job never cursed God, but church, he did exalt himself above God. &gt;&gt; But God didn't put that on the same level as a curse. &gt;&gt; That's totally scriptural. So, let's get your Bibles ready. We'll try to get some of those here by God's grace. We'll see how far we can get. So, Job had five levels of suffering that you and I really know nothing about. In fact, I don't even know if I have can ever say any of those five levels. I've always have never suffered for months on end. I have all my children. Thank God. We still have finances. I have my health and I sleep pretty well. So, I haven't suffered on any of those realms. But then when I go through a trial, brother Chris, I'm like, "Oh, God." Like I'm crying out like I'm going to die or something like that or I get worried if somebody threatens me this or threat and I forget I forget all the the trials that Job went through and still he says the Lord gives the Lord takes away. Still he said let's bless the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's why church in the midst of your hardest trial just come to church and bless the Lord. Hallelujah. You might spend Monday, Tuesday all discouraged, but come Wednesday night and just let God anoint you to say, "Bless the Lord." Hallelujah. I'm still here. I still made it. I still got this. I still got that. I'm not like Job. I ought to bless God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or maybe Thursday, Friday, Saturday is awful. But just come Sunday and just bless the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever. &gt;&gt; It'll turn your whole situation around. Hallelujah. change your whole perspective &gt;&gt; when you talk about the goodness of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now I uh for time's sake, yeah, I better just go to Job's I I could well I'll just rehearse real quickly Job's positives. Job uh brother Chris Job in Job 1 vers5. He prayed every morning and made sacrifice for his children early in the morning. He got up early. Church, you men and women, you want to be men and women of God, you got to get up early. Jesus got up early &gt;&gt; and remember and I want Rod to testify. That's right. But I need to get your your testimony on the schedule, brother. I'm so glad you're here tonight. Praise God. We got to hear that. We heard Adam's testimony. We heard David's testimony. Look, church. Crack cocaine, marijuana, alcohol, porn cannot stop a child of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going to fall off eventually. Just seek God with all your heart. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we need to hear from brother Rod as well what God has done in his life. I'm excited to hear more about that as well by God's grace. Hallelujah. And just just as a pre quick preview, Brother Rod felt led of the Lord to leave and move almost twos away just to support a preacher and leave everything dear to him. &gt;&gt; Well, we've got family like that. Austin did that. So that's part of Rod's testimony. Brother Chris, and you came back too, buddy. Hallelujah. But leave everything just to support the word of God. Hallelujah. It's like the queen of the south. Amen. &gt;&gt; Leaving everything in order to support the word of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Very few people will ever do that, but God has anointed our brother to do that. Hallelujah. She got up early, every morning early to pray and make sacrifices. Uh, he lived for others. Now, we're not going to read these, but he helped the widows in Job 29:13. He helped the fatherless in Job 29:12. He loved his enemies in Job 31:29. He didn't trust in his riches. As rich as he was, he actually didn't trust in that. That's why he could still praise God when he lost it. Amen. &gt;&gt; That was in Job 31:24 and 25. And he helped strangers. He let strangers live in his mansion. He he would have had a a mansion. &gt;&gt; Now, I would say that's well it's easy for you to let people stay if you got a mansion. If I had a hotel, brother Austin, I'd let a lot of people stay in the rooms, you know, right? If I was a rich man like that, it's different when your house is jam-packed to the corners and you got b lots of four or five bunk beds in your house. But that's just like the old days. Amen. They had small houses, but buck buck beds all around the the rooms. Hallelujah. That's right. stuff on the floor, the dirt floor. And he overcame like brother Adam's testimony, he overcame the sexual mind battles in Job 31 verse 1, N, and 10. He wouldn't even look at a woman that wasn't his wife. &gt;&gt; And God looked down and said, "That's a perfect man." &gt;&gt; Now, perfect doesn't mean sinless. Perfect means you're undefiled and you've confessed all your sins. &gt;&gt; It also means pious, which means you're really religious. You honor God. You fear the Lord. you keep his commands. In other words, Job faithfully made the sacrifices, right? Faithfully put all these sins under the blood every day. Faithfully tried to serve God. That's what made him a perfect man. Hallelujah. Look, he said, if I've done wrong, he said, then let my wife be given to another. But he said, I haven't done that. What a statement to make in the presence of God. Hallelujah. See, he knew. He knew he kept the word of God. He was just confused and didn't understand. Why would God allow me this five-fold test, which I don't know anyone who's battled all five of those. Hallelujah. And then one thing we got to remember, God called him perfect. God called him the most holy man in his generation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And remember, he was he was the closest man to God, but he still never had a great dream or vision as far as we know. Never heard from God, in other words. &gt;&gt; So, that ought to encourage you too, church. You can be close to God without having as many experiences as other people. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It's that that's the that's one of the main thoughts I want to bring out here. He said, "I've heard, but now I see." Well, just in the hearing, he was the greatest man on the earth. just in hearing. &gt;&gt; He He couldn't He couldn't brag, brother Rod about, well, I had that vision that last year. This year I've had three visions and then God talked to me that he couldn't brag on that. He hadn't seen God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He just knowed the word. So church, if you know the word, you're a blessed individual. &gt;&gt; And you can still live close to God if you've just heard the word of God. Do you brothers believe that? Brother Patrick Claw, do you believe that? If you just obey the word of God, you can be great in the sight of God. You We'll never be great in the sight of the world. We don't have to care about that. We want to be great in the sight of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To live a godly, pure life. Hallelujah. Okay. About 20 minutes. Okay. Perfect. Now, I just want to show just some of his failures. In Job 3:25, he said everything he feared came upon him. So in other words, Job struggled with fear. I'm going to lose it all. I'm going to lose my kids. I'm going to lose my money. I'm going to lose my health. So at some point, see, he greatly feared this. So at some point, although he was worshiping, there was times he let fear come in. &gt;&gt; But yeah, members church, the whole time, God said, "He's perfect." &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. In other words, we're all going to have mind battles. We're all going to fear about the future. Just keep worshiping God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just keep making the right sacrifices. Hallelujah. Just keep obeying the word of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And again, church. In other words, he feared he feared the hardest temptation there would ever come and it came upon him. But again, I don't know anyone that this has come upon that's ever had to deal with this like he did. Hallelujah. Here's where Job made a mistake. He said, "God puts no trust in his servants in Job 4:18." Look at this. Job suffering so much. He's like, "God doesn't trust any of his servants. He put no trust in his servants." But that's exactly the opposite of what was true. God told Satan, "I trust him. He won't deny me." God trusts you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In other words, he knows the beginning from the end. He knows you're going to serve him because you love him and you believe the truth. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, our trials will make us say things we don't even mean. Our trials, if we don't overcome them, it'll make us say things that disagree with God's word. But yet, God is still faithful to forgive us &gt;&gt; because he sees the beginning from the end. He tells us he was speaking out of a bitter soul because this fivelevel trial in Job 7:11. Therefore, I will not refrain my mouth. I will speak in the anguish of my spirit. So, he's speaking from his sorrow. He's battled all these things for so months. He's speaking just from a he's a wounded soldier, we'd say. And I will complain. So he even goes as far as saying, "I'm complaining because I don't understand this." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But does God hold him against it? No. God doesn't hold him against it. Does God bring correction to him? Yes. That's what every good father will do. Bring correction. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God doesn't hold this against him. As far as like, oh, you're lost or you're done. I'm never going to send my anointing. I'm never going to restore your joy. I'm never going to bring back all these things. God couldn't wait to bring it back. Right? As soon as Job confessed, uh, he's like telling those three friends, "Okay, go go have Job pray for you." And then as soon as that, God accepts Job and God starts blessing him right over again. Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's full of confusion in Job 10 verse1 15, if you have your Bible. If I be wicked, woe to me. And if I be righteous, yet I will not lift up my head. I'm full of confusion. Yeah, if you just you if you and I just miss sleep for one night, we'll be full of confusion. I know I will be. That's what I'm talking I'm talking about for myself. Can barely make it through the day, wonder around tripping over things, saying things I ought not to say, just it just comes out of my mouth. &gt;&gt; I not even know it's gonna not even know I'm going to say it. Just tired, confused. But not notice here, Job did say there was times he got lazy on God. Job 16:12. So again, church, try to take courage from this. We're going to get lazy on God. Sometimes we're going to fear, but just keep worshiping. Just keep praying. Just keep giving God glory. God will forgive us. He'll help us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I was at ease. So Job took a little break, Brother Chris. There must been a little time. He took a little spiritual break. I was at ease. Things were too easy for me. He no doubt he was rich. But he hath broken me aunder. He hath also taken me by my neck and shaken me to pieces and set me up for his mark. Now, did God do that? No. So, here's the another wrong statement. The the God allowed the enemy to do that. It wasn't God shaking him up. God will not tempt any man, but God will allow us to be tempted. And he'll never, as my remember I ended last Wednesday night, God will never allow us a temptation that we cannot handle. &gt;&gt; In other words, you can win every wrestling match. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can win every wrestling match cuz that's what it is. We wrestle not against flesh and blood. Amen. Brother Ram said it's not a flesh and blood affair. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You got to win the wrestling match of prayer. The wrestling match of speaking God's word. The wrestling match of trusting in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Trusting thus sayith the Lord. If we trust thus sayith the Lord, we're going to win the match. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. church. So again, no man's perfect as far as what we when we think perfect. It means uh mature, right? It means uh forgiven. It means undefiled. You've confessed all your sins. You're Oh, it also means upright. Amen. You're living upright. You're doing the right thing, not the wrong thing. &gt;&gt; And church. Oh, yeah. Here's another one. Uh and then he says, "I'm an enemy of God." In Job uh 19:11, look at those fingers. Lightning fingers back there. Heath also, now look, he says, "God has kindled his wrath against me." So, brother Austin, when he would pray, he would imagine God just angry with him. Can't wait to get back on him or something like that. And that wasn't at all. God's bragging on him in heaven. Have you considered Job? There's nobody like Job in heaven. There's nobody like Malachi on earth. Put yourself in there. There's nobody like Sister Kristen. But yet, he's looking up, Brother Christian. He's like, "God's angry at me. He's pouring out his wrath on me." He's wrong. God wasn't doing that. &gt;&gt; And how many times, church, do we get upset with God? Like, this isn't turning out like I wanted it to. &gt;&gt; God must be angry with me. &gt;&gt; Now, there could be a time where God is angry at us because of iniquity, right? &gt;&gt; But it's not every time. If we've confessed that, then we're forgiven. Now, there might be consequences, but let's say the consequences have already done and and now we're living pure before God and we have trials. Well, it's a test of our character. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Pro it could be God proving our character to the devil or as we saw with Job also, God was proving Job's character to Job. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he said, "I abhore myself. I hate myself and I repent in dust and ashes." &gt;&gt; All right. Now, let's look at real quick at Aahu. Elahu is watching this whole situation, right? He's a young man. That's that's the scripture that uh uh Brian opened up with Elahu. He lets Job go back and forth. Job does most of the talking with those three friends anyway. And he waits till they're all done. Then he says, "I've got the spirit of the Lord on me. My belly is like wine. I It's going to burst. I got to say these things. I've waited. I'm I'm I'm the youngest here and I know wisdom is in age, but everybody here is saying things wrong." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Let me speak for God." Hallelujah. And Brian tried to encourage these young girls. You can speak for God. You brothers can speak for God, too. Malachi, you young, all you young sisters, young brothers, you can speak for God, too. Just wait for your anointing. &gt;&gt; Just wait for the leading of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, uh I guess I'll just hit the highlights here. Let's go to uh Job 32:1 and2, honey. 321 and2. I'll just hit the highlights. So these three men ceased to answer Job because he was righteous in his own eyes. Okay, we'll see it later. God even says this too. Then was kindled the wrath of Aahu, the son of Berichel, the buzzite of the kindred of Ram. Against Job was his wrath kindled because he justified himself rather than God. So in Job's words, he was making himself like like God did wrong to me. &gt;&gt; Why didn't God do right for me? I'm the victim. &gt;&gt; It's God's fault. &gt;&gt; And Elahu is like, I'm angry now. I'm going to tell you I'm going to tell you what God feels. Right? Hallelujah. Just for the time sake, go to Job 34:5. Job says God had taken away his judgment and that was wrong. Look what Elahu says. For Job has said, I am righteous and God has taken away my judgment. Did God take away the judgment of Job? Of course not. No. But Job had felt that God taken away the judgment and God wasn't judging his situation the right way. Listen friends, God's a potter. God can do whatever he wants with his clay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like you, Brother Chris, and Brother Austin, you got your your your your vessels, your bowls, right? Your your plates, your cups now in your apartment. You can do whatever you want with them because they're yours. &gt;&gt; You paid for them fair and square. Or they were given to you fair and square. Well, isn't God greater than you and I? &gt;&gt; If we put something through, if we put something through a difficult time, it's still our vessel, right? uh we leave our vessel out in the car for a few weeks. It's going to be pretty nasty, right? But we got to bring it in, get it cleaned out, and I can use it again, but it's still mine. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what God's allowing here. God's allowing Job to be tested, but Job still belongs to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, go to verse 7 and 34. He said, Job is being scornful, which means he has disdain towards God. What is a man like Job who drinkketh up scorning like water? So he's just he's just drinking in all the scorn. Like he's just saying too many words against God. Uh go to 349 and 10. He uh Job said it's no profit to serve God for he has said it profit a man nothing that he should delight himself with God. Now stop right there. Job would have said it it's not going to help you at all, brother Rod, to come to church. It's not going to help you at all to read your Bible. That's basically what Job said. Now, when was the last time you said that? You don't have to raise your hand. But did you ever say, "Ah, it doesn't help to go to church." Well, if you did, now you're on the same level as Job, right? You've done the same wrong as Job. Doesn't help me to read my Bible. Well, you just said what Job said, and you you haven't had as hard as trials as Job. &gt;&gt; Now, is is our day more deceptive? Yes. But you haven't gone through the physical suffering that he went through. &gt;&gt; And I would say even the emotional suffering. There's there's no way, right? Therefore, hearken unto me, ye men of understanding, far be from God, that he should do wickedness and from the Almighty that he should commit iniquity. So, Job is basically saying God's committing iniquity because Elahu is rebuking Job for his iniquity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Everybody see that? &gt;&gt; In other words, Job's basically saying, "God did wrong with me." He's not judging my situation the right way. It doesn't do any doesn't help you if you delight in God. Doesn't do any good. Haven if you praise your praise God, raise your hands and sing and happy and and dance and shout for Jesus. It don't do you any good. That's what Job was saying. Oh, but it does do good. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. It does do good to sing to God. It does do good to dance for God. Hallelujah. You get under the anointing. Hallelujah. You get anointed and the Bible said it refreshes your spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Last Wednesday, I didn't plan it. I dance all around here, Austin. Last Wednesday, I danced all around here to the first song. I didn't plan it. Something just struck me and I just started dancing. I could sing of your love forever. I felt so good afterwards. I'm boy, I really needed that one. Praise God. It It's refreshment. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And then I live better after that. &gt;&gt; I live closer to God. Hallelujah. But look, even a even a man who's the greatest man on earth can say the wrong things about God. And then the Bible said Job condemned God in 34:17. Now look at this scripture 34:17. Shall even he that hateth right govern and wilt thou condemn him that is most just? Elahu who's got he's like Christ. He's like a type of Christ bringing the judgment of God in flesh. He tells Job, he said, "How can you condemn the most just God?" So all Job's complaining was almost condemning God as being unfair. He He judged it wrong. Church, as hard as trials as we go through in life, you can be assured God has always judged it right. &gt;&gt; And it might be hard for us in our human condition to say, uh, you know, this per we lost this person or we went through this suffering. It might be hard to say all things work together for good. But all things work together for good. Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll find out later, either this side or the next side. You'll find out later that all things work together for good &gt;&gt; to them that love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, Job is guilty by the spirit of God. Elahu said, "I'm anointed from the Almighty to bring rebuke." He's guilty of condemning God. Now, church, I've heard one person in this message say, "I hate I hate God." It was a woman who used to go to church here. She hated God because uh she wasn't couldn't be a preacher and because she wasn't married yet. And I told her, I said, "Sister, you need to repent of that." And she and she even told it to my face. We're standing outside the church one time at the other location. She said, "I hate God." I'm like, "What? Well, no wonder you're sitting like that in church, not praising God, not worshiping God. No joy." Think about that. But I thought, "Well, well, I've seen that. I mean, I've seen that somewhere. That's in the Bible." Now, Job never hated God, but Job said God did wrong. And so, that's what basically this sister was saying. God did wrong. I'm not uh he don't let women preach and he uh hasn't given me a husband yet. Isn't that something? And claim to believe this message. So, God will work that situation out. God will be the judge of that. &gt;&gt; But I'm just letting you know, I've rarely seen anybody suffer. And that sister never suffered on any of these levels &gt;&gt; that Job had. None of them. But what I want you to know is that we'll say things, church, and if if we're sincere, then then God will forgive us. But if we're truly servants of God, we'll be like Job and say, "I hate that I said that." &gt;&gt; Right? He said, "I hate myself." In other words, I hate my sin nature. I can't wait to get a theophony. Hallelujah. Amen. I can't wait to get a word body where I don't act like this. I don't say things like this. Where I can be a real believer all the time. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In other words, I don't sin every day. And look what Job rebukes I'm sorry. Look what Elahu rebukes him on in Job uh 3435 36 and 37. Elahu says he's rebelled against God. Job, this perfect man up in heaven. Now church, that ought to tell us something. The blood of Jesus Christ in heaven forgives us of our rebellion here on earth. Everybody catch that. Job's sin was rebelling. He was saying things against God that were right. But God in heaven is still calling him. He's my servant. He's the most He hates evil. He escapes evil. Hallelujah. See that? See the power of the blood sacrifice. Does everybody see that? The blood covers all your rebellion to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. The blood covers all my rebellion, all your re rebellion to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every day we rebel against God somehow, right? None of us are perfect, but the blood of Christ still forgives our rebellion. &gt;&gt; Job has spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom. My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men. For he hath added rebellion unto his sin. This is Elahu speaking by the word of the Lord. For he uh he clapth his hands among us, and multiplyth his words against God. So God's up here telling the devil, "Look at this man. He's a great man. Look at this great man. God saying good things about him, Brother Austin. But then Job is saying bad things about God. And this is a God who forgives. This is the God of love. Hallelujah. Amen. Can everybody see that? He's a loving God because he'll he'll let his believers even say words against him and still forgive it because he loves them. Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, brothers and sisters, no matter how many times we stumble, if we just re repent, if we just ask God to forgive us, God will forgive us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You might say, "I spoke against God. I rebelled against God. There's no hope for me." No, there is hope for you because there was hope for Job. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. again. Uh yeah, Job later agrees with this. Uh go to Job 42:3. Job Job totally agrees that he spoke without knowledge. Uh 423. Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore, I have uttered that I understood not things too wonderful me which I knew not. So see, I I said things I didn't understand. So when you go to the end of the story, Job's like, "You're right, Elahu. I said so many things I had no idea what I was saying. I rebelled against God. I hate myself. I abhore myself &gt;&gt; because of what I've said against God. And George, these were just words. He didn't sleep with anybody's wife. &gt;&gt; Right? He didn't commit sexual sin. He just spoke evil words. &gt;&gt; And yet, he hated himself because of his evil words that he uttered. See, that shows you're a real Christian when you're so ashamed of your sin that you you say, "Oh, I hate my sin. I hate my sin. I just want to be forgiven. God, forgive me. God, restore my joy. Amen. Lord, restore restore the words that come out of my mouth. Help me just to say good things about you, God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he wasn't guilty of sexual sin. He wasn't guilty of money embezzlement, right? He wasn't guilty of all these things. It was mostly his words. My then said Job was more righteous. Oh yeah. He said he was more righteous than God's righteousness in Job 351 2 and3. And I'm about ready to close here. I'm coming up to the end here. I didn't get to where I wanted to go, but we'll see. I may preaching Sunday. Elahu spake moreover and said, "Thinkest thou this to be right that thou says my righteousness is more than God." So look, he brother Rod, he exalted himself greater than God. And that's what these preachers, we we know preachers say that they call themselves the greatest of all time. And that and they don't even understand. They're they're actually saying they're greater than Jesus when they say all time because he was a prophet on this earth. Now, he was a God prophet, but he was still a prophet on this earth. They don't even realize it. Now, can they be forgiven and saved? Yes, because Job was. Everybody see that? That making sense? He Job said, "I am more righteous than God." In other words, I know more about it than God. I know what's right more than God. For thou hast said, "What advantage will it be unto thee? And what profit shall I have if I be cleansed from my sin?" What do I gain? Even if God does forgive me, what do I gain? I'm suffering. I'm doing all these things. This was uttered by the greatest man according to God. Hallelujah. Oh, that makes me just makes me so humbled that God could look down and call this man the greatest man because of the blood sacrifice. Hallelujah. So, he says he's more righteous than God. And let me I'll just close with this thought because I just I'll take about a couple more minutes here. Yeah, I'll just close with this here. Church, Job only knew God by hearing the preaching about God. He still hadn't seen God, right? Because faith comes by hearing. And Jesus said, "Greater is he who believeth on me and yet hasn't seen." So see, we get that revelation. How I'd like to see an angel, brother Claude. But it's actually I'd be greater in the sight of God if I didn't. Yet I still believed in angels. Thank God we can feel them. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the Bible said the angels come to minister. And they came to give Jesus strength touched by an angel ministered uh by an angel. Right? We actually have greater faith if we don't see all these supernatural things than if we do see these supernatural things. And Job knew God by hearing, but he hadn't seen God. &gt;&gt; So before Job even saw God, before he even had this amazing miracle, we'd say, hearing from God out of a whirlwind, he was already perfect in the sight of God, he was already pious, upright, and undefiled. Hallelujah. And church, what is what do we find out here? Here's I want to I want to close with this. Let's keep this in mind. My last two verses. 2 Chronicles 16:9. In the story of Job, hallelujah. Glory. 2 Chronicles 16:9. In the story of Job, we get this understanding. Is it coming up? 2 Chronicles 16:9. I can turn there. I want to read it there. So, you got it. For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect. Ah, there's Job. Amen. &gt;&gt; Herein thou hast done foolishly. Therefore, from henceforth thou shalt have wars. Now, just keep that up there. Um, that's not referring to Job. That's referring to uh Asa, King Asa, rebuked by Haniah. Okay. But the point I want to make here is that for all of Job's life, he had never seen God. But brother Chris, every day the eyes of the Lord come looking for him. And every day the eyes found him on his knees. Brother Rod praying, "Oh God, forgive my children. If they did anything wrong, I worship you, God. Great is the Lord. Greatly to be praised. Lord, if anybody does ever wrong, forgive them, Lord Jesus. Forgive them." By by the grace of God, every day the eyes of the Lord saw him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. Church, God's going to come looking tomorrow in your apartment or in your home to see how you're serving him. Because if you serve him right, he'll so show himself strong on your behalf. &gt;&gt; You know why that's so important, church? Why is this so important? God's eyes will find you serving him. Hallelujah. It'll make you perfect means upright. You're obedient. It's so important that the eyes of the Lord find you because they're going to and fro. But at the same time, Satan's going to and fro. &gt;&gt; Job 1 vers7, my last verse. The Lord said unto Satan, from whence cometh thou and S answered the Lord, he said, from going forth Akran and Kyogre Falls and Doylestown. The church said, &gt;&gt; oh, so what's that mean, brother Chris? That means every day the Lord comes looking to see if we're going to serve him. But the devil comes looking to see if we're not. &gt;&gt; And we better serve the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If we do, what does God God looks down from heaven say? That's my son. That's my daughter on their knees. Amen. And no matter what they go through, they've heard the word. Amen. Maybe they haven't seen Brother Ram's miracles or Brother Angley's miracles, which that those are ordained. Those are gifts of God ordained before the foundation world. But we're not any less, right? Because the Bible says if you believe and haven't seen, you're more blessed than they are. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, God will give them reward based upon their labor. I'm not saying we get greater rewards, but there is some reward we get that they might not get. There is some blessing that we will get if we haven't seen those because God's eye seeing him. And how many want to do that today by the grace of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand to our feet. Musicians can come. Satan's going to and fro in Akran, Kaoga Falls, Doylestown. Did I get all the towns here? And knowing that, we better make sure that we're worshiping and sacrificing every day to our Lord Jesus Christ because his eyes are looking, who can I show myself strong in? &gt;&gt; Can I show myself strong in brother Jesse's life today? Can I show myself strong in Malachi's life or Chris's life or Rod's life? or can I show myself strong for the new school year? And Claude and Patrick, amen, in the high school. Hallelujah. Every day his eyes are looking. Are they serving God? Do they want to overcome? Do they want to be true servants? Do they want to be perfect and upright? Church, God want God is here to help us have upright hearts. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, church, we don't aspire to be the greatest of all time, but I'll say it like this. We want to be as close to God as we possibly can. &gt;&gt; Let me say like this. We want to get as many rewards as we can. We're not in this for the rewards, but we're in this to honor our Lord and Savior. &gt;&gt; And he likened the kingdom of God. Brother Rod knows. You know too, church. He likened the kingdom of God of saying, "Uh, someone I need somebody to go work out in the vineyard &gt;&gt; in the heat of the day." Right? Now, we know we're the 11th hour workers, but Jesus is looking for laborers who go out in the harvest and work Malachi. Is it easy or hard to go out in the heat of the sun at the orchard and harvest? Easy or hard? Hard. They come in, they're sweating all over the place, dirt all over themselves. They harvest pumpkins and uh give me some apples, peaches, what else? Pears. Come home and if they're not careful, they're burnt red. Their face is all burnt red. In other words, it's not a picnic to go work in the harvest. But God's eyes are watching who's going to go to work. Who's going to go to work and get on their knees and ask God for mercy? And church, if you didn't do it this morning, let's do it tonight. Praise God. Let's end the night on our knees. Let's end the night praying because the eyes, Lord, are here. He wants to see who can I be strong in today. &gt;&gt; I want to be strong for Jesus Christ. Let's bow our heads. Father God, we thank you for today. Lord God, I'm looking at the time. Lord, I didn't get to the thought I wanted to get to, but Lord, I just trust it was a good place to stop. Lord, your eyes were on Job that whole time. You saw Hallelujah. You saw every prayer for his children that died eventually. Lord God, you heard it. So, I believe you saved it. Saved them, Lord God, by your grace and mercy. It was part of this test of Job's character, God's pre-esigned test to test Job to the devil, to prove to the devil that Job really loved the Lord. He wasn't in it for just the benefits. And the Bible tells us to forget not all his benefits, but we're not in it for all those benefits, Lord God, as far as natural things. We're in it for the spiritual benefits of forgiveness and a promise of a mansion in heaven or of a promise of eternal life with Jesus Christ our Lord. That's why we're in it, Lord God. Hallelujah. [Music] Lord, search our hearts right now. Lord, I know your Bible is true. I know the eyes of the Lord are in this room here tonight. It's they're looking for they're looking to see who can I show myself strong in tomorrow even tonight. Can I show myself strong in CPPley or Akran or Ka Falls &gt;&gt; or down in Amish country? Can I show myself strong in the schools, on the job site, at the grocery store? Hallelujah. in our closets. Hallelujah. In our homes, in our families, in our public schools or our home schools, the Lord's eyes are looking. Who can I show myself strong? In other words, who can I help win the wrestling match? Lord God, we've been preaching on wrestling for four services in a row. Lord God, I trust your people are better spiritual wrestlers, Lord God, because of the preaching that we've heard. May they recognize tonight, Lord God, that when you look down, you see them in love, but you also test their faith. And you want to see them overcome. And you just don't look down from heaven. I'll say like that. Your eyes run to and fro on the earth, Lord God. Are they going to dedicate their day to me? Are they going to dedicate their words and their time and their prayer to me? I want to show myself strong. I want to do something supernatural for them. Oh God, look down from heaven. Have mercy on us here tonight. Lord God, we pray. Lord, forgive our sins. Lord, as Job said, Lord, I imagine everybody here would say, "I abhore when I sin. I hate when I sin. Oh God, I never want to sin against you. Why would I do it after all you've done for me, Lord God?" Yet, Lord, Paul says, "When I want to do good, evil's right there with me." Lord Jesus, tonight, oh God, may we rededicate our hearts and lives to you, Lord God. May we trust in you, Aresh, Lord, out of those five layers of trials, I don't know anybody here that might have any of them. So Lord, may we see our tests in a new light. As Paul said, light afflictions. Hallelujah. Praise God. Light afflictions. Oh God. Oh God. Hallelujah. Help us, Lord Jesus, in our light afflictions to believe the word of God to say, "The Lord gives, the Lord takes away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. I'll still sacrifice in the morning. I'll still read my Bible. I'll still pray. I'll still give God glory. I'll still listen to music on the way to work or school. I'll still worship the Lord because I know they're not going to do it at school. They're not going to do it on the job. So, I better do it now. I better give God praise now while I got the chance. [Music] Grantite, Lord Jesus. And Lord, we know the enemy is going to be walking to and fro, too. He's going to walk through Akran tonight. He's going to walk through Ka Falls and Doylestown tonight. Green, Ohio. He's going to walk and look to try to bring people into temptation. Oh God, may we cast him down in Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah. May we hate evil. May we turn down evil. May we depart from evil. Escue it like Job, Lord God. For surely we're not in the same situation. Surely we can be stronger. Surely we get good sleep. Lord God, surely we got money in our accounts and we got our children. Lord God, surely you bless us beyond measure. Lord God, help us to cast down Satan. In the name of Jesus Christ, I ask you, Lord God. May every person leave here with sins confessed and strengthened and ones that the that the God can use and be strong in and win the wrestling matches that we face daily. Lord God, may every person put on each of the parts of the garment. Lord God, all the armor of God, as we've been preaching on, Lord God, if they've set down their sword, may they pick it up, start quoting the word of God. If they've laid down their shield, may they put it up. It'll stop every mind battle. Hallelujah. It will quench every fiery trial, every fiery thought. Hallelujah. Every lie, slander, temptation. It'll quench every single one with faith in the word of God. Grant it, Lord Jesus. Thank you for revealing your word to us. Lord, we're not worthy, Lord. I'm not worthy, Lord, to know these things, but you gave us a Bible, Lord God. We thank you for that. Thank you that the inspiration of the Holy Spirit's here, Lord God, anointing our brother to preach on Job after the day after I made a video on it. Lord God, may we have a re renewed trust in God. That's what Job needed. He needed to learn how to trust God and you really helped him, God. May we learn to trust in God as well. May we recommmit to trusting in you no matter what trials you allow in your wisdom to come to pass in our lives. May we show our love to you by conducting ourselves with joy as brother Brandham said in the midst of trials, Lord God. Of course, many Bible verses say the same, Lord God. So Lord, we love you tonight. Lord, be with us as we worship. Lord, if anyone desire prayer, I just pray you'd hear their humble prayers tonight. Lord God, thank you for the word that we've heard tonight. Job had heard, but then he saw the Lord. before he saw it, he was already a dedicated believer, Lord God. And you already recognize that, Lord, is so powerful in heaven, the greatest man on earth. Oh God, thank you for the dedication of your people, Lord. May we be more dedicated. I ask it in Jesus Christ's
