hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus Lord let's take our Bibles tonight let's go to Psalms chapter 87 like to speak on part four of the little series I I kind of started um Christ Delights in his brother like to look at that tonight God's grace let's look at this little sub topic thought of the love that God has for his house praise God the love that God has for his house what Psalms brother Psalms 87 sir Psalms 87 by God's grace i' like to look at this here tonight um I felt last Wednesday night the Lord really dealing on my heart I felt real burdened to preach about church attendance and so forth like that so I want to just take another service and just kind of deal with that again by God's grace uh such a burden in this hour to be in the house of the Lord so I want to minister on this here tonight by God's grace perhaps maybe some scriptures You' never seen before uh and some quotations from God's Prophet amen Psalms 87 verse1 praise the Lord his foundation is in the Holy mountains the Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob glorious things are spoken of thee Oh city of God sayah I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me behold philistia and Tyree in Ethiopia this man was born there and of Zion it shall be said this and that man was born in her and the highest himself shall establish speaking of Zion God will establish Zion himself the Lord shall count when he writeth up the people I'm sorry I can't I verse six here verse six is it coming up here pardon me let me let me read verse six there and finish your for now I got you read verse six the Lord shall count when he writeth up the people that this man was Bor there say very good I want to go to verse seven as well here by God's grace as well as the singers as the players on instrument shall be there all my Springs are amen thank you brother appreciate that right says a song or song for the sons of Kora to the chief musician upon mahatha lean M of hean the E ezrahite praise God so this was a song specifically for the sons of Kora remember the sons of Kora they were not uh the keepers of uh they they were not the the high priests right they were not the house of Levi we'd say that were actual priests but they just carried all the burdens They Carried all the pieces of furniture and so this song was for them they were to sing and they were to remember in verse two and I hope we can let's just read that again verse two let's remember this the Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob so of all the land of Israel God loved it but God loved more the gates of Zion meaning the gates that come into His City for worship let's bow our heads if you have he on your heart just make it known to god let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for tonight we thank you for your love and your mercy your compassion Lord God we just pray Lord you speak to us here tonight Lord we just want to do what you would do say what you would say Lord let us come in the power of the Resurrection The Power of the spoken word Lord preaching Lord God that will save and heal Lord and strengthen Lord God and perfect the Bride of Jesus Christ I have no ability of my own I'm only trusting in the Holy Spirit here tonight Lord take my mind away Lord and fill with your mind and your thoughts dear God thank you for the anointing of the holy spirit thank you for these inspired scriptures we can read to know your mind we thank you for your grace in Jesus Christ's name everybody said amen amen God bless you being seated praise God so I'd like to look at this the lord loves the house of God he loves his own house amen so let's look at this here I think it'll be important to you um it keeps getting more important to be in the house of the Lord as time goes on recently I preached that message on scarcely saved scarcely lost remember the Bible said that First Peter chapter 4 that those in the house of God right will be saved but what about those who don't obey the truth and are outside of the house of God judgment must begin at the house of God Amen so we think it's uh critical in this hour to be in the house of the Lord I want to lay down some scriptures I think we'll start with the numerous scriptures here and then we'll work our way uh to some quotations brother brandom uh I think you'd be blessed to hear these things here tonight by God's grace so let's if we can let's get our Bibles ready um let's go to Psalm 78 now we start at 87 let's go to Psalms 78 now verse 67 Psalms 7867 we're digging real deep in the Bible here to find these thank God for his Mercy thank God for these golden nuggets 7867 and 68 now look at this here moreover he refused the Tabernacle of Joseph and chose not the tribe of Ephraim but chose the tribe of Judah the Mount Zion which he loved amen what did God love God Lov Mount Zion now physically speaking Mount Zion is right next to mount Mariah praise God it's right next to it Mount Zion is the bigger Mountain physically but as you see in scripture God is talking about uh the place of worship at this point this is where Israel worshiped in the days of of course uh Joshua and then you have the days of David and Solomon and all these days and days of Ezra they reestablish worship here the days of Jesus they worship there they had the Temple of Herod Herod built this beautiful Temple we preached on a few months ago the middle wall partition and so forth but this was God's place where he dwelt amen and God chose Judah and Judah means praise amen he chose David of the tribe of Judah as ruler and King he chose a place within the limits of Judah so Israel I'm sorry Jerusalem was in the midst of the the land of Judah praise God so God dwells in the midst of Praise we ought to enjoy a song service because that's what God dwells in amen hallelujah so God physically dwelt in Judah because all that land was given of course to the the tribe of Judah and Caleb was one of those from Judah amen hallelujah amen so he had he had the Bible said he had another spirit in him a man like Cale that wasn't scared to fight the demons he had a different kind of spirit he's a different kind of a person amen that's what we need to be by God's grace not scared of demons not scared of scoffers not scared of sin not scared of those things but to cast it down in Jesus name amen do not fear God doesn't give a spirit of fear if you're scared about something God didn't give you that amen God don't give the spirit of fear God gives the spirit of power love and a sound mind amen so God chose Mount Zion or Jerusalem because many times Zion is called Jerusalem as the place where his worship was to be celebrated amen so you had Mount Zion if you're looking North at at at the Jerusalem you have Mount Zion the biggest mountain and you have Mount Mariah that's where Christ was crucified that's also where the Temple Mount was as well and and then you have the Mount of Olives praise God so Jesus went out the Mount of Olives of course to pray before he was crucified and then he was also uh crucified there on galtha which was a hill not on uh Mariah because remember he was killed outside the gates we went on that recently when we preaching on the red heer he was crucified outside the the Temple Gates he had to be because he was unclean amen so we see that now I want to read uh some more scripture here uh let's go to Psalms 48 1 and 2 Psalms 481 and2 try to lay a background here 481 and2 great is the Lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our God in the mountain of his Holiness beautiful for situation the joy of the whole earth is Mount Zion on the sides of the north the city of the great king amen this is the joy of the whole earth God calls Jerusalem the joy of all the Earth why because that's where he dwelt amen inside that Temple was of course the holy place and you have the Hol of holies praise God the holiest of holies uh contained the Ark of the Covenant inside of the Ark at the beginning was the rod of Aaron right uh was a table of of the two tables of stone of The Commandments and then a pot of om right pot of om that had Mana in it amen that's what it had the beginning in the days of Moses now by the days of Jesus it had nothing in it from what I've read through history it was just a box it just a they had I'm sorry they don't have the Arc of the Covenant they was just an empty room in there they had nothing in there so it was just an empty place and why was that because God the real Ark was walking around outside amen he was out in Solomon's courts teaching the people praise God Amen God they didn't let God in his own Temple my that's how much they shut him out that's what they do today the Luke the lukewarm lyan church right he's knocking on the door trying to get in but they won't let him in they kicked him out because they don't want the gospel amen they don't want the true word of God same thing today it repeats my What a Sad thing but this is a beautiful situation to have God dwelling on the mountain God dwelling with the people remember God told Moses I will meet you there I will speak to you Above The Mercy Seat praise God Amen and now we today we often hear this that that your heart is like the ark today and that's a good type because the Bible said the holy spirit will write the word upon your heart and the Word was placed in the ark right of the Covenant the word that the law the Commandments given to Moses was written and and placed inside of the Ark so and God dwells by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul of the believer praise God so with the picture of the Ark of the Covenant we have a picture of the soul of the believer amen where God writes his word there where God lives there and God speaks to us amen he speaks to us from the Soul because that's the where his spirit is and his Spirit of course speaks to us so that's where God dwells amen now this is also called The Beloved City Revelation 20:9 so God loves this city remember this is the type of God's Dwelling Place Revelation 20:9 let's read that by God's grace so you're familiar Revelation 20 ver9 I know I'm just kind of going slow with these Lamey scriptures but I believe they're important Revelation 20:9 and they went up upon the breath of the earth and compassed the camp of the Saints about and the Beloved City and fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them now of course this is God and may God at the end of the Thousand Years but this is when Satan gathers all the nations now remember we preached on that in the Millennium we don't know exactly who they are we don't know if they'll be raised up people who never heard the message or somehow people made it through the fires of Armageddon we're not quite sure who it is we're not exactly told but one thing's for sure they will come against God's people and they will be burned so we don't want to be the Nations outside of the city we want to dwell with Christ right in the city amen hallelujah he's got to come in the Millennium and anoint that Temple again amen the the Millennium Temple and we must be there with him amen so the Bible calls it a beloved City now I'm going to go back here let's go back to uh Psalms 87 here verse two now I want to go back here because I I left off a quotation I want to read this quotation by God's grace I want you to see what God Said again about the gates 87 verse1 his foundation is the holy mountains the Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob amen now I want to read this here this illustration of gates deals with the gates that lead into the Temple of worship amen so let's read about that this is from a commentary I found here and I think you'll like it by God's grace I want you to get the picture now how many knows how many times how many times did God say every male must be appear before me how many knows in the Old Testament three times three times there were seven feasts but they had to appear three times and if they appeared three times and brought their tithes and offerings God would receive them if they appeared those three times they would actually stay for all seven feasts if you know the the history behind that they'd actually have to stay there and they could attend all seven feasts but God said three times a year remember it was in the spring uh twice in the spring and then once in the fall they had these feasts and these three feasts had little Feast with inside of them but God said three times a year you'll come and be gathered praise God for the Passover the Feast of Weeks and then for the Feast of trumpets amen glory you must gather for those and they're of course all close together except for the Beast and Feast of Tabernacles is you know in the seventh month the all the other feasts were in the first month and the third month so I want you to get this picture here the gates of a city were the places of concourse where business transacted where courts were held this illusion seems to be of the thronging multitudes pressing into the city for public worship the numbers that gathered together at the great feasts and festivals of the nation and the meaning is that God looked with more pleasure on such multitudes as they throng the gates pressing in the city that they might worship him than any other scene in all Israel amen don't you like that Hallelujah so God loved this God loved the gates of Zion God love the gates that led into the city of of David we' say the place of worship God Loved These Gates more than any other Gates can you imagine millions of people let's say hundreds of thousands of people flooding into the gates for Passover Amen to offer their lambs to worship God to sing the songs to feel that they were forgiven amen hallelujah or uh once a year on the day of atonement right in the seventh month the 10th day of the seventh month all of Israel could stand there when the Two Goats were killed the goat for sacrifice and the scapegoat when that scape of course that first goat was killed for Aaron and all the people and Anointed The Tabernacle and so forth but that second goat that second goat was called the scapegoat and that goat would be LED out of the city and they would be led so far away and all of Israel's sins was upon that goat amen Aon laid his hands and Aaron made the transfer of all his sins and all Israel all the sins were transferred to the scapegoat and a strong man led the goat away and they led him out of the city they leted him out of the uh out of the the the city uh limits and so forth and they led him to a cliff and they push him over the cliff and that represented that God took your C sins away as far as the East is from the West praise God and that your sin would die how many thankful that your sin's dead tonight amen and church can you imagine the feeling of the people when they were sincere that when they're just going through the motions okay can we get this over the goats got to leave come on can we Hur up and end end the service and they're all trying to get done but the people who really believed it and loved God as soon as the goat was the away they could rejoice and say my sins are gone amen you ask me why I'm happy let me tell you why all my sins got just taken away by the scapegoat and now we're forgiven and he imagine the shout and the glory that would go forth all the praise that would go up to God our sins are gone God loves us so much he's taken our sins away we stand forgiven before God today amen and God loves when people would come in the city Gates and come to worship with the right heart and the right attitude he loveed this all and all their properties in the land amen Hallelujah church amen that means tonight God loves this church more than the biggest mansion in Akon or fairl amen are you with me church he loves the places where God's people are ascended where they give worship where they receive forgiveness where they accept his sacrifice where they praise His name God loves that more than all the rest of the real estate a amen glory amen and that's a reality to Believers Church because we feel we feel our guft but then we also feel our forgiveness amen amen we also feel the guilt leave we also feel the shame leave when we truly confess and recognize him as our savior and as Our Redeemer and our Advocate our our lawyer amen our husband our judge and here in the house of judgment here is where he says you're free you're forgiven go and sin no more where else does he say that amen glory we ought to be thankful this is the house of God the Judgment seat of God God loves this place more than all other places in accur I say like that amen because it was his place of worship where his name was praised where he is exalted on high amen I'm not going to go over this because I already went over this but God loved Zion because it's our future home as well so God physically loved Jerusalem because that's where the future home is going to come down that's that's his uh that's his mansion uh that's his real estate that's his property amen that's where he's going to live with his wife for all the honeymoon and all eternity on that land amen that Holy Land praise God and that's also called of course the New Jerusalem praise the Lord now let's go to Deuteronomy 125 if we can Deuteronomy 125 this is a scripture I want to read I never preached this and I wanted to Austin and Benjamin I don't know if they've heard this and some of the new Saints uh not sure any other new ones are here tonight but uh I want them to hear this by God's grace brother BR preached a message called God's one provided place of worship how many know that message I think the first time I preached it was in' 65 if I'm not mistaken maybe 64 I know he preached it right or right before he preached the marriage and divorce now can somebody read that for me Deuteronomy 12 uh it's five and six can somebody read that for me for the place which the Lord your God has chose out of all your tries to put his name there even until his habitation shall you seek and thou sht come and ye shall bring your burnt offerings your sacrifices and your TI and he offerings of your hand and your vow and your free will offerings and first things of yours and of your flock amen praise God thank you brother so where where are they supposed to bring all their offerings to the place where God chose to place his name praise God now that's old test we're not required to go to Jerusalem right but God still plac his name somewhere that's the whole point of brother Ram's sermon God said I I'm only going to take Worship in one spot and you have to come to that spot that's why God required the men to come the men had to come because they're going to answer they're the leaders right they're the heads and they're going to answer right so God required the men to come but in the New Testament let's go to Hebrews 2:12 Hebrews 2:12 then Malachi Malachi you get John 543 now Hebrews 2:12 in the New Testament now it's not a physical location but it's Christ amen Hebrews 2:12 all right I got this here it is saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee amen now this is a scripture David wrote but here Paul is quoting it in the New Testament that who fulfilled it who fulfilled it Church Christ Christ did this Christ declared God's name unto the Brethren and in the midst of the church he's saying praise amen so Christ was in the church amen hallelujah and see he declared the name of God now Mali read John 543 got it you receive back if another shall come in his own name will receive amen praise God he said I'm come in my father's name right I come in my father's name so Jesus came in God's name so brother said where does he place his name B said he did not place his name in Braham Tabernacle Glory he did not place his name in Jerusalem anymore he doesn't place his name in any denomination thank God for that amen he said he plac his name in in Jesus Christ amen and so today if the Holy Ghost is with us Jesus Christ spirit is with us and that's why we're saying that he will be glorified here if we are still LED of the Holy Ghost amen glory and so we would say he placed his name here because his people are here that have his Spirit praise God but as soon as his people leave that have a spirit that he's not here anymore right his name's not here anymore so it's not so so much the pro as is the people on the property amen or The God in the people on the property Hallelujah that's what it's really about amen God's name is in Christ and we must be baptized into Christ and then we bear forth the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah wonderful now I want to uh go to Psalms 37 because we preach on it already how judgment begins in the house of God here's the reason people don't like coming to church because they know they're going to be told they're wrong right that's why a lot of people hang out of church they know they're wrong they know they're living wrong and they don't want to be judged right but look what God Said judgment must be the house of God but in Psalms 37 uh it's going to be verses 27- 31 37 27- 31 let's look what the scripture says depart from Evil and do good and dwell forever more for the Lord loveth what what does God love judgment God loves to tell you right and wrong praise God we don't like it so much especially when we're wrong but God loves it and this is the house of judgment judgment begins where at the house of God so God has to love this house because this is where his judgment's going forth he has to and forsaketh not of saints he loves judgment and forsakes not his Saints AR you glad amen they are preserved forever but the the seed of the wicked shall be cut off the righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein forever the mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom and his tongue tth of judgment see when you really love God and you go to church you talk about what was said at church because it was God's judgment right and the Bible said his tongue talketh of judgment God loves judgment and God loves his word so when you really love God you talk about what was preached you talk about the Judgment that came during the word of God during the preaching of the word look at verse 31 the law of his God is in his heart none of his steps shall slide Hallelujah so see when you talk about judgments God is this right is that wrong and I I'll say like this some people you know hammer on this you know Christianity is not a do and don't religion now I understand that I understand what they're saying it's not like a to-do list I understand that but at the same time God loves right and wrong God loves to tell you right and wrong are you with me church he loves judgment he loves loves to tell you to do this don't do that so understand you know Christianity is more than just a to-do list Christianity is a a life that's lived based upon the Commandments of God Amen and it has to have a list of do this and don't do that amen amen you can't separate to do and not to do because he that loves God keeps all the commands of God Amen they do the commands of God so we got to be careful you when people say oh we're not legalist yeah we're not legalists because legalists take words they they add to the word of God they go ex legalism actually means excessive adherence to the Bible right or so they basically create things that are excessive in the word and are not needed anymore and that's legalism but strict obedience is love I'll say it again strict obedience to the word of God is love because that's what Jesus did Jesus said I always do that which please the father are you with with me so can you see that God loves judgment God loves to judge a matter and say this is right this is wrong he loves that because he had he's the spirit of what truth and he hates iniquity he hates sin he separates that from himself he cannot be he cannot dwell with that he must separate from it he loves truth he loves the spirit of Truth amen all right now go to Isaiah 61 Isaiah 61 you see this all over the scripture these are just too beautiful to pass up you go to we got to see these and God give us time to do it so let's do it Isaiah 618 and10 glory for I the Lord love what judgment God loves judgment I hate robbery for burnt offering and I'll direct their work in truth and I'll make an Everlasting Covenant with them and their seed should be known among the Gentiles and their offspring among the people all that see them shall ackowledge them that they are the seed which the Lord hath blessed amen I will greatly rejoice in the Lord my soul shall be joyful in my God he ha clothed me with the garments of Salvation amen glory he ha covered me with a robe of righteous as a bridegroom deck deth himself with ornaments and as a bride adorned herself with her Jewels what's he saying when you really love God the word of God clothes you because keeping the word of God is the righteousness of saints the bride is clothed with fine linen and fine linen is what the righteousness The Obedience of saints Hallelujah God loves judgment and when the Bible says I rejoice when I keep the word because I'm decked out like a bride who's ready to be married who doesn't like watching a wedding remember we talked about who doesn't like to see a beautiful bride walk down the aisle who don't like to see the Purity on the day of wedding amen who don't like to see that everybody likes everybody stands and they just can't we want to get a look at the bride by look at her she's all beautiful and pure well how much more the Bride of Jesus Christ by the blood of Jesus Christ when she keeps the word she stands there 100 times pure than a natural woman because she's pure by the blood the spirit makes her pure she's dressed in the righteousness of Jesus Christ amen amen glory go to Psalms 84 Psalms 84 we're going to stay in Psalms just for a few more minutes here by God's grace I don't know if I'll be able to finish tonight uh maybe Sunday by God's grace and I told you I felt led to do a series on Holy Ghost baptism so I'm going to Lord willing start that on Sunday if God's willing Psalms 84 this is a scripture you know it's quoted quite often verse one how amiable that means lovely how lovely are the Tabernacles of the Lord of hosts so that's the outer Court inner Court h of holies my soul longth yet even faints for the courts of the of the Lord my heart and flesh crith out for the Living God so that's what our that's how we should feel about church this is how I feel about church now for me I gotta Minister and I gotta make sure my heart's ready for service every service so that's why I'm desperate for for every service right that's why I cry out to God God speak to us God deal with us God strengthen us God forgive us God help us because I know I've got a minister there but it's different when more than one person or many people come with this kind of expectation or this kind of a hunger because those who come hungry and thirsting will be filled praise God it's hard to find that but it exists in this hour because God never leaves himself without a witness Hallelujah yay the spare I found in house and lay her young even thine altars oh lord of hosts my king and my God so even the Birds rest in the house of God they let them rest there Hallelujah less are they that dwell in thy house they will be still praising thee that means constant praising that don't mean stand still like a dead statue and not sing and clap and turn all around and look all around and jump all around and hop all around that means they'll be constantly praising thee praise God they that dwell in the house of God constantly praise the Lord am yes sir and they're blessed sometimes we wonder where's the blessings well are we in the house of God and are we coming to God's house like he said crying out of the Living God are we coming with the right attitude that's what it produces it produces a blessing now verse six who passing through I'm sorry verse five blessed is the man whose strength is in thee in whose heart are the ways of them amen who passing through the valley of baka make it a well the rain also fill the pools they go from strength to strength every one of them in Zion appear before God now I remember I preached on this years ago I'm just going to go for memory people that live far from Jerusalem had to travel quite a ways to get to Jerusalem in order for the feast and they travel you know in Harvest Time where there wouldn't be much rain but on their travel there they might get a rain so they would dig holes they would dig like the Bible said here they would dig in order to catch some of the water they would dig a well and then rain would pull their pool fill their pool in other words when they're on their way to God's house it'd be dry but because they're going to God's house God would send them rain amen and they just had to dig up whole and and they knew if I just keep going to church God's going to send a rainen in other words God will provide if I do my part and obey the word and go to God's house God will give me the rest amen oh but it's so hard to find that these days isn't it people that go that kind of attitude I know even though it's dry on my way somehow God will meet my need if I just go to his house amen because they know they have to appear before God they know church every church service is opportunity to come before God and ask for Grace because we know we're going to stand before him one day but we can stand before him now and receive Grace so that when we stand before him at the Judgment seat of Christ we have nothing to worry about because we've already made it right right here praise God amen amen we've already seen the judge I've already heard what the judge said I already know his forgiveness for me I already know his Mercy for me I know he's living in me and I know what he's going to say when I meet the judge amen there's no doubt because he already told me amen amen oh my church hallelujah what a desire for a Christian this hour to appear before God he's our Advocate he's our lawyer he's also our judge amen he's our jury as well because he's he said these three bear witness in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost each each of those manifestations is a witness is that right isn't the even isn't the invisible Spirit a witness for you doesn't the invisible Spirit know all things amen okay how about the the word the Bible said these three witness or the one witness how about the word isn't the written word right here a witness for you amen praise God that you kept the word you Ser the the word and how about the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost inside of you isn't that a witness to go before God Amen that you kept the word and the Holy Ghost won't lie amen hallelujah so these three are witnesses they're three manifestations of the same God but they all give witness to your life amen look at verse seven so when they get this rain what do they do they get stronger and stronger every one of them in his Z appear before God so as they would have let's say they had a weak a weak travel by uh by by horse or by donkey or by walking they would get stronger as they got closer to God's house that's what I feel too don't you praise God as soon as I'm pulling the parking lot I'm feeling so much better Glory but if you had a hard week you feel so far from God just coming to God's house you get stronger and stronger as you come amen amen if you're coming with the right attitude that's exactly that's what the Bible says now these are Eternal words amen not my words God's words the Lord God of hosts hear my prayer give ear oh god of Jacob say loud behold oh God our shield and look upon the face of that anointed see look he comes to God's house and he's anointed is it that's how we should come too right come to God's house and get anointed how do you get anointed we get all the sin off your life confess all your sins and then God can anoint you God can't anoint a heart that's condemned because we have no confidence with God if our hearts condemn us so we must confess all the sin that's on our heart and then he can anoint us praise God that's the only way the Bible said though they That Walk In the Flesh uh I'm sorry the Bible said that when you crucify the the lust and the affections thereof of the flesh then you walk in the spirit that's the only way to know you're walk in the spirit I don't care if I don't feel one power or one emotion for God if I have overcome sin all day brother sister I know I'm walking the Holy Ghost amen amen as long as I confess my sin I don't have to feel nothing because God's word said I am anointed amen when I confess my sin when I say I'm wrong when I ask God to forgive me for thinking that thought or looking at that or saying that I know I'm walk in the spirit because the flesh won't lead you to repentance the Holy Ghost will lead you to repentance the kindness of God leads you to repentance Hallelujah I want to get to verse 10 for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand than a thousand so one day in church is better than over three years outside of church anybody say Amen to that one day in God's house is better than three years anywhere else praise God I wonder why I just don't understand why people wouldn't want to come to God's house then I had rather a be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of the wicked so if your only job was to open the doors for people and let them into worship that the Bible said that's more enjoyable right that's more enjoyable than to dwell with sinners in wickedness so if you're the one that gets pushed oh come on I'm trying to get in come on open the doors I need to get in if you're the one get no brother BR called it a doormat too you rather be a doormat in the house of God but the Bible actually says a doorkeeper so we'll just say it's like the same thing you understand it's the people who are the furthest away from the worship the very lowest of the servants I'd rather be the lowest of the servant of God than be a wicked sinner amen glory I'd rather be in church one day than three years anywhere else amen the blessings are so much greater and this is under the Old Testament this is under the blood of bulls and goats amen not the blood of Jesus that thoroughly wipes away all your sin even the conscience of sin it takes away amen that awareness remember your conscious is your awareness your awareness that you've sinned only the holy ghost in the New Testament can take away your awareness that you're a sinner and now you don't think that anymore now you know you're a son or daughter of God I'm not thinking about my sin I'm not a sinner I'm a believer I'm a Christian My Flesh sins but I'm not amen glory he that's born of God does not commit what he don't commit he and she don't commit sin because they're born again of the seed of God within them amen that's what we look at as a Christian yes we look at our flesh we say God forgive us we confess our wrongs but when it comes down to are we gods are we forgiven or not we say we cannot sin anymore because we got God in the soul we're born again amen and that seed cannot sin that life that nature that Soul cannot sin verse 11 for the Lord God is a son in the shield the Lord will give Grace and Glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly oh lord of hosts blessed is a man that trusts in thee no good thing will he withhold from someone that walks honestly uprightly before God he'll give you all the good things you need what a promise that is my goodness look at Psalms 147 let's go to Psalms 147 towards the end of the book Psalms 147 this is all old test M now I want to read 1 to seven but I want to kind of get moving on here um we'll start verse one Praise You the Lord for it is good to sing praise unto our God for it is pleasant and it is calmly the Lord do build up Jerusalem he gathered together the outcast of Israel he healed the broken and heart and bindeth up their wounds CH what's he saying it's a pleasant thing to worship God Amen the church was a gathering of brokenhearted people that are not brokenheart anymore now they're healed amen amen they used to be outcasts but now they're accepted now they're Sons and Daughters amen the world made them Outcast but God makes us family amen that's why I don't care if I lost all my friends I gain God I gain Christ I gain brother amen Christ is our brother amen let me lose all that let me gain Christ amen that's my life this is the word of the Lord although we used to be out it's just like David's Mighty Men remember they were all outcasts but when they saw a man that could take uh the word of God and live it and cast down Goliath they said I can support a man like that glory and that's what we did when we seen the Holy Ghost right that's what we seen when we seen brother Bram that's what we seen we said will follow a man who's got the leadership of the Holy Ghost and I want my life to look like that as a local Minister that you see the Holy Ghost healing in the ministry that's what we desire praise God Amen that's what God always had a witness on the earth and he had he's always had a bunch of Mighty Men praise God wonder if he's got any mighty men that can that can judge the right the right situation he needs mighty men that can judge this is the right thing to do this is the wrong thing to do praise God this is the right direction for your life that's the wrong direction for your life God loves judgment praise God he loves the house of God for that's where judgment Goes Forth like I told some of these brothers lately you know they're giving their hearts to God and following God I said if you don't know the decision to make I said listen to me follow me as I follow Christ that's quite a statement to say but it's Bible amen praise the Lord that's exactly the scripture the Bible said follow them whose Faith uh has been tried and tested amen I've been walking this way since 2001 I've been walking the message amen so I got a few years behind me but the point is follow my faith the Bible said God gives us pastors so that you follow their example in other words live like them have faith like them amen because they're following God Amen said there's no higher order in the whole church than the local Pastor as far as to that assembly praise God how you believe that now the highest preaching gift is the apostle know that but the highest office locally is a pastor even an apostle cannot walk in and change the church the church as a whole must vote to remove a pastor the church as a whole must vote to remove remove deacons and soth I'm sorry I believe brother said a pastor can remove a deacon but to to change the leadership in the local assembly one man can't do it it's the body that must do it amen because that's the highest office the shepherd has the highest office in the local assembly but but not of course the highest preaching office that's Apostle then Prophet amen now what is worship worship is Pleasant to God Worship Is cely God loves to be worshiped amen when did Jesus ever stop anybody from kissing his feet can anybody show me that anybody ever show me where Jesus stopped somebody from worshiping him he never did he let him just stand right there and say my Lord and my God he let him kiss his feet he let him cry on his feet he loved to be worshiped he never stopped any body from worshiping him amen and God won't stop you from worshiping him tonight amen he'll accept your worship it's Pleasant you'll be blessed as you bless him because he dwells in the Praises of his people all right Psalm 63 verse one after this I'm after this I'm going to try to make a little pivot here and go a little different Direction kind of bring this down on the home Psalms 63 1-8 by God's grace verse one 63 verse one oh God Thou Art my God early will I seek thee my soul thirst for thee my flesh longth for thee and a dry and thirsty land where no water is look at this you got brother said you got to have a desperation for God he said if you don't have a desperation for God God won't answer your prayer praise God listen to desperation 1963 you got to be desperate for God and then God will come on the seene you got to thirst for it to see thy power and thy Glory so have I have seen the thee in the sanctuary because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee amen thus will I bless thee while I live I will lift up my hands to thy name my soul shall be satisfied as with tomorrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips when I remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches because thou has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy Wings will I Rejoice my soul fth hard after thee thy right hand upholdeth me now church I just want to share this recently I was holding Victoria at night trying to get her to bed and I you know I had I had a few things I struggle with that day and I said I propped up a few pillows so I could you know not lean flat because she don't like to lay flat she likes me to lay at an angle and church as I sat there I I was on my phone I started reading the scripture or something like that and I started confessing my sin I made a mistake that day I said God forgive me I said Lord I want to serve you better and as I after I got done confessing I started thinking about how God showed me this message I started thinking about this scripture right here where the Bible said when I remember thee on my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches I started crying God's my witness I started crying there right there on my bed thanking God and I started thinking that song I Feel the pull because the Bible said or that I'm sorry the song says I lay on my bed and I begin to cry and I don't know wonder and I wonder why but church I didn't wonder why because I knew I was crying because I was thankful God forgave me and that God loves me amen and that God would think of me sister brother to bring me into the greatest message uh in our day praise the Lord there's a lot of messages out there but we've got the the message from God we have thus say the Lord from God we have the revelation of the hour the light of the hour that God would Place me in that instead of some sinful sin loving church or something like that that made me cry and the Bible said we should meditate on our beds in the night watches amen glory let's make our beds a place to cry and praise God amen amen and not a place to look at the wrong thing right or say the wrong thing that's where the devil got into people's lives first brother said first he got go to picture shows and then he tricked them and brought TVs in their house right and then he brought in the bedroom and now the bedroom is not even a place to pray anymore now it's just an entertain spot God don't want us have entertainment God wants us to have life God wants us to have joy God wants us to have love God wants us to have a reality of his word in our lives a living reality not the American dream but a Christian reality that's what we're after amen a reality of Christ's presence in our life amen now like I said I want to start bringing this down here those are some of the most important scriptures uh I think that that would be good for us here tonight uh everybody love the Lord amen I'm going to try to make I might read maybe just a few more scriptures I'm just going to be referencing a few okay now let's go to Hebrews 10 I want end with this one as far as just maybe reading scriptures and I just wrote down a whole bunch of burdens on my heart I like to share with the Saints now I want you to understand as we turn to Hebrews chapter 10 that as pastor of the church I know what brother man said I'm the ax of the team the ax of the team carries the most burden right right you have an ax and you they carry the burd that's why you got an ax that can work do so I understand I should have the greatest burden for this ministry right I should that burden um and I I try to have that by God's grace to keep my life pure to preach and study and pray and go visit people and do what I can and and be a Ser real servant to Christ I should have the greatest burden I really should now let's read uh Hebrews 10 because after we read this this is the scripture where brother R often quotes that we should not skip church we should attend every time the doors are open how many you believe that amen we should do that every time the doors are open uh so let's uh let's look at this here by God's grace Hebrews 10:24 now and let us consider one another to revoke unto love and to Good Works so let's stop right there we should consider people and we should provoke them to love and to Good Works provoke of course what you would say means to inspire or motivate them right we should live such a a life that we should motivate each other to live closer to Christ now that's manifested in many ways you could sing a song you could text somebody you could pray for somebody you could give somebody something they need right you visit somebody there's all kinds of ways to encourage but look this is and then there's a a colon after that which means it's going to keep going on it's going to list how you do this so how do you provoke love and good works in the body of Christ you do this by not forsaking that means abandoning the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of sum is I don't want to be the sum in this scripture I don't want to be the son I want be those that gather I want to be a gatherer praise God not the some that abandon the house of God but those who are faithful to the house of God Amen but exhorting one another so instead of forsaking because remember uh that's what I'm sorry instead of abandoning which forsaken instead of abandoning church and the Saints you should exort one another and so much the more as you see that day approaching now exort means to strengthen so let me start looking at this a little bit here I want to just get into a few thoughts here the Bible says that we exhort one another we should provoke one another that's quite quite plain there by God's grace and how do you do that how do you strengthen brother Austin how do you strengthen brother Benjamin how do you strike the brother Jose how do you do that the Bible said you gather together and you edify them okay you love them the Bible said you love them so you find out how does this brother or sister need love and that's what you give them amen so if they need time with you or if they need a gift from you they need a hug from you if they need encouraging word from you uh they need a visit from you you give them what they need to feel love praise God if there's a work that they have need of then you help them with their work that's the way a real Christian Church uh response praise God so let me start here I told I emailed everybody I said I'm gonna give some warnings for those who Miss services for the I'm talking about for the wrong reasons now everybody bear with me on live stre I've got out for the the wrong reasons if you're sick and you can't make it to church I understand that if your boss forces you to work I understand that but if you voluntarily miss church to work off of volunteering uh you should EX examine your life at that point right or if you just don't be like going or if you put anything else above Church you really should examine your life because you're missing God's judgment you're missing what God loves and then also if you don't attend what the now what the Bible says here you lose influence with other Christians because the only way to edify them is to see them a text is not enough God said Gather and assemble and be with them don't abandon Gathering as you see that day approaching and he said gather more as you see that day approaching so let me give you a warning you start losing your influence with people because you don't you're not there to love them you're not there to help them you're not there to encourage them so people start they don't receive your influence as much anymore because you're not loving them like you ought to I've told this to people before just you coming to church raises my faith tremendously when I wonder where so and so and somebody come to church it just puts a huge and some of you probably seen it puts a huge smile on my face it it just lifts my face so much to see God's people come to God's house that in itself makes me want to serve God more when when people come to the house of God now of course it works that way with each other too right doesn't encourage you you get to talk to people out the parking lot or get to pray for people up here aren't you glad that people come and pray for you here doesn't that encourage you do that strengthen you well if you miss church here's a warning you start losing influence and you can't influence people like you ought to in other words you stop living you're really stopping living for other people you should be living for the PE the family of God the Bible said do good to all man but especially those of the household of faith now I couldn't find a scripture on the word confidence so I'm not going to say confidence because people might not lose confidence in you uh if you don't come to church I don't want to say that because I couldn't find a scripture on that and if you find one let me know but your influence you can't if you miss church for the wrong reasons people will not receive your influence your testimony doesn't mean as much as it could you could have more impact upon people now that's what the Bible said you provoke one another to good works and exhorting more as you see that day approaching so when you miss church even physically and you could be there you miss a chance to strengthen the rest of the body of Christ how many believe the Bible's true that's one warning that's a reality and brother baram said this if you miss the word of God in the small manners he said the rest of it will go right over your head my goodness brother said those who have obeyed in these small things will catch it and there's other things if they have it it'll go over the top of their head as far as the East is from the West if we can't even obey the simple command of gathering more and not abandoning the church how how are we going to get the Deep things of God if we can't even catch the simple things of God praise God Amen how are we gonna get rapture in faith when we can't even obey gather more as you see that day approaching oh my church that that's why start doing Sunday night services because Church the Bible said we got to gather together more how are you doing it if we're so busy when do we gather with Saints on Monday through Saturday when very little don't we so your pastor just felt l a few years ago let's do Sunday night services and then God sent a man Nam named amen Lee on the Sunday night and he got saved and come in the message Hallelujah and Le is fill with the Holy Ghost now why because we had a Sunday night service praise God he couldn't come in the morning because he was at the Mong church he couldn't come in the morning he could come in the evening time praise God when people start missing Church they lose opportunities to influence others and they can't influence others as well as they could and I'll say like this like I just said if we if we can't obey these simple things about just coming to church paying ties loving God singing worship and praising God with a humble heart how are we going to catch the deeper things brother Braham said do the ABCs first and then you'll get spiritual algebra Hallelujah is that what he said they said brother you ought to teach these women to gifts and spiritual things he said how can I teach them algebra gifts when they won't even obey cutting their hair coming to church not wearing makeup not smoking and drinking amen if you can't obey the ABCs How You Gonna Be Ready for algebra now remember a Holy Ghost Church gives warnings how many you know that Colossians one let's read that just briefly that's why I feel L of the Lord just to give a warning tonight if we say we're Christians and brother said if you got the Holy Ghost you can say Amen to every word of God if I'm preaching God's word and you got the Holy Ghost you should be able to say Amen to it that's right Colossians one the very last few scriptures now verse 20 27 is Christ in you the hope of glory what is that that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost how many you know that amen now look at the very next scripture whom we preach so we preach Christ warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus that's what I'm doing tonight I'm trying to warn people that don't come to church as much as they used to right I'm trying to warn those that do come to church like we'll said we'll balance it out because just because we come to church don't mean we're right Pharisees came to church a lot too is that right denomination people can go more Church than some of us sometimes but it's the condition in which you come amen it's the condition once you get here so there's a warning for all of us I'm not just pointing fingers at people that you know aren't coming to church all the time I'm well I'm warning everybody I got to make sure my heart doesn't get hard because the Bible said uh the minister must give the meat and due season if not he'll start get drunken with his own lust and start beating the people and I don't want to hurt the people because I've seen preachers that hurt the people praise God they put too much on them that they themselves don't even do but church I try to I I try not to ask anybody to do anything that I'm not doing I won't ask you to fast unless I'm fasting myself amen I would ask you to come to church unless I'm coming to church myself amen amen and that's why we have to live we have to live that right that way before all men amen now the second thing is that as parents I want to get to the parents there's a warning for parents when we don't come to the house of God it's sending a message to our children I'm not saying it like I said there's reasons that you miss if there's real Reasons I'm talking about if there's not a reason if there's not a real reason to this church it sends the message that God's house is not the most important thing it always sends that message it says it's well church is just optional word did God say that in all those scripture we just read he said Joy was there he said love was there he said he loved judgment he said he loved that place more than any other place you could go hallelujah amen it sends the message that God is really not number one serving God is optional praise God the Bible said Jesus in Luke 4:16 as his custom was he went into the Sabbath on the Sabbath day custom means habit Jesus's habit was he was in church every Saturday because he said I always to those things that please the father so it pleased God that Jesus never missed church he was always in the always in the the synagogue or temple on the Sabbath day yeah praise God so Jesus's example is that we obey the Lord amen now let me go down to some more quotes from brother Brandon that we can see these I want I want to lay a few more warnings that will be done here by God's grace brother says this and God keeps his word 1957 you say you have to love the Lord you ought to go to church brother BR said you don't have to tell them people that they go anyhow so brother says you don't have to tell people that they should go to church he said the real Christians will do it anyhow they'll walk through rain to go to church he says hallelujah they'll go through death to go to church sure they love it they just got to get there that's all there is to it it's their life if they don't they feel like they're perishing now all of us can remember when the times we love God the most where we felt bad when we missed Church anybody say Amen to that that's what brother says a real Christian feels like they're perishing if they can't hear the preaching of the word because Jesus said when he ascended I'm sending five gifts to preach and these gifts will preach and they will edify they will perfect will complete the Bride of Jesus Christ they will bring her to a Unity of the faith and the bride wants to be a part of that because that's why Jesus gave the gifts so she could be perfect amen right without without with with missing Church you feel like your Soul's perishing because it hasn't fed on the word of God lately amen okay even said this he said when people complain say he says this you say well I well I got to get up and get the kitties ready to go to church this morning brother said oh my you've never touched the resurrection brother when the resurrection has come into your heart you long to go to church there's something that you just can't keep away from it something inside praise God Amen brother B says for if you love God you couldn't wire you away from church they couldn't chain you away from it they can't hide a Believer from God people can't bind you and chain you up at your house you'll break loose just to come to church now I thought everybody said they believe God sent a prophet right how do you believe every word brother R said amen well then let's live like it praise God if God sent a Propet let's do what he said amen amen I just happen to believe that brother Ram was right if you you got the Holy Ghost and you're born again nobody can keep you out of the house of God you'll go to church because you feel like you're dying if you don't amen amen amen hallelujah brother said I'll go to church he said even if I can't get a wholeo I'll take a slice I'll go listen and show him that I'm doing my part I want everyone to know which side I'm on so when you miss church people wonder which side is brother so and so on huh what side his sister so and so on if they don't come to church when they ought to see it gives a spirit of confusion is God the author of confusion no sir God is not the author of confusion praise God now I want to find the quote about um yeah here it is brother said Christ the mystery this is a very familiar one but listen brother said don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in there to fellowship with your brothers amen if you don't feel that way I tell you it's time you got praying because we're in the last days and the Bible exort us to much more as we see that day approaching to love one another and assemble ourselves together in Heavenly places so your motivation to come to church is to see the people you love the most amen I like a lot of people but the people I love the most are sitting here tonight and live streaming by God's grace who do I spend my free time with I'm looking at them praise God who do I love and try to help out I'm looking at him amen praise the Lord the people you love the most should be church people amen your church family amen it ought to be if not brother says time you got the praying and this even ties you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost because brother R said if God's in your heart you can't wait for somebody to open those doors out there or door the door there's only one door for this church coming the door Christ is the door amen you understand what I'm saying so this to me Church attendance ties in with the baptism of the Holy Ghost because if they were saying how my if David was saying how my soul Longs for the house of God in the Old Testament when the Holy Ghost could not be given what about here where we got the Holy Ghost and we can't wait to get with our family that we're going to spend eternity with Hallelujah so the warning is you lose your influence people don't they don't they can't feel that you love them now they might know as a Christian but they can't feel it praise God they can't feel your love because that's why you come said to love one another when brother Jose sings a special he's shown his love for God but also Us Praise the Lord when you come to church and help somebody out or give somebody ride to church or you know help them out with some money or help them out with some clothes or whatever you're loving them we ought to love each other better than everybody else I tell you it's a shame if you love Sinners more than you love this group this wonderful group right here because those Sinners were turning their back on you real fast and you start talking about God Amen and God's your real father a God's your real family amen these are the people we all love right here praise the Lord no doubt about that said you got God in your heart you can't hardly wait till church to start so let me say to our live streamers if God's in their heart and they can't come to church they can't wait to turn on the computer to live stream glory glory glory amen I believe that brother ra said if you don't have a church home you'll die of course we know a church home we know that brother R said once you get saved he said remain faithful at your post of Duty until you until you die let me read this quote some of us forget about this where is it here it is brother Brandon when he ordained Perry green as a a Pastor said this what house will you build me November 21st 1965 he said we ought to be very grateful to God that they open up a church like this and he said and attend every service I'm going to read that again we to be very grateful to God and attend every service that's why that's a warning to to the people and everyone everyone that's a warning to people that aren't here brother brand said attend every service and the church said am that's what the message says that's what Jesus did amen he was his customed to go to God's house he declared God's name to his Brethren brother said take every place that we can and if we're asked now look if we're asked to call on to pray to seek to do let's be soldiers just anxious to do it that's what brother brandom said now let me share this for last Saturday I asked people to come to the church and pray and fast two people came I'm not upset and I'm not gonna I'm not going to bash anybody but I I hope if you weren't here I hope you at least praying for Christopher and and Samuel that's what I sent the email about brother B said if some somebody asked you to pray he said be anxious to do it if somebody asked you to do something he said be anxious to do it if you didn't fast for Christopher would you do it I hope you I hope you will I just missed two meals on Saturday I ate Saturday after service so I ate about you know 8 o'clock every service that's I didn't eat the food all day if I'm gonna fast I'm gonna fast and I invited everybody to fast with me is that right here's what I did church I read this quote uh in a Sunday night service recently and I got convicted so let me read it to you brother R said this and I showed this to the other person that was here on Saturday when we were fasting and praying brother B said when we bring the sick up before us and they fail to be healed we need to call a solemn fast and call assembly something's wrong somewhere God made the promise God's got to stick to that promise and he'll do it I read that quote on a Sunday night recently not many people are here well God knows where everyone is at I don't know where at I love everybody but I love God's house so I'm going to come to church I wasn't sick so I'm going to come to church all right so that's I'm just saying I come I believe I believe what brother said I come to church but Christopher we brought him up here numerous times and he hasn't been healed and last or two Wednesdays ago I saw Jose there crying about Christopher I said let's fast and pray I just be led let's fast and pray I gave everybody nine days notice and two people showed up fine that's fine that's between you and the Lord but I want you to know I read what brother R said and I believed it I called a f asked and brother said we should be anxious to do something if you're asked to do it that's for the live streamers that's for here and that's for those who are not streaming that hopefully will stream later the archive I felt that was let of the Lord to fast and pray when people don't get healed something's wrong we need to fast and say what's wrong am I sinting is there sin in the church is somebody lusting is somebody breaking the law is somebody stealing what's wrong the sick should be healed amen amen and I did and God knows I did what brother random said I called a fast and I invited the whole church to come now here's where I made a mistake I challenged you remember I said I challenged you last Wednesday so forgive me I need to apologize for that I feel like I just went a little bit too far in my flesh so forgive me I did challenge the church I need to repent of that I I'll try to apologize on Sunday if I don't forget if I forget somebody remind me say brother just you need to apologize so church I'm sorry I got a little bit overboard I challenge people to come but now in the light of what brother Ram said attend every service and when the sick don't get healed I gave everybody nine days notice to come pray and fast I hope somebody was praying and fasting at their house if not I'll call another one and I expect you to if you believe God God said a prophet I expect you to do what the prophet said if not get right with God get on your knees get on your face and pray if not you're lukewarm I'll just say like that lukewarm is everybody with me amen I want to read that how many believe that by God's grace I'll be with all my heart and here's some wisdom I want to give because here are some reasons where even I've been tempted not to T tend church and I'm the pastor I I get tempted like everybody else here's one reason now work constraints like we said if it's something mandatory yes but if that keeps up for a long time let me say like this and everybody listen it's time you got praying for another job because you're missing the anointing of the Holy Ghost to church and you're losing influence with the Believers not able to love them and build them up like you ought to how many can say Amen to that it's time you got praying for a different job I pray for those brothers that work second shift I pray for them often God give them a new job God give them a new job so they can come on Wednesday night because we need God on Wednesday night God's heal people on Wednesday night sister H God's heal me on Wednesday night amen we need God every hour praise the Lord what if it's every now and then like Jose you know different brothers that got to work on you amen but I'm still praying that God will give these brothers Jobs first shift or third then you can attend service you understand what I'm saying so see you need to have a solution if you're missing Church ask God for a solution is God is work greater than God is anything too hard for God nothing is too hard for God brother man said all too little time is spent on laboring for the Eternal rewards of God there's rewards we can get here at church if we pray for people amen and we brother man said we do not spend enough time laboring for the rewards of God that's why we have more services so we can have more chances to pray and try to do things for the Lord try to manifest his love towards people here's another one we're too tired on Sunday church if anyone knows about being tired on Sunday it's my family night I got six kids amen my wife gets them all up while I'm studying she gets them all gets them dress gets them fat all these things like that Mal kind l or great help but if anybody understands tired on a Sunday I sometimes I teach Sunday school on Sunday I lead songs on Sunday both services and preach both services and you want to see who's tired on Monday you understand what I'm saying if anybody knows tired it's me but tiredness is not excuse to not come to God's house and here's a big here's a good some good advice if you know Sunday's going to be long what should you do on Saturday Church rest go to bed early yes go to bed early and make Saturday your day of rest because Sunday is your spiritual rest where you get the rest for your soul and you can feel good in your soul every time almost every time I walk out those doors on Sunday night I'm tired of My Flesh but my soul feels like I'm a million miles high in Heavenly places hallelujah amen so it's an excuse tiredness is an excuse if you're tired on Sunday then you better relax Saturday don't drive all around and go all kind of places and run yourself ragged on Saturday rest Saturday so you can give God your day Sunday that's my advice to the church for all those who feel led to do what brother Bram said and attend every service like I said there's different reasons talk to me you know there's different reasons sure well we'll talk about it but the Bible said we must gather more brother ra said I just read it must gather more as we see that day approaching if you're not doing it now when you gonna do it when's your plan to do it let's make a plan to do it by God's grace well say just don't talk about it if it's something good do it Hallelujah everybody love the Lord and people just say there's not enough time well how much time do you spend on your phone that could be time could be redeemed right there's a there's a way you can go on your phone and figure out how much time you spend on those apps did you know that we should do that we should do that one time during service let's examine ourselves and see whether we're good managers of our time or if you know it's going to be a special weekend rest during the week if you possibly can I know the enemy comes in like a flood but then you if he comes in tired then just rest try to rest up as much you can and come to God's house and give him praise give him praise how do you know that's not the service where God's going to pour out the blessing I've been healed twice instantly in church brother Austin twice instantly I was healed Glory what if I would have said I'm too tired to go to church that day I have missed out on the healing how many people have I seen healed in Services well that' probably go into like few dozen just because they came to God's house amen and what about the wisdom that you receive in Services just to live your life and make this decision do this instead don't do that follow God's Will and worship feel close to God when do you feel that any other place yeah in your prayer closet but what other time throughout the week it's time to go to God's house it's time to do that now let me go through a few more and now I got to give the warnings for those who do attend oh here's another one we got to be careful here's a warning the leot toan spirit is the spirit of I have need of nothing how many you know that the rich increas in blind and have need of nothing so the attitude of Le is I have enough of God I don't need any more of God I don't need any more church services because I have enough that's the attitude of Le oia so I want to stay a million miles away from that praise God sometimes church we ought look at ourselves and we all we ask some of these Saints who been around longer even when I was growing up in Pentecostal we would have uh we would have Revival Services Monday through Sunday every night I've never done that the most I've done is Wednesday Sunday so I'm like two days behind that was in P that was in denomination they were trying to get closer to God what about us now how many would come if I called a Revival for a whole week how many well I don't know but brother Bram said you ought to have a when those doors are open you ought to H if you're born again you can't wait for those that door to open that's a prophet of God Amen another thing Jesus said this is the House of Prayer so the warning is if you don't come to church you're probably going to pray less amen if you if you can come to church but rather live stream when you could come to church there's danger in that too you got to be careful in that there's warnings for that because at home it's a lot easier to get distracted from the word I I I I don't like live streaming at all I get distracted too much I just can't sit there and stare at the computer screen I got I I feel like I got to do something that's why that's another reason why I love to come to church so much it keeps my attention praise God I know there's jobs at home there's there's spirits that are try to battle me you know different things like that you got to working this and work and do that gota do that I love coming to the house of God because God takes up all my thinking he takes up all my attention we got to give him all of our attention praise God now brother BR said it's a dishonor to not come to church on Sunday morning or Sunday because you dishonor the resurrection so actually dishonor God say I'm not coming on the Resurrection Day it's a dishonor to Christ brother said and brother BR said uh he said I'm not man said I'm not a legalist brother BR about church service brother BR said you ought to be a legalist for a while about church service until you really fall in love with God is what he's saying you ought to have a legalistic attitude well I gotta be there gotta be there gotta be there you ought to have that attitude until you develop the right habits and the real love for God amen here's one my wife was listening to the radio and heard a man uh just and it tied in too because he was talking about church attendance and brother Jose might know this too and other sister beatric in other countries where there's persecution it is life or death when they go to church sometimes some of them are risking their lives to go to church right because of government persecution or Muslims or something like that violent Muslims you understand what I'm saying they would they risk their lives to go to church and church becomes so so optional for us don't feel like going I don't feel like traveling I don't feel like going there I don't feel like getting dressed I don't feel like I need to go I'm too tired and we get so sometimes I'll say like this don't the people get spoiled is that right sometimes we got so good over here we get lazy on God when people in other countries are they know they might die if they go to church one night because it's life or death they'll risk life or death remember brother Clement and brother Keith Randol from Columbus they went to Pakistan a few years ago and they their church was right next door in a house that had a big room it was right next door to some violent Muslims that killed Christians they're known for killing Christians but they still had church right next door but they whispered and they s and they God's presence still fell they said people got saved and baptized and they're Whispering oh they believe oh they believe all things are possible and God honors Whispering Pakistani Christians and helps them win souls and get people Sav and they have Miracles and healings when they're willing to put their lives on the line to go to church we need rugged Faith Like That amen we need some uh Christians with faith like that to care so much about God's house you'll put your life on the line to do it amen Church so we must we must come to God's house remember brother uh brother Dale preach this uh brother R said when you got the Holy Ghost you're in the word all the way you're in the things of God all the way well is it a Sunday night service in the plans of God isn't that a part of the plans of God well if you got the Holy Ghost you want to be a part of all the things of God even on a Wednesday night praise God see I'm applying that to anything that's about God anything that's about the the message of the hour you want to be a part of it because you're born again and you love all the things of God praise the Lord that's exactly right church and ultimately no matter how much you might say it when you don't fellowship with Believers you become disconnected to the body and you become connected to other things and most of the time it ain't right things most of the time for most people it's work and money right for others it's relationships and temptations and things like that or worldly lust and pleasures and and pleasure seekers in Hollywood and internet but if you're not connected here you're going to get connected to something else amen it's very very challenging there's something about physically Gathering when Paul wrote that in Hebrews 10 there was no internet right there's no phone hook up there's nothing there's no live stream it was a physical meeting with God and God's people it was appearing before God Almighty amen [Music] amen praise the Lord I want to say this I said this last Sunday I'm sorry I said this last Wednesday night if you've got children in sports and things like that you should never miss church for that I said this last Wednesday night look at said look at me as example my son and I do Taekwondo we get to wear holy clothes they look holy at least our practices are on Tuesday and Thursday night we never church for our extra extracurricular events ever never and we always pray don't we Malachi before we go into practice that's my example to you praise God and there's many times I skip Taekwondo to help out God's people on Tuesday nights and Thursday nights because it's not it's just exercise for me it's also a mission field I try to witness invite people to church I've invited people they haven't come yet but they said they would but they don't but it's a mission field for me too but I need to keep take care of my body because there's there's a little profit in exercising a little I I want that little by God's grace so I want to make sure I say that birthday parties are not more important than God's house praise God Sports Taekwondo football you name it none of those things are more important than God's house show me where brother Brandon did that and I'll take back all this I'll take this preaching back but brother Bram always went to two Services right every Sunday that's what the church did and you got the faith of brother Bram let's live like it by God's grace amen now let me give a warning to us that do come uh Ecclesiastes let's go here Ecclesiastes [Music] chapter five here's the danger for us or for those who come to every service here's the danger eclesiastes 5 vers1 keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools for they consider not that they do evil all right did you catch that keep your foot so don't stumble when you come to God's house and this is spiritually you see that you must be ready to hear and not just give a sacrifice and say well I came to church I'm better than the live streamers or I'm better than anyone that skip church tonight no that that's just that's being that's giv a sacrifice as a fool we come to church ready to hear God's word how many can say Amen to that and we come here to consider that we've done evil sometime this week we don't come thinking well I'm holier than everybody bless God I'm the pastor I'm better than everybody no we come here humble praise God become here humble ready to be corrected ready to remember that we sin too and we need God help every hour so see there's a self-righteous warning uh or Spirit we got to overcome when we come to God's house remember brother brand said he got a critical spirit and he went to church every time he preached hundreds of sermons a year and he developed the critical spirit see you can go to church and develop the wrong spirit so we must keep the right spirit and I've been guilty of this I'm going to repent of this too I've been guilty of being discouraged on Sunday nights when people don't show up for Wednesday night I've been guilty of that instead I should just Rejoice for the people that are here right because we get to get closer to God or those who are live streaming and are really pulling and really focusing on the word of God we get to get closer to God we can't force people to come we can take the horse to the water but can't make them drink but if we're here we can drink praise God so I've been guilty of having a pitiful attitude or feeling Sor for myself I should stop feeling sorry for myself and be thankful and be grateful that I can hear God's word I can preach God's word I can live God's word and God loves me and I love him amen I can express my love to him in his house I'm trying to close here pardon me so that's a warning for those of us who do came I just read that scripture recently in my prayer or my uh devotion time I thought well I think the church would like to read that one don't give a sacrifice of fools the Bible said remember Jesus said when you come to church don't give your offering if you know someone sinned against you or you sin against somebody that's a sacri of fools you give an offering and you know you got sin in your life you haven't taken care of that's a foolish offering you shouldn't come to church like that we should come to church with pure hearts praise God Amen and we must not make Church a tradition of men because if we do then we take out the leadership of the Holy Ghost I've been preaching on that lately and the Deeds of the nickol adans come in just their deeds and then pretty soon then it becomes a Doctrine and then the Antichrist spirit is here and there's no real heartfelt love of God here we need the love of God in this house don't we Church the Zeal of thine house has eaten me up why is it eat you up Jesus because there's sin in God's house and I've got Zeal to kick out the sin I got a Zeal to purify the house of God let's stand on our feet by God's grace brother Braham said a great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches soft living and nervous tensions those are the three things we battle soft living so see you got to be a remember brother Daniel preach it remember from we had a brother from Ghana last Wednesday night preach brother Daniel I forget his last name he was from Ghana brother Samuel brownie brought him down it was a special uh thing here I forgot to I apologize I forgot to let the church know he's from G and he preached on the assessment of the oil and I was just getting ready to preach on the Holy Ghost and here God sends a man all the way from God to preach on getting ready to be tested for oil I thought Hallelujah God is in this place I don't care what anybody says God is in this place amen but see he preached about brother R said a Christian's rugged you don't have to Baby them or beg them to come to church because it's in their heart to come to church so Satan wants us to live soft easy lives but God's people will labor for the kingdom of God they're rugged they know how to fight praise God they know how to cast down tiredness they know how to cast down fears they know I say like this they know how to get in the spirit amen that's it right there they know how to get the spirit amen get out of the human spirit and get into Christ spirit amen hallelujah Church Glory thank you Jesus you have a pressure to be rich but you got to overcome that don't ever let work or money become more important than God's house I plead with everybody live streaming here don't let money and work get you far from God cast that down and watch God provide for you stop worrying about it stop focusing on it put God first honor God and have the right spirit and repent before God and watch God provide every need I'm a witness amen I'm a witness I made this church my life I pour my heart and soul in this I pour myself so much in this lose my voice my hands bleed from clapping so much I pour my heart and soul into this church by God's grace and God has always provided for me and he can't treat me any better than he treats you because God is not a respector of preachers God's not a respector of any person amen God loves all his children yes amen praise God I think that's it let me stop right there because it's already 9:07 are you happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen this is all amen let's give Round of Applause praise God I know we heard before I know we heard some of these things before church but we're getting at a spot where it's coming down to the end we know it and we got to show which side we're standing on by God's grace there's so many things we missed brother said always stay in the blessings always stay where the spirit of God's being poured out when people don't come to Wednesday and they could or they don't stream when they could or they don't come to Sunday night when they really could they're missing out the pouring of the spirit upon them to live a closer life to Christ brother Bram said this he said uh well I I don't have to go to church I'll be just as fine if I don't and brother man said you cannot he said if you miss church you cannot be a good of a Christian as you would be if you went to church praise God it's impossible because you miss the word of God the spirit of God the justice of God the love of God you miss all of God because God's in his word amen that when you really could be there and you don't come and there's excuse and Excuse excuse and so forth like that you cannot be as close to Christ skipping or missing on purpose than you could if you just came let's bow our heads here Sunday Lord willing I'll share a little complex I had because I know it's going late I'll share a little complex I had I also share one of brother Brandon's complexes that uh he had to keep working on sometimes God allows the complex to come back and you've got to keep working on it but church as we bow our heads I encourage us let's get closer to Christ God delighted more in Zion than all or the gates of Zion than all the other property in Judah showing that God Delights the worship he loves the worship that he receives more than any other place and and that place is in Christ the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's true you can live stream and be so focused and God can Bless you that's true no no doubt about that but we're talking about people that don't come when they really could that maybe don't have maybe the wisdom yet to to to direct their lives and Order their lives the right way so they can have enough strength to be in church when they really could and a prophet that says every service be anxious to pray be anxious to fast be anxious to do anything anyone would ask you to do in a Bible that says you should gather more as the Rapture is approaching not less we should be physically together more as we see that day approaching how God loves when his people gather together dear Lord thank you for tonight thank you Lord that your people have gathered in this holy place because your holy spirit's here I've not preached my word I've preached the words of the Bible I preach the words of your Prophet so Lord I pray you just come vindicate your word Lord in our lives as I sent that email may we examine our hearts may we examine our motives and our objectives may we examine what's most important may we look at our lives compared to brother brandom compare it to the Bible are we truly living the revelation of church attendance and Gathering not forsaking or abandoning the Saints Lord help us to examine Our Lives Lord God this is a sermon that pastors or oxes have to sometimes have to preach because they're there the whole time they can't get up and leave they've got to stay there they got to labor for the people they got to pray for the people they got to love the people and Lord you know my heart I love the people I love these people more than anybody else because I sacrifice all my free time to give to these people and Lord I trust I believe many of them love me dear God Lord help us to love you though most of all Lord but as your Prophet said we can only see uh our love for God by how we love others so Lord if I do love them and if they do love me then surely we love you dear God thank you Lord Jesus for that promise bless us now Lord help us to fulfill the scripture of gathering more as we see that day approaching it will take the power of God to Humble Hearts it will take the power of God maybe to heal bodies to change Minds to transform thoughts Lord God but that's what the word of God is meant to do I pray for transformed Minds tonight in
