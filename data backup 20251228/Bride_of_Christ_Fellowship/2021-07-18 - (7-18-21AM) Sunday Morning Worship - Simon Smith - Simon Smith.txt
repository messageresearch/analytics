========================================

brother simon uh if you don't know simon's one that shared the message with me 20 years ago so i'm very thankful for simon through god anointing him has used him to change my life so so thank god for brother simon he's a great help and strength in the preaching of the word and the teaching of others and a tremendous witness for this message and thank god for his life and testimony and if we pull on the gift of god we'll surely get bed this morning how are we looking forward to the word of god this morning amen praise god well let's invite our brother to come here and i want to sing that song i was singing on wednesday oh get ready the evening shadows fall let's sing that ellie easter song we'll see you may not know it we sang it years ago haven't sang it for many years i just came to me wednesday night i wasn't even thinking about it thank god for eliezer coming to get to rebecca praise god thank god we're gonna see isaac soon praise the lord hallelujah [Music] have you heard the voice [Music] is [Music] have you heard the voice how many days [Music] is far away [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] that'll be a wonderful time when we make this rapture and get out of this world i cannot wait to leave this place this place is out of control literally god is our lord and savior is not happy with this world uh even in toledo ohio someone had painted a mural of george flor george floyd and they painted a crown on his head and lightning struck it knocked the entire thing down there's only one king and that is our lovely lord jesus christ amen anything that you or i would try to exalt above him will be brought down he will shake it from our lives he's going to do whatever it takes so that he that he will be number one in your life amen praise the lord god bless you brother good to see you william let's get into the word i had i was gonna do a song special but there are so many things that this brother just saying my favorite one of my favorite songs ever let it start in me and i really believe this uh study here is for you guys this brother jesse mentioned a name that i've never ever heard anyone even say and it's right on my notes this morning i just could not believe it i'm sitting there i'm going through this and boom he drops the name and right there it wasn't when i was like pretty slow so let's get into the word of god and we will keep you standing uh hopefully this will be a blessing to uh maybe just to further maybe everyone understands the breach i've never really understood it for 20 years i've studied the message i've looked at it listen to sermons but i just never could get a real grasp of what what took place there at that breach what was going on there and uh dealing with some brothers there and through doctrinal ways and scripture and those sort of things and then i read uh we're dealing with a certain topic and i read a scripture and there come right there you know i just i just love it you can have a you can have a thought in your mind on a certain thing or the man gets seen you uh brother jose's got a beautiful beard i just want everybody to thank the lord for that beer that that lifted my i walked in and that my oh my heart caught on fire i was like oh that was and look at the hairs just flowing brothers got looks man god bless him i really appreciate that i took a picture with him i was so like man lord when i hit that age i got goals you gotta have goals right uh uh anyhow the the lord's uh been so good i lost my train of thought here so let's just that's weird okay let's go revelations five and one anyhow i i wondered a little bit about this the the the breach and what was going on there what what is significant about that and uh you know you read a scripture and and sometimes the entire revelation comes off one scripture and you understand it just you just catch one scripture and you can literally run that thing from genesis all the way in revelations in your mind and the picture it's like you have you have a puzzle and you have all the peach everything in place except that one little thing and just take that one little piece and it just finishes it or unlocks it however you will so i hope this will be a blessing today and i really believe the lord uh brother just mention that name my goodness yeah amazing revelations 5 1 we'll read to verse 7 and i saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor on earth nor under the earth was able to open the book needed to look there on and i went much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereof and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion the tribe of judah the root of david which hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and in the midst of the throne and in the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb that had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand that has of him that sat upon the throne now let's just say word with prayer right there let's say a prayer dearly father lord jesus slowly come lord forever humbly though knowing we're just the fleeting shadows of time the last grains of sand are going through that uh time machine you've got there lord and lord jesus though we know this thing is soon it ends lord and well maybe not lord to the jews but lord the gentiles days are about over and lord jesus lord you know lord how unworthy we are even lord he would be uh privileged lord to call to this message though privileged lord for salvation lord vessels of honor lord chosen a forehand lord for your glory god and to show us your glory lord and lord i don't know why we're here lord you just ordained it that way you know in all my carnal plans though when i was younger lord we had no desire to be here the lord you do the call you do the choosing god in the lord jesus lord we are so thankful god lord for all that you've done in our lives where would we be without you lord jesus thank you lord so much and lord we come lord just humble lord you just take full control of this little service lord and this little vessel here lord and may you anoint the people here lord and i believe this is uh right in time lord for your lord to bring this little word lord this thought hello blessing people god let may have your weight in this service in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated so as we uh the last time i was here was a wednesday night there were seven of us and it was i felt real comfortable so this brother back here knows brother brooks and brother brooks is our i'd have to say just seriously our father in the faith he is uh our dearest compadre and friend and lawyer and when we prayed for truth he sent us to brother brooks's riot for the isaiah versus church and we've been with him on the battlefield obviously he's very gifted and many other things but uh we stand right behind him or beside him and uh certainly brother brooks is a special brother uh always has a special meaning in our hearts for jess and uh he was no other pastor did we have besides him that god called us under to train us and to feed us the word and to and to show us what the lord has showed us so anyhow let's uh be thankful for brother isaiah so here uh i don't know if i have this we even hooked up here oops there we go hope this will be a blessing you know i'm just a powerpoint guy i'm a little teacher just do bible studies and it's been kind of dry in the last year or so not too many people want bible studies um really a really it's just drying out i can't hardly it's hard to witness people you tell the truth and means nothing and i'm happy where i'm at and this and that and that you don't want god and this those those sort of things and it is what it is so so here we read uh in the scripture uh as uh christ here it was it was a certain now this came at a certain time this was just this could not take place in any specific time other than when it did take place and the lord uh told us that this was going to take place this is a book of prophecy here in revelations 5 1 to 22 however and it is a book of prophecy in other words he's god was showing that there was coming a time where he was going to take this book break the seven seals and then uh later on here then give it to john and give it to the bride to eat so um so if i had another scripture i'd want to tie in with this and just ask a couple questions i would go right here to malachi 4 and 1. it says and behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven we all know this we these scriptures are just so common we uh as soon as we read them we know exactly what they mean we don't have to search much more uh the depths of them but but of course god always has more things hidden down in there uh through meanings through shadows through types and uh those sort of things um but then as we jump here to verse 5 behold i send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children of the father lest they come and smite the earth with a curse right and as the man of god or prophet malachi 4 there would preach and preach and preach and he would say he says look saints this is not john the baptist because notice the world was not burned after john the baptist now malachi 4 has went off the scene the the revelations 10 70 the angel seventh angel has went off the scene in 65 so let me ask you another question has the earth burned yet why has not the earth burned yet if he says the day cometh and shall burn as an oven and the prophet would say time and time and time again he says he says when that man of god when malachi 4. when revelation 10 7 when that angel the son of man is to be revealed when he comes he says you know right after his ministry and me he even said one time he says immediately after he says the earth will burn why is it burnt why are we still here so i guess if i had a title this morning it would be at this present time present time like right now where are we why has not the earth burned what is going on didn't was are we looking for another to come with greater signs with greater miracles with greater revelations have all the mysteries been cleared up do we understand who revelations uh 17 is do we understand what revelations 18's mean come out of my people be not a partaker over sin unless you receive of the plagues do we understand the seven church ages has those things brought forth do we understand the mysteries and depths of those do you understand the true baptism water baptism these all these all these things have been restored but why has not the earth been burnt so i want to get into this a little bit just a real simple thought but saints of god this is just so to me it was just so encouraging to see this thought so um i want to start here at a certain scripture here and where are we at at this present time at this present time where are we at why is this thing lingered and lingered and lingered on 2020 [Music] from 1965 it's a long time most of us here were not even born then right except with our brother with a wonderful beard and mustache and our brother william our sister right there those i think those are past 65 okay yeah soldiers still weird they've seen a lot in their days so let's look at this god has a chosen man here and we know in the scripture that god said that moses was the meekest man on the face of the earth i think i taught a while back here about how how the the bride must become the meek because the bible says the meat shall inherit the earth and you know what the word meek means it means humble we must see ourselves as nothing except yielded sons and daughters of god and we must not have anything in our minds that we want to do outside of doing the will of the father amen because that is the father's business amen sure now there's a man by the name of moses the meekest man on the face of the earth and god said to him one time now what was special about moses god sent to him one time he says come up with me into the mount he says and be there he says and be there and i will give thee three tables of stone and the long commandments which i have written that thou mayest teach them and wrote moses rose up and his minister joshua and moses went up into the mount of god and he said unto the elders he says tarry ye here for us until we come again unto you and behold aaron and her are with you if any man have any matters to do let him come unto them but god said i want to speak some things to you moses jesus as moses went up into the mount and the cloud would cover the mount the prophet in god now being joined together communing right he says in the glory of the lord abode upon the mount sinai he says in the cloud covered in six days in the seventh day he called called unto moses out of the midst of the cloud and the sight of the glory of the lord like was like a devouring fire upon the top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of israel in other words if you go there right now today from where mount sinai really is that top of that mountain is still burnt it is burnt to a crisp if you can you can search it on google search it on the internet i believe is uh what's his name um anyone know that archaeologist ron wyatt found that he showed it he's shown actually where they went and rounded up those uh uh they had the altar and killed the slayed the lambs and slay the bullocks and all that stuff all that stuff's still there they found the very rock that all the water came out of it's like four four five was it ten stories tall or something it wasn't a small rock it was a big rock and it split completely in half by the force that water came out that rock so god calls this man up into the mountain he says and the eyes of the glory lord was like a devouring fire upon the top of the mountain the eyes of the children israel and moses went into the midst of the cloud and got him into the mount and moses was in the mount 40 days and 40 nights what were they doing what was what was going on at that time god was showing moses he was communing with moses about what now saints of god if we can get into the presence of god now look look what took place in the presence of god look at all the revelation that was given to moses if you look what was given to moses in that time when he was in the spirit of god why no we we we go like this we try and read the bible try and pray with us but if we get into the spirit what more can be opened up given fresh look at everything that took that was given to moses up there in 40 days and 40 nights the contributions for the sanctuary that order was given he said the ark of the covenant was that the the very dimensions how to build it was to be made out of all that came from being in the presence of god all that information the knowledge the table for bread which is brother jesse's book amen that revelation 4 that book was given by to moses on that day amen praise god yes that book started all the way back here but just somebody got into the spirit a meek man god in the spirit what and now we see you coming back at the end time amen as the 12 new testament mysteries praise be to god jesus and then what he said the golden lamp stands which represents the gentile church that's you and i that is a mystery that mystery came forth and was revealed to paul and to john but here first it was given to moses why because he was in the presence in the anointing of god for 40 days and 40 nights hallelujah what is in the mind of god we have to get in the presence of god praise god the tabernacle inner court holy place holy holies all those things the bronze altar the quarter of the tabernacle oil for the lamb the holy ghost the priests garments how we're supposed to conduct ourselves and dress ourselves amen consecration for the priests however to live the altar of incense the census tax the bronze basin the or the anointing oil and incense and then the holy bib and how's it progress that's allele unbelievable but just got memory god bless them [Laughter] and the sabbath day all this information was given to moses 40 days and 40 nights right because he got in with god in fact he was called and chosen to know these things he was called and chosen for these revelations this furthering these mystery he didn't even know they were mysteries right but these things were given to him that what it was not even really awesome he was given for us amen amen now all those things and when he gave unto moses and he gave it to moses when he had made an ending of communing with him upon mount sinai two table of testimony tables of stone written with the finger of god that's powerful stuff so here was one man getting in the presence of god for 40 days and 40 nights and he received all this information he received all all the all the pattern all the plan of god everything for his move he was given but what took place at that exact same time while one was gathered while one was getting all the revelation i think spiritually while you are getting all this revelation receiving all the knowledge of the mysteries while you're receiving the oil and the lamps the res the revelation of jesus christ while moses while i'll say this why you were getting all those things what was taking place elsewhere while psalm was getting in the presence of god and revelations blasting blasting blasting like brother man i said the roman candle goes out seven falls another sound falls nothing off that what was taking place down here and when the people saw the moses delayed to come down upon the mount the people gathered themselves together unto aaron and said to him make us gods who shall go out before us for as is for this moses the man which brought us up out of the land of egypt what we want not what is become of him while some while one person was called to the greatest most revelated time on the face of the earth at his day others were fully backsliding leaving the call these people came by a supernatural move called out of egypt by signs wonders and miracles and while one of them was continuing on into deeper greater greater things the others were backsliding all the way back to egypt they didn't go there in the physical but in the spiritual they were already back in egypt amen he says and aaron said to him break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives and your sons and your daughters and bring them unto me and all the people break off the golden earrings which were in their ears and brought them unto aaron and received them in their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool whether he had made it a molten calf and they said these be thy gods of israel which had brought thee up out of the land of egypt notice false worship again a lie right notice the priesthood went off oh my god i sure yeah now but remember moses was a meek man moses was the prophet of god i'll say this one time for many times i'll pray to say this this this service malachi 4 behold i send you moses the prophet no it does not say moses right it says elijah john the baptist in luke 1 and 17 he shall come in the spirit and power of moses no don't say moses but notice when moses is on the scene and he receives all these things all 40 communing with god and he comes down now from off that anointing off that spiritual hi i'll say it like that the lord said what unto moses in verse 7 get thee down for thy people who shall brought out the land of egypt have corrupted themselves god says moses we're having a great time up here i'm showing you things i wanted to show somebody for all time i wanted to show people this for a long time he says but you're the chosen one you're going to see it and no one else is gonna see it until you bring it forth why because you are my chosen prophet praise be to god yes but he said he says your people the people all right people that i called out they're sliding back right now he said get down there and do something and they turn aside quickly out of the way which i have commanded them for they have made them a golden molten calf and have worshiped them and have sacrificed there on you and said these be thy gods the wisdom which have brought thee up out of the land of egypt and the lord said to moses i have seen this people and behold it is a stiff-necked people let me tell you something does god need to be three persons while god was up there communing with moses he already knew what was going down there he is all powerful he can be anywhere he can build multiple locations at one time is he omnipresent through omniscience he knows everything he is not surprised god goes down he sees a people they have totally stopped worshipping him went to something that's not even real brought forth idols and what he says here in verse 10. now therefore what's he telling moses he says let me alone all right meek man prophet back off he says that my wife my wrath may wax hot against him he says you stand back boy he says i'm gonna deal with these people i did the twelve or the ten signs what is the mirror i brought these people out these are my people stand back i'm going to deal with them then i may consume them and i'll make thee and i'll make thee make of thee a great nation he says i'm done with these people moses i'm going to use you under your seedline but god set the stage for everything and moses what did moses say to an angry god god said he was all around i am gonna wipe these people out but moses fresh out of 40 days in the presence of god wow anybody received a baptism of the holy ghost before you can feel the presence for days and days and days hallelujah and why you're just as happy and praise me to god brother oh hallelujah praise the lord i'm so happy and just feel the presence of god and just everybody looks like they're clean all i see is jesus look at this sister jesus brother jesus brother jesus sister jesus brother jesus absolutely that's all i see is clean saints this brother might do something to me that system might do something to you or however it doesn't matter we're all clean moses fresh off the anointing still probably even anointed he had to be anointed to save this at this time if he was in the presence of god the prayers of god would then affect him and the lord says he says uh and the law and moses besought the lord his god said lord why dost thou wax hot against thy people why are you so mad lord i'm not mad the lord's like well moses they're not worshiping you guys i know i know i know he goes i know they're not worse from you but i'm still not man [Laughter] [Music] he was a type of christ which has he says which has thou wrought uh which thou has brought forth out of the land of egypt with great power and with us mighty hand he said lord how can you get so mad at these people you brought them out you've done such tremendous work with look at all you've done you've done it all yes and then he's then he said he says and then moses i'm sure the anointing on him he he tries to bring the spiritual reasoning as well he says wherefore should the egyptians speak and say for mischief did he bring them out he says lord why would you get mad he says he says back your own self up remember you don't want yourself to look bad don't re-reproach against yourself what kind of god would you be [Laughter] i know you're a good god be a good god amen and the lord in his in the uh more faith i'm sure if in the more faith he was angry but on the inside he's like oh yes that's what i wanted to hear that's my boy that's my prophet he says for mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains consume them from the from the face of people turn thy rat their fierce wrath or repent of this evil against thy people he said lord just forgive them and moses knowing that if that didn't touch god's heart moses knew god loved abraham isaac he went back to the covenant remember moses says now remember abraham isaac did he use jacob he did not use the word jacob but he used the word israel because he needed all the power of god he needed to have that pull that card that prince with power with god amen thy servants to whom thou swear thine own self and say to him i will multiply thy seed to the stars of heaven brings them back to what he said he was going to do god but you said you are going to use the offspring of these three men and these are the offspring of these three men amen and the lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people look at the anointing of the spirit of moses look at the kind of prophet that moses was look at the kind of man that moses was but now look what he says here for moses said unto them concentrate consecrate yourselves to the day this day uh yourselves to the day to the lord even every man and upon his son and upon his brother that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day and it came to pass and tomorrow that moses sent unto the people ye have sinned a great sin he had to call him out he to make sure they knew this was wrong and that god was not pleased now think of this saul king saul was supposed to slay everything but uh but samuel said he was gonna be there in time and when samuel did not show up saul did not wait and this exact same thing took place right here they had lost confidence on what moses what had happened to moses and they would not be patient and wait to see what took place with this prophet they god just brought these guys out and now he's going to forget about him that's not they did not know who they were dealing with they did not know they did not understand the god that called them out of egypt they did not understand how much he loved him he was giving the prophet everything that was going to prosper them up with them with the man of god there and he was it was for the people it wasn't necessarily for the prophet it was for the people and they did not wait my and the moses returned under the lord said all these people have seen the great sin and made them gods of gold now look at this look at this man moses look how great of satan humble way how great this man moses was yet now if thou for will forgive their sin and if not he says brought me i pray thee out of the book which thou has written who wrote the book jesus did god almighty and the lord said unto moses now this is going to tie right in with the breach here as we get to it and the lord said to moses whosoever has sinned against me him will i blot out of my book if you are on the book and you are eternal and you do not so this came up in a certain topic as well another discussion with certain individuals and they said brother the man of god brother braham said he said how he said brother and said you can be justified sanctified and still go to hell they said how's that possible i said i sent him the scripture i said you tell me let me tell you some things this bible is not supposed to make logical sense this bible is showing you what god calls sense this bible reveals to you the mind of god we have to quit making trying to think of this logically well this doesn't make sense why would he put their names on the book to take them off it's not i don't know all it tells me is they were called and when they heard that call of moses when they heard the word and they saw those things and they followed their names were put on but there are some that were put there before the foundation of the earth [Applause] but one thing we're certain names can be blotted off absolutely now look at this man moses they forgot god their savior which had done great things in egypt wondrous works in the land of ham and terrible things by the red sea therefore he hath he said that he would uh therefore he said that he would destroy them had not moses has chosen stood before him in the breach amen moses had to stand in the breach right yeah now this at the end here you're going to see this thing flip it's not what you think therefore he said unto unto them had not moses his chosen stood before him in the breach to turn away his wrath lest he would destroy them yea they despise the pleasant land which is what the holy ghost they despise the holy ghost and they believe not his word praise god spirit and truth they despise both spirit and truth and what's our call for this day the bible says what that we're supposed to be true worshipers worship in spirit and in truth amen you must have both remember that was now paul sealed the deal in first corinthians 13 he says no i know all mysteries in other words not false mysteries not this mystery or this one living off but all mysteries you have the full truth but if you do not have charity if you do not have the holy ghost it means nothing as brother jesse just posted on his website a gifted minister preaches on the two seeds the most single most powerful teaching on original sin i've ever heard and probably could never be matched and that brother's not even in the message anymore you can have all the mysteries but if you do not have the very life of christ it means nothing so what what do we want we want the very life give me the baptism of the holy ghost and then all the rest will be given you seek me first seek the kingdom of god first and all his righteousness shall follow yes yes the holy ghost will lead and guide you into all truth hallelujah thank you praise the lord now notice moses was a big interceder but now let's look at another one samuel this is a time of the judges hear god send the prophet on samuel the prophet and things start happening to test israel kings foreign kings start rising up but they had a prophet in the land and samuel was a dedicated man from birth to god he was an answer to prayer of a woman that fasted and prayed and said i must have a man-child her husband said am i not more than seven sons and she's like give me seed i've got to have a son and when god answered supernaturally she says now this is the kind of woman that she was she said i'm giving this boy back to you lord and place him right in the priesthood and god used that man especially gifted prophet now as these children israel will get in trouble time and time and time again look what samuel says unto the house of israel saying if you do return unto the lord with all your hearts just like it was at the beginning then put away the strange gods and ashtroth from you and prepare your hearts unto the lord put it all away god help us and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the hand of the philistines notice the prophet's care and concern for the children of god the people of god then the children put away balaam and ashtroth and serve the lord only and samuel said gather all israel to mispass and i will pray for you sam you knew he was already set aside sammy was already living the kind of life samuel was all he already had favor with god he was a prophet of god when when that prophet felt the anointing of the holy ghost and he spoke what things happened so samuel said i'm going to get in the presence right now he says i'm going to find the mind of god and i'm going to beg and intercede and god is going to deliver you and guess what happened he did notice and samuel took a suckling lamb and offered a burnt offering holy unto the lord and samuel cried unto the lord for israel and the lord heard him did it heard that it didn't hear israel it heard the prophet who heard the man who what had the spirit of christ on him amen he heard the one that had soul trivial and the one that says lord these are your people what it was moses 2.0 absolutely this was another man that could touch the heart of god and say don't destroy him don't let any harm don't let it hurt or hate danger or anything harm anything touch your people lord please deliver them yes and god heard him now and god delivered them and then it comes down to where samuel's sons are getting old well same is getting old and the sons were his two sons were backslid priests backstage ministers but jesse's tall and that extensively type shadows however and the people approached samuel and said we want a king just like notice they got their eyes off god and started looking i know this is elementary he says but start looking at the leaders in the world and other denominational churches at this at that at that king or this this pastor or however right saints of god let me tell you something there is only one standard in the bible on judgment day on judgment day because we all have to answer to god do you think this is going to hold up in god's court i come before the lord his holy presence i said lord i might have done this a little bit better than this brother and if he if this brother was my standard and i said i live better than this brother but but i i wasn't as good as him on other things but i was better him on this thing and jesus is going to say what is my standard yeah here's the thing we see here here's the thing that kind of muddles our mind sometimes our imagination whereas william might think he's better me than this spiritually in certain things in areas aspects maybe maybe his character is better than mine i said well he's he might say well i'm good to go or this sister might be more humble more meek than this other sister says i'm good i'm good at least i'm better than her or i'm better than this brother but what's going to be the standard we are all in the race when all of us are up there and one by one we have to give an account god have mercy we are going to need the holy we're going to have to say i've got the token do you think i'm going to try and make any reasons or this i'm just saying here's my talking lord laid at his feet the holy ghost every one of us is judged by this not by you can't compare yourself to anyone else we're judged by this there ain't no great ones among us because we're all judged by this god help us and we are going to need grace on that day and we we will have grace on that day because the bible said he won't have a wife and david said what he says blessed is the man whom god will not impute iniquity where did that blessing come from it came all the way back to genesis 1. and the bible said in genesis 1 he says let us make man our image in the image of god he created hear them he says and he said i bless them that blessing came i was already there so these people wanted a king a natural man to lead them and it hurt samuel very much because he loved the lord do you think samuel wanted anyone leading him outside of god no sir god samuel brought it before god and god said now therefore hearken unto their voice how be it yet protest solemnly unto them try to get them to change their mind try to let them know what decision they are making we must make good decisions yes starting now because whatever decision we made yesterday and last week and last month and years ago we can't change we must make good decisions from this moment forward amen how many's got false in here how many main beds have changed before right here this guy many of them men i could write you a brother jesse's book where's that my book of mistakes would be greater than that [Laughter] hallelujah yeah i'm being honest i'm being yeah it will probably 20 000 of those books to be all my faults and failures and sins and iniquities let's be honest absolutely but it takes just a little thin look like this to make it all right oh hallelujah this is the great equalizer right there this will teach me how to get rid of all my truckload of sins amen praise me the god of iniquities yes this is instructions on how to get rid of those things wanna make your way away to heaven praise me to god yes i am pounding on that yeah so god tells samuel he says don't let them do this tell them warn them show them absolutely samuel does but he said now notice if you pick a king he's going to do this he's going to do this he's going to do this he's going to do this but the moment you go into this then you make your final decision and ye shall cry in the day because your king which she have chosen and what god say and the lord will not hear you in that day i thought god was a god of grace and mercy but once you go into order what was what was samuel taipa or saul assault king saw a type of denomination or that organization organization the spirit of organizations before denomination as the prophet broke it down in the church age book the spirit of organization kicks out the spirit of god and once the spirit of god is out then denomination can come in and set up its man-made doctrines you got to watch how the spirit moves you got to watch how the antichrist spirit works he must get the spirit of god out first and then he can set up his kingdom so let us keep the spirit of god here keep it in your midst stay man yes wow are we okay sunday morning praise the lord now he says nevertheless the people refuse to obey the voice of samuel they said nay but we will have a king god is not going to hear them now when it gets tough you know the spirit you know the story of saul after this what took place many israelites died in battle saw himself die the leader of this movement would not even speak to god or god would not even speak to the leaders movement and the lord will not hear you in that day he would not hear saul because he went in he was the leader of that campaign all right now therefore but notice samuel look at the character and nature of this man much like moses and same with some of the people figured out you have done all this wickedness by choosing you a king yeah it turned out aside from following lord but serve the lord he says if you're going in it you might you better serve god with all your heart if you still want the blessings of god to remain you better serve god give him everything withhold nothing and turn you not aside for then should you go after the vain things which they cannot profit nor deliver for they are vain laodicea let me tell you something all you young men how many this brother here from maokai i don't know about this brother be very leery about becoming a plumber plumbing will take over your life because everybody needs a plumber every hour of every day so johnny i'm sure knows as a electrician almost exactly the same kind of there's a lot of electricity in residential houses there's a lot of plumbing in residential houses and you could you could literally lose your entire life to a job i'm a witness hey amen all vanity a lot of times i i help i don't even take i take the job just to help the people not even for money it's not even worth it it's it's so much vanity to it because this is it the will of god for me to run to every single anyhow i'm okay i'm on that now notice samuel that's a warning now they say dirty hands clean money sure absolutely but it's an honest living but you've got to control that thing you've got to control it into you john into your profession your job is not number one jesus christ is number one by the grace by the grace of god i missed one maybe two services because i had to work on a sunday and that's within the last year or so so i fought it and i fought it and fought it until you kind of anyhow now notice samuel was saying he says he says don't turn aside for vain things for the lord will not forsake his people for his great name sake because it please lord to make you his people notice god still wanted to rule over them though they entered into that denominational and organizational spirit now no notice what he says go over as for me as for samuel as for the prophet just like moses he says god forbid that i should sin against the lord how would he sing against the lord he says in ceasing to pray he was an interceder he loved the very people of god he he knew that god wanted to deal with this brother and this brother that sister no all he wants you are god's children you are god's people and samuel says i will always pray for you just like saint paul said he's playing paul says i've been in peril so deep false brother and this and this he says jesus but most everything constantly says praying for the churches paul said i've been beaten three times forty stripes slave one i've been in the deep shipwrecked all those things he said but the greatest thing he says the care of the churches he is a real man of god he cares about the children of the most high he says but i will steal his i would teach you the good and the right way now there's two mighty men right there moses and samuel people who will sigh and cry day and night for our sins for the sins of those people yes in that time in that hour they were the ones interceding now lotus in the days of the open book and the people of the land have used oppression and exercise robbery and have vexed the poor needy yeah they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully and i sought a man among them that would make up the hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that i should not destroy it but i found none what is the eagle that roll that open book came down his eagle he ate the book exactly revelations 10. and here in those days of the open book much like this day god couldn't find a man who was fully interceding but he was looking for someone he was searching for the one that would make intercession but he said he couldn't find one they came to a point in israel's time and the lord said unto me though you mean god can get fed up and he seals the door shut and he closes and will not hear us anymore or hear his children or anybody he says though moses and samuel then saith the lord the lord calls out these warriors moses samuel who are men of people men have gone forth the cent for the protection and the profits and the the prophetic it's like profit not as like a prophecy but as far as profit for gain for the people these two were sent to profit the people to keep them protected safe sound but god said though moses and samuel stood before me yet my mind could not be toward this people he said you could get these two both these guys right now and they still can change one thing cast them out of my sight and let them go for there is a time when god gets fed up and saints of god let me tell you something what age are we in in this present moment we are in laodicea and the bible says if we are not called and if we are not hot he will spew us out god help and it shall come to pass if they say unto thee whither shall we go forth then thou shalt tell them thus saith the lord such are for death such as for death to death and such a sword for swords such a famine famous such as a captivity captain in other words there's no way out you're all getting it things of god let us get ready for this rapture is everyone here ready for this rapture we must be filled with the baptism of the holy ghost hallelujah because if not here is what's left run you to and fro through the streets of jerusalem and see now and know and seek in the broad places thereof and see and if you see if you can find a man if there be any that executes the judgment and seeketh truth he says and i will pardon god always gives warning before judgment and here in the very heart of god he says israel was such was all ate up in jerusalem he says go fight me one man and i'll pardon the whole thing this judgment that i've declared just like jonah jonah said 40 days you're all dead man did they get did they die no they repented because what god found one man that would go inside and cry behind abominations he says guys you better wake up judgment's on his way god pardon the entire city and though they say the lord lives surely they sweareth falsely o lord are not thine eyes upon the truth thou hast stricken them but they have not grieved thou has consumed them but they have not refused to they have had but they have refused to receive correction they have made their face harder than iraq and they refused to return saints of god this malachi 4 was sent to turn our hearts back to the father back to what the very book of acts ministry and as far as i know none of us are fully there yet but we are coming we in our hearts we desire it is our goal we are if these things come to us we say lord you said you would restore you said lord you would restore lord and lord restored upon us amen praise god that's what we want we want restoration lord no matter what it takes in my life to get these things out get them out yes isaiah 59 16 yay 15 sorry yay truth faileth and he that departed for me making themselves to pray and the lord sought and displeased him for there was no judgment there was a time where people would do things and no one would call it out there was a time when the laity would do things and no one would call out their brother and sister would just let it go there was a time when a preacher would go up and preach and preach false doctrines and no one called out and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness it sustaineth him in other words god had to do it himself in jesus day how much false doctrine was there loads of it i taught on years ago i think a year or two ago i taught on the gibeonites if you look at that study if you wash pots and pans if you did that was a death sentence back then you could be you could be stoned for that back in that day in jesus day they held the words of the scribes and pharisees above the torah right they said the words of the sky and the pharisees are more weightier than the holy scriptures in other words a minister will get back behind his pulpit and now amen his word even if it doesn't line up with the bible bro jesse just showed me a thing a man said a minister and this message said that it's poppycock or tommy roth if you will that we need a scripture to prove a quote that we have to take the quotes back to the scripture they said that man doesn't even need behind the pulpit things of god let me tell you something even in denomination i was taught the bible is the absolute and you know what when i come to this message if you listen to malachi 4 you listen to his messenger he said the bible is the absolute and he also said the holy ghost is the north star yeah yes amen you know what the difference between jesus christ and brother graham was for the man was sinful he was a sinful man and he exaggerated and he did say things wrong much like nathaniel or nathan i'll say like this david said i want to build god a temple nathan said do whatever's on your heart son and god said you messed up nathan that's not what i want yeah good and nathan had to go and correct what he told prophet god had to correct what he said absolutely all through the scripture because the word is the absolute if there's something that takes place in this day there's always an old testament new testament type laying right there in the word of god it is proven time and time again if you are a believer bible believer yes sir now wow i've held you guys 53 minutes everybody okay still all right let's continue on here 53 i don't i don't hold you too long i want to i want i want to show you this breach and i hope this is a blessing because jesus christ did something tremendous for us he did something very very tremendous amen now hold on here let me see let's get that let's get that now continuing on here there is a time when god has done he is tired genesis 5 the sons of god saw the daughters of man that they were fair and took upon them wives and this and that directly after the sons of god took on the serpent the daughter serpents god said it is done it is finished judgment is coming it's already sealed it's set and you're going to have some issues here right he was done no one moses did you notice noah did not intercede he just kept preaching and preaching his coming gay there was no saving and he said just get in the ark you're not saving this earth just get in the ark that was what is the message which is coming it's raining he says and get in the ark get into safety because out here is not going to be saved now therefore look he says god done he says and i'll cast you out of my sight even i cast out all your brother and even the whole seed of ephraim he says ephraim he says therefore pray not for this people neither lift up cry lift up cry or prayer for them neither make intercession to me for i will not hear thee saints of god we are in the most dangerous time period in all history say to god remember we all have lives right sisters children housework brothers work going around doing this and this but those are distractions those are just temporary things that we have to do frivolous things our jobs are frivolous things we have to do to make it to to keep afloat but we we have to be set aside for the lord jesus christ amen at all times ready ready to go we cannot have things the bible scripture says uh um because it's i don't have a memory like brother john so something like uh if you're not careful for the things of this world i'll say like that i don't know if it's um burned down or i don't know anyhow i don't have to get ended by myself he says for i will not hear thee notice for according to all the numbers of the cities where were their gods he says oh judah and according to the numbers on the streets of jerusalem have set e up altars to that shameful thing even altars to burn incense unto baal notice they went fully into baalism therefore pray thou not for those people neither lift up or cry for them brown to hear them in a time of the time they cry to me for their trouble once again once again jeremiah says then said the lord unto me pray not for this good for this people for their good when they fast i will not hear their cry and when they offer burnt offering and oblation i will not accept them there's a time saints of god when the doors shut god help us to get there now we're in a time where we're leaning in ezekiel 22 and i just got caught wind of this ezekiel 22 verse 26 notice her priests have violated my law and have profaned my holy things they have no put no difference between the the holy and the profane neither have they huge difference between the unclean and the clean they have hid their eyes from my establishment i profaned among them in other words they they allow gray areas now i just come to knowledge of this but there are a lot of sisters in this and not in this church but in this message that we are wearing pajama pants pants pants pajama pants you know there's one quote brother branham what do you think this is he says well i don't have thus said lord but he says what he says i don't see what's wrong with a c now this is dave malachi 4's opinion malachi 4 said what he said i don't see anything wrong why can't the sister just wear a nice uh nightgown and now i'm hearing that the majority of sisters i know wear these pajama pants at night and when they're not when they're at home they're still wearing them what is going on here but we will declare right here well i will declare right here i do not like that right do men wear pajama pants but jess you got some champagne me too brother johnny [Laughter] [Music] yours are probably kind of short so they probably look like you're tall man let's say make them they're sure they make them in your size so if you wore my cam okay okay so men wear pajama pants sisters are not to wear it's an abomination for a woman a woman to wear what is likened to a man's clothing when you buy those the name the name on the tag is pajama pants who is allowing this what i'm not blasting the girls i'm blasting the parents yep no that isn't brother you're not the prophet i'm gonna take you brother jesse could we do another study could you do another study on hair and dress or let's bring that book out again okay i just i heard about that and i was i was so upset and we're wondering why we're not seeing the things we need to be seeing is the things done in the darkness what's coming next in the open let me give you a story three years ago i was i had a sister i had we had flown some sisters in and one was holiness the daughter was not and as my it was in my lot to host true story this is my lot to host i took him to cedar point and the road rides now the sister daughter was still in pants and lo and behold at cedar point guess what i saw a sister an old time sister that i know from way back when i come in the message she's walking around with her daughter wearing culottes which is pretty much just baggy real baggy empty hammer pants and she thinking no one's going to see her at cedar point and boom i'm like this and my wife's like hey is that where what oh my goodness in fact when we ran into them i could not introduce this sister and say that she was a believer because i'm witnessing to this sister about wearing skirts what do i do i say huh this is one of our friends because you know what as soon as this sister and pants would see that she's like oh versailles she's not wearing skirts and i'm like i know so i had to introduce a little bit different that day caught right in the act don't fear god true story now all right let's let's get to this ezekiel 22 19 29 the people the land if anyone has a problem with that i i'm sorry that is that is the way i see it and remember when i prayed for truth he sent me to brother isaiah brooks's church and brother isaiah brooks the preacher say anything the people and have used oppression and exercise robbery and have vexed the poor needy yeah they have oppressed a stranger wrongfully he says and i sought for a man among them that would make up a hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land for i would not destroy he says but i found none now let's get into this i want you to i want to show you something here for the day of vengeance is in my heart what is the day of vengeance maokai 4-5 5-6 unless i come and smite the earth with the curse and the year of my redeemed is come there is a year coming saints whether it's this year or next year where the redeemed of god are going to be redeemed amen glory but it's going to be the exact god has two things in his heart judgment and mercy judgment and grace grace and i looked and there was none to help and i wondered there was none to uphold therefore my own arm brought salvation unto me in my period with it upheld me and i'll tread down the people in my anger and make them drunk in my fury and i'll bring down their strength to the earth we're at that time but when he brings the judgment what's supposed to happen here behold i send elijah the prophet right but what are the lies of the prophet do let me show you in the message let me show you this in the message here 6 8 62. he says if these mighty signs would have been done in russia it wouldn't be communist today these mighty signs would be on china wouldn't be communist day oh america america how oft hath god visit you and how much longer will he permit it the end time is here the evening lights are shining he said how much longer do we have 1960 and 2. we're at the end he says 1962 1962 he says how much longer do we have 1963 you leave the west coast and go right back into china japan right back in again seven thousand miles across you're right back to east again so east west is matt that's all of it he says we're at the end he says there's nothing left 1963 why did god have to send the spirit of elijah instead of the spirit of samuel why did god have to spend the spirit of elijah instead of moses at this time and why in this time where the seal is broken notice the man of god he says there's nothing left he said what's the matter with the pentecostal church you don't want to listen to something that that'll that'll do you good it'll make you sick to your theological gastronomics but it'll do you good it'll work you out back to the word of god and back to the faith that was once delivered to the saints and take away from all this here bible school theological seminary giving you ministers all kinds of degrees god never did hand out a handful of solid apples like that he wanted to have men of faith correct he said i know that's hard but i'm here to tell i'm here to i'm not here to baby you and make you laugh and make you shout i'm here to tell you the truth in god and you'll see someday if you don't believe it now some day will come when you'll say that was right true you've got to get back the whole thing is in this condition there's nothing left for it to come but the coming of the lord jesus 63. he said in other words he's saying we're done it's over the saints of god that was 1963 it's 2021 june 18. what are the birthdays god why 18 why are we still here i notice what was the spirit of elijah remember god always wanted he says give me a man that will tell the truth give me a man that can see the truth why do you have to be a prophet saints of god in 1909 the end of the azusa street revival is stopped at that year the reducer street bible after three years and you know from the testimonies of those at the judiciary revival why it stopped the woman said there was so much pride in it and god shut it down and then those ministers so prideful they said they went and started their own denominations and what was the one doctrine they went up on speaking in tongues is the evidence of the holy ghost and god sends a prophet in right at that time and nobody knows what the truth is saints of god when i was the nomination what's the truth i was studying pentecostal stuff i go over and talk to baptists and i go check the rest of the catholic church out went out to other churches whatever this church looking for more truth i was looking for something greater they're preaching about women uh marriage money uh holidays uh program in the churches and i'm thinking this is all there is to it and it was like that back then too but god had to ordain one man who would come in with the prophet gift and be able to discern what is truth and what is not by the word of god correct but now why was it not a moses or a samuel anointing it was an elijah anointing what is different about elijah and samuel what is different about elijah and moses the anointing now notice what he does here this is one of my favorite sermons called indictment some god was looking for one man to call this whole thing out he says he says no he says you mess this baptist protection lutheran pentecost is the most holy places there he receives his hardest pierces a new cavalry what is he doing he is pronouncing judgment is he bringing grace he's bringing condemnation where is he crucified at from the pastors you hear hypocrites you know better than that i'm not angry i'm but there's something inside me stirring it was the spirit of elijah stirring in him the holy ghost he says god had been thoroughly identified among you where did he get his spears at in his side where did he get his pierces on calvary where does he get it today in the pulpit he was calling god had to find a man to call the thing out and he said this is wrong this is right now why do you have to bring judgment prophet was ordained to bring a judgment and indictment an indictment is a sentence has been served they've been found guilty in the wanting in other words he says it's over but why are we still here i got a right to bring an indictment against this generation because as hard as spears points have been right from the pulpits where they've criticized and said yo go out to hear that stuff oh my goodness people within this message are criticized writing a place is supposed to love him crown from the audience by scoffers he's got a new crown of thorns he said scoffers pierced from the pulpit crowned by the scoffers if is he is he crucified again afresh stripped by man-made creeds teachers of denomination against his word they strip it in shame condemn it 1965. america america notice he said he says how much longer in 62 he's in america how much longer we got 1965 he says there's a million miles from being a christian country i don't even pray for it the spirit of god in malachi 4 told our our our prophet don't even pray for america what had taken place the indictment was served it was passed the gavel went down but saints of god why are we still here it's 2021 july 18th why are we still here if judgment remember he said what in malachi 4-1 that they will burn as an oven but why are we still here because god sent elijah the prophet and not moses remember shadows and types he did not send to moses anointing he did not send the same anointing he sent an elijah anointing and watch this what does the scripture say here elias was a man subject to like passions as we are he prayed earnestly that it might not reign and he prayed not on the earth and it rained out on earth for space of three years and six months he prayed again and heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth the rain brethren if any man if any of you do air from the truth and one convert him let him know that he which converteth the sinner from the air of his way shall save his soul from death and hide a multitude of sins right notice these disciples were seeing a man that wouldn't follow him and they said lord will thou command fire come down from heaven that we can sue them even as elias did he said you don't even know what matter of spirit you are they were trying to bring an elijah spirit at the come first coming of the lord the elijah's spirit was not until this day but why are we still here the key lies right here i'm going to show you a scripture this let me tell you something who interceded for you did brother branham intercede for you no i'm going to show you something by the grace of god who stepped in why is it not burnt why are you alive i know it's quite crazy question for you sister why are you still alive why are we here why was i born why were you born brother william it's 2021. 65's already this should have been burnt because the indictment already was given why are we sitting here notice the first elijah and it came and as he came through to a cave elijah and behold the word of the lord came unto him and sent to him what thus thou hear elijah what does elijah say look what elijah said he says i've been very jealous for the lord of god of hosts for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown dying down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i the spirit of elijah i i am only alone do you think anyone very few people even understood the prophet's message even in his day but notice the spirit of elijah did not bring intercession for israel he says i and i only have left and they seek my life to take it away verse 14 he says again he says i have been very jealous for the lord god thy host because of the children of israel forsaken the covenant throw down altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i and i am left alone he says and they seek my life to take it away do you see any do you see intercession there any mercy or any grace there none but look what jesus said look what god said yet elijah yet i say that hath god cast away his people god forbid he says for i also am an israelite of the seed of abraham here we go saints of the tribe of benjamin god had not cast away his people which he for knew what united the scripture stands of a lie yes elijah how he maketh intercession to god against israel he did not make intercession for you the spirit of elijah was supposed to bring judgment not intercession he says lord they have killed thy prophets and dig down night altars and i am left alone to seek my i am left alone and and they seek my life but what did god answer i have reserved to myself seven thousand men who have not bowed down the knee the image of baal even so at this present time even so at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace so malachi 4 according to malachi 4-5 he was a prophet not of grace but what the prophets say he said he said moses represented the law and elijah represented justice why do you think the seals had to be broken in 1963. let me show you this quote look elijah never knew even one of them that was that way he thought he was the only one saved until god opened one of the seals and showed him the mystery in the book why are we still here because god had to open the seals because judgment was pronounced but to save you and i god had to open the seals and release that there was more in the type there were 7 000 more to be saved hey you know why the fire hasn't fallen yet saints because your names were sealed up in the seven seals and they had to be released to stop judgment that's why you're here today there's still more to come how many more need save things the fire is ready to fall but those seals had to be broken and those seals contained every name that was written from the foundation of the earth that needed to be saved what was the old testament type right here brother was talking about elijah right back here in the still small voice and he said when god spoke back he said that was the open of the seventh of the first seal or the seals until god opened one of the seals and showed him the mystery what's the mystery in the book that he had seven hundred seven thousand look you messed up on that seven hundred to never bow down to the creeds in other words you're here because you are not going to bow down to these denominational creeds amen there are people past 63 they're going to be baptized they would be able to see and receive the baptism in the name of jesus christ see the one god had seen the original sin see everything and receive the baptism of the holy ghost brother you're going to go off the scene and i've got a whole bunch more coming [Laughter] hey man how many has passed you i mean we're saying to god we're literally the fire's just right up there waiting to fall but because you are here and you were called you were elected well maybe maybe it was better that i wasn't what you know if i wasn't born i've been okay if you would never if you would not have been born if god brought about that stuff right there you would never know the joys of salvation you would never get to taste eternal life up there with him as the bride he brought forth more bride after judgment was passed absolutely robin said what in the church book he says when she knows who she is we better start waking up to see who we are god actually prolonged the judgment of elijah he said brother brahm here brother graham said i see that's wrong that's wrong no wrong or wrong he's just passed judgment done but god said you're gonna go off now it's been judged it's been judged by a man it's been judged by a prophet but there are people coming through oh hallelujah even though she said thus saith the lord god is withholding that word from striking come and smite the earth with the curse that burning praise god i'll stand do you see who you are i hope that you see why we are still here it is the grace of god godhead well if i was never born if you were because you were born he wanted you to taste ever there is something eternal about you and god was not going to let a prophet's word stand in the way he needed that to happen god needed a man to come in and condemn it the saints of god who are you he's withheld this thing for 40 50 years waiting for you to come into position saints of god i when this thing opened up to you guys it makes all the sense you look at these sermons 63 62 64 65 judgment judgment judgment then then 63 brings the opening of the seven seals to save us we had to come forward because we were eternal you can't stop eternal if even the prophet could not stop eternal eternal will come forward and you are eternal it proves that we're that's why we're still here because you are eternal god cannot burn you hey man oh praise god i just to me i know that was kind of long and drawn out whatever i'm telling you what's saying to god if you catch who you are if you understand why this thing took place the reason why things hit at certain times and why we're still saints of god that's who you are it was for you god interceding for you this time it wasn't a moses it wasn't a man but one came off the throne named jesus christ hallelujah and what he was the one that stood in the gap in the breach for us today amen oh hallelujah god that natural israel being received by a natural man but spiritual israel there's only one man in heaven on earth that was worthy to take that and he interceded for us praise god let's just praise him praise praising hater hallelujah we love you lord oh we love you lord jesus thank you lord god so much praise the lord how is oh we love you lord amen thank you lord i know i took a long way around it but i i just thought that thought he just came to me i you asked your pastor that's correct or not but i'll tell you what scene that's how i see it god is so good he is so
