========================================

I'd like to go to first Thessalonians 4 tonight I'd like to continue the Rapture series I'm almost at the at the ending of this beautiful powerful sermon from God's Prophet brother Brandon but not quite so maybe got one or two more services here by God's grace at the end of this OCC I'll have slides but I don't right now I just I got a couple nice little pictures I think the people will appreciate if You' never seen them before tonight you're going to see Lord willing brother brandom's own handwriting on his own sermon notes you ever seen knows brother Mercy yeah have you ever seen his handwritten notes brother brother brother randoms have you seen him yeah Hallelujah so you get a real it's a real treat to see brother Ram's short hand hallelujah what a blessing God sent us a prophet in this day amen so let's go to uh 1 Thessalonians 4 I think it's 16 and 17 if I'm not mistaken God's grace we look at the shout voice Trump I'll be dealing with the shout here today uh by the grace of the Lord so let's read uh I'll read 16 and then we can all read 17 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first let's read this one two three then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated God bless you all right so we'll see how far we can get here on this uh sermon you know we've looked at brother Bram sermon from December 4th 1965 uh this is part seven of the coming of the lord The Rapture mystery I still got a couple more sermons to preach I got God in Simplicity and then the spoken words Original Seed in this little series here now in this particular sermon brother Rams addressed scoffers in the last days as second Peter said the importance of Revelation was the second part and then you looked at uh election so going back even further if person has Revelation then it's it's likely they're elected to eternal life um and then we he looked at types of the Rapture with Enoch and so forth and then uh we we're looking at the shout the voice and the Trump uh last time we looked at this before brother cim had come uh to preach for us so now we're going to pick up here and look at uh the three parts of the Rapture again uh by God's grace now in this particular sermon brother randam says uh he addresses the shout voice Trump three times so I want you to hear uh kind of what he says here again to make a point you know uh some people uh believe the shout started when brother brandom opened the seals that's what I believe um but we don't have a thus sayith the Lord on it there's actually very few quotes on shout voice Trump I found eight today that's a very small sample size none of them are thus sayith the Lord uh some people don't believe that uh because it can it can seem kind of uh odd uh you think the Rapture started in 1963 well in that's the way I believe it yes because the shout the shout is Jesus Christ himself the shout has to go out to gather everybody together right the shout it's a it's a stimulating cry in the Greek there's got to be a shout to gather the people and so yes I do believe the Rapture is a process uh just like uh The Exodus was a process with Moses it was a process it just wasn't one instant it was an entire process and brother R even calls our Rapture the Third Exodus so again another testimony uh for this but again we don't have a thus sayith the Lord either way we have a thus sayith the Bible but we don't have any particular interpret ation thus sayith the Lord so that's how I've always taught it I've always taught it that way I feel like I'm just getting more Revelation here as as time goes on uh but again I'm open to correction if I'm wrong I just want to be right now what's notable I'll get to a little bit what's notable out of these eight quotes um uh brother brandham uh doesn't really give uh he's I'm sorry on four of them he's just reading the scripture and then on uh three of them as you'll see he actually teaches the shout was his message message his message all the revelations and the finished mystery of God the prophecies on three of them he says that was the message to get the bride ready okay and then on two of them I'll show you he just says uh one he said there's a big clap of Thunder but he get doesn't give a verse and then he gives another one uh where he just talks about the Corporal body of Jesus coming back which that's what the Rapture will be the Rapture will be the Corporal body of Jesus in a glorified condition meeting us in the air by God's grace so that's just a little introduction there so there's three parts of the Rapture shout voice Trump and in this part of the the sermon I'm now looking at the third time he's mentioned it the first time he mentioned he said a shout what is a shout it's the message going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth the bride now look at that look at and look at the verse he uses Amos 3:7 you want to put that up there h brother Ram uses uh Amos 37 as a verse uh God surely God will do nothing but he revealed his secret unto his servants the prophets now leave that up there just for a moment this is the first scripture brother Braham uses to say the shout will be a message the living bread bringing forth the bride and again we don't have thus sayi the Lord but I just want want you to see how brother Ram taught it right before he passed away and I'm not saying it was thus sayi the Lord I'm just saying this is how he taught it and I'll show you the notes you can actually see it in his notes his own handwritten writing so I don't feel bad so bad about my handwriting anymore I used to but I don't feel so bad you know CU We All We're Men we're just doing our best uh you you'll you'll be real tickled brother Jose and brother Williams saw when we went to brandom Tabernacle they actually have these his actual notes hanging up there in the voice of God Recordings office now of course I believe that's an office of mostly idolatry right but I do respect them for printing books but they're they most of them have the idolatrous spirit so that's the first mention I've already preached that to you in earlier sermons oh yeah and then he reads another one he says we've come through the church ages but we're promis in the last days according to Malachi 4 that there would be return again a prophet in the land so now pull up Malachi 45 and 6 AAA so here's the first two verses he uses how many you think these are familiar verses to us very familiar right even down the little children have you heard me use these verses before for sure yeah we've gone through these behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord this he ties this in with a shout right you can listen to yourself I I would encourage you I would say if I'm wrong you know correct me please correct me somebody correct me I'm this is exactly what brother Ram said uh about uh the shout he says and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with the curse so our scripture we know this first part right here was John the Baptist he turned the heart of the fathers Apostolic fathers to the children or the second coming of Christ and the Heart of the children that's us the Believers at the second coming of Christ back to the Apostolic Pentecostal fathers okay and how is it done it's by the spirit of Elijah okay all right so that's the first two verses brother uses now the second time he he quotes it in the same Rapture sermon he says there's a shout what is it is a message to get the people together a message comes forth now he says first now lamp trimming time rise and trim your lamps now we know that's Matthew 25 we're not going to read that one honey he said but it's lamp trimming time lamp trimmy time it's Malachi 4 time it's Luke 17:30 okay so those are all familiar right get your lamp trimmed right uh so you can have the oil burning which the oil is the what the baptism of the Holy Ghost so this is all the shout this is all he uses all these verses on the shout two uh three four yeah four because he uses Malachi four again he said the shout is Malachi four time that's why that's why so many preachers in the message believe that because brother Ram said the shout is Malachi four time it's a message getting the bride ready Hallelujah the bride the bride it's getting the bride ready hallelujah how many getting ready tonight Hallelujah and church again we just saw seven I just baptized 17 Junction City Saints and that that's God getting his bride ready right the Rapture couldn't happen without them the Rapture could happen with God sending Lena Hallelujah right it had to happen and they really like your testimony so far so it's really awesome to see that Hallelujah especially the sisters that's why I knew i' that's why I like to get the sisters testimony because they want some encouragement they want to know has sisters been through what I've been through and and God has moved amongst you guys or gals our sister is so powerfully I wanted to share it by God's grace now Luke 17:30 is the day of the son of man that's brother Ram's prophetic gift as as the son of man as a prophet the son of man Jesus Christ giving brother brandham the Messiah sign to tell people the secrets and thoughts and Tents of their heart that's Luke 17:30 even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed this is the shout brother R's tying all these verses in with a shout now I've already preached all those to you now here's the new one where I pick up I'm about an hour and 20 minutes into this sermon and it's a it's a less than two hour sermon he says shout a messenger getting the people ready and then he goes into uh the the voice of the Resurrection he says the same voice that called Lazarus from the grave that'll be the voice of Jesus Calling uh uh the the dead in Christ alive and the last thing is a trump uh a trump is a calling together brother R said calling everyone to the the the marriage the bride supper the lamb supper with the bride in the sky the marriage supper of the Lamb so does everybody see that the shout was brother Ram's message it's still going out right that's what he taught in this sermon I know he didn't teach it everywhere else but he had very few quotes on it the second is Jesus will call his voice will call forth the dead in Christ so that'll be brother brandom that'll be Paul Peter James John the dead in Christ rise first hopefully we see them by God's grace to raise our faith and then the Trump is the voice of Jesus as well where our bodies are changed in a moment twinkling of an eye Hallelujah so those are the three steps of the Rapture brother tells us that he goes over this three times in this sermon the Rapture and then he got then he says it a fourth time the first things comes forth is his message calling the bride together Hallelujah so he says it he says it uh four times okay so I'm going to just go over this again what is the shout he said it's the message going forth the living bread bringing forth the bride so this connects to Malachi 4 again all those scriptures that we we use there and so if the bride is still being gathered like The Junction City Saints then the shout still going forth and the church said right we're still Gathering bride members Hallelujah and hopefully that brother there Derek in the prison is calling bride members too because they can recognize Lord Jesus Christ is the name of the father son Holy Ghost amen hallelujah like Anna Patrick and Claude recognized this summer Hallelujah bride members amen hallelujah praise God that's right it's the living bread bringing forth the living bride Hallelujah then he says it's the the the shout is the message to get the people together calling the people together Hallelujah and then he says the message is lamp trimming time Malachi four time Luke 173 time hallelujah it's that shout it's a in it's a stimulating cry shout get ready the the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him Hallelujah and again I'll say like this again Saints if our lamps are still being trimmed then our lives are still getting in order then the shout is still sounding church if your life was in order you'd already be dead or raptured right right and so that's the confidence we have the saints that have gone on died before like brother brandom they were already ready for the Rapture when when God chose to take them they were ready they were as mature as they were going to be just like a wheat grain being ripened at the right time it's mature as it's going to be hallelujah amen so that's the confidence we have no matter what age God uh calls these Believers home whether it's younger or older they're in the right condition God knows they're ripe hallelujah amen it has to be or else God uh God's wrong but no God is God God is uh trimming our lamps Hallelujah uh he he's getting us ready he's getting us uh he's letting us hear the message so our lives are being prepared for the coming of the Lord hallelujah then he says again a messenger getting the people ready calling the bride together Oh Glory that's what I heard I got I got called out of denominations into the bride age which is just the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's five times brother says bride age he just means the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's not some separate age uh outside of Leo or something like that we're still living in leoda but we're in uh we're in the time where the Holy Ghost is falling we're born born again we're bride members Hallelujah in other words we're we're the bride sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Hallelujah so many people try to miss that they they they spiritualize it they they get people off track off into a bunch of nonsense but uh we pray for them I pray for them all right now let me read you some other quotes now so I just read you those uh three or four quotes where brother ram calls the shout a certain thing now a week before he preached the Rapture he called the shout here he didn't he didn't he didn't uh call the shout the message he said this he's praying he said dear God he said it's going to be a time like this when there really will be a clap of Thunder someday and the Son of God shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise and each one of us knows and we're aware tonight father that we're going to have to answer for every word we give and every word we say even the thoughts that's in our hearts we're going to answer for it okay so this was a week before now did he give scripture anybody's I don't see any anyone's welcome to correct me after service he didn't give any Scripture he just said there's going to come a clap of Thunder someday he didn't say seven Thunders okay he said a clap of Thunder he doesn't give a verse I read before and after he doesn't give a verse but then a week later he said he lists all these verses Luke 17:30 Malachi 4 Matthew 25 uh he lists all these verses Amos 3:7 so you just have to take this and uh we just he didn't give us a scripture so we just have to look at it and say okay well uh we'll just have to uh be kind right and just do our best to rightly divide the word of truth right can everybody see that now the ne the only other time or I'm sorry there's two other times he actually used a scripture one was in 1962 so three years earlier in July we would see Jesus he said I believe in his literal coming Corporal body descending from the heavens with a shout with the voice of the Archangel the Trump of God the dead in Christ shall rise but his spirit is here with us he doesn't list any other scriptures he just says when the shout voice Trump it's the it's the the Corporal Body of Christ okay now is the Corporal Body of Christ here now right now during the shout no so see some people will they might take that quote over the quotes from The Rapture but to me there's more scriptures with the Rapture quotes so that's why I go with that okay but if somebody wants to believe the shout isn't until the literal Corporal body of Jesus is in the meeting in there that's fine they can believe that that that's wonderful I mean brother R said the main thing is to get ready for his coming Hallelujah that's the main thing amen but I think everybody can agree there is brother R's message is still going out and people are still getting their lamps trimmed Hallelujah are you with me right we see it in Junction City right we people are still getting their lamps trimmed Hallelujah there's still a sh I'm sorry there a shout there there's still a message going out we can see that and brother R tied it in to shout voice Trump at the end of his life but if you want to stay with the July that's 62 that's fine people can have that okay what what we see is that he never taught on the shout very thoroughly until that last sermon but then he was rushed by the woman at the back Lord have mercy on that woman on the day of on the day of judgment that hotel owner she was rushing brother brandom out and you can tell brother br's rushing to try to finish the sermon if you haven't listened to it you should listen to it he's doing his best uh now the only other time he used the scripture was Matthew 24:40 you want to pull that up there hun and I already preached this one to you you won't remember don't feel bad it's from the sudden Seeker going away 1958 when I preached that sermon remember uh uh what was the bombing Pearl Harbor remember I preach on Pearl Harbor brother William was still here okay Pearl Harbor how brother used that to tell people you got to be ready any time for the Rapture because the judgment's on the way Hallelujah I know everybody's calling this a golden day for America but we'll see if if they actually let president Trump into office and then we'll see how they fight him we'll see nobody knows for sure I'd say say like this it's only a golden age for the bride hallelujah it's a golden age for the bride because she's got thus sayith the Lord she's got the word of God hallelujah and she's got uh that's right she's got gold Tried by the fire amen hallelujah praise God Amen fire tried Faith by God's grace Time tested faith brother ra says one will be in the field working daytime the other one in a bed sleeping and the other one on the other side side of the world it'll be a universal Rapture and will come with a shout with the voice voice of the arch Archangel and the Trump of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise and she'll be called away secretly oh I love that that great bridegroom coming and the bride got herself ready waiting for that secret moment that she doesn't even know herself but she's ready and dressed and waiting for it so this is the only other verse right he says clap of thunder in 60 uh 65 but we don't know he doesn't give us a verse he says uh and then he said a Corporal body doesn't give a verse just just mentions it okay so the most thorough that I can find I could I'm open open to be correcting um I'm open to be corrected but the the the deepest teaching I've seen on it is in this Rapture sermon 1965 so I lean towards that teaching uh brother R gave us in the Rapture but I also admit it wasn't spoken with thus sayeth the Lord okay now I'm going to get back to this in just a moment but brother Ram says this he said says uh right after this he says we're right there ready now the only thing the church coming out has got to lay before the sun to ripen the great combine will come by after a while the wheat will be burned the stalks but the grain will be gathered into its Garner see you're not blind people you're sensible people so brother ra says anyone with spiritual eyes will know uh the combine is coming it's Harvest Time amen hallelujah if you got eyes that can see if you rub on the iav you'll see it's Rapture time Church can't you see both seeds are making themselves ready we can see the left insane woke seeds they asked me what woke was we can see that's them coming to the fruition of their their seed the seed is producing of its own kind but we must not be in despair because we know our seed is producing of Our Own Kind it's the word kind Hallelujah I've got a word seed I only believe the word I'm a Child of God I'm filled with the Holy Ghost I love Jes Jesus I given my whole life I've surrendered everything to him I've got a word seed Hallelujah that's what you've got amen hallelujah now I just want to just think about this there's numerous quotes brother R says we just got to lay in the presence of the sun now what does that mean what is the presence of God the presence of God is God's spirit Among Us right and David said in his presence is fullness of joy Psalm 16 put it up there hun psalm 16 so if these message people don't have joy then they're not laying in the presence of the Son and the church said all right 16 all right now I got to skip down I didn't pull it up there I just that actually just came to me i' forgotten about that verse psalm 16 in his presence is fullness of joy yes verse 11 thou will show me the path of Life how many believe he'll do that for you especially young people uh where where do I go with my life Malachi is asking that Lydia is asking where do I go with my life he'll show it to you Hallelujah he showed me where to go I to get that full scholarship because I was poor and couldn't afford College he showed me where to go it's very plain to see where to go right he'll show you the way to go you just got to listen for him right brother Mercy he'll show you to come to akaran right now I hope you stay brother we love to have you stay but God's going to show him his path of life right that W show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are Pleasures forever more it is a pleasure to be a Christian it's joyful it's pleasurable to be a message believer Hallelujah if not it's time to start fighting Hallelujah get your joy back because we all know at some point you were Joyful We had power we had joy we had Victory just get it back let's fight the good fight of Faith tonight Hallelujah you can get it back Hallelujah I've got it back Hallelujah the best place to get it is in prayer closet amen or somewhere here at the altar somewhere you know just just a little talk with Jesus makes everything right see so if we're laying in the presence of the sun then we'll have Pleasures in the presence of the Holy Ghost we'll have joy in the presence of the Holy Ghost these are all things that we have while we're laying in the presence of the sun now I just want to show you and I looked up on the internet now this is chat GTP so bear with me here but I asked in Israel how long is the each stage of the growth for the wheat plant so it looks like a pretty good article it's got a citation it normally uh is grown as a winter crop and they align with the Mediterranean climate's rainfall but the first seven to 14 days is germination and when the uh the little plant emerges the next two or three weeks is tillering it's from December to January the plant develops additional choots and then the next four to six weeks is stem elongation from January to February the wheat plant begins to grow taller as a stem elongates leading to the formation of nodes growth depends on temperature and nutrient availability then for the next two or 3 weeks in February or March the head starts to develop and emerges from the leaf sheath proper moisture and W mild temperatures support this stage and then the flowering stage is in the next one to two weeks in March and April pollination occurs the plant is highly sensitive to heat and drought stress during this stage how many want to be sensitive to the heat of the Holy Spirit hallelujah praise God but how many know there's cold Seasons too so what's going to get us through stay planted in Christ Hallelujah stay planted in Christ brother R says when the winds blow you know sence says it too when the winds blow your roots just go deeper Hallelujah when the Trials come you just get more faith Hallelujah for the next trial Hallelujah there's going to be some cold spells but you'll get through the season God works everything out in his own time Hallelujah he makes all things beautiful in his time so after grain filling no next is grain filling uh from April to May four to six weeks this is the plant shifts in resources to filling the grains warm days and cool nights promote good grain development now you can see the wheat grain at this time but here's what I've read other places if you pick it off and you pinch it milk comes out right which means it's not hard enough it's kind of weak right it's a little wimpy it's a baby it cries a little bit it's got its baby milk out right it's got It's a baby it's not mature and see church when we get pinched we can't cry too much about it I mean complain I mean sin I'm not talking about I do cry when when when tough times come I'll cry but I'm not talk I'm not talking about those kind of Tears I'm talking about complaining tears and sinful Tears like fighting somebody back or uh trying to get revenge on somebody that's what I'm talking about it's immaturity but it's still the it's still a seed now of course in the natural if you if you crack it like that you've ruined it right but that that proves to us that God's protected us and he won't let the devil crack us hallelujah because I just said it's harvest time I just said it's time for the seeds to mature Hallelujah that's right glory to God and then after that four to six weeks is the ripening stage it's actually the last stage and this is what brother man was talking about it's only two to four weeks it's two weeks to a month it's from May to June the grains mature and Harden as the plant dries out Farmers prepare for Harvest during this time so it just gets hard and church let me just say like this it just becomes solid amen right it becomes hard and and you you couldn't you couldn't squeeze it and and milk would come out you're a solid Christian you're a mature Christian that's the kind God's going to Rapture Hallelujah brother had been through many storms and many Trials of Life many difficult times but by the end of his life he was a hardened Soldier he was solid and I I always love what he said about brother Neville brother brother Neville's the same every day same brother Neville day in day out that's what he not only uh I he said I don't only like his preaching I like that he lives his preaching same every day what he's hard he's he's solid he's a real mature believer God help us to live the same every day Hallelujah be mature ripen Hallelujah so lay in the presence of the Sun the joy the pleasures of the Lord lay brother it's time to lay in the presence of the son and then last stage eighth stage oh eight is eternity amen eight stage is Harvest Time from late May to early June once the grain reaches full maturity the crop is harvested so the total growth cycle lasts about five to seven months seven months oh I like that seven Church ages seven depending on environmental conditions and the wheat variety glory to God hallelujah now I'm going to read a few more here before I show some visuals here next in this sermon brother Ram says his message was to open the Seven Seals all those Mysteries brother ra said and if I stood here and said those things for prejudice question mark I say it because it's life because I'm responsible to God for saying it I'm must say it and my message all the time knowing back there under healing so he talking about his first poll and second poll back there under healing and so forth that was just to catch the people's attention knowing the message would come and here it is and them Seven Seals open those Mysteries and showing these things is what's happened I didn't know it now church I don't know what caught you but what caught me was actually the Mysteries what caught me so some people when they hear Brother R they'll just hear us t and they'll see him on YouTube and he'll be Discerning there and people see that that's the that's the first and second poll and that will catch people they like oh my this guy knows Secrets Benny Hinn even says I mean all these guys Kenneth copelan and Bill Johnson they these guys are all Heretics but they all can recognize brother had a gift of God they can all enjoy the healing but what do they miss they miss the third poll the opening of the word hallelujah what caught our attention the Mysteries the third poll marriage and divorce serpent seed the godhead waterb baptism amen all these great truths brother said that's what the first two polls were to do get the people's attention so they'll look to the third pole they'll look to the opening of the word hallelujah he said the opening of these Seven Seals and again the Seven Seals it unmasks God's anointing remember there four anointings on the church it it it reveals those but it also unmasks Satan's four horse riders so that we can overcome the Gates of Hell Hallelujah now look what brother says I might have read this before and forgive me if this is a repeat I didn't think this was a repeat but if it was forgive me he says ' but there's men standing here now was standing right with me when all you heard me preach that sermon s what time is it now you remember that from a few months ago it's okay if you don't brother R also called this verse you remember the other name he gave this uh for this sermon the seven Thunders that was it was a sermon he preached about the vision he had about going out west meeting the seven angels in a in a snow white pyramid remember that he had a he had a vision about that in late 1962 he told the church about it December 30th I think think was 1962 he said in the name of the Lord something's going to happen and then he goes out there two months later and experiences the cloud it was a prophecy and he says there's men standing here now that was with me then when all you heard me preach that sermon what time is it sir that morning exactly where it said it would be there stood Seven Angels standing right there from heaven and as they went up the the Whirlwind taking them up there we were standing watching as they went away science took a picture of it so now he ties back in that cloud picture with his ministry the shout hallelujah right that's God vindicating Revelation chapter 10 God coming down and giving an open book to Brother brandom The Seven Seals have been revealed Hallelujah they've been revealed the Mysteries have been finished the Bible's a new Bible amen hallelujah it's a brand new Bible Hallelujah because we have the revelations Hallelujah and brother's backing that up he's saying I'm just not saying that there's men that were there that that saw it as well and I told you about it before it happened in the name of the Lord hallelujah all right let me go a little further here by God's grace I got plenty of time now the next story he gives I'm just going to do a few more stories before I get to these final visuals here um brother Bram tells a story about that CL oh yeah talking about the cloud there that we had the picture of that I showed you a couple weeks ago and he said he asked Jack Moore Jack Moore um he says uh why why did Jesus have white hair in Revelation chapter 1 he said that always puzzled him and because he's connecting that white cloud remember the holy spirit said turn the picture right and then brother could see oh that's the head of Christ right brother said that's Christ looking down at us but he said I always wonder why do he have the white hair and uh Jack Moore told him oh that's Jesus's glorified body and brother said that didn't ring the bell he said then I went to prayer and God showed me that white represents not just the glorified body it represents deity that Jesus is the Supreme judge he's Lord God Almighty he's he who was he who is and he who is to come Hallelujah he's all of it amen he's the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end he's all of God hallelujah the fullness of the godhead dwelt in Christ bodily now I want to say this I believe that white hair does represent the glorified body now people might think I'm crazy for that they can think whatever they want but Church there's only three bodies there's only a a there's only a natural body a theophany and a glorified so which one is which one is Jesus in right now he's got to be in the glorified he's got to be in the glorified because he rose with that body right and then he that that glorified body uh was walking there after the resurrection it walked through walls it could disappear it could change it form it has to be the glorified body but brother said that didn't ring a bell because there was more truth to that yes it's the glorified body but also it's God in Christ reconciling the world to himself all of God was in Christ hallelujah amen all power and authority is given unto me okay so some people disagree with me on that too that's fine they can do whatever they want but there's only three bodies you show me where there's four bodies or five bodies or six bodies you show me brother ra tells us and who is this mezic there's only three bodies so if you don't believe there's the glorified body you're going against brother random in other places so you got to rightly divide the word of Truth okay so it has to be Jesus in a glorified body but it's the white is referring to Supreme deity Jesus is the judge and the Holy Spirit said go back into the days of the founding fathers what did the judges always wear a white wig so that cloud come down with Jesus with the white wig on showing he's Supreme judge of this Earth Hallelujah he's judge of Heaven judge of Earth Hallelujah and the judge said you're pardoned the judge said you're Justified amen amen hallelujah that's what the judge said he's my Advocate he's also the advocate too he's also the lawyer and the judge Hallelujah he's all of it Hallelujah now then brother R goes into how the bride is Justified as though you never did it at all now our flesh did it our mind did it but the soul that's anointed the anointed Soul did not do any sin because that anointing is the Holy Ghost is that right but your body's guilty your mind's guilty that's totally guilty those parts of you did Sin but the soul uh but but the soul that's born again cannot sin because it's the seed of God hallelujah I think it's first John 4:9 case you want to pull that up there I ought to have that one memorized by now shame on me if I don't first John is it 49 no 48 shame on see shame on me tonight no it's not that one okay I got to find it I thought it was 48 bear with me if you find it you let me know somebody Shout It Out Lydia where's Lydia tonight where's Lydia when you need her I'm just joking okay I can't seem to find it so uh let me search in the concordance maybe it's chapter two no it's 39 sorry 39 I said 49 it's 39 thank you thanks for your patience Saints whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin this is what brother's talking about you never sin in the first place well what what part of you my flesh sins all the time my mind sins all the time every day brother Bram says I sin for his seed remains in him he cannot sin because he's born of God hallelujah the bride is born of God so the part that's born again is the soul the soul cannot sin it never did sin because it's part of God's spirit Hallelujah all right there you go he said uh the bride is married married to The Virtuous Son of God the sinless Son of God brother Bram says we're married so we have to have a part of us that never sin in the first place if we're to be married to the sinless one right we have to have that part that's his own life okay all right and then now brother BR breaks into this part we'll see I'm almost here to this part of showing the visuals brother said then we see we see the Rapture in types he said for every type we need two or three Witnesses he says he says there's already been three Old Testament raptures Enoch Elijah and Jesus alone there's already been three so he said that's three Witnesses then he says there's three new testament raptures one's already passed that was Jesus when he led captivity captive Hallelujah and then the second one he says is this bride the Gentile bride's Rapture that's the one we're living for Hallelujah and then the third one will be the two witnesses of Revelation probably Moses and Elijah or two men Anointed with their Spirits I personally believe it'll be Moses and Elijah but I could be wrong okay now I'm G to keep going here um next brother random goes into uh reading first Thessalonians four uh four again he talks about the three or the six raptures and then he breaks he's almost done he breaks into the armis day parade which was the Veterans Day Parade that's the old term for it Armistice Armistice Day parade and brother bam says he he watched him and Joseph watched the parade and they started with the the oldest war and then they worked their up to the most modern war right the most recent war and uh brother R said the last one was was gold star mothers that have lost their sons and and gold star wives have lost their husbands and a little boy who lost his daddy in the war and brother B said that's so sad he he said but one day there's going to be a blast and the dead in Christ will rise first so he's talking about the voice he's talking about the Second Step the voice of the Archangel the shout is getting everybody ready and now he's talking about one day there's a blast and the dead in Christ that that that dead soldier if he was a holy ghost filled Saint he'll rise when the voice of the Archangel sounds it's Christ Hallelujah he said he does all these as he's descending then brother R said see then we'll drop right in line brother R said the dead in Christ go first he said and then we'll go to meet them in the air in our order and remember there's an order for the Rapture we're not going to look at it but it's 1 Corinthians 15 I'll eventually get to it when I get to my series on Corinthians there's an order just like in the parade brother Braham saw the parade there was the order it was the oldest maybe the Civil War I don't know if there was any Civil War people alive in that time in 1965 the Civil War people and then any other Wars and then the World War II right that was the most recent War they they were they were uh presented in their order and brother says so is the rapture it'll be in its order Jesus with the uh Jesus with the Saints was first the bride will be second right and then Moses and elij third right in the order for six raptures Hallelujah then brother Ram says it the Rapture has been spoken it must come to pass he said just like when Moses was requested to speak for God as a prophet of God whatever God said to Moses it came to pass he said like Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive and she did it came to pass whatever God says will come to pass if the shout voice Trump is in the Bible it will come to pass oh there's going to be some people imagine some people will not have to have a funeral Hallelujah there's going to be some people they don't got to pay insurance money for the casket cuz they're not going to have a casket hallelujah amen they're going to have Angels they're going to have a brand new body pack them to a meeting in the air it's been spoken someone's going to manifest that just as sure as all these other prophecies came to pass someone is going to fulfill the shout voice and Trump that's the point brother BRS making just as Jesus called for Lazarus as resurrection and Lazarus came forth uh Jesus also said uh he said one day all those that are in the graves will hear the voice of the son of man and come forth to the Judgment it's going to happen Hallelujah each and every person that's ever lived is going to come to judgment they heal the voice of Christ think about that all these Napoleon and all these Great Men even George Washington all these great men and these evil men like Hitler melini and S they're all going to hear the voice of Jesus Christ calling them for judgment Hallelujah that's the P that's how powerful the voice of Christ is hallelujah oh but when the Savior calls let me answer for the rapture Hallelujah I want to hear his voice before the white Throne judgment I want to hear his voice at the meeting in the air praise God grant it Lord and then brother random in this sermon I don't know if you knew this he repeats his last prophecy about Los Angeles he said thus sayith the Lord Los Angeles will fall in the ocean he said it will he repeats it one more time he said just as sure as the Holy Spirit told me judgment is going to strike the West Coast and two days later alas Parts of Alaska broke apart and almost sunk brother Ram says I've got video I've got magazines of it in there it was it was a huge earthquake brother Ram said thus say the Lord judgment is going to strike the west coast and Alaska had this massive earthquake in 1964 he said the same voice that told me judgment was strike the same voice said Los Angeles is going to sink thus sayith the Lord now we don't know when I believe it be after the Rapture because I I don't see how that could be before the Rapture the Bible speaks of great earthquake I mentioned that a few months ago in Revelation all of them happen either during the trumpets or the vows it speaks of the the earthquake that will never be like it ever again I believe that it'll be that one Hallelujah and then he says uh okay yeah I'm gonna wait I'm gonna hold that for next time now I'm going to switch to some visuals here and I'm just going to try to finish up I'm GNA try to not preach hour I'm GNA try not to preach hour because I've been preaching and singing a lot and I'm really tired at home okay let's switch over here doesn't look like I'm tired but at home I'm a different Man Okay so let's do a few visuals here as we finish up by God's how many enjoying this Rapture series I've thoroughly enjoyed it I've really enjoyed it by God's grace it's good to revisit these things and see all the um the thoughts brother Ram put into this one sermon even being rushed so if you never seen brother Ram's handwriting or notes you're going in for a treat tonight I've seen them years I just I never thought about showing you guys so it kind of worked out or you Saints I shouldn't say guys you Saints it's been a long day so um here's brother Man's first few pages the Rapture Psalm that was his text Psalm 27 1-5 this is a new sermon he never preached this before on the shout voice Trump we are warned that the doctoring doctoring Doctrine will be scorned in the last days days 2 Peter 334 read that's his reminder read that he did remember he did like 30 minutes on scoffers I preach that to you guys you Saints sorry Lord have mercy but it is the revelation of his bride Church bread Church see how just a shorthand and then the section is on Revelation right so think about that he's preaching from the from memory he's basically like they say shooting from the hip these are his notes so brother in some people criticize his memory well he criticizes his memory like who doesn't have a bad memory who remembers everything in their life to me brother had a great memory yeah he remembered Mo I mean he's quoting scripture all throughout this sermon I the Lord of planted I water day and night Hallelujah he quotes that now he doesn't have in his notes here but he was he had a great memory when the spirit of God anointed him the Holy Spirit brought all things to his remembrance that was needed Hallelujah so we had a section on the first section was scorn uh scorners Revelation without rev Revelation there cannot be Faith that's beautiful he just got done preaching works as Faith Express and in that he says you can try to confess your healing all day long but you're not going to get it till God gives you the Revelation for it it's good to confess your healing it's good to confess any promise of God but it's not going to happen until you have a revelation it's God's will it's going to happen so look he had that in his notes you can't have faith unless there's a revelation about it and a revelation is an unveiling you can't believe something or or have hope for something unless God's revealed it to you and then he quotes that for faith is something that has been revealed to you like Abraham and that's what I preached to you a few weeks ago when I read that Abraham called those things not as though they were because God let him know you're going to have a child he knew it it was it was revealed to him he didn't have to question him brother Mercy he knew it now most of have to question are we going to live until the Rapture happens or not we have to question unless God gives us a thus sayith the Lord but if You' got to thus sayith the Lord you can be just like Abraham right I'm going to get a body changed I'm not going to die thus sayith the Lord now that's a statement I don't have that Revelation some people claim to have it but they don't say thus sayith the lord they're just boasting they're just presuming and the church said they're just presuming if you have a thus sayith the Lord Brother man if I had thus sayth the Lord I I wouldn't be afraid to announce it before the whole world because you know God told you hallelujah amen like Abraham Abraham could call those things not as though they were because God said you're going to have a son through Sarah now the Rapture is only for the bride Church the elected ones in him remember that's that section on Election he talks about um the germs and the egg right you talked about one at a million you know we talked about election how how that's mysterious that's more mysterious than the virgin birth right but it's it's predestination it's election and from the beginning father spiritual look he said jeans but he says Janes instead of attributes it's attributes that's his shorthand so don't feel bad if you're not a good speller prophet of God wasn't the perfect speller I try to do my best so see election uh you're a spiritual Gene you're an attribute you're an attribute you from God's mind Hallelujah now how do we get in him I read this to you or come alive to it come alive to the fact we're an attribute we're elected we're only for the Rapture remember uh 1 Corinthians 12 by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body Hallelujah brother uses this verse hundreds of times how do I go make sure I'm in the Rapture how do I know I'm GNA I'm the bride of Christ you get Born Again by the Holy Spirit praise God Amen you get baptized into the body of Christ and so this point he's already preached almost 50 minutes just with just with this with a page and and three quarters he's already preached 50 minutes now that's totally different from me right I'll show you my notes here's my notes for tonight I got to have a lot more notes than brother brandom these are all my notes for tonight brother Bram just had a few pages my wife laughing at me there's only been one time I've ever preached a sermon where I didn't have look at my notes that was in Guyana that's that's the day God healed that woman from uh kidney stone she had she was packing the baby there that was just a highly anointed service there then he breaks into Enoch Enoch was the seven type this is where he goes in the types of the Rapture the other six all died so the six men before Enoch all died right Adam all the way down Enoch lived okay how many like those notes well he wasn't really a scholar like some people huh but he didn't have to be he had to be a prophet of God and he was but thus sayith the Lord nobody ever spoke like that except it was another prophet of God okay now here's where we get into it now this this a little crooked here sometimes I wonder I know we got to let Mali see the word sometimes now look here's where he breaks into it he said this is new a shout a voice a trumpet Christ does all three as he descends so that's why some people believe you know Christ's spirit is more powerful now because the Bible said he does it as he's descending which I could I could say Amen to that we have more holy ghosts than Martin Luther had am than John Wesley than isusa street we have more right but we have a certain character about us there's a certain anointing we have the eagle anointing right they each had their own anointing now those three all had the man anointing but we've got the eagle anointing prophetic we know the we know the word of God the Revelation finish the mysteries of God and now look he says shout a message getting the living ready Mal Malachi 4 there's Malachi right there so Malachi spelled your name m a l Ki Malachi Malachi 4 Lamp trimming I love this because this shows me he was preaching from his heart he was preaching just as best he could by Revelation he's a prophet of God doing his best look at the prophet's notes I love it you remember this brother Mercy you remember have you seen these before yeah I only saw them there uh you know at the voice of God and this is all the things I've just preached to you seven sermons Worth right voice of resurrect the same one that called Lazareth from the dead St John 11 38-44 okay so you'll shout voice trumpet assembling the bride gather to at Feast of trumpet or or or maybe air I'm not sure I'm not sure okay so these are all things I've preached right right right from his sermon notes right right from the sermon uh transcript then after his resurrection rapture there has been one already passed in the New Testament so now he breaks into how there was three Old Testament three new testament there's been one already in the past that was Jesus and he said read that and he does read that he reads through that on the on the sermon uh when Jesus led captivity captive the the Old Testament Saints he led them up to heaven then then notice verse 50 his loud voice awakened the Old Testament Saints like it did Lazarus so again when the Rapture comes church only the elect are going to hear the voice of God only those elect are going to hear the voice and have their bodies change to go to meet the lord and there that's why we got to have that's why we have to recognize the voice of God right now praise God the voice of God is Not denomination thank God the voice of God is not in the government the voice of God is in the bride amen the spirit and the bride say come Hallelujah that's the word now we're humbled I know it must be hard for Lena sometimes it's hard for me to understand too that God would make me part of the voice of the Bride us how us not the government not the big denomination it's the bride those who love the bridegroom Hallelujah the real bridegroom the real word hallelujah what a privilege I mean could could we ask for any greater privilege in life no we this is the greatest privilege we could ask for in life to have thus sayith the Lord on the word of God to be the bride to have the voice of the Holy Spirit the spirit and the bride and the prophet uh say come and whatever they've said has already been said in the word of God hallelujah now the second will fulfill 1 Thessalonians 4 12- 18 okay so that's the so we are we are the second Rapture that's what he's talking about we're the second Rapture of the New Testament Jesus and the Old Testament Saints first we're second and then Moses and Elijah third everybody see that trying to show how brother man preached off his notes I thought you like it I like it and this is what we just I preached just tonight it has been spoken it shall come to pass for it is his promised word be ready be ready to ease be ready the vision now he he actually he ran out of time so he didn't have time to share the vision of the Bride remember the vision of the Bride he was out there and a voice said look there's the bride and the first bride was so beautiful he said it was the early church and E there was a bride there was a woman from every nation and they're all dressed modestly with long hair and and the voice said here the original bride's going to pass and they passed he said oh praise God he said now the Church of America or uh he said uh um what' he say uh he eventually he goes through different nations I was trying to think of the individual Nation but he eventually gets the United States and he said oh oh yeah I said the Church of Asia passed he said oh that was an awful group he said but the worst of all was Church of the United States He said a witch was leading them right witchcraft Rebellion is as witchcraft when the churches rebel against the word it's a witchcraft right they don't want to obey the word of God and brother said I want to go hide and cry and say all my preaching all these all these evangelists preaching all these years and this is what it's produced but then the voice said there's going to come another bride and he took courage Hallelujah and he said he saw he saw uh the bride for the second Rapture us he saw us again every woman or I'm sorry a woman from every nation he said dress just like they were at the beginning amen amen he said then he saw a few at the end that were getting out of step and he said he said stay in line and that's when he woke up from the vision so it shows some bride members sometimes they get a little out of Step but the voice of elaser Hallelujah the voice of the shout get them back in line hallelujah amen glory the message getting the people ready it's lamp trimming time hallelujah it's Malachi 4 time hallelujah amen he didn't share that because he ran out of time but he did share this uh instead of no he didn't share that instead of Michelangelo he called it Nicki Angelo's Masterpiece we're molded in him from the big inning big big beginning so the he didn't get to any he he stopped right there because he was pressed out he didn't get to any of those stories but that's what he wanted to share now he says on tape I had eight or 10 more pages so we only have five and I like somebody answer me in the brandom family can I get those other eight pages what do I got to do press play and Obey I won't do it I'm sorry I'm not doing that I'll do things but I won't do that I'll call your brother I'll donate to your church but I won't do that okay all right did I miss yeah I miss okay now I'm gonna close with this because I it was just timely it was just timely now this is totally off the Rapture okay but this is on uh the people that say a brother was emailing me and uh we found some good quotes together this morning and so I just brought I just brought this up because uh the brandom worshippers bring this fear TCT tactic and they say how dare you correct brother brandom now let me give you those examples here where is oh where did I do oh here's the examples even from this sermon there's there's there's three or four examples but these are the easiest one to see Enoch was the seventh from Noah anyone that reads their Bible knows that Noah wasn't born till 70 years after Enoch was raptured Noah was a descendant of Enoch not the other way around oh who are you to correct a prophet of God I'll show you what I'm what the prophet of God said about it brother Brandon prayed that the Holy Ghost would help us to see his mistakes so we could be correct he prayed so we'd see his Corrections Hallelujah and and what does that mean you and I are the answer to brother Ram's prayers Hallelujah I'm the answer you're the answer we're actually people that want the truth right we want the full truth of God we won't worship brother random but we'll pray and say God we know he's a prophet he's Vindicated we have confidence in him he's a human though and God show us the truth of all it which scriptures is he pointing to and we're the bride that wants all the word hallelujah am that's one of them so anyone that says every word is thus say the Lord is a liar they're Anointed with the Spirit of idolatry and a lying spirit and a spirit of Pride and how many other Spirits right because they got Pride they're taking their thoughts above the word of God hallelujah and then he says next the next Rapture takes place in second Thessalonians for the church now somebody open your Bible and show me the Rapture in 2 Thessalonians 4 there's only three chapters in 2 Thessalonians oh brother Ram knew there was a another extra chapter there that was secret or mystery no you're just a liar right you're just a lion idolator full of pride and arrogance and fear because you don't have a gift to rightly divide the word of truth hallelujah now those are some harsh words sister but that's the truth I'm saying that because you probably hearing them for the first time but I've said it before these people are just insane they're insane and and how do we know because they don't take the other quotes look at these other quotes how dare we not correct brother random since he prayed and asked God to correct his mistakes in our hearts after we listened to the tapes and I got quotes I wouldn't be preaching if I didn't have quotes Church you know me a little better than that don't you I wouldn't just be saying things for my own thoughts I mean I'll tell you if they're my thoughts this one's So Beautiful Lord Jesus he's praying forgive us of our ways that maybe we fail somewhere maybe to get the message just the way it should be but father I pray that where we have made a mistake so he he didn't say if we made a mistake he said we have made a mistake I pray where we've made a mistake that the great holy spirit will take the words wind them around and fix them into the hearts in the correct way that they might understand that it's preparation time now before the going of the way of the church Hallelujah and if you want even more I got a few more but I'm only going to show two tonight this one's says I mean if you can't see this one you're you're spiritually blind I pray tonight Lord somehow you'll build faith in these people's hearts that every one of them will be delivered all these sick and Afflicted people may be so simple Lord just let us as we try to teach your word let the Holy Spirit take my mistakes Lord huh I thought there's no mistakes on the tape Brother Joseph the tapes say there's mistakes on the tapes and correct them in the hearts of the people and the church saiden how dare you correct brother Ram brother Ram prayed the Holy Ghost would help us to correct it when there's mistakes like seventh from Enoch 7th from Noah and 2 Thessalonians 4 so what does this prove all these people are liars all these people have evil spirits on them all these people are immature babies now it's not to prop us up but it's to be a reality God help us to be true to the word of God and be a light to them which we tried to be make it real real ni that the that he can bed himself into the heart of each believer here we set this night for that purpose Lord May those who are not saved Above All Things be ready get ready now while the doors of Mercy still open we ask this in Jesus name and the church said let's stand ref Fe oh right at one hour Oh Glory I thought it was going to be less than an hour Malachi can come how many enjoyed that tonight amen I enjoyed uh getting it from the Lord I enjoyed the inspiration of the Holy Spirit I'm more convinced than ever that we're on the right path by the work of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah that's what I just find the more longer I serve God the more evidences the more signpost he gives me that I'm on the right path I'm on the right Road you know when I first started it said Rapture about 50 miles away Hallelujah Heaven about 50 miles away the next sign said Oh Heaven 30 miles away the next one oh 20 miles away pretty soon church is going to be half a mile away like on the highway half a mile to your exit quarter mile to your exit hallelujah amen everything is telling me we're on the right path we'll get there amen because he's the way the truth and the life Hallelujah we know our bridegroom we know who Christ is we know what his word says let's live like it how many you want to live like it by God's grace let's trim our lamps let's bow our heads here hallelujah let's be ready to meet him I probably got one or two more more sermons on this Rapture here we'll see by God's grace CU I think there's about 18 minutes left I haven't preached to you just wanted to hit the highlights I thought that'd be a help to you you all got a treat tonight to see the prophet's handwriting there by God's grace it's a real treat a real man of God a real prophet of God who saw visions and dreams and prophesied Supernatural signs wonders and miracles interpreting dreams finish the mystery of God a true man of God we honor him we don't worship him we honor him just like we honor John the Baptist Moses Elijah Hallelujah Jeremiah Isaiah all the saints but we have been visited

granted Lord God that each person will seek the baptism of the Holy Ghost to their so certain their soul is sealed until the day of redemption Hallelujah as we saw on Sunday that that everything from their heart is the love of God love love love love Hallelujah Lord we know sometimes love is corrective so Lord we know there's a balance on that I want to preach the balance of that maybe Sunday we love all those 16 attributes or let those attributes be in our heart that we believe all things that you speak we hope all things we rejoice in truth and we don't rejoice in iniquity we can suffer all things we can bear all things Hallelujah Grant it Lord God that the love of God will be in our souls Lord God and we'll be ready to meet you lord god father let's listen to brother Brandon more lord
