holdest fast my name and has not denied my faith even in those days wherein Antipas my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan allowed such as far as the word prayer need on your heart making known to God Heavenly Father or my hands up I need of you Lord God to speak tonight help me to get out of your way Lord for the preaching of the Cross Lord is foolishness to them who do not

prayers to your God somehow one way or another your honor sincere prayers you delight in the prayers of the upright you know you love that Lord we prayed sincere so we're looking forward to seeing what you're going to do give your praise daughter Lord Jesus Christ in every set even I would actually be in some crazy okay praise God look at think of everything around I hopefully I got juice right now I just as a reminder we do have that assignment he's gonna preach forth twice on Sundays I'm looking forward to that God has blessed his ministry more and more as he's becoming you know just like any gift I've been compared to like a child talking or you let the little baby talk better it's going to get talking all the time we'd only hinder that you know the hundred pieces of God we're looking for - I need to break I'm just tired worn out I try to preach almost every sermon just except for a couple since January January for every March April I did pretty good I feel like God's giving me strength to do that's what I did it by God's grace I really felt like I want to preach these church ages now I'll take a few Sunday break my brother Simon and their brother Brooks so really looking forward to that having these brothers in God's grace all right that's so I'm going to go right to the church age book here so I spend all my time this week I started Sunday night just really got home from church or from charts I took a shower I went downstairs just for a few minutes I started reading the rest of the chapters here this chapter is read at Monday Tuesday and finish the chapter today again by God's grace so the first section here is I know that works in verse 13 so we got a little scripture to read here up Friday to help reading Malachi can you read buddy Lydia Pingree anybody else want to read it but it's used with Malachi first John 3:7 Lydia James 3:11 but Adam yurid broken six to that okay anybody else to the replay okay sister bow so what you want to read up Matthew 12:33 so I got first John 3:7 Malachi Lydia James 3:11 that in Romans six - it's a stroke Matthew 12 rule program lists all these scriptures as soon as he quotes I know that works so God is telling these Pergamon pergamene church age believers I know your works how we know God is watching your works praise the Lord works don't save you but works prove you are safe that's right just one more proof that you're saying Amen along with of course having an experience like you know the book of Acts fruits of the spirit signing crimes of abominations all these scriptures that apply to our day this is another this is just another angle on you have to have the works of God much do the right works okay so now when we first job three seven little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous alright so by man says if you do righteous you are righteous right amen Lydia James 3:11 amends remember Christ is comparing your life to a fountain your fountains bring the two types of water no just one kind of water because all but whatever water is it just it combines into one right whether it's the salty or whether it's fresh it's the only one okay brother Adam how about Romans six you sir god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any learner they're in amen thank you we've seen that if you're righteous you live righteous you're a fountain you should bring for sweet water not bitter and then the Bible says if you're dead just sin I gonna live instead of sins dead to you how can you live in that it's dead alright such a boat Matthew 12:33 either make the tree good and has pretty good or else make the trooper out in his fruit grow the tree is known by his fruit David so program quotes these these wonderful scriptures praise God no doubt in verse 35 they said a good man the good treasure of a the heart bringeth forth good things an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things praise God so Graham makes this statement here you list all these scriptures it's just a beautiful just a beautiful combination of scriptures and all say if you're a child of God you'll have godly works you will live the right kind of life the RAM said if you are the word he said you will produce the word they met I'm going to read this quote I read a few weeks ago this is beautiful if a man fears that he might not please God let me stop right there anybody ever have that fear sometimes sometimes that comes over me and I please he got enough well dad tell us what to do if we have a fear if you wonder if I'm pleasing God Gomez's then let him fulfill the word so if you're scared am i doing God's will or not he said then act on the word do what the word says if a man wonders if he will hear those words well done good and faithful servant let him fulfill the Word of God in his life and surely he will hear those words of praise I simply Mason I don't want to hear the words put all down to the papal sudden the road Addison look at your life look at the word for your life as a man or woman whatever you are and fulfill that work do that word he says and surely you'll hear those words up praise program calls that phrase God is praising you I know you're worse I know how you're laboring for Christ Christ is praising you amen then real random quotes you know James chapter one if a man wants to know how he is making out let him do as change suggestion look into the mirror of God's Word hallelujah look into the mirror loo and see if you cannot if your reflection matches the word Amen you like the word is this what your life looks like amen all right that's a first highlight guard kind of highlight that put some stars under that I know it's a bridge like whatever the Holy Spirit struck my heart said all my I want to preach that I'm gonna turn the page all right now the holdest fast my day now yeah verse 13 and the holdest fast my name said I didn't preach this yet here's the poem says about holding fast the name he quotes John 6 where it says Peter says to whom can we go now alone has the words of eternal life they held fast then they were holding fast now but not with fatalistic dread as men who lived out barren lives they were holding fast in his strength in the assurance of the Spirit they were one with this theirs was a certian knowledge of sins forgiven and they bore the name of Christian in testimony to it they knew and loved that name that was above every day their knees bow to that date amen their tongues had confessed it whatsoever they did they did it all the name of the Lord Jesus they had named that name and departed from evil and having taken understand they were now prepared to die that for that name being assured of a better resurrection praise God so see their voting fasting the name in the example there are numerous examples but the money game is Peter remember that case there he said Jesus said you must drink of my blood and eat of my flesh and every all the seventy preachers left but he said you want to go to and the disciples said where are we going to go in other words were holding fast to the name of Christ that's what we say today we're holding fast to the name of Christ amen that's what we're gonna mentions their great he said hold fast to the literal name not the titles father son Holy Ghost that's what the next two paragraphs about but we know that all right now now rest is not denied my faith I get ready to turn to acts 3:16 let's go x3 16 x3 16 this is a Horton scripture and just the way he brings it out was just so powerful x3 16 you see where Peter you know program said he saw a vision of this going to be made well and that's why you said such as I have give I believe eyes and walk in the name of Jesus Christ when he poor it points out the red points out verse 16 because jesus said thou has not denied my faith he said you held to my name and you've not denied my faith the program brings a striking thought out of this year 3 first 16 months we together ready one two three and his name through faith in his name have been ages and man strong whom you see and know yay the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all mmmm says see there it is Jesus's name and Jesus's faith brought about the miracle like that it was a Peters neighbor Peters faith it was Jesus's name and Jesus's faith but that faith was in theater hey you then other than a beautiful highlighted words on that page in the three stars I know that's gonna need to preach right there Peter did not claim it was his own human faith anymore that he claimed it was his own name he said it was Jesus's name used in the faith which is from Jesus that performed the great work and then so what does that tell us we need to say God give you your faith to speak something in your name praise God that's what we need we need God's a God we need to see God say Lord reveal something to me that's why our maps are the most important thing to pray for is love guru remembers revelation revelation of the will of God that when you got a revelation you know God's will for something that you can speak God's will in the name of Jesus Christ with the faith of Jesus Christ and no matter what any delusion any neighbor it's going to come to pass if you see it in Jesus name with Jesus's faith because jesus paid Kenneth Bailey met that's a beautiful scripture his they through faith in his name had made the man strong the faith which is by him where'd you get your faith to come to church nah I got from Christ right have given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all so it's always the faith given from God that overcomes the gates of hell praise God all right holding fast his name that's the one major Orson he brings out here okay let's read a few more see this actually about four scriptures in here okay go to Romans 12:3 actually now I didn't get Romans 12:3 and then Lenny did you get fees ins to eight garden but Adam can you get James to 113 maybe say three more scriptures here to build this doctrine I love what the Bible says line upon line precept upon precept that's exactly what program that's exactly what the church age book is it's a thought and then all the precepts building it up okay so back I Romans 12:3 sir right say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith amen measure means a portion right so I suffered tonight or breakfast this morning you had a portion of the eggs or you had a portion of the steak we ran a portion of the salad right that's what the Bible said here you have a portion of faith from God you don't have all faith like Jesus head right but you have a portion praise God every man's got it some Paul says everybody that's at the Roman Church has a measure of faith everybody that accurate it's not a measure of faith and Jesus says I'll think about how big your measures Jesus said if it's the size of a mustard seed to move mountain but education did you ask the other day honey mind that bag of the mustard seed just daddy why you got this bag of mustard seeds I said it reminds me just one of those little CDs is all I need that's all the faith I need to move a mountain now I already believe they got the faith of Christ amen you got that much faith absolutely just looking for the timing of God to use it amen use it against sickness I was listening just a brother yesterday brother I'm saying he said Satan keep giving me a cold and I keep giving it back he said he keeps giving it to me I keep giving it back to him so he's got faith to say I'm not keeping this cold it keeps coming back but I've got faith and on one day Satan just going to keep that cold whether it's through divine healing or medicine or death ready for separation and the press you got one day faith will overcome that devil amen and all you need is a little bit of faith I like that church imagine everybody's got a little portion everybody that's a believer has a little bit of portion of faith we've all got it we all say God now use it helped me to use it let me have your faith with that amazing yours now let me speak something in your name your glory help me to know your will for the situation now that's getting up to real spirituality right there that's our mature Christian when you can speak something in the name of the lower and you know what's going to happen is you just prophesied aim ahead because the spirit of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy the faith of Jesus speaks the word of Jesus its prophesy that's a real spiritual Christian amateurish okay would I say that's Lidia Ephesians 2:8 is all I said Thank You KC where'd you get that faith did you work it up did you pump yourself up to get the faith no the Bible says faith which is of God so you have a measure given to you from God now your faith your eyes if you hear because faith cometh by hearing the Word of God that's why come to church is such a great thing to do if not layout Church throw few services once you betta watch your love for your brother or sister what you love you go to the your enemies watch it then see it when you hear the word of God and races your faith in it you're ready to challenge the devil when you got the right portion of faith when your faith is raised from here the Word of God James - would give it out of you James - unser my brother in the head not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ the Lord of glory with respect of persons yes over here see brother man said look he said have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ he didn't say faith in he says the fate of that's what our points out it is Jesus its own faith so what led you to be baptized in Jesus Christ in Jesus is faith what leads to believe that you're saved I thought the Holy Ghost when the rapture it's Jesus's faith Hey not behind it Jesus faith of my possessor of it yes I'm holding that faith I do have that faith I possess that faith but it's actually his faith thing that it's his assurance praise God it's his promise it's going to be backed up alright now that's a four in part brother have more highlights and I highlighted that do that was important part there that's a crucial doctor just understand that's why that's why we can't be discouraged like that's why I gotta watch myself with my wife noses I gotta watch myself if I don't see enough miracles by the time I get discouraged I thought it must be my fate my fate can't do anything Church ain't even my faith it's his statement and he's the one that's got to use his faith in me praise the Lord and I just got to get to the spot where I muted enough and then God can use people as glory not to be the scourge but be encouraged when God wants to do something nobody's going to stop I'm not gonna stop but churches were so yield to God those think God's going to use this when he's good and ready service after service year after year month after month we just keep coming faithful to the house of God homes that God's going to use this one day absolutely praise God at some point he's going to use us even more horse glory I believe that must stay committed must stay faithful now I'm going to go to start now Antipas mother Adam said there's no history record of him but there he said the only one that counts is that Jesus recorded his name and the Word of God that's only history that counts is revelation to that Antipas is in here now it says this let me have said Antipas he died but like Abel's and I takes it back to Abel ball for what Marvin both were killed for the faith like Abel and the purpose obtaining a witness from God which was his name written in the word and though dead his voice still speaks in the pages of God's divine record and then remember one of the voice of Abel cry out for vengeance right cut out for many where's my brother you don't hey dobe can't go the Bible says that the blood of Jesus Christ speaks better things in Abel what does the blood speak for you and I forgiveness raised God says forgive him forgive her forgive them Abel's blood cut out for open gence avenge me on am Kane's murder men's feet but the blood of Jesus Christ cries out for mercy have mercy forgive them father not to forgive them they don't know what they do and here and offenses voices crying out be faithful to my name hold on till death amen I do hold on to my name I know your works be faithful to Christ amen that voice is crying out even now the Prophet says it's crying out through the written word hey now Satan seat I hid that pretty good on Sunday did y'all catch that it was the physical sexual headquarters of Satan it started in Babylon the actual city of Babylon in Iraq I think I got my geography right and then it moved when a Dallas was a Babylonian ruler when they got overtaken by the Medes and Persians he moved all their Babylon religion up north to Parga most in Turkey hey that was sane see Sagan's he actually moved location and then run answer then stop in Pergamos in north would be Northwest to Rome I think I got my geographer you guys don't have to teach at first grate it so I kind of lose that you know I just got a teach like oceans continents individual counties in their countries and things like that it moved from Babylon Iraq Turkey and then to Rome you see that and that's a program goes through here now if you have time you want to redo that purchase out is you should make time at some point to redo this it's a detailed description of where Babylon came from honey does anybody remember which Bible character come from anybody remember it was cush cush the son of ham who was the son of Noah Babylonian worship came from ham I mean through his descended now it went ham cush Nimrod and Nimrod built the tower Babel so Babylon so in other words the Roman Catholic Church came from cush who did the son of ham baby then but a NASA program takes about four pages and shows you in the Bible where it came from which is pretty powerful now and it was cush who introduced the multiplicity of gods in other words more than one God so where the Trinity came from it actually came from cush he's the first one that started introducing more than one God which is pretty astounding now okay there's that okay now I want to uh that's all there if you want to read that it's on page 186 to 188 now it goes in the denunciation so let's go to revelation 214 let's go back to this I just want to bring this out because it blast you I've preached a series on this I just want to bring this out just for men here relation to 14 where did that I'm sorry okay I think I got yeah let's look at verse 14 because what I've done is I've I've looked at verse 14 I'm going to just read this the street 14 but I have a few things against thee because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam who taught failing to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication okay so here in this one we see the doctor to Balaam verse 15 so has thou also them which hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans which thing I hate now that's where I want to get to that's what I was on I was like where's that scripture I know that scriptures in here and there it is in verse 15 so forgive me that's what I was looking for hatred his brother has spends the next pages right about how Jesus hates things what's the first thing that we see that he hates the doctrine of balaam and the doctrine it belated I'm just going to hit a few more things on X I want to be mindful the time here by God's grace as I spend a little bit of time on that now over the years I preached numerous times on on Balaam and I think you all understand that I just want to make sure I remind you that last row preaches series on how what God loves and what God hates I was born while I think I caught a Christ the lights as brethren I preach a little series on that lid you remember okay good thank you I don't there's a lot of service but ii mean i you know as I've studied I go back and think about them okay I did preach that's right again uh but in that series I showed what Christ loves and what Christ hates and one thing for sure that Christ AIDS is these false doctrines what does he love he loves to be worshiped he loves faithful prayers they had even loved us before we loved him any better so he loves all these things and that whole series went through all the things that he loves he said if you love me keep my commands okay so that kind of refreshes our memories I'm sure but here is what it's about what he hates we know what he loves here's what he hates so what we are spending sparked showing what he hates and of course it's this false religion now let me look at the pages here okay now here's Wade us he shows the history of where actually the Church of Rome started actually writing there in Rome so after the Pergamos after Pergamos you know Rome Babylon moved to Rome and there was a Church of Rome there okay and my dad says how the First Church of Rome back slid and then some real Christians came in there's a lot of history there many ways that first church in actual actual Rome turned in eventually to the Roman Catholic Church okay that's what he spent the next looks like four pages five pages off now I want you read I want to read this focus I got this one highlighted here to mother Madison there was at least two or three churches in Rome the first church was the pagan Church that back slid and brother had said here's what the true church is I want you to catch this the true church that was in Rome like it was called the second Church of Rome kept trying to get the first church to repent how do they do the praise guy so even though the first church vaccin what is the true church what is the true church what do we knows what are we always going to be trying to do we're going to try to get our church friends to repent amen is that simple Church we can't force them to repent but it should always be our desire to try to get them to ring it what was John the Baptist to it he was trying to get air to repent of his sins even though they wouldn't he still tried to church that's my desire even though even if my friends well I've got to try to get them to an end that's my invited to church as a by a vital to watch the videos I don't know you don't pray with them like I'm guy witnesses spent at school I said I want to meet with you I want to talk about your soul he's like well I will some time and now I said I'm not you know he's not going to be with me but what am i trying to try to get to his soul I'm trying to give to repent and get saved you see we must do that because that's what the true church is trying to do is try to get the false churches to become true churches amen after that event goes throughout the persecution started in Rome the false church the First Church of Rome try to persecute the second Church of Rome by the Randstad that's how it always is the false church always persecutes the true church now the next page the next page he talks about how and what I'm this little bit on Sunday how eventually Constantine marry the false church and state together and it's in a true church Constantine married the false church the Church of Rome with the state ok the government's the government and the church United then brother man talks about that how that was when it gotten married that's when the church and state married and then I'd already spent a lot of time with this then program goes through Daniel chapter 2 the image of the man never he's got the four parts the head go let him go remember the silver arms and chest the loins and thighs of brass and the legs of iron and then the feet of iron and clay he goes through that shows how Rome was the the legs and the feet okay goes through that and I've already pre stepped quite thoroughly you've heard that I'm sure numerous times okay now the next thing he hits is the feet of that that image the feet of the image I don't know if I got a picture that real quick or not I'm not sure I probably that if I take too long now the feet of the image member is iron and clay who remembers what the clay is anybody remember lady come Protestants glory amen I'm Olivia's Lydia bless your heart garden hey iron is the spirit of Rome or the Roman got the church the clay is Protestants the program says it again right here it's on page 195 if you want to look it up there I encourage you to do that he said but that's how Rome is controlling the world today is controlling through papal pagan Rome right or the holy unholy Roman Empire that's how they're controlling for example Road and I heard what I understand something tape yesterday he said Eisenhower doubt he was the president I saw I was a pretty big net in America he said with overseas and I already nothing he said he said but the boat is a big man in every country headed better right and I strike you to see a prophet say that he said that's because that's because look the iron crushes every nation the Pope has influence in every nation is a great person every nation are no Trump so they did he gets booted every nation I think pretty much even in our nation he gets moved I voted all the Liberals I'll go if he does he evil things I was looking too excited vote Parker but I'll give you just some good I like the muhammed anything goodman he'd do anything good really i could see not very much at least notice how to say but see this is how the iron will crush every nation because everybody loves hope that now if he's that liberal what's the next guy going to be if god Terri's they just keep getting more and more more liberal in other words all we're all saved come back to the mother right daughter's come back to mama that's what they keep doing and program goes through that and this chapter he goes through that again to show you he said papal fox christian roams with roman catholic church now controls by religion even more aptly than when pegida bare room controlled by the pure iron of force see that so what does mother am showing religion is more powerful than government right the root of the power of religion the influence of the roman catholic church is more powerful than just military power that's a program shown here it is it's more powerful he said the spear that motivated pagan rome is the same spirit that now motivates false Christian rome remember what they did they tried to rule everybody didn't they is that what it really rome did never they said all roads lead to Rome remember that and the history my brother in history books more history that's why that's what the Roman Catholic Church all churches are not supposed to go to Rome that's what they're teaching them right we're all saving everybody save every save my grades were all in the flame family we should all unite I've heard the Pope say things like that now the next page they show how st. Augustine of Hippo gave permission to the bishops and Pope's to start persecuting people that wouldn't come to the Roman Catholic Church and that was in 354 to 430 so it's on page 195 if you're interested to read that but I've been through that I think I just preaches a few weeks ago all right okay and then this is interesting to remember this do you ever Julius Caesar called himself Pontius Maximus remember that remember that now got you didn't do the Caesar book a few months ago remember that he called himself Pontus or paja maximus brother branham founded history and showed that the next one after him let's see what his name was maximus the third refused to be called that because it was just too exhausting of a title as a title it exalts the ruler but then the history said without a history from a man named Stephens and it said when the leader Maximus the third denied that title the Pope picked it up and none of the Pope is called the pontiff of Rome how do you know that he's the pontiff or the head or leader of Rome the god of Rome that's what he is and that striking Julius Caesar is off himself as a god the next man saw her more humble you wouldn't take that with the Pope willingly takes on that role I'm the pontiff on the head I'm the gospel and he still called the pontiff that's exactly right my dad sees rodents at sea yes positive Maximus is still with us today who is he the Pope of Rome right now next is a doctor Nicolaitans the thing that he hates now remember what does Nick elated mean to conquer who the laity to conquer the lay of T so program spends the next pages 1 2 3 4 5 the next 5 pages showing how the preachers are not any holier than the congregation I said good amen on this amen creatures are not any more holy than the laity everybody everybody who is bought by the blood of Christ are all the same for the eyes of God there's not a Jew or Greek there's not male or female there's not bother free we're all one in Christ Jesus if we're watching the blood I'm not saying like if a sinner walks in somebody's done an adultery yes we're more holier than that you understand like they're living consider I'm talking about people that artists the right relationship with God they're all the same God just for dogs is where a preacher has to stand here and preach but I know more holier brother brookster brother cragger recited we're no more holy than anybody else if we're all washed in the blood but that's what Jesus hates Jesus hates a doctrine that conquers the lady it puts all the holiness in the priesthood and no holiness in the church that's the Nicolaitans option it conquers the lagi oh you've all got to follow the preachers and the preachers are more holier than you and and you should just be thankful for the preachers no we all need Christ you all need the blood of Jesus yes you should listen to the preachers if they're living the Word of God yes you should respect them but the preacher should respect you as well but that's what the nickel day and doctrine does it separates us in two groups we're more holy than you and if wasn't for us you could hear from God no you can go home to get a revelation right you can come here you can come here oldest undergrad with a thus saith the Lord and it can be just as powerful as anything that would be preached on Sunday praise God because why is God using his body everybody's got a measure of Fame everybody get out of the faith of Jesus everybody can speak the name of Jesus amen it don't have to be just preachers but that's what the Roman Catholic Church does they make the priests more holy don't they they make that more holy and that's what actually most every denomination and the daughters the Protestants the clay they do the same thing many of them most of them they make the preachers more holy than the congregation we cannot allow that here we've got to let everybody uh have respect and everybody's got to have a right walk with the Lord let me say like that everybody has to be spear that programs that spear filled and word living how do you want to be that man but I said everybody should be that led by the spirit he said the nickel laden separates the ministers and makes them overlords instead of servants you see that I don't want to ever be an overlord I would be a servant to you if I can help you send me text call me email me you know talk to me other service if I could be help to you then God help me to be a servant to you amen it's not an overlord like yous Isham you do that you just happen now if you got a message the Lord Yeti you do that you'll believe that but if the word says something do what the word says but you don't do it without the word of the Lord aim ahead so I want you to catch have you ever seen the Overlord he come come to me about it because I want to be the letter the Holy Spirit I want to be a human Overlord just with my thinking well I think this will be good I want to feel that the dish on it like recently I felt led to ask a certain person step down from a certain position I just kind of led to do that and I know it was the right leading because by the fruits works are known you understand what I'm saying by someone's actions it declares if that's the right decision or not jesus said that jesus says wisdom is justified in your children other words wisdom is justified by the actions that are produced after a decision is made so if somebody makes a right decision then the fruits will show that was right decision for example of God leads you to this church the effects of that will grow in Christ Jesus right or another example you've got need you to take a job then that job will be a blessing to you right the fruits of that the actions that take place after decision prove that you've made the right decision see that's what we must do in our lives we must make sure we're spirit leg look at that what's the results my decision what was the result of my decision here then you can tell that was a leading of the Lord or not amen so brother Branham said what they started doing first they got rid of the Holy Ghost and then they started giving men titles he said like bishop Cardinal elder Oh all these titles I just want to be called your brother hey you see it's just be my brother you should just be my sister to the Lord we shouldn't exalt anybody give you a special title okay I said that's the trouble they started giving titles we might have said the spirit of Rome divides and then conquers you see what the Antichrist fear once they do to our church he wants to divide our church and then conquer us so we don't let the Holy Spirit move in you see that divide what's afoot preachers against the people or maybe this family against that family it's kinda nice to divide the church but we understand what whatever stand with you not even love you're not loving even anyone who speaks is he to get you loving anyone who's upset with you loving them love will cover a multitude a city Rome is divided Concord nickel Laden is divided the people conquer the people the spirit of Rome is divide and conquer that's how Rome became a great nation they go into the next nation and divide it and conquer it and that's what Satan does today but Christ counters with love amen so we'll see that God will help our church be united through loving one another amen devoted answer they first rejected the Holy Ghost then they started taking titles and then they started choosing the most educated preachers the mother richest preachers and the most political preachers oh that was how they voted who had the most money with the most education and who was the best politician to please everybody but see preachers shouldn't try to please anybody but Christ amen in other words preach the word if the rich people want to go or whoever wants to go let him go just preach the word then I thought about this all the way over yo two years ago in 2015 we had about three or four families move in and it was my desire to unify the church so what I turned down some invitations for each other other places I just wanted to preach here preacher preach here and after two years like on Sunday most of those families have left and that's okay that's okay now one of them is that okay because one of them left the message and I told them not to but they did anyway but I just want you to see that my heart was to unite everybody when some people have different doctrines maybe some people get worldly maybe some people do need the message but the people that have stayed have seen that we're trying to unite under the Word of God and you see that by God's grace can you see that sister come over China know you've been here this whole time they were you don't California you watch the whole thing since when a man came into 2014 you a man came in I haven't changed my preaching I try to stay with all the message stay with all this but people come to people to know but we must remain united with those who stayed we must remain united on the truth that people want to lead let them go they're free to go we wouldn't want to force anybody to stay we want people to come here who love the Holy Ghost amen who knows the ownership who knows the Spirit of God who want to see more of God their lives data that's going to be uniting of the church amen God knows our labor God hates dividing in Congress I hate to see people leave I hate to see of young people conquered and divided by st. but we're trying to unite around the love of Jesus Christ and that love is shown through obedience through sport that's exactly right I try to stand there's a pastor and Holden and if somebody don't agree with me fighting that's fine go to church but go to a church that loves the Lord serve God love God with all your heart I know I'm not had them the best preacher for everybody I understand that I understand that I'm the lowest of the lows of the preaching of the least of the least that's fine with me I just want to be pleasing to God I just want to hear him say well duh here and I do that who I do that I'm just pretty sort of guy man every every preacher has a different gift for every uh every one that God's called them to every sheet that's supposed to give that Shepherd God has a special gift for that preacher to meet the needs of those sheep and it's not there's nothing good with a shepherd and he just a shepherd he's just a human it's Christ in it's Christ as a shepherd its Christ in the Sheep not dividing a concrete but united by the word God hates the division and conquering amongst people God loves unity so what's going on I thought about that later I wanted to make sure I should say that though people come and go all of you that are here still know we're preaching the same message just more of it that's the only thing that's changed we fall more in love than any event that's always gonna change by God's grace just trying to stay more true to the Word of God go to love the Lord man hey that's my heart's desire God knows my heart just want to be faithful to Lord Jesus now what was amazing to me remember a few weeks ago when I preached in Ezekiel you rented out a few weeks ago right before Easter remember when I went to Ezekiel and I showed you the Tammis in Ezekiel brother Branham Redknapp writer wrote about that right in the church age book and I was so rejoicing I just preached about it before Easter Tammuz in this part of the book he said damn us was romps our point of the wrong scripture for Oh in Ezekiel 8 number one is eqo went into the temple and they saw abominable things all over the walls remember that a few weeks ago brother Branham quotes that he said that's exactly what the Church of Pergamos was the false church and that's exactly what the Roman Catholic Church's three Sundays ago I appreciate right before Easter his he feels brought to the house of God remember that and he sees remember there was four steps to the evilness remember there's four abominable steps remember that some of you remember that and run out of gloaty here and I've forgotten all about it so those who showed that the Roman Catholic Church and their daughters the Bible said they're filled with unclean and hateful spirits can you see that not to be me but to be honest if they don't preach the truth they're filled with unclean spirits in other words there's abominations all over the walls like we said right there's abominations behind the pulpit there's abominations of the congregation letting homosexuals and transgenders lead the church and and for many people to marry the Overson fornication and adultery and all these things what is it it's abomination so the church is filled with all these sins are filled with unclean and hateful spirits can every see that a program brings that up in this chapter that's what the Church of Pergamos was the false church and that church of course spread to Rome and now rolled the Roman Catholic Church and all the denominations are filled with unclean spirits did everybody see that so we better have a church filled with the holy scheme and let them sit let them get bigger let them get bigger buildings and bigger ministries and rock and roll services nothing let them have that just let these walls speak an echo and whisper of the name of Jesus and the holiness of my name let these walls whisper holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty a day let them have that let me fill with unclean birds we want to be filled with the clean Gaia the Dove of God the Holy Ghost exactly right God hates the vision God loves purity all right the next page goes the doctrine of balaam tells about five pages there on your own time so my timer for 10 more minutes try to do about an hour I think maokai told no takes--it daddy did pretty good go with reach 45 minutes on Sunday night thank you sir thank you trying to preserve my strength here that that service also tonight impacted me the rest of the week it really did it's shorter services no matter how long this matters how much godson how much our hearts are willing to enter the gasps amen it was on the power of a prayer life if you like to listen to him even got a good evening about that and it was really blessed by that as well I thank the Lord for that now the doctrine of balaam I got a little bit more to go some more pages we went we went over that pretty good okay how he sucked had a worship that was close to his remember he had seven altars and Israel you know had seven red arrows random Sliema seven Rams and the feasts of Israel anyways they both had sevens in their worship and he was the Balaam was impersonating and copying God's worship the program said that's how Balaam got the anointing on him because he knew the way to approach God you approached out through sevens and then that's exactly how he said Balaam we got the the worship in other words he knew the approach to get the anointing what's the pro she gets anointed humble yourself right cry out for aid and God will send rain right that's the way to get the anointing on you worship God remember that with the live show Jehoshaphat and a have a half son went Elijah and said prophesy and he said bring me a minstrel they started playing the music and the Holy Spirit fell how do these people get the Holy Ghost on them even though they're tears they worship God with all the ghosts on you now Holy Ghost on me let's worship God amen yeah that's the approach unto God but let's make sure we take that anointing home with us man he then and then we're all by ourselves in our in our bedroom and we're all by ourselves the kitchen table let that same anointing let's let's have that same anointing praising God all day long amen and bring that real life to church the next time we have trip hey Dad let's live a life of integrity I spent the next one two three four five six seven seven pages going over the doctrine of balaam we pretty much went through the line program said the doctrine of Balaam is this he said you know God's will would you take out from and then Balaam for money's sake for money's sake he taught Israel to CID right taught them to commit fornication he taught them to have a false unity over all the same we all love Jesus we all worship the same God right and they all gather them as Israelites left their camp left their church and went to a false gathering and committed fornication and died God judges it so that's the doctrine of balaam again taking the permissive will of God knowing God's will doing the permissive will still with the anointing but eventually teaching others to sin that's the doctrine of balaam you get that all through this he just lays it out off you the whole thing okay now let's go to Revelation 2:16 I'm gonna try to close out I might have one more service we'll see I didn't get as far as I thought over well I think I can understand it look at revelation 260 mark 2:16 repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against the fire fight against them with the sword of my mouth forgetting now the point about I makes the book here can God overlook the sin of those who have borne his name in vain other words is God going to look over look somebody's sin who serve him in vain worship no but man said God is going to judge those people who worship Him in vain he says there's only one way to receive grace and that's the repent and then honey one grace amen then we need to repent hey keep repenting that's what I mean we've already done that let's keep repent amen but when I said this this is our wolf those who fought the word who fight the message will one day find the word fighting again is that what Jesus said he said repent or else I'll come and fight against you so listen to me if we fight against the message the is unified against UPS right if we fight against the words and we don't have to live that or I don't want to live that if you fight against the word the words going to come fight against you you know where it's going to fight against you it's going to fight against you in your life towards it in your life because people can run people can run from God for a while but it always catch them at the end of their life right it called call Michael Jackson and caught prints I just read the article about Prince he died the same way those other guys died he had 16 uh drugs in his house that weren't even prescriptions for him the same thing Elvis did the same thing Michael Jackson did taking drugs the water drugs remember where drugs are witchcraft remember that that's in the scripture of those who do witchcraft will not inherit the kingdom of God and all three of those men died on drugs see that see they can't have any real peace from the Holy Ghost so they got to go to drugs but we get a real peace every time we cover the house you got it every time you pray your prayer closet every time you confess your sin what do you get it you're getting peace out so see you're fighting for the word so the words going to fight with you amen glory the word is fighting against them but the word is fighting with us say that if you don't take the word if you fight against the word the word I'll come fight against you how about you I want the word to fight for me because I know I can't defeat the word I never would want you the word I want to were to slay my sin and take away all my sins and the lust and everything like that and then the word will fight for me a hot idiom thank you Jesus now the reward now I hope you enjoyed that on Sunday I don't think I've had enough time to preach it but I sure enjoyed preach on those rewards they hidden manna and the white stuff now I want to just let's close vex I got into five minutes yeah yeah I got three minutes with the clock up there since I said I'm gonna take five okay the reward now in the church age book brother random goes through the reward of of the the hidden manna now on Sunday I showed you how brother I've said it was the shewbread now there's two kinds of Reds did you catch that I only studied the serving part the servant part except the shewbread the shewbread was it in the holy place remember that it's on a table and there was 12 loads of them that was hidden man said that hidden manna was he said was the shewbread now that's true it was only for the priests right and when they would come in to do the service they'd light the lamps they'd offer the incense they wouldn't eat that bread and that was that was the hidden shewbread this is hidden with the congregation they had a special bread then a special word just for them but now in the church age book brother Ram takes us to Hebrews 9 for let's go to Hebrews 9 for now I could read up for me sir Hebrews ninety-fourth the country Bibles whenever you're ready would and I mention this on Sunday I kind of felt silly at the end because I I didn't teach honor but I couldn't help it because I studied was the servant not the book but now I study the book again so hearty ready hey go ahead which had the golden censer and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid roundabout with gold wherein was the golden pot the head man up and Aaron's rod that budded and the tables of the covenant he meant I'd hear that this lists everything that was in the Ark of the Covenant had the tables of stone the rod of Aaron was the third thing man now and the sermon program said the hidden manna was the shewbread in the church age book he said it's the manna in the Ark of the Covenant so either one will work but the actual manna was the one the Ark of the Covenant and here's what he says but the ark was naked but the sum of the original manna in it he said it was angel food member rain down from heaven so they could have these little pellets an angel booted and honey he said they never got sick all these little pellets he thought now he said they kept some of the Ark of the Covenant so in every generation all the priests that would come to the Ark of the Covenant could eat some of that hidden manna so the program says is for us he said God gives his hidden manna to the overcomer Aaron the high priest had to overcome in order to get the Holies of Holies what do you what he had to overcome to church all the sins of his self and the people right on the day of atonement that's the only day in the year that he could go to awesome Holies how do you know that how did you overcome to get in there he overcame by the blood are you with me he overcame by the blood that's how it overcome and so he would overcome you put the blood of the outer court inner court and then bring the blood of the holiest of Holies and program said in every generation so the man after Aaron and the manager that each one could take a little bit of that mana and eat that hidden revelation they could have a taste of the original food and program says that's the believer today eating the original truth from Pentecost a an area so when we read the book of Acts and we live and enjoy that original treatment we act like the book of Acts we are feasting on it advant is and that's a reward for the overcomer of that day but also for this statement is not so it works fold it works both in the holy place and it works off so the voice of Holies it's even better than always always because that represents the fact system of the justification outer court sanctification holy place baptism of the Holy Ghost all these diplomas thank you Jesus amen glory that's what he said I did and some page of 211 is what we're eating he said they received the original truth of Pentecost that's right he said it was in the the pints of manna that were in the golden vessel behind the veil in the holiest of Holies praise God now brother Branham says there's also a future partaking of this manner okay so let me say like this there's manna we partake of today it is the truth with Pentecost my brother has said God has that will be a reward for us in the future okay so you have mana today but you also have future mana that Christ is going to give us in the Millennium at the New Jerusalem oh I love you hey man my makes his tired body all feel energetic for a little while amen the anointing of the Lord amen here's we said the future partaking of the hidden manna will be the eternal partaking of the revelation of Jesus Christ in eternal ages to come how else can we begin to know the unsearchable riches of his own being all that we have longed to notice is all our unanswered questions anybody got any other answer your questions I have a lot of unanswered questions why is this versus that what happened to this person why this doesn't happen more life you allow this I have a lot of questions unanswered but never said when Christ shows us all of our questions throughout eternity that will be the hidden man up for the future amen hallelujah thank you Jesus he'll anthill dissolve every doubt just like is that about Daniel you know Christ will dissolve all of our doubts dissolve all of our questions and we will know even as he knows right he said all that will be remember jesus said it he says everything that's been hid about my doors he said will be shouted from the rooftops every said that every secret listen whispers everything that we may know right they don't know little warm-up now you can even compared to nesting level know about 911 what happened there right every everything unknown will be big know all these question about JFK who killed him you know those are just little things but you know though any question we had will be able to answer those are not the most important questions but Christ is here Christ will be there as a reward to answer any questions they met that's the future manner that will partake them now the white stuff I've already over a few minutes but I'll just take a few more like face the Whitestone motor have said there's a he said there's the remember the typewriter on Sunday Abram to Abraham Sarah - Sarah and he brother BAM said today each of us true believers has a change in name now so Sunday
