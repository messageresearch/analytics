real you know that you've been there you've you've met the burning bush you you've had the experience you've gone through the trials and he was with you and so it's not a hope so or maybe this is right you know it amen so I I love to be here it's an honor to be here this morning uh you can be seated a bit um so it's a real blessing to to be with you all and it's an honor and behalf of myself and my wife my two daughters and my son-in-law and uh for the saints that are connected I know that uh our little assembly many of them are connected by the YouTube link and greet you all this morning in Jesus name amen so uh looking forward to this day we've been looking forward to it for a while especially this afternoon service when he's speaking right amen Aaron has really become a a real minister of the gospel and I'm uh I'm proud of him you know to see how the Lord's been using him and he too has been through the ringer he's been through the mill and he's um but he's been to the burning bush that changes everything you know I was thinking that uh this weekend of course is a national holiday it's Memorial Day and in doing that we remember those that uh gave their lives to in service to the country and um when I was cutting the grass the other day around two days ago I was thinking about a man I never met U his name was Ralph Smith and uh he loved my mother uh this is before my father and mother got together and uh he did a real beautiful painting for her a watercolor of her a portrait of her and gave it to her well he uh was drafted or signed up I don't know World War II where they sent him overseas uh I believe the Germans and they got a hold of him and hung him by his feet till he died he gave his life for his country and uh all we have is a painting to remember I pray that a man was a Christian you know and U my dad when he fought Japanese in World War II on the other side he uh served in many many areas of battle as a combat engineer but he was on what's called The Landing ship tank it's a great big vessel that carries all the equipment and tanks and trucks and stuff and they got hit by a comicazi came down blew up went down hit the magazine and the whole thing blew up and he saw men go just crazy you know they didn't know what to do some of them just turned and ran into the fire and disappeared they gave their lives you know and um so it's a it is something to remember and but I'm also thinking of a greater Memorial Day I think of uh like you hear people talk about well my people this and my people that my people were saw aunder right my people were burned at the stake during the Dark Ages amen those are my people they're every color every race amen wherever the gospel has been preached men and women and children have died for this gospel and what a service it's going to be on that day when that trumpet sounds and they all come forward and uh we join them on that parade March to the sky oh my I get chills thinking about it because it's real this isn't a fable this is more real than the room we're sitting in you know so I thank God for his grace and uh I think of uh uh how that every one of the Apostles they gave their lives and and it wasn't like they just took a bullet and died they were the they died in the most horrible ways you know hung upside down hung sideways burnt and you know dismembered whatever and they did it with joy because they met the burning bush they met Christ you know there's um I Heard message a couple weeks back where brother Brandon was talking about this Infidel that was writing critical things about him and a man didn't believe in God and he said what kind of a God would it be that would during the Dark Ages would just sat and watch his disciples women you know what they went through and being the baby taken out and just horrible unspeakable things done to them and a God would sit there and just laugh and look at them it's because the man will never met the burning bush once you've met him see that's what proves that this gospel isn't real every single one of those disciples they went to the death with joy because it wasn't an intellectual concept it was a living being in here that energized their human Spirit their mind their body amen they were quickened by the Holy Ghost and it changed them into entirely made them different people so when Christ comes inside it it changes everything and I'm glad to be one of them today right we're one of them oh yeah one of them I'm so glad amen amen right brother we can say we're one of them so may this be a memorial day may it be a day we long remember um let's stand for a reading of one scripture please I want to turn to the Old Testament I want to turn to Jeremiah chapter 31 I'm going to finish this water pretty soon in Jeremiah 31 and I want to read verses 31 to 33 you can hear all right with this here I not used to these kind this is good especially if you're like brother Jesse you like to run all over the place you know amen behold the days come sayith the Lord that I will a future tense I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah thank you amen a new covenant not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day this is this is heartbreaking in the day that I I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt which Covenant my which my Covenant they break although I was in husband unto them sayeth the Lord isn't that heartbreaking and he goes on but this but this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days sayeth the Lord I will put my law in their inward parts and will write it in their hearts and they will and and will be their God and they shall be my people amen next verse and they shall teach no more uh every man his neighbor and every man is brother saying know the Lord for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the Lord for I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more oh praise God hallelujah it won't be a case where he makes a covenant with them and they break it where he's a husband and she's an Unfaithful wife but his law his word his love will be in her she has no other choice she will be led by that same one that wrote the law let's just talk to him for a minute blessed Lord Jesus we come to to you now in the wonderful all sufficient name of Jesus Christ we're so honored and blessed to be among these precious Believers here today Lord God what a wonderful congregation we're thankful for your servant brother Smith and his family Lord God for the invitation to to invite us to come here and to partake of this uh Priceless word of the Lord with people of like Precious faith the Lord May the holy spirit that wrote the word come and inhabit the word and make it real to me and to each person here today Lord have thine own way dear father Lord God and may if there's any in here that's not sure of where they stand today or they haven't yet received that wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost Lord may you may you hover over them may the the life of God the canopy of life and sh them and fill their inner being with the person of the Holy Ghost which is Jesus Christ Grant it father bless this day we pray in Jesus name amen amen amen you can be seated uh again I'm very thankful for your pastor we had a wonderful time when he came to our little assembly amen right amen and spoke for us and it it was tremendous uh and we both felt the same way all right we're kindred spirit Spirits you know I won't say it we're just Kindred Spirits so it's an honor to be here and we half went crazy when he was speaking in our church because he spoke about the life of Abraham there is no way that he knew that we had been going through the covenants of God and at that time we were talking about God's covenant with Abraham now how could he know that and he comes in and when he announces his subject I'm already done you know we're all looking at one another can you believe this you know what it's a holy spirit that's all you know you just trust him there's no you know big me big Minister you little no no no no no we're all the same in Christ right amen amen so we when you have a humble heart which if if you have the Holy Ghost he gives you a humble heart it's just that's one of the very first signs a person has received the Holy Spirit is humility you know you don't get some big idea about yourself you love one another preferring one another over yourself you know so that's the way I felt when he came so I said if if his congregation is like him we want to be there so amen so we're here uh in the name of the Lord so we had been at the uh Open Door Tabernacle we've been gloriously enjoying the uh eight covenants that God had made with his people there's seven of them in the Old Testament and there's one in the New Testament and in prayer meeting Wednesday night I was praying because I had it on my heart to come here today to speak about the Covenant that God made with Israel as they were about to go into the new land because the new new land Covenant pertains to us because Ephesians is in the New Testament as Joshua is in the Old Testament and there's a perfect blending there and then when you read the scriptures you realize oh my word this is my land in Ephesians and Colossians and all those things it's for us and we have to take that land with our sword and when the enemy comes we take the sword out and it's a daily fight amen yes sir yes sir but I've read the book I know who wins the war you know so you can fight with confidence right so that was on my heart to speak on but at prayer meeting Wednesday night it totally changed the Lord showed me no bring the New Covenant now I hadn't studied it yet I hadn't done anything about it and it's kind of jumping ahead out of order where we're at in in our church you you know so um I had been listening to the message I when I was working I I do U landscape design and construction and when I was out there working all week I was listening to the message um the unveiling of God and I just seen it just oh my talk about the O the open uh Covenant the the the New Covenant to us and how God unveils himself you know so we've been going through those um covenants and I just want to make a quick just a very quick review of them as we uh kind of set it up for the for the uh the New Covenant so the edenic Covenant that was the very first one of course that was in the Garden of Eden before sin before everything went sideways and God told Adam and Eve uh it's all yours they walked like uh uh if you will if you forgive the terminology like a God and a goddess on the earth they had everything everything was at their disposal they could speak and it would create like that you know uh whatever they said it happened because he was on the inside and they were fashioned to be he you imagine a direct Son of God you know how many thousands of generations are we past that he was a direct walked off the hand of God walking on the earth I bet he could tell us a thing or two about living one with God am but we know the story there had to be a fall yes sir there had to be so they're walking the Earth in this edenic Covenant and he said there just one thing don't add or take away from my word what I say I mean it so this tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil just stay away from it because the day that you eat thereof you're G to lose everything right isn't amazing that Satan is so slick that this first beautiful identic couple would fall for the lie of Satan how could you I can't even imagine it but that shows us in the last days how lick he is yes sir so don't take anything for great granted you you know we uh a good warrior has respect for their enemy they know his tactics they know he's uh very hard to beat you know in natural terms and so forth and the only way you can beat him is to know Satan at every one of his tricks you know this whole message comes to life when you start studying this stuff it's just beyond belief so anyhow so he said don't add don't take away from the word of course they did and uh Eve uh did her thing and and so everything fell apart and so God had to make another Covenant and he made the what we call the adamic Covenant in uh Genesis 3 and in that Covenant he promised a way of redemption that her seed would bruise his head and he would bruise your heel in that was a promise of redemption this is so phenomenal if you go to the third seal right um of the Seven Seals and I the newer ver uh book um it's uh of course I I'm still oldfashioned I read paper books you know I haven't graduated to all you young guys I I still do the E and everything um but it's uh page um 2115 to 234 where brother brandom in the third seal before he gets the actual seal he explains the adamic Covenant perfectly and you know what's so amazing is these covenants throughout the Bible brother Brenham never preached a series called the eight covenants right and if somebody's so ignorant that they think well he never preached them he sure did it's throughout the entire message you know did he tell us about Adam and Eve and what happened and and the promise of redemption there it is that's the adamic Covenant did he talk about Abraham in almost every message that's the abrahamic Covenant did he talk about Noah and as it was in the days of Noah Noah Noah Covenant Glory Glory I you know so it's all there but when you go to searching it out that way you begin to see this word crosssection one and another and it's just so exciting so in that third seal he says that God promised Eve that she would one day come back to the full word he promised her read it it it's on in the third seal what that mean she would finally come back to the full Dominion of Mark 11:23 this last day's Eve would come and it has can only be in the last days the first church had it yes they did first church had rapturing faith we know that and you know Philip was needed somewhere gone he was translated somewhere but the seed had to go in the ground and die just like Jesus did otherwise that would have been it they would have gone and it a story over but there were seeds yet in the earth that had to come forth in 2024 there were seeds yet to come forth praise God I'll never get to my topic here so amen the adamic Covenant promises that she'll come back Eve to Dominion on the earth like she did have and then of course the uh Covenant that God made with Noah after he uh flooded the Earth and of course the whole story of Noah is to us uh a sign of the last days his message his preaching for 120 years his building of the Ark all these things were types for us in the last days how he built the ark out of this U uh type of a wood that's like Balsam and then they took the rosin out of another which they had to beat the tree to get the rosin out and they pitched it which is the Holy Ghost am typing the Holy Spirit Spirit making that light pliable wood suddenly hard as steel but still light that could float through the storms oh man you know it it's so great so the whole story of Noah is for us in the last days and God tops it off with a covenant a rainbow Covenant which is half of what you see around the Throne of God because in the last days the half had not been told now the entire book is open glory amen praise God oh my so it's not going to be a flood anymore no more flood but next time it will be fire next time it's the baptism of fire as he does to the Earth so he does to the individual praise God that's the Noah Covenant God promised it with a sealed it with a rainbow glory to godj abrahamic Covenant God came down to Abraham and uh here's a famous quote from brother Jesse Smith I wrote it down when he was speaking he said the bride of Christ follows Abraham's life it's exactly right that's why we were jumping off our seats literally because we've been just going through Abraham's life and how that everything reel uhu uh Genesis 12 gen gen is uh 14 6 17 18 19 15 all these things the abrahamic Covenant and how that God had to come back and reiterate it and reiterate it and reiterate it and tell him it's going to happen so Lord amen Satan comes to your mind or you run up into problems just remember he what he promised he's going to do it's yours don't let any evil spirit talk you out out of it and God swore by himself God glory you see that that's for youlu my goodness he swore by himself that Abraham would have a son Isaac which is Jesus Christ amenah right the Royal Seed of Abraham and that that life of Abraham how God promised in his life we have the Salvation the sanctification you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've got the new name you've got adoption you've got the Resurrection The Rapture all these things are in Abraham's life praise God and He swore by himself it's going to happen sure it was for Abraham in the natural but in the end time these things become ours amen a real promises for a real bride and every Redemptive act that uh Abraham lived out it's to the believer in this last days amen every Redemptive promise then of course uh when Israel uh finally uh in fulfillment of part of the abrahamic Covenant God sends Moses and he Moses wouldn't go until he met God and he met God he went down and and he led them and this is this is just heartbreaking again like he remember how he mentioned in Jeremiah 20 31 whose Covenant they break I was a husband to them and so forth so the Mosaic Covenant he brings Israel out of Egypt with a mighty hand that we're still talking about today it was so tremendous right and did all these things 10 plagues on Egypt opens the Red Sea brings them through 3 days in Israel begin to complain and moan and cry right even in Egypt one time they wanted to pick up stones and kill Moses it's like what's wrong with you people you've seen all this and you still can't believe will you ever believe well we know that the long story is that they didn't they didn't go over but there was a new generation coming up they might not have been the ones that saw squirrels spoken into existence and all these things but they know it's real Hallelujah Glory a new generation rising up that knows God is real praise God oh my goodness and then when God came with the Mosaic Covenant and if you listen to look for all the messages brother Braham talks about the law versus Grace and all these things he says Israel see when when God came with covenants they cried out we'll obey every word you say sure you will they already proved they can't they already proved they should at that time they should have hit their knees and say God we can't follow any Covenant we need Grace gave Abraham Grace give us Grace we can't do it but brother brandham said they wanted a law so that they could make churches you know and form organizations and have a hierarchy of priests and Bishops and all this so that it became a nickan scene just like in the early church where they could rule the Le and lay down iron laws you must do this our word is God and and uh you know if Christ is in your heart you know where the word of God is first of all it's in here number one and if anybody conforms to this Word of Life great you're my brother if anybody preaches 99% of this and they so well now those days are past watch out you better hit the street fast right exactly so um the Mosaic Covenant but it brought the law laws of God by which one day God will judge the world so everything serves a purpose you know but think of how he gave that law with great Glory right the pillar of fire himself I love it on Ten Commandments right the pillar of fire himself came down and wrote the law with the Finger of God the glory of God was fully made manifest over the Old Testament the old Covenant the Mosaic Covenant the full glory of God was on display and Moses when he looked he couldn't see he blocked his view but then when he passed by he saw the back of a man and we'll touch on that in a little bit it's just so glorious oh my so Moses met the pillar of fire for the Old Testament you know we're going to hit something with that coming from forward now I'll try not to go more than four hours so I'm just kidding so they should have cried out we can't keep the law we need Grace that's what they should have done hey you think I can keep the law I need Grace every day amen you know brother Brandon preached a message called the message of Grace when I went went back and really listened to it it wasn't a message entitled the message of Grace he was telling us the entire message is a message of Grace the whole thing from beginning to end is nothing but the grace of God oh is so good it's Rich it's real glory so then the sixth one the land Covenant that's simply an extension of the abrahamic Covenant because now they've got Joshua they're about to go over Moses is is giving them their final instructions then God's about to take Moses up on Mount pisga and take him home and um so he tells them wait let me just read hold on a minute just for a second here Deuteronomy uh 30 I I just love this because it speaks of the coming new covenant in Deuteronomy uh 30 on uh verse five he says and the Lord thy God will bring thee into the land which thy father is possessed talking about Abraham and so forth and thou shalt possess it and he will do thee good and multiply thee above thy fathers and the Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart there it isise there's a new covenant coming down the road see and that Prophet Moses when prophets look and brother Bram the same thing when they see the mountaintops sometimes it looks like the mountains are merging you know they see this Advent and that advent so here's Moses looking into the promised land but he sees a Time coming when God was going to circumcise their hearts God that couldn't happen until the New Covenant praise God glory circumcise thine uh thine heart and the Heart of thy seed to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul that thou mayest live and then jumping down to uh verse 11 for this commandment which I command me thee this day it is not hidden from thee neither is it far off it is not in heaven that thou should say who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it neither is it Beyond the sea that thou should say who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it doesn't that sound like Jesus if they say Lo here or low there or loow it's in the desert or it's in this country or it's over there don't go because the word is with you even in you amen praise God but the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thine heart heart that thou mayest do it praise God see I have set before thee this day life and good death and evil in that I command thee this day to love isn't that beautiful didn't Jesus do the same thing to love the Lord thy God to walk in his ways to keep his Commandments and his statutes and his judgments that thou mayest live and multiply and the Lord thy God shall shall bless thee in the land with thou goest to possess it there's a land Covenant in a nutshell right there amen so you can see how these covenants they blend every one of them with the New Covenant and then of course the davidic Covenant was the last of the New Testament Covenant and the story of that is so beautiful because here's David he's got a heart after God right and he's like Lord I just want to do whatever ever I can for you and he and the Lord put it in his heart to build him a house you know so he goes to the Lord and then uh the prophet Nathan says look just do whatever is in your heart God is with you and he knew it that God was with him and so that night then God came to Nathan and said go tell my servant David you want to build me a house I'm going to build you a house isn't that just beautifulall he loved his wishes his will so much that he said thy seed will build me a house of course Solomon was the one to build the house but more than that the seed the son of David Jesus Christ and think of this beyond that I I son of David Jesus I go to prepare a place for you we want to give him our Temple right this is yours Lord he said I've got a temple for you you can't even imagine my the the mind can't conceive what it's like when you go over there so here amen so David uh I'll build you a house and of his lineage will come the Messiah but you know he was the last king all the kings uh were crowned of the lineage of David were crowned in Jerusalem the last king to be crowned in Jerusalem was Jesus but they crowned him with a crown of thorns my my my my my this gospel road is not a road of uh flowers and just good times and my goodness amen he's our example friends Hallelujah so then now the eighth one the eighth Covenant This is So Glorious so the eighth Covenant the New Covenant it's the only one in the in the New Testament why because it is the New Testament my goodness Hallelujah it is the New Covenant Testament means Covenant it's the same word interchangeable now as I told you on um Wednesday night I'd been praying and the Lord said no speak on this so kind of venturing into territory here I haven't done before but um among friends so if I Stumble and fall it'll be all right praise God but you know as I begin to really uh look at this and so forth I like uh last night this morning early I feel like uh joob how he said I'm just dust I come before almighty God who am I you know I'm going to lay my hand on my mouth and say nothing anymore when I begin to the look into the glory of this New Covenant or or like um Abraham remember when he was there and he was praying and talking to the Lord and interceding for lot which is Us in this day intercede for your family amilies and so forth your friends but he said I have taken it upon myself to speak to the god of ab the god of Heaven who am I each time when he went to as it were bargain with god well what if there's 40 what if there's 35 you know and he's like I've taken it upon myself to talk to this king the king of the universe and when I looked into this thing I'm like I've taken it upon myself to talk about this Eternal Covenant well you better have Sanctified lips that's all I can say you better have the Holy Spirit living in you Hallelujah this is sacred territory amen so I'm going to read a few scriptures now about the New Covenant we read the first one out of Jeremiah 31 and I want you to notice the numerology here God wanted us to see this and understand the number eight right it speaks of the new creation it speaks of Eternity it speaks of going back to the beginning uh It's A Perfect Circle Number Eight there's nothing beyond that amen so God positioned it so in the Bible that the New Covenant spoken of in the Old Testament is in Jeremiah 3131 four and four is eight right and then Jes Jesus begins to talk about it in Matthew 26 verse 26 8 and 8 and in the book of Hebrews guess where it's at Hebrews 88 three is a witness there's nothing Beyond this Covenant this is all you'll ever need Glory so let's get into it amen so Jesus Matthew 26 he says um uh starting here verse 26 amen and as they were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins and if you have a margin in your Bible uh I have a scoffield Bible and the it has the letter uh there which means uh New Covenant Testament and Covenant is the same word amen I want to turn uh to Hebrews 8 so this is a blood Covenant yes amen all right this is no light thing you know you can skip over you skip over this you just skipped over eternal life CU this is the all of it now amen this is dead serious Hebrews 8 and turning to uh verse 8 and here it is uh we we'll go back a few uh verses we'll go to verse six but now now hath he obtained a more excellent Ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better Covenant which was established upon better promises for if that first Covenant had been faultless then should no place have been sought for the second for finding fault with them he saith behold the days come saeth the Lord when I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah see he's not just making it with Israel he's making it with Judah too so none of the Seed of Abraham misses out amen he wants to be sure that the Royal Seed of Abraham doesn't miss out on this Covenant amen and with the house of Judah not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt because they continued not in my Covenant and I regarded them not sayeth the Lord for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days sayeth the Lord I will put my laws into their mind and will write them in their hearts and I will be to them a God and they will be to me a people see here's St Paul now placing it in the giving us understanding of what this new covenant is is which is the New Testament the the uh Matthew Mark Luke and John they were scribes they wrote what they saw but Paul he and I I'm going to get into this amen Moses met the pillar of fire there were all the other Patriarchs and Prophets and so forth but when Moses met the pillar of fire he wrote the Bible Genesis Exodus you know the Torah he wrote quot the Bible once meeting the pillar of fire St Paul met the same Pillar of Fire and St Paul wrote the New Testament wrote the New Covenant he broke it out and explained it the same Pillar of Fire now oh my goodness you got a painting in the office there of that same Pillar of Fire coming back in the last days to take this New Covenant and put it in your hearts he came back in a pillar of fire a son of man man I'm getting way ahead of myself here a son of man revealed Jesus the son of man which is the new land amen that's the land Covenant to take you into the promises of God but it had to be the same Pillar of Fire and I didn't understand it that way until I heard uh the unveiling of God he explained it on there thoroughly very thoroughly and I was just floored Hallelujah so here's St Paul doing just that he met God went on a road to Damascus right and then went in the wilderness and God opened the word to him amen we must do the same how you ever going to know unless you're constantly in the word reading and praying and seeking the Lord right so he says I'll put my laws in their mind and write them on their hearts I will be to them a God and they shall be to me a people and they shall not teach every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying no the Lord For All Shall know me from the least to the greatest for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more that is music to my ears amen Amen in in that he saith a New Covenant he hath made the first old now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away and in Hebrews here and in Corinthians and just everywhere Paul writes he explains how we've transitioned from the Mosaic Covenant into the New Covenant you see so um uh for a title I'm calling this the eternal Covenant because it is eternal this reaches from here clear over to the new city everything all through the Millennium the his coming on a white horse with the sword the final judgment right the white Throne judgment beyond all that beyond the 144,000 beyond the uh Jews being saved and rescued and and Christ coming for them as well right and bringing them home uh Joseph to his Brethren and then taking us right the bride with Christ judging the world passed all that all the way into the new city why why do you say that because the Book of Revelation is the revelation of Jesus Christ and the revelation of Jesus Christ is the New Covenant amen hallelujah oh my my my so amen so let me read uh Hebrews 9 I've got right written here to read Hebrews 911 uh nine okay here but Christ becoming an high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal there it is eternal Redemption for us so it's not like forever for a space of time it's Eternal amen there's no ending to this Covenant for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of a heer and sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh that's the Mosaic Covenant how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit God offer himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God oh my goodness and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Covenant the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgression that were under the first first testament the Old Testament they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal Eternal inheritance it doesn't begin and end you were in Christ before the world was God isn't that a mindblowing oh my goodness so and and also I wanted to read in Hebrews 11 uh 39 and4 40 he says all right he went through all these Saints all the Patriarchs the prophets even RAB and and Gideon barck jeffa Samson uh David and all the prophets and he says how they through faith subdued kingdoms and so forth but down in verse 39 he says and these all see they were under the Old Testament the old Covenant these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise they were still under the blood of bulls goats Cales lambs and so forth but they couldn't receive the full promise yet because he hadn't come and he says in verse 40 God having provided some better thing for us and this is what it does that they without us should not be made perfect you see how perfectly that resur Resurrection is going to be they with us will be perfect Onward Christian Soul right marching amen off the Earth boy it sounds like a fairy tale doesn't it doesn't it sound like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs or or what's the other one Cinderella they are fairy tales but they all s this sounds like it but the glory is this is real you can tell this one to your children and tell them this isn't a fairy tale honey this is reality this is happening and it's happening right now the bride is being prepared to walk off this Earth he's got to come soon because I don't know if you noticed it's crazy out there people have gone Hog Wild insane and they're calling that normal and calling you crazy fine call me whatever you want on Mar ing I'm on my way to Canaan land amen glory to God so and then on 12 chapter 12 uh Verse 18 this is it okay this is the comparison between the old Covenant and the New Covenant for ye are not come unto the mount which might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto Blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of Words which voice that they heard they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded see they couldn't and if so much as a beast touch the mountain it or it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart which I guess is a spear and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake right they were looking at death this would have killed them just like uh that fella what's his name you usza or something when he touched the ark right killed him right out amen these are the it's a fearful thing to fall into the hand of the Living God so amen God says anything he's not kidding amen but this is the glory but ye are come unto Mount Zion unto the city of the Living God amen the Heavenly Jerusalem this is your New Covenant now amen and to an innumerable company of angels you can't number it say so many one place in Revelation it said there was uh a 100 million Angels plus thousands of thousands it's just too many you can't you can't number them and they're all looking waiting isn't this amazing oh my innumerable company of angels to the general assembly that's the bride the church and the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect you can't be made perfect under the law only way is through this New Covenant and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel thank you Jesus his blood speaks to us today so what I'll I wanted to read a few things in a little bit out of second Corinthians and so forth and also out of the unveiling of God and where are we are 20 of 19 of um let me just hit this here so every Covenant that God made in the Old Testament comes alive under the new Covenant because the identic Covenant right uh just stay where you are do the right thing you got Dominion don't mess it up right but under the New Covenant you never messed it up you never did it in the first place you are thoroughly restored back to an Eden condition speak and their word is backed and they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover right they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues that's in the New Covenant Mark 16 if you want to look it up amen uh also um Mark chap 11 look it up it's all part of the new promise the New Covenant the New Testament praise God so we are restored back to the identic condition under the identic Covenant in the adamic Covenant the full word is restored to Eve the whole promise the whole package everything that we lost in the fall is restored back because God promised to Eve you're not going to be like this forever I love you I will restore you back all the years right where you went through all kind of things as the individual you've gone through all kind of stuff I will restore all that you lost and bride of Christ I will restore to you everything that you had in the Garden of Eden that's his promise Hallelujah and more than that you're going to bruise his head on your way out of here you're going to kick him off the the the cart going up amen amen you're free in Christ you are totally free the adamic Covenant becomes a reality to you amen and God swore with a by a rainbow Covenant to Noah right that as it was in the days of Noah so when God prepared had Noah prepare the ark with pitch and the wood so this bride is preparing her arkc by the word to be carried out of this world but more than that he said as it was in the days of Noah that links the Covenant of Noah to the last days so shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed and like I said it's crazy world out there it's clown world had to be like that those conditions had to be here before the bride goes so when we look at it and it just Grieves your heart how could intelligent people think or believe this total anti-science nonsense they reject common bi ology and they they've lost their minds had it be that way days of Noah in the son of man yes a son of man revealed the son of man that son of man is there now enjoying everything that he told us about what it's like but the son of man is here in this church oh my goodness Hallelujah the son of man is walking around the seats right now amen praise God as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in this day and he swore and put a rainbow out there and there's a rainbow around your Covenant a full rainbow because he looked at Jesus in Revelation one right and there was a rainbow about his head oh my goodness and you were in his right hand Seven Stars glory to God oh my word and then the uh abrahamic Covenant Every Blessing every Redemptive blessing that he gave to Abraham is ours now through this uh New Covenant every single one every promise he had given to Abraham in type is that was the type the type is pointing to something yes that was the type but you're the reality of it amen the abrahamic Covenant and as I mentioned before with the Mosaic Covenant that becomes real to us because like I said Moses met the pillar of fire and wrote the word right and he had to write the Mosaic Covenant and he wrote the first five books of the Bible the Finger of God that means something to us because that same identical finger comes back and writes the word in your heart only not on tables of stone but on the the fleshy tables of your heart glory to God hallelujah glory and then we inherit in the land Covenant we inherit the new land the son of man Christ amen revealing himself as he did through a son of man I don't know but he's still revealing himself I go through these here messages and every time I pick it up it's a new message it is the word just keeps opening and opening brother brandham isn't doing that the Holy Ghost is doing that because that same Pillar of Fire that Moses wrote the word that Paul wrote the word brought and restored back the word same one same one Glory Hallelujah Glory that Pillar of Fire is here don't look for it with your natural eye amen amen every mystery every former mystery pertaining to Redemption has been revealed amen they were former Mysteries but they're a reality now amen that's what makes you happy that's why we're so happy we look half crazy to people because it's been revealed amen and he said I love you bride all this is yours and it's not like a promise a far off someday it's going to come this is living T present tense reality right now in you is the power to speak the word in you right now remember what was one of the earlier messages and he said in you right now is your Resurrection imagine that the resurrection is in you right now it's not hyperbole or whatever you want to call it that's God that's his word praise God whatever God says is going to happen is that in you uh 1 Thessalonians 4 is that in you then the resurrection is in you through the New Covenant glory to God hallelujah because under the land Covenant like I said it's the Ephesians land that's the new land amen Joshua typed the Holy Ghost and he led them into the new land today because Moses had to go the one who met the fire he had to go back and be with God and his people right but Joshua which typed the Holy Ghost he led them over all right goodness where is Joshua now well Lo it's far off over there or Lo if you go to that convention maybe you'll find him there he's right here right now it's not far off of the sea or amen uh off in the desert Jesus is here right now Hallelujah because his spirit and his word are here amen thank you Lord you have more power in you than a h a hydrogen bomb God I'm serious that's a truth hallelujah why this is a I'm still just reviewing the seven covenants amen and Joshua Holy Ghost he fights your battles right that's that's under the land Covenant oh my in the davidic Covenant or Royal seed or King amen he's coming the king is coming right and you will crown him oh my goodness we'll crown him king of kings and you crown him now King of Kings in Your Heart Lord You're My Savior yes but you're also my Lord now I'm giving up this and you know it's almost laughable I'm like it's something Noble I give up sin for you you what you're giving up death for life like that's some Noble act please spare me you know but it's that human spirit that likes to hold on to things you know I'm not Ironclad I know I go through it myself so I'm speaking from experience I'm not way up in the clouds Reverend King Joseph something or other no I'm your brother and I go through it just like you amen amen but I'm so glad I've got a promise yes I do amen so the we will crown him we crown him king of kings in the throne room whoops sorry there in the throne room of our heart well they say the throne's on the left side anyhow so amen praise the Lord now I wanted to read second Corinthians and this is just too glorious and and my friend brother Brian Cutz he's he's uh he's watching now um we were talking just by text about these things and early in the week he told me I guess maybe it was Thursday he told me read 2 Corinthians 3 in the Amplified in and I'm busy I'm like sure I'll definitely do that well I'm driving down here or she's driving and he texted me did you read it yet and I'm like oh no then while we're driving I begin to I looked it up on my phone and I begin to read it in the uh Amplified and I was oh my goodness sometimes the Amplified really can help amplify what you're reading you know we don't take the Amplified as the word of of God you understand but we still we can definitely Garner some great things off of it oh my it's all already nine nine of well I'll wrap this up soon but right now we're in the thick of it all right this is too good this is wonderful amen well I could read 2 Corinthians 3 out of the King James I'll just hit a a few verses out of the King James and I'll read the whole thing out of the U Amplified verse three well verse two ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink here it is the Finger of God but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in the fleshy tables of the heart and such trust have we through Christ to God word see it's all through Christ amen um not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves right we're not going to think of ourselves higher than we we ought to but our sufficiency is of God who also hath made us able Ministers of the the New Testament he's made us Ministers of the New Covenant when you talk to somebody when you're witnessing to somebody about Jesus to come to Christ you're a minister of the New Covenant amen when you're just living a Christian Life out there in the street you're a minister of the New Covenant every one of you young old child doesn't matter amen amen so here's St Paul saying it now my goodness and he's saying don't think higher of me than you ought to but I'm a minister of this New Covenant oh my goodness and he sure was because he met that Pillar of Fire to tell us what it was able Ministers of the New Testament not of the leather letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life you can have the word the word the word and word until the Holy Ghost comes it's just going to be dead letter but when the Holy Spirit gets into the word it quickens your mortal body and it lives out Jesus Christ hallelujah amen so he says then the old Covenant but if the ministration of death written and engraven in Stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which Glory was to be done away you imagine that how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious see the New Covenant is the Holy Ghost amen amen the New Covenant was explained displayed and poured out on the day of Pentecost right Jesus went gave the offering paid your price in mine then he wasn't done he went down to Hell and took the keys of death and Hell Rose up took paradise and took that to Glory then comes down and is resurrected with the keys of death and Hell walks around with his disciples in a resurrection Ministry to what did Jesus do for that whole time what did he do he pointed them to the word many he says how how all when Jesus met with them he opened open to them their understanding that they might understand brother Jones's Revelation no that they might understand the scriptures and that's all the Holy Ghost is going to do amen he's not going to give you some understanding of some whack out thing he's going to give you understanding of the word of God why because he wrote the word of God and the ministration of the Holy Ghost writes the word of God in your heart and mind amen praise the Lord God it's always the Holy Spirit not not just the letter of the word it's so you need to know the word you need to read and study the word on your knees and wait for Divine Light but until it's a holy ghost anointing the word you got a lot of head knowledge you can go in uh you can go into some ministerial conference and argue quots with people and that'll get you nowhere like I I I wrote some poor brother that was going down some rabbit hole on some uh thing and uh but I knew this that this poor brother he had prayed for people nobody got healed no there was no power I said brother all kid aside I'm like St Paul said don't show me your words show me your power is what you're talking about real well then it's got to manifest itself you don't have to manifest anything if your heart and life belongs to Jesus Christ he will manifest himself I don't have to vindicate anything it's been Vindicated the world around this word is thus sayith the Lord all I have to do is be yield to the spirit and allow the spirit to conform me to that word then you become a uh manifested written epistle you become the word Jesus Christ manifest on two feet to your parents to your coworker to those that have need of you know the days of the big revivals we know that's over over you know this generation's gone too far this country my beloved America has gone too far they've gone complete they've kicked the word out back in 1956 yes sir and then the Pentecostal Church Church kicked him out in 64 when they thoroughly rejected and brother brandham went around the country preaching trial and trial and Here There and the other right and then God sent the earthquake in Alaska Good Friday Jesus Christ turned down and that earthquake was a sign a judgment sign of something that was what a 9.2 was it I think it was 9.2 it was spectacular ularly powerful but because there weren't many people they even had I didn't know this I just read this the other day they had a foot tsunami far more than what you saw uh overseas that one that killed those poor Japanese people and that swept in from the sea look at the videos and it's just stunning 200 feet on uh April uh uh 19 uh 196 4 it was a judgment sign he said wait he said you'll find out when California is at the bottom of the sea that was a sign of what's to come just imagine I can't I can't imagine what would happen a 9.2 in Los Angeles you can't even imagine the amount of Devastation that's going to happen amen and ryes for that song If you want to see your loved ones say you better get them in now you know because it's coming oh Father amen I'm so glad for the New Covenant amen praise His wonderful name boy I sure went down a rabbit hole that time Aaron praise the Lord amen amen so The Spirit Well the Lord want I felt in my heart he wanted me to talk about the ministration of the spirit that writes his word in your heart and lives the word through US amen so that's it's not you trying to defend some Doctrine it's you living Christ amen how do you do that yield right just yield this a place where he said a man who help me with this Saron um if a man will completely yield himself to God he that man is om om nipotent think about that omnipotent what is why she's like Adam and Eve again because she's yielded her members to him the king it's no more her thought anymore she doesn't think well if I go and pray for this person and they're healed they'll know my Ministry is Vindicated you better throw that filthy thought out that's a filthy thought there is no such thing amen you live the life of Jesus Christ who took upon himself no reputation amen amen my precious Lord amen he didn't care about his legacy they stood there and spat in his face oh boy you know you think about that and I wonder what would I have done that day oh my but you know what there was nobody there I suppose I would have done just like Peter and the rest of them I would have run scared yes sir right but you know what it's different when he comes and then lives because that same Peter was crucified upside down he said I'm not worthy to be crucified like my w Lord did he didn't run then he ran to the Cross oh my that's what he does he changes your way you think the way you talk the way you live in that same Jesus the Holy Ghost is here right now oh my goodness I'm going to read this here this New Covenant I was going to read so many quotes uh I maybe maybe I'll make a part two and send it to you all right but I want to read this New Covenant which brother Cuts told me to read out of the uh out of the Amplified version because you know how's I as I said the holy spirit is Jesus Christ that's what Paul says he says it right in uh verse 17 now the Lord Jesus the Lord is that spirit amen it's one and the same Christ is the Holy Ghost oh my goodness Christ is Joshua the Holy Ghost is Joshua to lead us to this Promised Land the New Covenant he says here the Amplified are we starting to commend our ourselves again or do we need some false teachers letters of recommendation to you or from you no you are our letter of recommendation written in our hearts recognized and read by everyone you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but on tablets of human hearts such is the confidence and steadfast Reliance and absolute truth that we have through Christ toward God not that we are sufficiently qualified in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us but our sufficiency and qualifications come from God Amen he has qualified US making us sufficient as Ministers of a New Covenant and that's what the that's the heading here above this chap chapter in the Amplified it says Ministers of a New Covenant all Ministers of a New Covenant of Salvation through Christ not of the letter of a written code but of the spirit for the letter of the law kills by revealing sin and demanding obedience but the spirit gives life now if the ministry of death engraved in letters on Stones The Covenant of the law which led to death because of sin came with such glory and Splendor that the Israelites were not able to look steadily on the face of Moses because of its Glory a Brilliance that was fading how will the ministry of the spirit the New Covenant which allows us to be spirit filled oh the New Covenant is a baptism of the Holy Ghost don't take that away from me brother amen prise God Amen I'm so glad that ministers don't have a heaven they don't have a hell they don't have nothing that they can give or take away you just need to conform to the word you can only do that by Jesus Christ amen glory amen okay uh for the ministry of condemnation the old Covenant of the law has Glory how much more does TH does glory overflow in the ministry that brings righteousness the New Covenant which de declares Believers free of guilt and sets them apart for God's special purpose indeed what had Glory the law in this case no longer has Glory because the glory that surpasses it the gospel see the the glory that was in the law is now eclipsed and overshadowed by the glory of Christ in the gospel for that for if that law which Fades away came with Glory how much more must that gospel which remains is permanent abide in glory and Splendor I think of that imagine and Moses cried for a for give me a give me a greater Vision Lord and here comes God himself right Pillar of Fire and and that was the glory to be passed away because there was a greater see we don't realize who we are we really didn't remember he said something like one day she'll realize who she is and when she does then the Rapture will go that Glory that Splendor on Mount Si all of that writing the law the whole Mountain shaking Blackness sound of trumpet fire lightning everything the absolute glor glory of God so that everyone was terrified that's in you really yes really that really is in you amen he said so all right all right permanent abide in glory and Splendor since we have such a glorious hope and confident expectation we speak with great courage and we are not like Moses who used to put a veil over his face so that the Israelites would not gaze at the end of the glory which was fading away but in fact their minds were hardened for they had lost the ability to understand same with the Gentile Church same exact thing they lost the ability to understand the word even in the message they've got so message and they think well I'm in the message everything is fine that's one side they're dead as a door nail and then over the other side the the these crazy Revelations start perking up because they figure well the Bible just isn't enough we need more oh God that's what Eve said they don't realize the glory the power of the Eternal Word when he sets up sharp in you you know what people don't have the Holy Ghost that's the problem a lot of people don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost so they get restless and they try to manufacture a Dynamics to their mechanics you can't do that no no no no let God be God and you be obedient that's what we want he he's happy with obedience then he manifests himself then when you pray for somebody they get healed amen how do you know I know because it happens all the time but the bride isn't going to blow the trumpet hey look God's no you're humble simple look when that bride begins to speak the word and it creates like that is she going to run a flag up the pole and say hey look we got it we got it we got spoken [Music] word that's absurd she's way beyond that Hallelujah she's walking with her King she's walking walking in humility amen she's walking in love every day she has she could care less what you know that kind of a mindset all right quit here we go their minds were hardened they lost the ability to understand for until this very day at the reading of the old Covenant the same Veil remains unlifted because it is removed only in Christ but to this day whenever Moses is read a veil of of blindness Lies over their heart but whenever a person turns in Repentance and Faith to the Lord the veil is taken away and so is it today now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty emancipation from bondage true freedom and we all with unveiled face oh my continually see being as in a mirror the glory of the Lord are progressively being transformed see that progressively day by day by day unconscious growth amen amen seeing as in a mirror the glory of the Lord are progressively being transformed into his image from one degree of Glory even more to even more Glory which comes from the Lord who is the spirit you see that the New Covenant is the Holy Ghost baptism and until you really enter in Beyond the Veil and I'll paraphrase paraphrase a few things that he said on the unveiling of God as I had mentioned on there he was talking about how that there were two two men that make met the pillar of fire and those two men were authors of the Bible that was Moses for the old Covenant and St Paul for the New Covenant and those two literally met the literal Pillar of Fire then on that same message he says at the last days at the end that same Pillar of Fire has come back to get into the word and reveal what's already been preached by Paul and take us back to what he preached Hallelujah it has to be the same Pillar of Fire and it's a it the book becomes an open book and all us with open face beholding the glory of the Lord because he opened the Seven Seals and revealed the glory of his person he revealed how Christ operated down through all the ages amen amen he opened the book he had to come back as a pillar of fire in the last days to reveal the mystery of himself because none of the reformers could get it right right every church as soon as they get a new idea they form a group amen and call it this and you got to join our church or you're lost same the same thing goes on in the message there's all kind of ministers out there that have some whack Revelation and they say you got to join our group or you're not going in a Rapture here when that Prophet said on uh God's chosen place of worship he said some man called me the other day from bont Texas and said brother unless you be gone belong to our group you can't go you you you missed it he said who ever heard of such a thing he said to say such a thing is Antichrist that's right and then he said I'll say this if you believe something like that you're lost you're lost and you got people in the message screaming that same thing you got to belong to our group or you're not going to go you got to see through my glasses or you're not going Antichrist lost now I'm not saying there literally lost that's between them and God I'm just quoting what thus sayith the Lord said right the New Covenant has opened the word oh my goodness he came back and ripped the seals off oh man can I read something to you all right I know it's almost a quarter after but uh let me see this is um page 17 here he says um this is unfailing of God I think this is the one yeah this is just too glorious maybe we'll wrap it up on this all right in the Old Testament God was hid when he was on his mercy seat on The Mercy Seat by a veil and the Old Testament see I haven't even talked about the mercy seat and you know the Tabernacle and how that there's you know there's three things you got the outer Court inner Court Most Holy Place human being outer Court your flesh inner Court mind you know conscious reasoning Most Holy place the Throne of your heart you can have God here and here but unless he's in there you'll just be arguing quotes that's right y oh my so so he said but the people come in and worship like this but remember there was a veil that hid God they knew God was there they couldn't see him the pillar of fire never listen to this that Pillar of Fire never appeared anymore there did you notice there's not one time in the scripture from the time that the pillar of fire went in behind that Veil that it ever showed again till it come from Jesus Christ God was veiled when he stood on Earth and he said I come from God and I go go to God then Paul after his death burial and Resurrection on his road to Damascus there was that Pillar of Fire again what was it out from behind the veil glory to God he was in behind the veil now he was behind what skin Veil oh man see that God himself veiled in you my goodness that's why he says say you know love one another another say good things to one another encourage one another don't cut one another down you're you're talking about a skin Veil there's God in there right amen uh out from behind the veil he went was in behind the veil what kind of a veil a skin Veil see Badger skins in the Old Testament behind the veil and when that veil was rent on the day of crucifixion the Veil that he was wrapped in was rent on the day of crucifixion the whole Mercy Seat came into view oh that's love that's love he didn't want us wondering and confused and is this right he opened the whole Mercy Seat what did he do in the last days he came in the same Pillar of Fire and revealed the whole Mercy Seat amen every mystery was revealed as pertains to your personal Redemption glory to God there's no more Mysteries to be revealed outside of that Elijah that's what he said so he says um the whole Mercy Seat came into view I'll skip down since Pentecost since the crucifixion when that veil was rent from the top to the bottom for that generation Jesus was that God veiled and when he died at Calvary God sent fire and lightning and ripped that Veil from top to the bottom and the whole Mercy Seat was in plain view but they were too blind to see it yes imagine that they knew the word they and he said they were in the temple singing chanting Psalm 22 while Jesus is out there screaming my God my God why have they why have you forsaken me you imagine that they're reading the same scriptures and yet they're veiled they couldn't see it and they're the same way today yes sir God revealed in the open unveiled before us and they think we need something more have mercy father my goodness the whole Mercy Seat came into view um ripped the veil from top to bottom but they were too blind to see it as Moses said here here though and as Paul said reading of Moses when Moses is read yet that Veil is still on their heart oh brother sister that's what's the that's what the Jews did when the veil was rent and God brought into Plain View hanging on the cross he was in plain view but they couldn't see it could it be possible that the Gentiles has done the same thing oh God when they've had the church ages a Son of God but when now the veil of this denomination and things this veil of tradition that we've got since Pentecost when the church Traditions have been rent and the things that the people said days of Miracles is passed and these things you know they say that yet in the message there's groups that say the days of Miracles are passed right you know that's true right and these things and God has took the veil off of it and brought it in plain view and they're ready to crucify it again oh my goodness they said he was too common he was too ordinary you're too common you're too ordinary God isn't failed in that not that right oh it's in this you know Grand somebody soand so with titles it's amazing how that denominational Spirit could come into the message and do the same thing he said they will never denominate this what's he talking about the word if you see a denominational message church or message they're not in the message the message I should say the message is not in them amen everywhere they're doing that again amen and they break up Unity break up Brotherhood Fellowship lost because we've got it and you don't you know you've got to agree with Pastor Jones from East B you know I need to agree with Jesus and he revealed himself in the last days he ripped back the veil and open the whole book it's a New Covenant on display oh God help me glory to God Amen is it real to you praise God so he says the Gentiles done the same thing they're ready to crucify him again he said he brought him in open View and they still don't see it they are blinded now he's a prophet he's speaking in 1964 but he sees the message in 2024 right he's looking 60 years down the road oh my amen they still don't see it they are blinded God veiled in a human being and of course that's where a bunch of them went off on worshiping brother brandham that's right that's right they they went to the extreme on that side it's hard to maintain the middle of the road you know you get washed off to one side or the other you get washed off into formal you got washed off into crazies you know and it's hard to stay right with the word but I got news for you all power in Heaven and Earth is on the word through the spirit oh my goodness oh my all right he said all right I'll read this and then we'll close you you can come up and get ready to play start playing a himym I don't know something happen happy something of Redemptive all right and something I'll know you know all right brought him an open view he says uh God veiled in a human being God has veiled in you little bride amen is Christ in you he's the hope of glory a three-fold mystery it's Christ in you the hope of glory all these promises are see that whole thing the the Seven Seals this here unveiling of God all the promises that Abraham displayed the new name the son of man uh adoption all these promises were displayed in the seven covenants but the New Covenant takes and puts it in you for our day in reality and the Book of Revelation says the same you have a new name that the world doesn't know anything about your name is is written in a white stone perfect revelation of Jesus Christ all these things are to the individual because the church kicked them out he's on he's let me in let me in and the individuals is the only ones that let him out Revelation three proves that the days of big revivals is over because the church is all shut him out no other age like it not even thyra was his bad where he's totally on the outside can I come into my own church heartbreaking again she went off and committed adultery with men's ideas instead of saying pure virgin to the word yes sir God help me it's going fast Aaron I'm trying to all right oh should I read that one oh my goodness oh it's so beautiful he says uh listen to this how could God have mercy on foul Sinners as us when he hid himself was a mystery and now it's in plain view it's in full view revealed by his word it's always the word constantly that is God it's the word that opens it up if those people would have known that the word of God that day when Jesus died they would have seen the Mercy Seat they would have seen who he was who was that then why did the veil rent remember it was death to go into it nobody could see it Moses saw it in a form it was a man's back well here it is a bleeding back oh I read that I just wanted to die um bleeding back that same man what was it God wanted to show them The Mercy Seat God wanted to show them who he was so the veil in the temple from the hand of God above was rent from top to bottom and showed God in plain view it was Jesus Christ hanging on the cross The Mercy Seat and what was it the people were too blind to see it now it's repeated again he said but glory to God he promised in the last days what he would do he would show his word in plain view open before us again and open it up oh my Hallelujah what's this revival for now how could it Prosper how could it be blessed I don't care how many interpretations impersonations it's God or anything else when Moses went out there was a mixed multitude went with them and what's it done for it's Jehovah himself taking the veil off God to show the difference between right and wrong which is Methodist Baptist Presbyterian or who is right God's word is Right glory to God hallelujah let every man's word be a lie and mine be truth God needs no interpreter he does his own interpretation he manifests it it gives the interpretation God unveiling himself oh my right in the midst of us we see his great hand telling us these things and doing these things listen to this message the unveiling of God and another one I was going to read is Christ revealed in his own word listen to those two messages they're fantastic oh
