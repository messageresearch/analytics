========================================

uh by God's grace we looked at the life of Eli in part one we looked at the life of King Saul in part two um Wednesday we looked at some of the uh some of the i' say false Doctrine you know currently around you know our sister churches and so forth like that of how people idolize uh William brandom and so forth We Believe William Brandon was a prophet of God but we don't worship him uh so we looked at that on Sunday by God's grace I'm sure you remember but uh by God's grace we tonight we want to look at the life of St Peter so we want to look at this in the light of we can see many times through his life how he was double-minded and it's very clear to see that uh and I've never and I preached on Peter Peter of course numerous times but never have I seen it in this light so to me it's the Holy Spirit giving me more understanding giving us more understanding uh that we can by God's grace cast down double-mindedness and we can live a single-minded life how many want that by God's grace I know that's why you're here right you want a single-minded uh walk with the Lord without distraction you want to overcome life's trials and so forth so let's go to James chapter 1 ver8 then we'll read uh James 4 ver8 James 4 ver8 so James 1 verse eight let's read that if we can on three one two three a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways amen now let's go to James uh 4:8 remember James chapter 1 is to the believer who's faithful uh James chapter 1 was not really rebuke it was just saying if you think you're going to receive anything anything from God you can't be double-minded you have to be single-minded now chapter four is a totally different story chapter 4 they've got Wars and fights in the church they've got adulterers and adulteresses people sleeping around the church and now James says this is another kind of double double-mindedness this is a worse double-mindedness uh and I don't believe this applies to us because how many have Clean Hands by the grace of God how many have how many have a pure heart by the grace of God that's why I lay here at the altar before service in my home say God created me a clean heart Hallelujah there's any sin show me I'll confess it I just want to live pure before the Lord hallelujah so this is of course another kind of double-mindedness this is the one that we want to avoid by God's grace and I believe we have by the grace of God let's read this one as well ready one two 3 draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify your hearts ye double-minded amen may God add his a blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated praise God hallelujah so we'll look at this here tonight uh trust be a blessing I think last time Paige was here didn't we look at David sister Paige is okay if I call you sister Paige sister Carrie sister Sharon you know we're all brothers and sisters uh by the blood of Jesus Christ so uh we're looking at God's grace last time uh Paige was here God's grace to David and uh of course God had great grace on David God has great grace on us too Hallelujah let me set a timer here I'll try to preach about 45 minutes I can't promise that but I'm going to try to stop at 45 minutes we'll see how that goes so uh tonight you know let's look at the life of Peter we looked at Eli I said King Saul we looked at the current uh idolatry some people have today on Sunday you know regarding brother William brandham um and then uh today we're look at the life of St Peter I don't think I've ever looked at it in this light so hope it'll be a blessing to you you know I looked at um you know these scriptures on Peter I want to start off by uh reminding you of how he was raised uh he was raised as a fisherman right his father was a fisherman of course in those days the the sons always did the the the occupation of their father right Jesus was a carpenter they looked at Jesus and said isn't this the Carpenter's son right and that was a lowly kind of job a carpenter wasn't a great man it wasn't a great job you know so uh Jesus you know wasn't raised we'd Say by a great man um you know as far as the world standards but of course Joseph was a a true servant of God Amen there was no uh there's no Prophet when he was alive right John the Baptist wasn't born yet Malachi had died you know hundreds of years later or earlier and so there there was no way to talk to Joseph so God sent him a dream right and then he spoke to him about you know a baby Jesus and so forth and God was able to speak to him and he was a just man the Bible said Hallelujah so God has a way to speak to us hallelujah if there's maybe no Prophet on the scene if there's no uh if there's no person with a great gift of God God still can speak to us that ought encourage us tonight praise God because you might go to bed tonight you might get a Dream from the Lord right or maybe next week or you know in the upcoming months here by God's grace uh I think we've all had dreams that we know God was speaking to us hallelujah we looked at that a few weeks ago where job said God gives Men Dreams to seal up the sum of their wisdom so God will give you a dream sometimes to confirm that what you were hearing while you were awake that was the will of God right sometimes you do that sometimes we'll give you a warning like with uh Joseph or sending the angel uh sometimes God does those things but we want to be aware of how God speaks to us but uh Peter of course was raised here as a fisherman uh fishermen were pretty lowly workers right they were the uh they're the Burly right they're the Burly workers on I imagine there were some little ones too but we imagine Peter had was a big Burly guy you know in those big Nets of fish right trying to pull them in and uh and remember he was raised in the Roman culture that was not a very kind culture right to women and children remember remember we looked at the history a Roman man could have his wife and children killed in any moment just just if he said so and the women couldn't be you know they couldn't go to court a woman's word couldn't be trusted think about think about that that was the the culture remember that and then maybe they are under heavy taxation so Peter would work all day he'd pull in the Nets and then the the the the publicans and and all the tax collectors would be right there and you know how they didn't like Tax Collectors they didn't like zakus right they always charge too much they always took too much money so Peter was just living under this cycle of life right he was married you know uh he had a had a wife the Bible said Jesus healed his mother-in-law later on but he was you know raised in this uh in in this system it's kind of like the cast system right where you you just can't get out of it how is he ever going to raise out of being a fisherman what hope did he have for his life what was their life expectancy around that time not very long not like ours right thanks to the Industrial Revolution so we would say he didn't maybe have like a a very hopeful life but one day he heard about that there was a man a young man a young preacher just about his age who was a preacher and he went to see him we know that in John chapter 1 he went to see him and the very first thing Jesus said he saids your name is uh Simon son of Jonas right and he says I'm going to make you a fisher of men now see the Bible wouldn't put that in there unless it was significant now I've never seen the chosen series but people say there's some good moments like that in the chosen series I I don't watch it you know there might be some good moments I know I've seen some healings on there that look really good you know on the advertisements and so forth like that but it must have been the case that that that uh you know that that Jesus told him who his father was because his father had told Peter about who the Messiah would be that had had to be a significant event in Peter's life so Peter out there on the boats they would have been talking about the Messiah and he would have heard it like Malachi heard me preach all these years Dad yeah Dad you keep saying that yeah yeah one of these days the messiah's going to come son yeah yeah yeah Peter would just you know he just go along with it and when he comes he's going to tell us the secrets of of our hearts and he's gonna he's gonna be greater than Moses and yeah Dad yeah I heard it a hundred times Dad yeah now he doesn't act that way but you can imagine Peter right he was just raised around that but then the first time you know Andrew and Nathaniel they all say John they say there he's the Messiah we believe he's the Messiah and he said okay let me let me see about that let me see and no doubt his dad told him about it and the very first thing he tells him his dad's name and he tells him now I'm going to call you sephus which means the Rock I'm going to call you the Rock So before he must have not been much of a rock right and we're going to see it even in his life before Pentecost he wasn't very solid and the church said amen and church that's how we are you know we become Christians and at at the beginning we're not very solid but what does God do he makes us strong Hallelujah right Peter uh followed Jesus for three maybe three and a half years some Scholars say and then after Jesus resurrect resurrected and ascended then he went to the the Pentecost right upper room and that's where he was filled with the spirit of God and after he was filled with the spirit of God he was a different man Hallelujah right that's what we're going to see tonight but I won't be able to go through everything but this is what we see you know he he comes in the presence of Jesus and Jesus tells him who his dad is how could Jesus know there wasn't any way for him to know other than God let him know he was a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart praise God he had that gift okay and so we see that's how Peter gets his start Hallelujah he meets Jesus In This Very Supernatural way and remember in Matthew chapter 10 I don't want to have time to read all these because a lot of these are familiar to us but in Matthew chapter 10 Jesus calls Peter and the other 11 and he says I'm going to give you power to heal the sick any manner of sickness they could have healed raise the Dead cast out Devils now I've never raised the dead but I have prayed for the sick they've got well I have cast out Devils about six or seven times out of people that were foaming at the mouth and I just prayed for them and they screamed and they fell down like just like in the Bible they fell down like they were dead and uh had to wait a little while wake them up and they're they're in their right mind again praising God so I I know the Bible's real how many know the Bible's real praise God I know the Bible's real Hallelujah but Peter and was G like all the other 11 he was given all of these remember Judas was given that same power too so that proves no matter what gifts you have that doesn't mean you're saved just because you're gifted everybody has at least one gift the Bible says right so what it means we got to be faithful our gifts don't save us Grace saves us amen hallelujah God's grace saves us amen we're saved by grace through faith it is a gift of God hallelujah amen and so we see that uh Peter gets the power you know and he goes out and uh he begins uh the Bible said Jesus sent him out two by two so Peter would go with another man I wonder who he'd go with you know uh he go out there and and they would do Miracles and they they they tell the the communities the messiah's coming Jesus is coming after us and Jesus would come and they do many mighty wonderful things uh but we also as we look at the scripture we begin to see Peter's double-mindedness right we begin to see some of his struggles uh but before that let's look at a few of his uh I'm going to look at some of these good moments here by God's grace because I want to show you the good and then of course the struggles so in Matthew 16: 16 a case I'm going to have you maybe busy putting up some verses up there because I like to cover a lot of ground here if I can uh by God's grace Matthew 16:16 it's amazing Peter gives us two of the most beautiful confessions of faith in the entire Bible two of the most memorable statements anyone's ever said to Jesus came by Peter Hallelujah and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God think about that Peter had seen the first miracle water turned to Wine he'd seen that he'd seen 5,000 fed Peter would have saw the baskets they take a fish out and there would have been more fish down there how how'd that happen wait wait let me let me check again and each time they took out there was more Peter saw that and he said uh Jesus said who do men say that I am Jeremiah John the Baptist who do who do men say that I am is Isaiah who do men say that I am and Peter's the one that speaks up he says I know you're the Christ you're the Messiah amen remember Christ means the anointed one Hallelujah Peter had seen Jesus anointed Hallelujah he just wasn't a preacher he was a powerful preacher Hallelujah there's times I wish I seen more power in my life I have seen power in my life at times but I wish I saw more of the power Hallelujah but not so with Jesus Jesus had all power Hallelujah he said all power all authority is given unto me in heaven and earth Hallelujah but then he also said I can only do what the father shows me remember in John chapter 5 he said the son can do nothing of himself except what the father shows him first Hallelujah so we also know Jesus was obedient to the father's Visions or the word that the father spoke to Jesus amen but then also we know John said that uh if if it were possible the world couldn't hold all the books of the testimonies of Jesus amen and Peter was the one right there standing them standing there watching Jesus do all these amazing Miracles Hallelujah now uh let's go if you would here uh let's go to this one Luke 5 one of the first things uh where we see uh maybe a little bit of Peter's struggles in Luke 5 verse4 Luke 5 verse4 thanks you're doing a great Joba when he had left speaking he said unto Simon Simon laod out into the deep and let down your nets for a drw next verse and Simon answered said to him Master we have toiled all the night think about that when was the last time you worked third shift thank God I've I don't think I've ever done it by God's grace I worked a real long second one time just to try to make some money in between my college SE semester so hopefully you don't have to do that sister paig that was an awful day I'll never forget that day but he worked all night in this rigorous monotonous job and see they had to work all night because they had to make some money because they know they're going to get taxed as soon as they get up there they're going to get taxed and have to pay it's a it's not a it's not a very glorious life now look at his respect right look at his respect for Jesus he said we've toy it all the day long we've taken nothing nevertheless I like that little speck of faith in there amen hallelujah he already knew he was the Messiah but I like that Speck of faith in there he he' already Jesus already told him the secret of his father who his father's name it already changed his name does that remind anybody of Abraham was it Abra the father of the faith who's the father of the New Testament Peter everybody see that name change Hallelujah right Abra Abram went from Abram to Abraham right father of many nations Peter went from Peter I'm sorry from Peter to sephus Hallelujah so we can see it it's a it's a beautiful example here he said nevertheless at Thy word I'll let down the net in other words I've seen you do great things I I I I I know God's with you I know God's anointed you I'm very tired I've worked all night but Lord I want to obey the word so I'll obey the word it's kind of like when when we don't feel like praying but yet we still pray anyway am right we don't maybe feel like going to church but we go to church anyway and look what God does God gives us a great blessing afterwards amen if we just give a little sacrifice if we just show God a little more dedication right if we just if we can just bring our bodies and our minds into subjection into obedience to the word of God God's going to pour out a blessing how many have seen it before hallelujah amen so how many times just give God the sacrifice just obey the word of God and God will bless you richly hallelujah amen verse uh six and when he had done this uh they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net break the blessing was so great they couldn't contain it Hallelujah does the Bible say he does exceedingly abundantly above all we ask or think Hallelujah I've had seasons of of life like that where the finances just flowed in like it's like the an like the windows of Heaven were open I'll tell let the sister shared I've had times I've had Seasons sister every couple weeks I go out to the mail there's an all this money in the in the mailbox unexpected right and there are seasons where I get tested and tried and I don't get those right but there are seasons where God pours out blessing upon blessing is he worthy of Our Praise of course he's worthy in the good times and the bad times but he's given Peter a lesson at the beginning always obey the word of God always obey my voice if you obey my voice everything going to be good Hallelujah we see that today in our day too verse seven and they beckoned unto their Partners which were in the other ship so not only had he worked all night all these other guys had worked all night that they should come and help them and they came and filled both the ships so that they began to sink you can't even contain the blessing that he's given verse eight and Simon Peter saw it he fell down at jesus' knees saying depart from me for I am a sinful man oh Lord now look at the humility of Peter In This Moment he realized I was having a mind battle I was battling double-mindedness so this clearly shows he didn't want to let down the Nets so he just obeyed by okay I'll just in other words I'll just go through the motions and the church said sometimes church we just go through the motions God help us he will that proves to help us amen because he knows we want to love him and serve him we love Jesus but sometimes we're exhausted and we need God to help us to obey so Peter sees this amazing miracle he says what is his first reaction oh I'm such a great man no I'm a sinner depart from me I can you leave my presence I'm not much of a man I'm a sinner Hallelujah and that's what we know when the spirit of God comes it always makes us humble amen no person here me no one musicians visitors no one should get any glory in the service except Jesus Christ amen am in your life in all of our Lives the only person that deserves glory is the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah because we realize w wow I could never do this if we ever have a testimony if we ever if anything ever happens to us that's a blessing it's because of the grace of God to us hallelujah that's what Peter recognizes so I like you to see this see he's battling this double-mindedness and we we battle the same thing I know the Bible says this but it's so hard okay I guess I'll do it well we should expect a great blessing Hallelujah right we should because Peter got one by the grace of God hallelujah let's look at the next verse there verse 9 for he was astonished and all that were with him at the draw of the fishes which they had taken Hallelujah so here when when he sees a miracle he's humbled and he calls himself a sinful man Hallelujah so we we want to just remember here that that God is faithful Hallelujah if we can yield ourselves uh Peter learns a lot of great lessons here he learns at the beginning that Jesus has power over fish Jesus has power over nature Hallelujah he learns a good lesson Jesus can provide when I've exhausted all my efforts and I've tried to provide I've tried to do what's right and when I fail Jesus can fill in for my mistakes Jesus can give me strength in weakness there it is amen hallelujah he can give me strength when I'm weak Hallelujah he can provide when there seems to be no provider Hallelujah so he has to learn this great lesson here as a a young fisherman here we'd say a young uh apostle of the Lord Jesus Hallelujah now we want to look at another here's another great one in John 6:68 another one of his famous lines that we've said many times John 6:68 now in in the in the context Jesus preaches about how his his his body is the bread his blood is the wine and 70 preachers scratch their head and say uh we don't can't understand this you speak hard things and then in verse 66 70 preachers leave Jesus right so he had at least 82 preachers following him 70 left right and then Jesus turns around and says do you want to go also remember that Jesus gave him a great test what if Jesus came to you today and said do you want to leave the church too like like all these other people that have left do you want to leave too right see it shows us that there's going to be times when God tests our faith but how many want to pass the test Hallelujah when the test comes we want to be able to pass it by the grace of God and here I love it here Peter passes the test amen he sees 70 preachers leave because they can't understand Jesus's preaching he watches 70 men walk away and then Jesus says do you want to go to Jesus was not a baby preacher he wasn't a Tickler of the ears he asked his inner people so that' be me asking our inner church do you want to leave today do you want to go now you can't because you're my son right but asking the adults do you want to go and he makes these marvelous words he says to whom shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life Hallelujah he'd seen it operate on him remember Jesus told him who his dad was right told him he's changing his name Peter must have he must have wanted to be a rock he must have knew he was kind of on shifting Sands in his life right he just wanted to be solid he wanted to believe in God dad had told him about the Messiah all these years he just wanted to be sure is this really God or not and Jesus told him yes I am he said you've said right Hallelujah let's go to Matthew 16 I'm kind of jumping ahead of myself amen back to Matthew 16 verse1 16 then go to verse 17 Thou Art the Christ son of living God verse 17 and Jesus answered said to him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood ha not revealed unto thee this is an excellent point if a man talks into believing Jesus then another man or woman can talk you out of it but if God reveals it to you nobody can talk you out of iten and that's what Peter had now later now remember Church in a few years he would deny Jesus but not forever amen hallelujah you might have a struggle for a couple days but God's going to restore you Hallelujah you might have a difficult few days or weeks or months or something like that but if you're a child of God you are going to come back to Jesus hallelujah amen so Jesus gives us this great compliment Flesh and Blood didn't reveal this to you but my Father which is the spirit Jesus said that God is a a spirit and they that worship Him worship Him in spirit and Truth he said but my Father which is in secret which is in heaven hallelujah hallelujah the father had revealed this to so the God is the spirit so the spirit of God had revealed to Peter this is the Christ we've been waiting for him for 4,000 years and he's here Church no wonder he dropped his Nets and said fine I'm going to leave all my funding now who's going to take care of his wife and children in that system they just had to the the Jewish Community just had to come around and help them well I got a little bit of money I can share a little bit of fish here he left his wife and maybe children just in that condition just to be uh just to be uh at the mercy of the other Jewish families in the community but see God called him to that sacrifice and church don't you know God was going to reward him in his family amen it turned it came out to be really handy when his mother-in-law was dying of a fever and Jesus comes down and lays his hand on her and instantly she got up I've never seen a person get up from a fever like that but that's how Jesus operated amen you're laying down lays hands on her get up Hallelujah Peter had seen that Hallelujah right they that uh believe in prophets get a prophet's reward Jesus said hallelujah amen thank God Amen so there although there was suffering and there was tests and trials along with being a disciple of Jesus there were so many benefits Hallelujah I'll say this eternal benefits hallelujah amen and Peter got to to see these benefits verse 18 and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock now people misunderstand what The Rock is it's the Revelation that the father gave to je to to Peter because that's what he said he said he Flesh and Blood didn't reveal to you the father delivered reveal it to you amen the rock is the Revelation amen the whole church is built upon Revelation amen and what does that mean it's not built on education because we see a lot of churches today they're built on education go to Seminary you have to forgive me I didn't go to Seminary but I went I went to God's spirit and I got the Holy Ghost praise I went to The Upper Room amen I got the Holy Ghost that's what that's all that matters praise God but so many churches today they have the education but then they allow such Wicked sins in the church whereas you can't even recognize it it's the same church of the Lord Jesus from the Bible and we've gone over it like the lgbq community but also adultery and fornication and all these other wickedness that doesn't resemble the real Church of God the real Church of God is Holy Peter said Peter said be holy for I'm holy hallelujah amen of course that's when he wrote first Peter the first Epistle of Peter hallelujah oh it's beautiful Upon This Rock see see the church is built upon the revelation of Jesus now some people say it's built upon Jesus well I agree but it's the revelation of Jesus you got to have a revelation of Jesus hallelujah amen right CU every everybody says well I believe in Jesus or A lot of churches say I believe in Jesus all these things but you have to have a revelation so what the gates of hell do not Prevail against you amen amen that's what we need a revelation for hallelujah we're going to see the gates of hell were against Peter many times but thank God the Revelation held him in the midst of his trials and church it'll hold you in the midst of your trials amen it's the revelation of the Holy Spirit of who Jesus is we know Jesus is the Risen Messiah today amen that's right Hallelujah so here we see two of the greatest confessions of Faith come from Peter because he's got the keys to the kingdom remember Jesus called it he also said it's the key of knowledge right and he said oh Pharisees you got the key of understanding but you're keeping those out that are trying to get into the kingdom of God see so the knowledge that that uh the knowledge that Peter had the key was the revelation of Jesus Christ remember on the day of Pentecost Peter took that key they said how do we get in the Kingdom G uh Peter and Peter said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Church did the key open the door 300 people walk through that door Hallelujah I'm sorry 3,000 3,000 people walk through that door Hallelujah I'm a little tired tonight that's why I'm messing up my number so it's a long it's been a long week amen woke up at 450 on Monday it's just been it's been a busy busy week this week Hallelujah so forgive me for my little mistakes but 3,000 people he put the key in the door of Salvation and 3,000 walked through that's the door we want to walk through Hallelujah if you haven't been baptized be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins amen hallelujah that's the first Bible verse I really memorized was Acts 238 so if you haven't memorized that one it's time to memorize that one Hallelujah so he's got the keys and then remember that was Acts chapter 2 but remember Acts chapter 8 he also uh uh open the door to the Samaritans they got baptized and they got the Holy Ghost the Bible said they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Hallelujah so Peter opened the door to the Jews the Samaritans they were half Jew and Gentile Jews consider them Mong girls you know uh but they wouldn't worship together like in John chapter 4 Jesus and the woman at the well there but Peter opened the door to them God would accept them God will accept all those who repent and are baptized hallelujah amen that really want to serve Jesus and then Acts chapter 10 was was one of the most amazing ones Jesus gave Peter three visions and each time Peter said no Lord not so he told the Holy Spirit no three times he said rise kill and eat no Lord I've never eat that rise kill e no Lord rise kill e no Lord and then finally after three times God gives him the Revelation Church it proves you'll get the Revelation in the right time and season praise God Amen you can't work your way oh I'm really going to get a revelation this Wednesday night I'm really really I'm finally going to get it no you got to wait on God Church wait on God for the Revelation and God will drop it into your heart Hallelujah you got to receive it you can't reject it you have to receive the revelation of who Jesus is the true water baptism the True Church the true Holy Spirit Hallelujah that points us back to the word of God hallelujah oh that's right amen I'm getting happy now Glory the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it so he opened the door to the Gentiles in Acts chapter 10 at the house of Cornelius and the Bible said they went and got baptized in the name of the Lord they got the Holy Ghost before they were baptized praise God they said who can forbid water that these having received the Holy Ghost uh should not be baptized like all the others so Peter commands them go be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah what a beautiful story amen now I'm going to try to move on here by God's grace now Peter had a lot of great uh experiences he was uh we would say a very spur of the moment person now the wives don't have to say Amen but any of your husbands kind of spur the moment they'll just drop everything and go do something you don't have to say Amen sisters or how many brothers your wives are kind of spur the moment they'll just drop anything and go do something else that's kind of how Peter was he was just whatever came to his mind he was zealous about it he would just do it now it it it it was it was a struggle at sometimes but later it turned into a great blessing Hallelujah in other words what seem to be our weaknesses God can make our strengths praise God am if we just stay with the word just stay with the Revelation stay with the word of God stay in prayer stay in repenting stay in feeding on the word if you just stay in that realm God's going to make you strong God's going to make you stable he's going to set your feet on a rock hallelujah oh I've seen it in my life you've seen it in your lives Hallelujah this is what Peter experienced many times there was the spur of the moment remember Matthew 14:28 we know this about walking on water praise God this was a man that walked on water could you pull that up there and Jesus and Peter said to him Lord if it be if it be thou bid me to come unto thee on the water see Peter often gets negativity because he sank but as we know at least he walked on the water who had that idea first who had the idea of like wow anything's possible am I I could walk out to the Lord amen who had that Peter he was gonna and he he and he already had the keys to the kingdom praise God he was Kingdom Minded God help us have people that are kingom minded amen just in that moment like what was it in that moment I mean the storms are raging it's dark I mean Jesus looks like a ghost walking on the water which of us would have thought I want to walk out there that means he was praying right he was praying he was focused on God he was meditating he was staying in the spirit and he had this lead this spur of the moment brother that's what brother Braham calls it a spur of the moment in other words inspiration that strikes you praise God Amen sometimes the inspiration will strike you and you'll just say something and you know it's God well that's what happened here he said Lord if it's you invite me to come out and we know Peter walked out now we know he got his eyes off uh he got his eyes off Jesus that's a great minor keep your eyes on Christ right we've heard it for I've heard it all these years it's true we got to keep our eyes on Jesus that's when we fall is when we stop looking at the word of God we start looking at circumstances of Our Lives that's what we need in 2024 we got election coming up we got two Wars around the world we got hurricanes we need to keep our eyes on Jesus Christ amen right no matter what happens no matter the struggles we have to keep our eyes on Jesus Christ and then you've heard it too I just heard this this week too that it perhaps you know the he said Lord save me perhaps he walked right back on water to the boat like so some people forget about that it's very possible he walked out sank but then walked back so it looks like twice he walked on water right I mean that's that's a man of Faith Hallelujah that's a man Jesus is going to use to birth the church a man who believes in the impossible amen hallelujah this is such a a a blessing to look at the life of St Peter now here we're going to look at another one where the spur of the moment but it's not so much the right inspiration Matthew 17 verse4 you know know this Jesus invites three preachers uh Peter James and John up to mount Transfiguration right and then later he tells him don't tell this Vision until after I'm raised from the dead after the resurrection Direction you know the story they get up there and the Bible said they saw a vision so God gives a vision to Peter James and John they see a vision Jesus is instantly transformed into shining like the sun and there's Moses and Elijah the Bible said Elijah Moses talk to him about Calvary I imagine they went over the scriptures like here's this is all just to assure him to help him to get through Garden of Gethsemane right right and there's Moses he's in the promised land he never some people say never got oh yes he got in amen it was just about 1500 years later amen but he got in amen glory to God Amen and Peter sees it and now Peter in the spur of the moment he's got a vision brother Levi he's breaking a vision now we would think if we're in a vision we would say exactly right right we'd say exactly what was the right thing and Peter we' say Peter drops the ball in this one he said let us build three Tabernacles because of this place and the Bible said while he's talking God over Shadows him God interrupts him right in other words Peter not the right thing to say wrong time right right and brother said it was kind of like building of denomination let's build this denomination right here he said it was the same thing as cor and Dayan that's what the prophet said right that that that denominational Spirit right well we got to build a building we got to make a uh we got we got got to make a corporation an organization and the Bible says while he yet spake a bright Cloud overshadowed them and a voice said this is my beloved Son and whom I'm well Pleasers please hear ye him in other words don't hear Peter In This Moment hear Jesus In This Moment In other words Peter stop planning on this big all these three big buildings just follow Jesus Hallelujah but people what what do people want a big building it's got to be a big church or it's got to be a big home or God's not in it well I'm sorry God stopped this one right here it would have been it would have been a pretty reverent thing to build right right three big buildings for Moses uh Elijah and Jesus that's that's pretty good but God said no it's about hearing Christ amen at this time this ain't the time to build that was back in Solomon's day amen that was a thousand years ago amen Now's the Time Glory Now's the Time not to build a natural Church Now's the Time to build the spiritual church Hallelujah and forgive me sister Carri sometimes I shout too much and what I mean is I shout too much and the next day my throat hurts I can barely talk I just got to control myself I've been telling the Lord for many years Lord help me help me to control myself but see here look so we see uh the spur of the moment Sometimes good sometimes not so good Hallelujah here's another one uh this was after the resurrection John 21:7 you know a man was shouting from the shore oh cast your nets on the other side so Peter and John did that and they got a great uh draw or they got a great uh uh Gathering of fish fish and John said it's the Lord now I like what Peter does he puts on clothes when he goes to see Jesus that's what most churches don't do especially the women they strip down and then they go to church that's the wrong thing to do and the church said the Bible said women should wear modest clothes I was seeing it when I was in the Assemblies of God I'm like why are these women dressed like that look like they just went to a worldly dance the Bible said so he had he had his outer garment on when he went to see Jesus he put on clothes Hallelujah God help us amen right people they they read this and they don't even think about that but that's what 1 Timothy 2:9 said Paul told the women be modest in your clothing right be modest remember uh uh I think it's after we'll read this after that therefore the disciple whom Jesus loves to Peter it is the Lord now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he G his Fisher coat into him for he was naked and they cast himself in the sea so he just had his tunic on the tunic was kind of like a t-shirt a long t-shirt uh down to the about The Shins and it was just like a t-shirt that's what it was but it probably had like holes for his arms or whatever you know and with that t-shirt he was naked naked in other words he was immodest you could see some of his uh body parts so he put on a coat but look it's the spur of the moment oh there's Jesus I'm putting clothes on and I'm going to go swim to him I want to get to him as fast as I can and when he got there uh they had to make sure it was him and he said give me some give me some bread or give me give me some some meat give me some fish Hallelujah and he ate the fish but here's another spur of the moment nobody else jumped out of the boat it was Peter there he goes jumping out of boats again there right walking out of boats jumping out of boats this guy he just moves he's just got to do something sound familiar to anybody in here I've got to go do this I gotta do the I gotta do that seemed like a like brother M said shifting Sands or what do they call it shifting winds you know just one from one thing to the next constantly moving sometimes it work out sometimes it didn't work out Hallelujah see but double-mindedness you know we we see it sometimes sometimes uh we struggle with the right thoughts right uh Peter said let's build Tabernacles that wasn't really what God was looking for at that moment Hallelujah now let's go back to Matthew 16:22 I'm I'm kind of a little bit jumping around so you have to pardon me how am I doing on time okay about 35 minutes here's another one wow this is such a reminder to us now remember earlier in the chapter Jesus said who who do men say that I am and Peter says Thou Art the Christ Jesus said you've got the keys and you got a revelation from the father and the Gates of Hell won't Prevail against you just in a few sentences later Jesus pulls him aside and said listen I've got to go give my life I've got to die and but I'm going to be raised I'm G to be given to the hands of the Gentiles but I'll be raised from the dead verse 22 then Peter took him and began to rebuke him imagine rebuking God Church don't think bad at Peter sometimes we get mad at God too when God doesn't do what we want him to do God how could this person pass away how could I lose this money how could I how can I lose my job and we started saying God what what's wrong what God you're wrong no God's never wrong right we're the ones who need our minds changed so see let's not let's not bash Peter I'm not bashing Peter Peter will be a million times of Christian I'll ever be that's for sure but look at him you know in this he just got the keys and look what he says he says the wrong thing and he begins to pull him aside right M stand up I always use you let me pull let me pull you aside Jesus Jesus you're not going to go die okay I've got the keys no he didn't say that he said be it far from you this you not it's not going to happen what does Jesus say thank you buddy he said he said this to Peter so he looked at Peter I'm not going to say to you he said Peter he said get thee behind me Satan now all the all the all the disciples saw this he just gave him the keys and now he calls him the devil what kind of what what kind of ministry is this the devil has the keys but see they they had to realize he was speaking spiritually he wasn't speaking to that individual he's speaking to that wrong anointing on the individual right the individual was going to be saved he was a real man of God a real believer but he was just IM mature at that point just saying things impulse no no no no way no way we've seen too many miracles no way no no Lord no no telling God no now Church we're all guilty like I'm saying I'm not bashing Peter but we all do it sometimes sometimes we think God it should have went this way why didn't go my way I thought I thought you said this I thought this I thought that your thoughts don't matter my thoughts don't matter what matters is God's grace amen God giving us the grace to go through our lives and the struggles of life and still praise Him amen he says the Peter I said it to Peter Satan Satan you are an offense unto me for Satan you don't Savor you don't enjoy love the things that be of God but those be of men so Peter was thinking long term he was thinking three big Tabernacles right he was he just had this natural thought oh like it we saw later in the in the gospels will at this time Lord will at this time you rest the Kingdom of Israel he was thinking another uh big Solomon Temple you know he was thinking all these promises about the Millennium and and the the church age hadn't even started yet he was 2,000 years ahead of the thing right because we're coming up on 2,000 years of church ages right right we're coming up on that I think it was what 19 something we're almost there by God's grace so see again the spur of the moment he goes from one moment to saying wow Lord's really blessed me I got the keys and I got I got real Revelation I'm going to be the leader of the church nobody else got the keys hallelujah praise God you know and then Jesus says Get Behind Me Satan right so we see this can can everybody see the double-mindedness here I can walk on water well no I can't uh I got the Keys of the Kingdom Jesus you don't have to go die Satan get behind me right there's just these these incredible highs and lows in his life can everybody see that by God's grace Church why am I saying this so it connects to you you know I've had different people tell me over the years you know a couple Brothers called me one time crying not from our church but they said brother Jesse I I said this certain thing and did I blashe the Holy Ghost and is God ever going to forgive me and I said of course God's going to forgive you look you've already got saved you're Sanctified you're filled with the Holy Ghost yes you might have said something awful but in your heart did you really mean that no so we would say the same thing about Peter in Peter's heart did he really mean if Peter would have known the plan of the Cross amen and how the cross broke every uh every demon power over the church and the power that would flow into the church would Peter have ever said that of course not right so what is it God forgives our ignorance God forgives our our ignorance God knows like the Bible said he pies us like children in the Book of Psalms right he remembers we're just dust Hallelujah he doesn't punish us as much as we deserve Hallelujah he chasen us I guess maybe the better word he doesn't chasen us as much as we really deserve it but Peter had to battle this double-mindedness we see it also now this is a good one too um in John chapter 13:8 I mean they're all good they're all good examples John 13:8 this is of course uh the night of the Lord's Supper The Last Supper Peter say to him Thou shalt never wash my feet now look at this statement Lord you'll never wash my feet uh that was kind of a Spur the- moment thing wasn't it now Jesus had already served him the bread the wine he'd already leaned into John and say John asked him who the who's the betrayer going to be and remember just a few moments before that the Bible said all the apostles or disciples thought is it me is it me is it me so Peter just wondered is it me is it me then the Lord said no it's the one who I give the bread to and then he missed that they they misunderstood even that then a few moments later Jesus takes off his garment so among among men that must be okay he washes their feet or he goes on to wash his feet and says no Lord he says you'll never wash my feet never never but within a few moments he's fully washed he goes from never to fully never to yes right now amen hallelujah see the double-mindedness of of a man like Peter who's strong willed and he was raised amongst this Roman environment and raised to work for a living and just had to do it and just had to to bring the fish in and provide for the family and pay heavy taxes and look like he was trapped in his life but that attitude that that type of mindset that type of mentality if it was properly channeled would be used for the kingdom of God hallelujah to start the church amen that's the kind of uh personality Jesus chose God chose to start the church someone with a lot of mistakes kind of like your pastor amen or your favorite preacher or whoever you know who who whoever you look up to right whoever you might look up to or whoever might be a leader or speaker anyone who might be a a some type of a well-known Christian I'm not well known that's what I'm saying but just a leader in the church you know they have mistakes but God's grace is there every time to forgive them and give them a fresh start praise God if they'll stay true to God God will make them stronger In the End Amen they have to come back to God though right what did Satan want what Satan wanted to Peter to just run away and never come back but we're so glad Jesus came looking for Peter amen hallelujah that's right Jesus came looking for his disciples because all the disciples had scattered like sheep Smite the shepherd and the Sheep will be scattered the prophecy said but the great Shepherd went looking for them Church don't you know he comes looking for you too when you're straying when you're wandering off and you're not where you should be who comes looking for you the great Shepherd the Lord Jesus I see so many parallels of course in our lives I can't get to all of them here tonight but I'm going to close with this I'm coming up on my hour or my 45 minutes so yeah I'll try to preach an hour okay all right let me set that timer okay I'm coming up on my 45 minutes um now think on on this all this H all these things are happening on the same night now the night of Jesus's arrest think of the double-mindedness here at first you know he's having the supper with the Lord he's wondering am I the betrayer oh no I'm not oh thank God you're not going to wash my feet wash all of me uh it just it's just constant change you know just try trying he's trying his best praise God church we would have done the same thing praise God we would have done the same thing we you and I would have been the Dy Thomas right we're we're not bashing these these men these are Mighty Men of God like I said I would say I'm the least in the Kingdom but these are Mighty Men of God hallelujah but we see here that uh it becomes a very difficult situation here this night because as soon as uh as soon as they get done with feet washing the Bible said they sing A Hymn and they go out to the Garden of Gethsemane remember what happened there Jesus said I need to pray he said you he said you uh it would have been eight you eight stay there Peter James and John come with me I need your prayers think about that if somebody in your life really needed prayer would you be able to intercede for them I actually forgot something before this before they left remember uh Jes or Jesus said uh no Peter said he said Lord he said I would die for you he said I'll never deny you and Jesus said before the crows three times I'm Sor yeah you'll deny me Thrice before the crows you'll deny me Thrice now look there there there's that spur of the moment right the wrong one that false confidence he's so confident I've had communion ever feel like that when you come out of communion sometimes I feel like that I'm on the mountain oh I got I got communion with my Lord I'm on the mountain amen he's just had communion he's Washed by Jesus I'll never I'll die for you within a matter of a few feet right maybe a few yards he goes out to the Mount of Olives and he can't even pray he falls asleep and Jesus goes back and said can you pray with me yeah I'll try to I'll try to break through tonight Lord I try to break through sometimes we have trouble breaking through too don't we and then by the time he's like well just sleep on get your rest right I can't even my closest disciples can't even pray for me but yet he just said I'll die for you then we know the story Judas comes kisses Jesus betray us thou uh your Master with a kiss what does Peter do shink he's he's had communion he's washed he's ready to he's ready to manifest what he spoke in there right he he spoke oh I'm I I'll die for you and look Church in all of his Zeal right his Zeal eats up his wisdom he says I'm gonna I'm gonna protect my Lord I'm going to protect my master and he cuts off his ear he misses thank God he missed that sounded like Moses killed a man David killed a man that same battle that we have as men right to protect or to rule or to uh just to be strong to have our way to to to kind try to back up our claims and yet he even fails in that and then Jesus heals malus's ear and says don't you know Peter those who take the sword Die By The Sword even in that moment so see and mind he's like this sword is going to help my Lord and Jesus said no no so see again double mindedness no you need the sword of the word amen that's the sword we need Hallelujah the sword of the word of God hallelujah it's not so much the the gun that we have it's the faith that we have so see again this double-mindedness a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways so see how Peter was unstable no you're not okay yes you can wash me uh I'll die for you and then I we see this no he doesn't my Matthew 2669 Peter comes to The Darkest Hour of his life think of the darkest time of your life hopefully you're past it I'll say like that but you might not be the darkest hour is life Matthew 2669 now Peter sat without in the palace so he's kind of in like the Courtyard outside of the palace when Jesus is going on trial and a damsel came unto him and said thou was with Jesus of Galilee next verse but he denied before them all so everybody heard it I know not I don't know what you say You're With Jesus I don't know what you're talking about just a few hours maybe an hour later two hours earlier he just said I'll die for you see the double mindness and of course we know Peter got Grace but this is his Darkest Hour See sir Church the devil puts some of us under such condemnation sometimes we need to remember God is rich in Mercy if anybody had a right to feel condemned it was Peter you've heard it before Judas denied him once Peter denied him three times right Judas just did it with the pH es there in the Sanhedrin Peter did it in front of this whole crowd right here and Judas never denied that he knew him he just sold him out for money Peter denies he even knows him I don't I don't know who he is I don't know and he gets more and more mad as it goes on right at verse uh 71 and when he was gone out into the porch another made song so these these little girls these little foxes spoil the vine right right these little these little little tender girls a big Burly fisherman who's scared of nothing he's walked on water he's got the keys to the kingdom my goodness he's seen Miracle upon Miracle upon Miracle because of the threat of arrest the threat of arrest brother ram calls us he lacked real Christian Courage how many want courage for the days ahead I do Church they've this administ ation has banged down the doors of Christians they've locked up Christians just for praying outside of abortion clinics would you be willing to do that would you keep the faith I'm talking about real Christian Courage now I'm I'm not talking about playing church this is the moment of arrest possible death he just said a few hours ago I'll die for you and now he's shying away from that double-minded he's unstable because of what the pressure of fear but God does not give the spirit of fear but a power love and a sound mind my prayer tonight is that God would help me to be ready if if he if he calls me to go to a moment like this that I would keep the faith that I'd have real Christian Courage Hallelujah and be able to stand in the midst of any Obstacle of any threat our faith would stand and we would not deny the Lord Jesus the made saw him and said to them this fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth next verse and again he Deni with an oath I give my oath I do not know the man I promise I don't know the truth about God's word I don't know the message I I'm not associated with William Bram right right or if you live in the days of Martin Luther I'm not associated with Martin Luther I don't I don't know anything about John Wesley right no I don't know anything about isry I I don't believe in miracles you know that's how people would do it today right same thing but we're not ashamed of what we believe we believe the Bible God's real Hallelujah God's word cannot change Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah praise God Amen that's right again he denied I give a oath I don't know the man verse 73 three and after a while came unto him they that stood by and said to Peter surely surely you're one of those see they knew he denied it twice already he said for thy speech be rathy you talk like a Galilean you got that akran accent some of you got I know our sisters got that English accent right we love that sister we love that verse uh 74 then began he to curse and to swear now he starts cursing and swearing I know not the man and immediately the crew could there be any more embarrassing moment for the man who held the keys to the kingdom I'll say like this for the pastor of the church that's why I start crying like oh God keep me from this I don't want to I don't want to deny Christ no matter what you allow in my life God help me to be faithful help me not to deny the Jesus who saved me the Jesus who loves me who healed my mom of cancer when I was 8 years old and she's alive today done the Miracles that you and I have seen the healings we've seen the dreams we've had that have come to pass the prophecies and God has given us God help me to never deny the Jesus who loves me and who loves us hallelujah the Jesus who loves you God don't let me deny you I want to be true I want to say yes I know Jesus yes I believe the Bible every word of it Hallelujah yes I believe in the Supernatural this the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit yes I believe in the pre-tribulation Rapture Hallelujah yes I believe God's one person hallelujah amen yes I believe the Roman Catholic Church is the mother Harlot yes I believe that Hallelujah yes I believe William brandham was a prophet of God yes I believe Martin Luther John Wesley and uh William Seymour and William brandham restore the church Hallelujah yes I believe that verse 75 and Peter remembered the word of Jesus which said to him before the Crow Thou shalt deny me Thrice and he went out and wept bitterly oh my so finally all his all his double-mindedness all his shifting catches up to him and he realizes look what I've done look what I've done I've sworn on it I've cursed on it I wonder what he cursed I wonder if he cursed the day he was born now we look at that as a cuss word but is that a cuss word I don't know or was he cursing something else somebody else I don't I don't know was he cursing the followers of Jesus I don't know but he cursed he cursed and swore and gave Oaths that it was not that he wasn't a part of it he denied it but yet did Jesus leave him no ma'am no sir Jesus let him go through the next that was Thursday night right Thursday night Friday Saturday and into Sunday Jesus let him go through we'd say parts of four of the hardest days of his life remind you of anybody Jonah three days and nights in the belly of the whale because of what Disobedience all these foreshadows of Peter that's a foreshadowing of Peter amen oh but on that third day hallelujah amen on that Sunday Jesus rose and he showed himself first to women because they weren't ashamed to go to the Cross amen I thought the sisters would say a little amen a little louder on that one by God's grace God bless you I'm just joking but it was sisters that were faithful that went to the cross the men ran like a bunch of uh eaglets I'll say it like that or Lambs I'll say it Lambs brother I don't want to say chickens they're not chickens they're Eagles they're Lambs they W they ran like a bunch of lambs but the women stayed there and then the Bible said sometime after that morning then the Bible said he appeared to sephus and by the night time he was gathered up there and then he appeared in the midst and Peter got to see him another time so he got to see him twice on Resurrection Sunday today Amen Hallelujah Jesus personally visited Peter to show him I'm alive Hallelujah so see Church in the midst of your mistakes stay with God if we if you feel condemned confess that sin don't let the devil condemn you you're forgiven if you confess the Bible said God forgives you of all unrighteousness and he cleanses you and you walk in the Light of Christ as he's in the light Hallelujah there's cleansing power in the name of of Jesus Christ amen for the awfulest thing you could think of any guilt the enemy might put on you there is Mercy he even denied him he was the leader he was the one who knew Jesus so intimately one of those three inner uh disciples who had the most intimate relationship with Christ brother BR made that statement he lacked real Christian Courage God helped us to have real Christian Courage because most of us our faith hasn't been tested like Peter's was now some of them i' I've always told amen's great testimony he was tested because his dad kicked him out of the church if you're going to go to that church um you can't live here and his face did that test that's a great test most of us haven't been kicked out of our homes for believing the truth but our brother's face did the test that's right revi yeah let's say let's all say praise the Lord can we praise the Lord that's right that's right family reject you but that's what Jesus said I come to bring division in the family that's what he said I turn a father against a son Allelujah a son against a mother right a daughter against a mother-in-law and so forth I don't come to bring peace I come to bring a sword to divide who's the Sheep amen hallelujah who's the goats Hallelujah that's what the word of God does I'm trying to finish up here sorry that real Christian Courage he says Peter he was good with his sword when Jesus got in trouble he pulled out his sword he could flop any way cut the high priest he cut his servants uh ear off with a sword but when it come to real Christian Courage Peter didn't have it he was good with his sword he could duel he said as good as anybody but when it when it come to spiritual courage he didn't have it so he failed right there he said but brother after he went up to Pentecost he put on the whole armor of of God Amen he got the real sword let's say the real sword ready the real sword he had the sword but it was the wrong sword Hallelujah it was a sword of man and I'm trying to figure this out and this is about my physical strength as a man but he needed the sword of the word and that's what we have if we eat the book then the sword comes into our mouth hallelujah amen he got the full armor of God when he went up to Pentecost so what do we learn again if we want real power real courage we must be filled with the Holy Ghost saved is good you get saved just like Peter Peter got saved but then he got the Bible Jesus said he prayed Lord sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth he prayed that in John 17 so we know 50 days later Jesus's prayer was answered Peter got more Sanctified he got separated unto God and then he got the Holy Ghost he was filled with the Holy Ghost that's what we need today the real Holy Ghost we need a deeper walk with God more experience with God more power in our lives how many need more power amen oh yes my hands up too so I'm going to close now by God's grace friends remember my notes are kind of scattered here so pardon me here Peter had seen all these things he'd seen the the Miracles he'd seen walking on water he'd seen the storms he'd seen all these things but it when it came down to the threat of arrest he showed he didn't have the power he needed so Jesus had to come and talk to him about forgiveness right he said Peter do you love me what what' Peter say he said yes Lord I love you what' he say feed my sheeps right feed my sheep sorry he said Peter do you love me yes Lord feed my sheep Peter let me ask you one more time do you love me and I love what Peter said he said Lord you know all things Hallelujah you know I love you he said then feed my sheep now look the very next thing what does he do he flips back to that double-mindedness again he said oh what about John what's John going to do and Jesus said John's gonna do whatever he wants don't worry about John you put your eyes on me see that see how men see how men are Levi smile me too buddy sometimes I go from that to that and I'm like I got I try to go with the spur of the moment sometimes it works out sometimes it doesn't but God is gracious God is merciful we need the faith faith of God and in closing remember this is the man that after he got the Holy Ghost he put the key into uh he put the key of faith into the day of Pentecost 3,000 people got saved nobody else has that said about them but Peter 3,000 Souls but yet had a suffer through the shame of I denied him I couldn't stand up for Jesus to for a few little girls no doubt that the devil brought that all that into his mind right but then God gave him so much Faith he walks by a paralyzed man and said such as I have I give to you rise up in the name of Jesus Christ glory amen God filled him with so much power he'd walk by and said if I can just get in the shadow see now you're in my shadow me think about that if he just walked if someone just put a sick person in the shadow of Peter they were healed praise God that's how much power he got that's what God can do with someone who's yielded now maybe for us it be like that that's a sign of an apostle but church we could lay hands on the sick and they should recover we could speak with new tongues the Bible says hallelujah the Bible tells us these things we could prophesy the Bible said God wants to pour out his spirit and this is what God did with Peter and then God even let him walk into Tabitha's house and pray for a dead woman and God raised her up from the dead hallelujah amen a man or woman that can get their their their personality channeled in into the power of the Holy Spirit God can do wonders with that individual how many want to be used by God tonight let's stand to our feet by God's grace musicians can come Hallelujah I'm sure church if you're anything like me you see yourself in the life of Peter so tonight let's pray that God would give us a single mindedness on the word of God you know maybe some maybe the Lord took me down some of these thoughts because some people will battle condemnation here tonight or like maybe like a thought well God can never forgive you surely God could forgive you the Bible said the blood of Jesus Christ forgives us of all our trespasses a l l all of our trespasses there's nothing too hard for the Lord your mistakes it's not too hard for God my mistakes it's not too hard for God he specializes in forgiving those amen amen he specializes in another chance and then church if we're stay faithful he can use us in Greater ways than we've ever been used before praise God let's bow our hearts here tonight father God we thank you for Lord tonight we thank you for this word that we've heard thank you for the songs that we sang Lord our visitors and uh the church here and the live streamers Lord God we're thankful Lord father we can learn so much from your servant Peter what a wonderful man of God Lord he's just made more real to me these last few days have I've been looking at his life seeing how he battled double-mindedness he was unstable at times Lord then other times he was stable and you used him in Mighty ways especially after Pentecost especially after he was filled with the Holy Spirit Lord God lord look at our lives today Father God we want to be stable Lord God we want to be single minded Lord God Hallelujah Jesus we want to be a v so you can use Lord God so I pray that today Lord God forgive us of any sin Lord God if anyone's battling Lord God a feeling of hopelessness or depression or guilt or shame I pray in Jesus Christ's name they could confess it tonight and Trust in the healing powers the forgiving grace of our Lord as the scripture says he can save to the uttermost is anything too hard for God [Music] thank you Lord for a man like Peter Lord God who could stumble we'd say and make mistakes and yet get back up stay with the word go to Pentecost get the Holy Ghost and be used by God with signs wonders and miracles Lord Jesus father we want to see you move in our midst Lord God Hal Hallelujah Lord thank you for those Miracles you did out in Iowa this summer Lord God that was such a blessing to see that Lord God lord if you want to move Lord God I just pray Lord we let you move Lord by your spirit Lord God we're here we're
