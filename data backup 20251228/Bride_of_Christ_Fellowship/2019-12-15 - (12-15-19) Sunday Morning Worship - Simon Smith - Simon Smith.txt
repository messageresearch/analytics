everything by the grace of God yes just been battling personally myself the last couple maybe three weeks here just a lot of things have changed or like seeing a lot of wars fatalities serious battles on the homefront we're really coming into some things here and we want to emphasize even at all we're coming into some things and we the devil ain't playing games you know we this is a serious time a real serious matter everyone's fighting for their lives this is literally a life and death this is we're talking rapture those up behind either take the mark of the beast or they died for their faith and they have the courage by their own blood not by the blood of Jesus Christ so we're at a serious time they were going the winds are going to start picking up here the winds of doctrines the winds of evil spirits that were coming like a flood but the Bible says that Jesus would raise up a standard for us so I want to get you up seated here let's see if I can dial this in by the grace of God maybe we'll have a PowerPoint maybe we won't a lot of quotes you know how I just I don't know why I like reading and I like to I'm not uh I talked with the brother and I you know and we're discussing discussing the ministry and there we go and and things of that matter and and I knew he was trying to throw some hints my way and some things and and I you're like Paul said to you he said I am what I am you know I watch his you know brother Jesse became the Brooks my real dear Coast brothers in Christ I say the closest I have and those ministers and I watch how they get under the anointing and they're able just to preach and just catch the inspiration of God and maybe I'm just not there yet as far as that I'm still very young as far as ministering but I this is how I am and revelations 13 verse 11 will read this portion right here and I have chosen this subject I we kind of waited I try to wait for something to pop out to preach or teach on and something that happened last week at work and I'm just going to focus on that and we'll go with that by the grace of God in verse 11 and I beheld another beast coming out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon and he exercises all the power of the first beast before him and caused the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed HIDA the great wonders so that he maketh Fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men and he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast we know this is what America this is where we live this is our home country everybody's trying to flee to here but they don't understand they're coming into the greatest trap the greatest deception the world's ever seen and deceive them they had that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the Beast we're at that point right now we're right at where they are going this country is going to push that we need to be governed religiously this is a religious move that they should make an image to the Beast which had the wound by the sword and did live we know that's the Catholic Church and he had power to give life unto the image wouldn't the Catholic Church gave has power to give life to the image of the Beast we know this is the World Council of Churches by the by the prophet right there is a coming and religious uniting should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed there's going to be laws change there's laws coming up things are changing what was a major law we have recently seen in our in our day before our day but the josè may have seen it abortion now is legal back then God getting kicked out of the schools Pledge of Allegiance those things are getting you brother Jose saw those things now we're to the point in our day where we seen now homosexual marriage legalized now children have rights even in my surrounding his coworkers I work with my the secretary at her shop there's a child in the third grade who's already made a decision to switch why because now that child's parents both switched in Woodville Ohio legal absolutely 100% legal we can even slay your own born child almost now born unborn - just a second before you can you can you can kill that abortion fully legal look how these laws of death are coming in and he had power to give unto the image of the beast that's that that the image we should both speak and cause that as many should would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed and he caused all he caused all both small and great everyone rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads what is the saying not everybody's received the whole the mark of the beast check in World International Forum the majority have not decided which way yet they're still lukewarm want to look religious and this or that or however but they've not taken the mark of the beast and then oh man I'm sorry and he calls all small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell save he that hath had that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name here his wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is a number of a man and his number is six hundred threescore and six so say a word of Prayer your father Lord Jesus we just love you lo we thank you so much for your grace and for your mercy and O God you've been faithful Lord since day one Lord you were faithful before time even began God and what we know this is just a great story a love story you've written Lord you've written a script Lord and and Lord you've chosen your actors Lord to play out the parts God though many didn't know what they were doing acting or they're just living life Lord but the Bible says Lord even the Old Testament Saints were did things where they were moved by the Holy Ghost and Lord Jesus will we thank you Lord for that predestinated seed God Lord the very life of God Lord they could come and dictate Lord in our lives or our actions or thoughts Lord I know we love you so much or bless the people god lord we don't want to have any part order this little study God Lord we just pray Lord you would take full control over these vessels or whatever you best won't hear God and Lord we rebuke any unclean spirit in the name of Jesus Christ we bind it right now and command it as you were Lord that you would that there's a devil or any demons Lord would flee out of here they're not welcome here this morning and the name of Jesus Christ or we do that Lord by not any power I have it over but we do it by the authority you've given us or I know we just we don't have to yell and shout or we just speak the word god we believe it Lord because faith is here your faith God we love you so much in a name Jesus Christ amen you may have your seats everybody feeling okay this morning and good and we just want the full leadership of the Holy Ghost it may seem all negative this morning but I'm not we're just putting out warning here warnings and warnings and warnings you know we there's something coming you know I can't get over there just there's a lot of things that's happened were going to share some things this morning and because even though we are as a body here a church we are the members right here of the Bride of Christ fellowship but individually we leave here individually in all Ryan's home and this upcoming week we will be faced by decisions individually thoughts will come into each one of your individual minds things will come upon your your hearts and your minds and you will have to weigh what you're going to do it's not what comes into your mind it's the decisions you make from them it's the actions that come forth from those thoughts and we have a decision we have to be we have to either accept those thoughts check those thoughts reiterate them think on them chew them up a little bit pray on them and then we have to make a decision and then by those decisions we have to live with our decisions so this morning I'd like to teach or maybe the the coming deception and if we had a subtitle would be the mark of the beast just the general over looking at the subject and and weighing things and and examining what the Prophet would say about this this topic and and what the scripture has and I'll be honest you know as Jesus said about you know Judas and the losses he said it's better for them to have never even heard the gospel because the damnation would be greater be greatest you know the three realms and hell there's the I believe the regular then there's a CLE sorry then there's a civil the second realm of civil where the leaders the rulers the kings and presidents if they would fail to make heaven the second round was be civil and that's where they would go but the lowest realm I believe is the prophet talk would be the easy class to go around the lowest parts of the hell which was those who heard the gospel those that maybe preach the gospel like Judas would be in the lowest hell the ecclesiastical realm the top realm would be be for people that we drive pass in the cars and they'd be on their motorcycles just the never even the Holy Ghost never came to him even one time and they never even thought about accepting God or rejecting him all's they know is right into heart Harley's and and and doing drugs and drinking alcohol and things like that they don't know anything about religion but today we're going to talk on the coming deception and as we looked at this before there's something coming this is coming there is coming a time very very shortly here and and I'm kind of shaking you know the last week I I'm just I don't even feel like I'm when I'm work I know my ball might the guy I'm working with notices I'm just kind of audit right now just I feel like a first-year apprentice and I'm grabbing things he's know so I get this I'm like oh yeah that's right grab this and I'm just there's many things that have happened and it's I'm worried so worried for the people so I want to read some quotes here by the grace of God and we'll get into some things but as you go through I was like I want to share this little story as we go into life here these next from this point on I want you to I heard this story and believe it or not I got this off Facebook there's a story and there's this farmer the farmer had his prized horse you know and and the horse was in the stable they're in the stable area and maybe let him a smile maybe shared he heard it and there's this farmer head he had this horse you know when he had a son and one day you know the son sure did love that horse and he wrote it and practiced on it and you know that was his prized horse his buddy horse you know that was like it for me would be a dog and well one night you know there was a windstorm kick up or whatever a tornado however in the gate of the horse pasture or the barn whatever blew open and that horse ran out and it got loose it was gone and they woke up the next morning and the Sun ran out dog daddy where's my horse the farmer said wow I don't know and the neighbor said wow this is a terrible thing this could have happened and the father the farmer heard he says it could be bad or it could be good and then after about two or three days sure enough that horse comes back and he had brought with him a whole a herd of wild horses and he made friends this guess you know tame horses making friends these wild horses and Mustangs and sure enough he you know the horse finally got lonely some and I was eating better over there and he this wild horse or this normal horse brought all this wild pack horses back and they right went we let him right into this pasture and the the sun's all rejoicing and they shut the door and they had a whole herd of horses now and the neighbors like this was the greatest thing that's ever happened and the farmer daddy says well this could be bad or it could be good the father didn't make one call either way he's watching things unfold and one day you know the son was writing to his favorite horse you know and he thought well maybe I got to start breaking in these other wild horses and the son gets up one mounts the saddle on it and starts trying to to get this horse you know all broke in you know and ii told bay em and this and that and the wild horse kicked him off and he broke his leg the farmer's son broke his leg and now he had to get his set by the doctor and and the the neighbor come out and said this is the worst thing that's ever happened this is absolutely terrible and the father though the farmer said well it could be bad or it could be really good i guess what the wait and see two weeks later - the boy breaks his leg le blues in a time of the Civil War Revolutionary War whatever here's some soldiers come looking for 18 year olds 19 year olds to recruit to go to war and the father said this was the best thing that ever happened to me so saints of God no matter what's you hear about what you see about and say oh my goodness this is the worst the most horrible they can't get wait and see because the Bible says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered it may look bad but in the end it's gonna turn out for your good a man so let's get into this I just want to share that because way before you speak anything let's just say maybe it is maybe it isn't we'll see what let's see let's let God decide what's going to happen he'll work this out I know he will now look what the look what the look at the Prophet says here he says but Rome is not going in alone he says her daughters are right with her and she will take over absolute authority by the World Council of Churches this may seem far-fetched to some but actually it is a very plain for all to see because right now the churches are controlling the politics why are these things homosexually all being okay and being passed because it's in the churches later controlling politics he says he says and at the opportune time will manifest exactly how great that control is there's no way the churches are gonna you could ask all the streets that the churches will rule the world they the people are laughing your face and kick dust on your shoes and say get out of here you a fanatic they don't understand that this is a religious move coming he says he says this is so because of revelation 17 states at the Mystery Babylon is seated on the Beast she's controlling the last or a fourth system under her Rome will be controlling and this image church system would be obedience Rome because Rome controls the goal of the world thus all the people will have to belong to the world church system or be at the mercy of the elements for they cannot buy or sell without the mark of the beast in the hand or head right this may be just a refresher okay what is the mark in the head and on the floor and then in the hand the mark in the hand means that they will have to take the doctrine of the world church system which is Trinitarian trinitarianism etc and we come out of that we've come out of that but notice notice how the people who come out many have went back in people you would never even think mighty preachers over the pulpit that stood with the word for 30 40 years have now I went back to this take heed and the mark in the hand which which means to do the will of the world Church so there is coming a temptation and we must not be ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ when push comes to shove we will stand on the Word of God we believe that God is the one person we believe in the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we believe Lord I was like this in in the the dot Lee is these true doctors have become we believe in the truth we believe that God is coming the way he said he would come we believe there is a rapture for those that are filled with the oil right of the Holy Ghost he says he says now look the image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching etc notice when does the mark come when does this great mark come while the bride is still here because remember the the mystery of iniquity will not we will not see the Antichrist rise up perhaps it will be will be gone before then but we will looks as this as these quotes look as we as we've studied the message it looks like we will see this false thing rise up the image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching etc her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and true to the people who need it but before the Antichrist in person takes over this complete world system of churches the true church will be taken away from this world to be with the Lord God will catch his bride away for the great marriage supper of the lamb right and the reason I i-i've kind of wanted to focus on this this is the only thing the Lord really showed me while I was working and that I was and I'll say like this I was measuring I was putting some sensor Wells into these oil pits and their big vats of pits I'm at the train station here working in Willard Ohio and there's these pits of oil where they separate the water in the oil so it wouldn't go and contaminate the the ground or however and I have to put these 4-inch pipes down in the ground or into the into the well there I had to cut the grading and lower him down anchor him into and then set the little flange here but I needed dimensions I had to figure out how deep it was so I could get the right height for the electrician's at I own for their sensor to go in there right so as I as I take my tape measure out and I'm lowering it down into the oil I hit bottom and ice measure up the top here's and okay I need about 12 foot and I had a 12 foot measurement as I pulled the tape measure up guess where the oil mark was at 666 if you know anything about the tape measure there is a portion of that tape measure where it actually has 666 on it and I kind of jump back or like whoa because you know every time that's happened in the job where I've measured over and this this I always move it okay the pipes might not look right this way but you know what I'm moving that's and they may look why did he put it over here well there's a reason why I put it away because we don't want nothing to do with that mark hey man right we want to be what full of the Holy Ghost amen absolutely down not just into the flesh not into the spirit realm also but down into the soul we need the baptism of the Holy Ghost sealed and working its way out pushing into every fiber amen now so as I thought about these things you know I thought about deception and I thought about this thing is coming and the Lord kept showing me that there is a certain blade for a sawzall in the company that come out is called Diablo which is the and in this in this holiday season they had this little sawzall pack I saw this the very next day at Home Depot and in this packet the name was Diablo which we know means devil and Spanish and then in this pack they had three separate compartments and they had six blades of this six blades of that and another six blades of this and I'm thinking I'm looking at something my goodness this thing is coming and then the same day I had this little app on my word and that word for the day was a dilatory saints of God are this thing is like Shiki mean I'm like lord we must be ready we must have the holy the mind of Christ ready to discern the very two spirits within the framework of the church with the spirits out there the spirits out here we must be able I was like this to even discern the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost speaking or is it something else amen now notice how close let me show you like this how even I love how the scripture says this then first Kings 10:1 says and when the Queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord she came to prove him with hard questions and she came to Jerusalem with the very great train and with camels and bear spices and very much gold and precious stones and when when she had was come to Solomon she commune with him all that was in her heart and Solomon told all her questions and there was not anything hid from the king which he told her not you know that Queen was pretty sharply she tried to deceive the king look at what the Prophet said here says and then we come down to human life the characteristic characteristics between man and woman there is a difference he says they're both a human being but the characteristics of the two sexes detect them I was reading some time ago about one of the problems that was put to test Solomon by the Queen that she had some women dressed like men that come with her and Solomon head and what Solomon do he says let him walk and do things and quickly he said those are women so even the days of Solomon he had to discern between a man and a woman to cross-dressing and everything a man and here we are today amen praise God I go to Thailand and they call him at ladyboys and I had the first glance I didn't even recognize it and brother Ron said brother I go what he goes look at the hands here these feminine dressed men Daud up and this and that but they had these big giant hands on not fit for a woman and then as I as I saw him was like whoa so then I turned to speak to one of them for whatever reason and I said put your I didn't say this but in in in Thai god bless yous put chopped pachai way pawn Pichai pawn hello oh and the lady spoke with a man's voice oh my it's getting close see but God has always seen there's nothing new Under the Sun Salman was tested by the Queen of Sheba absolutely many deceptions coming he says now look at the Prophet I like to when brother Jesse called for those special meetings I liked what he was doing there he says now look what the Prophet says if you're if you keep your emic your stomach empty and the blood is at your brain and you must be ready when you're full he says that's the power of fasting when you're full the blood goes to your stomach to digest the food you see and then when you're empty is it's all those new Bloods up in your brain he says so you can just cause them to spirits is so close to deceive the very elect if possible and many times you hear it cry I've heard people shout as I've told you I hope God let me find favor with you today if you believe me I've heard people shout and it wasn't gone in church he's not talking about a baseball game he's not talking about MLB or the NF him he's talking about in church he says I've heard people cry and it wasn't God see and their sympathy sometimes the devil wants to be patted and it takes a real sheep razor to know the difference between the bleed of a goat and of a lamb they're so close together you see he says so they're on this platform you must be very careful can be just one thing as all Satan wants to throw out before the public so they're therefore I have to be fasting prayerful every minute on guard watching for something what's the power of fasting it gets you out of your flesh allows all your blood to your brain and that he says even helps you discern the spirits with them to frame workers with church amen I know I'm full of quotes and scriptures but this is how I teach a man I don't want you to I'm have nothing to do with this I am just reiterating what God has brought to us in this day amen sure and once you look here I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom why am I reading this preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine for the time will come when they shall not endure sound doctrine are we there yes sound doctrine think about every crazy doctrine you hear in this message where do they get these from they're listening to tapes and they catch one quote and they take that one quote maybe two quotes and they plant it they put it to seed they take these quotes at ah there it is something new something fresh and they planted it within their hearts and look what they create look what the what the blossoms forth and this and that every word on the tape says thus saith the Lord no it's not did you ever see what he said the Prophet said in the seventh seal at the end he says don't ever put me in any of this I am just a man full of sin he said he said say by the grace of Jesus Christ full the Holy Ghost obviously he says but don't put me into any of it he said I have nothing to do for the time will come when they not endure sound doctrine but after their own lust show heap up to themselves teachers having itching ears they're gonna buy preachers who preach what they want to hear and that's it if you don't preach what they want to hear you're not getting the invite and they shall turn away their ears shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables you wait till I show you some things here anyhow uh some things in you he said but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of the evangelist make full proof of thy ministry now some of this part I don't understand I'm gonna read this things to ya okay just just hang with me there's a lot of reading here he says but today they don't want to hear a message like that and he's blasting uh women leaving their wives and wives leaving their women he says because when a husband wife being married there are one he says when a when a husband leaves he says they cut the flesh they cook them the wife off at the wife leaves he cuts the flesh she cuts the flesh off the husband off he said but they don't want to hear something like that the people don't want to hear that they want to be tickled in their ears oh my goodness what if I only talk good thing is good things good things I'm not worried about the good things we'll get the good things over there hey man you know your pride I don't have to tell you Brian you should know it by now by the grace of God sure do we have battles absolutely but we must know within our hearts that we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost a man yes he said but they want to be tickled in the ears exactly what the Holy Spirit told me the day I laid the cornerstone they're said to preach the gospel we're gonna jump down said when the vision leaves so he saw a vision the day he laid the cornerstone he saw this vision and then said you read 2nd Timothy 4 so don't forget 2nd Timothy 4 and then the vision left standing right there on the seventh Street a 19 year old boy standing there the voice of God spoke out in the room and he said 2nd Timothy 4 that's exactly what it turned to be see the time will they come will he not endure sound doctrine this planet in where is this vision planet in Brenham Tabernacle yes well though not endure sound doctrine no he says here he says he says but the morning that laid that cornerstone because if you're the spiritual you'll get it because the cry the people if you could break out that out or take the book and read and said he said do the work of the Evangelist don't call me to being a he said didn't call me to be evangelist but said do the work of the evangelist for the time will come with a not endure sound doctrine but he did all those things he quoted that scripture and told me where to find it set up three times and I got the Bible and turned to where he told me and there it was and then you know about - about the two buckets of the Pentecostal oneness and the Pentecostal Assemblies I never crossed them now he's talking about the vision he says I planted there I planted their own trees right where they was because I was thinking though they were both wrong but out of it I was at the cross at the harvest now do I understand this just this vision no cuz he's very vague on it he says now here is when I run down there and seen them two trees he's talking about this vision broke off one here oneness and Trinity I never crossed them I planted them like that then he's seen the fruit fault then he's seen the fruit fall in my hand and then run me to Calvary what is he doing I think my thought on this I'm not saying it's a dusty look my thought is that God told him to go and preach the gospel to everybody and let them believe what they want to believe but if he's sowed seed that he would catch the fruit of it and bring it to the gate I'm saved he drew a circle around all of them because remember what he had to get people there was people he would said that had the Holy Ghost and he said stay in your churches absolutely now let's see here and it left me sitting in my room might even know I was a vision I didn't know what it was called in that day and we're back then I was laying the cornerstone that day of the foundation it's wrote there laying and there in the cope the cornerstone now and said he goes on to this right okay let's see here you remember the other night of the message that he gave me back there when I was laying the cornerstone just exactly to do the work said when you come out of this vision reading 2nd Timothy 4 you know what's laying right there in the corner stone 33 years ago but remember the other night when I met when I never did read the rest of it so remember God gave him this vision he saw this thing with the two groups she'd up be plant trees grab the fruit and brought him to Calvary but now he's thinking he's thinking he says because that scripture only went so far he says I often wondered one day till I seen Jesus pick up the scroll began to read he said a tureen and read half of the prophecy and the stopped and said there in poker poker poker Neum Capernaum he said and this day this prophecy is fulfilled why didn't he read the rest of it it pertains to a second coming see okay everybody follow me I know what kind of okay and there I had to read that not knowing I picked up there I picked up that and there it was right before me as Southern Pines now he's examining his ministry right he went lead the the he had this vision that day he saw this this this he then the spirit said second Timothy 4 he read it and then when he's laying the quarters - he stuck that vision in that prophecy in there and now it's in a cornerstone in jeffersonville right but as his ministry went on he couldn't understand things he says in there I it was right before me at Southern Pines South Carolina that morning standing right there talking to Joseph Bose a leaning up against the sidecar is I struck it he's like this he says Paul said all men has turned against me there's no man with me demas has forsaken me loving this present world and now I look and the coppersmith done done me much harm look what Dimas must have thought in other words he was preaching to all these churches and finally at the end what he is fully rejected but he said but Lord you said in the vision that I would do this and this this but now it's all that favor is gone and now he's bringing he's reading it further he says I don't think Dimas went out into the world because Dimas was one of you know his history was a big rich family and he wanted to go with the rest of the crowd now why am I saying that because look at the rest of the scripture from where he picked up for I am now ready to be offered in my time of departure is at hand if the Prophet would have continued on he would have seen the rest of his ministry that he would be taken off the scene and that Dimas would forsake him he says what I and what the Prophet could go home is saying what I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there's a lane up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not me only but unto all them that love his appearing do thy diligence to come shortly unto me for demas heifer shake shake in me having loved this present world and where is he where did he go that's Salonika yeah Thessalonica that's the first star that is the firt message of the first church age and demas forsaken and right and what the Thessalonica in the seventh we're to demas go he stayed in Laodicea what was Paul's 7th Church he wrote to Thessalonica in the 7th the 7th letter that the first messenger wrote was to Thessalonica and that's where demons fell and Wednesday for shouting whether the Dimas of this day would fall a lot in the seventh church age as well it's a recorder there was a rich city full of wealth material goods yeah hey man there it is Romans Galatia Colossians I'm sorry Corinthians Galatians Ephesians Philippians Colossians Thessalonians that's Salonika that's where he fell he didn't go to any of the others he would fall what in the 7th church age in Laodicea of his day he men now let's continue on here what I'm gonna read to you next I have first-hand dealt with I want to tell you how serious this is ok yes I had just had just have dealt with this I seen there was one night there was a boy in a monastery in the days of Saint Martin that he said the Lord made me an old prophet out of the Old Testament did you know that while I am here teaching or another ministers up here preaching that God or I'm sorry that the devil can come and put into your minds that you are something greater or something more than you're not I could be the I could be the High Priestess mystic and she can walk out here with her golden robe and say look I'm from Hong Kong I am your ambassador I'm here to lead you as our pastor we let us lead and these things but the devil could put this in your mind that you were more than what you are I just dealt with this I learned a lot of lessons here this is a serious thing this is very very serious like and I wish I could say I am one of the old prophets well I cannot be I cannot call the bishops name there of this old little school just a little group out there like I cannot tell his name at this time but he was trained under Martin it didn't sound right just so the rest of the brother and just let him alone hmm just let him alone I guess directly he prophesized that tonight God is coming down and going to give me a white robe to sit among you and you'll know that I'm one of the prophets of the Old Testament brother surely he's off surely this is not going to happen so that night 12 o'clock actually it happened what would you do I am Simeon one of the eldest of the tribes of Israel I'm coming back and Here I am in fact I will sit in one of the twenty-four Thrones around the throne I am one of the four and twenty-four elders Simeon what if I was to go up here and say like that and I said it tonight at midnight I'm going to get such-and-such and you will see I will have this mantle wrapped around me and it happens and I could comb and show your pastor brother Jesse what if it happened whoa Jess - well that's my brother no he should feel clear on my face tear me up you're my older brother but you're still literal little and God Mania small a second spank huh he would test it by the word of God so it actually happened and the boy got a robe they said just as white as it could be he come out said didn't I tell you I prophesied true said now all of you take orders from me I'm the Old Testament prophet you know they will Bishop of that church said well some just doesn't seem right here they just let alone for a little bit and then the inspiration the Holy Ghost came and said you know what take him before Martin Martin was the prophet of the day he was the man of that day and they said they grabbed him by force now actually it went confront him said hey we're gonna bring you to Martin he said no I'm not I am commissioned not to stand before margins well what that does exactly what to do that they said that the history says that they grabbed the boy and started forcing and as soon as I grabbed into bringing the margin it disappeared but look at the deception it was manifested he did not just make a claim but what he said come the pass it was manifested in the flesh that that robe and it was a white hmm deception false teaching now what that that first instance I just read to you that just happened and the second one I'm reading to you just happened as well at the same time Martin said Satan appeared to at one time great golden crown on three or four decks of stars on it like this glistening beautiful great big fellow nice handsome correctly combed and groomed the the great beautiful robe on and his shoes on his feet was gold walk down said Martin do you know me this just happened okay this just happened I've been acquainted with these two things just happening at the exact same time this just happened while someone was preaching Martin do you know me now people that don't see visions this might not this might you might not understand it see but how things come to you in different spirits he says and how deceiving they are the Bible said they would be they were deceived a very elected if it was possible see the elected that's those that are predestinated born for that purpose see see so he come to his elected Martin was the elected what angel of God for his day he said Martin do you know me I am Christ he said will you recognize me Martin hesitated could be bad it could be good what is this what is this seemed strange he waited a minute and said again he said don't you see me I am Christ do you recognize me he said that three or four times to him Martin said Satan I know you my lord is not crowned yet but his Saints will crown him there is a word back what if these two things would take place in this church right now would you be able to discern it because it's already happened one time recently weird a very deceptive age and if you do not know your word if you will believe anything that comes your path you'll be deceived unless you are the elected of God and how many here believe they are elected of God we all believe that email we believe that Jesus Christ is going to keep us as he held those seven stars in his right hand he is gonna hold you all the way into the rapture amen praise God we believe that we cannot be shaken by that saints of God I believe your pastor my Oh pastor has taught us good enough to rely on the word and the word alone which is also the Holy Ghost amen yes because Satan will bring the word as well but it will take the Holy Ghost to discern Amen so I have experience with these things right here and it's very dangerous now looking for for one I just want to read this because it's very this is very bad I just you know first John just beautiful I in fact when I was at a time in my life where I was really low I something had happened tremendous and I could not sleep I'm an Janette and I went downstairs I read first John and it comforted me so much first time for one beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits you're gonna have more than one battle oh yeah everyday everyday whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know ye the Spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God what's he talking about and this is the spirit of Antichrist where we have heard that it should come and even now already is is it in the world year of God little children and have overcome them we're believing that fully because greater is He that is in you NAND heat is in the world they they are there of the world therefore speak they of the world in the world hear them we are not of God he that knoweth God hears us he that is not of God here that's not hereby we know the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of error our pastor here has went on the internet put teaching after teaching after teaching after teaching the Bible says the words that I speak Jesus said what the words I speak are spirit and truth and life I'm Adam now here's another test you could always use we find out that Judas Iscariot came right down and went on rejoicing and preach the gospel come back hollering is shouting and have a big time with the rest of the sciples Matthew 10 sing Matthew 10 chapter 10 he says but he followed the disciples ride long yet the incarnated devil and come right along as Jesus was incarnated God and Cain and Abel from the Garden of Eden but when it come time to go to Pentecost and get the blessing he showed his colors that look the Prophet gives another test and when you go to talking about being born again hey brother god bless you oh praise the Lord good seeing you again brother of Allah hey man remember when you got the Holy Ghost and this and that and what was a like you know when the Holy Ghost this and the Holy Ghost adds and man isn't he wonderful when he just feels the presence of God comes into you and you start shouting and you get on the altar and you bawl your eyes out and you have a new birth and you explain exactly how it happened to you what will the other person say well he had the exact same experience or well he changed the subject will he dodge it well yeah oh that's good brother awesome now remember when I was praying on this brother they got healed on this net let's focus on the baptism the Holy Ghost when you became a new creature if you became a new creature and you all became new creatures and when you go into talking about being a born again receiving the baptism the Holy Ghost 9 times out of 10 them spirits will show their colors what they are because what that spirit don't want to go to Pentecost let alone talk about it I like these little nuggets that the Prophet goes near ways to ways to see you know test the spirits Johnson test the spirits try them oh you're an apostle okay let's talk a little bit you know the pastor before invites anyone in it should have a little interview with the brother see where they're at right amen now remember when I was down there measuring that oil pit and I pulled it up in 666 right there and I was like oh god Marcis I wiped it clean and I started thought about it Lord what what were you trying to show me there what were you trying to show me there what were you trying to show me there according to the scripture when does the mark of the beast take place when does someone take the mark of the beast why is it why is the mark of the beast gonna have to become a law why has not everyone in the mark of the beast taken the mark of beasts yet if they need a law if if they have to force everyone to make a choice and they've not taken their choice yet what must be present this is what's coming to me as I'm thinking I said Lord why did you show me to get nice like Oh God Merson a wipe it off things I could because you know we don't not to do with that we have to go back to the scripture very simple and Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bare Cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord right you know that's the second line of Bible and she again bare his brother Abel and able to keep her the Sheep but came to the till at the ground and the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord I was just had a when I was preaching in the hills of Chiang Mai and the mountains there we went to as a special celebration of the acha tribe and you know it was on their altars fruit and vegetables filled the entire altar area and I'm sitting there going right it's like fruits on the altar again for what a reason I don't know why why they were doing that exactly as I asked around they said it was to to celebrate the first fruits I don't know if I'd put it on the altar oh man because that was to scriptural for me to feel good about and Abel he also brought the first thing was flock and the fat deriving the Lord had respect and able into his offering but in the cadences offering in that respect and Cain was very wroth with his count and his countenance fallen and look what takes place and the Lord said how would the Lord how would the Lord speak to him he would have to be he had to have come down right if you look at the scripture every time someone takes the mark of the beast the Holy Ghost was there and the Lord said unto Cain why art thou wroth why is thy countenance fallen in fact the Holy Ghost tries to lead him to salvation now look what the Prophet said he said and he said let them both grow together as the church natural begins to get formal and ungodly and the church spiritual is receiving greater gifts and powers from above but they're going they're both going into seed and as the world gets more wicked the church gets more powerful email they cannot be deceived their senses exercised to discern what's true and what's false a man they want more of God to design more of the gifts of spirit lying more of God himself they met I don't mean all that's called church I mean the church the born-again believers not by membership not by this but by the spirit baptized into one body Amen praise be to God and now look if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted yes and if this doest not well look he gives them Deuteronomy obey or disobey sin lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him and Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass when they're in the field that Cain rose up against his brother and slew him and the Lord said Akane look he comes God comes down again visits him gives him warning number one says just do like this and you'll be accepted Cain walked away and did the opposite workers Matthew 7 workers of iniquity I wonder why in the seventh chapter 7 Church age and Cain rose up against his brother and slew him and the Lord said where is Abel thy brother and he said I know not am I my brother's keeper and he said where has he said what has thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crieth up to me from the ground and now thou art cursed from the earth right here in the presence of God he turned God down which has opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thine hand jump down then to verse 15 the Lord said to him therefore whosoever slayeth Cain vengeance shall be taken on him Sevenfold and the Lord sent a mark upon Cain lest any finding him should kill him look at verse 16 and Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the Land of Nod on the East of Eden he was in the presence of the oil where God comes down and now he has to make a choice obey or disobey Cain went out from the presence of the Lord now watch the first thing he done tell me he says so Cain went out from the presence of the Lord there he made his mistake and there is where you'll make your mistake and there is where I'll make the mistake ever the very minute we walk out of the presence of God Cain went from the presence of the Lord and twelve the nod the East of Eden see how religious it was it went to the east side east side remember I taught on the East Gate years ago he took the mark and remained religious he stayed and eating on the east side tavern a cold opening on the east side hey man laws well notice the second the first coming of Jesus Christ God the Holy Ghost comes down the oil is right there he starts preaching eating my flesh drink of my blood do these things if you don't drink my flesh drink my blood and eat my flesh he said there'll be no life in you you have no part of me if you don't do this did he explain it he never explained it and they said what this is a hard saying john 6:66 from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him the oil was present at the time of the mark of the beast the oil God was right there where am i leading up to Matthew 19 and behold one came came unto him saying good Master look at the fruits of the spirit sweet and kind to God and flesh good Master said you'll rule over you're my master what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life and he said to Wycoff now me good there is none good but one he said that is gone he says but if thou will enter into life keep the commandments and he said to me which Jesus said thou shalt not murder thou shall not commit adultery thou shall not steal thou shalt not bear false witness honor thy father and mother mother he says and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself the young man said to him all these things have I kept from my youth up what lack I yet he realized he had done perfect but something within him knew he did not have eternal life yet something within him said man there was this great prophet he's now on the scene and man I I've done well have kept myself absolutely pure group and what in a good home a man did on business he wise and although is the world to make money he kept in the Bible said I'll bless you if you keep my Commandments and he's done that God blessed him and Jesus said if thou be will be perfect go and sell all that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me and when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had many great possessions he went and left the presence of God because he could have come and follow me he had the option to be one of the disciples which what would have been one of the twelve Thrones up in heaven or even greater he had that option but he chose to leave the oil the presence of God in that day let me ask you a question did his blessing stop did he did he have a nervous breakdown fell apart and was a beggar on the streets or of his rest of his life the Prophet picked it up what in the next parable or whatever he said he became a very very rich man in his crumbs fed Lazarus one did God quit blessing him no he didn't still had and had the mark of the beast and was blessed gain is not godliness but godliness with contentment is great gain it doesn't matter what your financial ticket looks like it doesn't look like how you feel physically how you're doing right now does not matter are you in the Holy Ghost amen and is the Holy Ghost in you yes siree that's great game absolutely and we're all heading that way soon anyhow we're gonna be on we're gonna be on the streets or however but God will take care of us each one we will have to walk away from our homes we'll have to walk away from this and that because we will not take the mark of the beast and the Lord I'll say latest the Lord made it a little easy for me because I already lost a house so it's not too hard to walk away it's just trust me it's just a house I built that thing it took me an entire here but when you lose it you realize unless God allows you to keep it it's not yours in you don't be scared to let anything go your material goods mean absolutely nothing how happy do they really make you oh that brand-new car lessness let me tell you something ten years that thing's gonna be needing some repairs and it's gonna cost you in the bills are gonna hit at the wrong time at the wrong moment and your get this big begging and praying and trust me it's better to be without and have God forsake everything why would you want to keep either war when you can lose your soul oh my goodness you know we were fully ready to go and do whatever God would have us to do it by God's grace and you know he knows how to work each one of us he'll get us there have no don't even worry about don't fret just continue or like the private said about that persons that just continue on maturely go as you will and just wait on God it'll come you know we'll be all right amen now let's continue on here look at Steven now starts full the Holy Ghost starts preaching to this group here he says heaven is my throne he says earth is my footstool what house will you build me say at the Lord or what is the place of my rest hath not my hands made all things and then what the Holy Ghost kicks in and says you stiff nicht stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears you do always resist the Holy Ghost as your father's did so do ye which of the prophets have not your father's persecuted and they have they have slain them with shoot which shewed before the coming of the just one of whom you have now been portrays and murders he called them out who also received the law by dispensation of angels and have not kept in all them prophets and when they heard these things they were cut - they're they're hard to the national and with their teeth but he being full the Holy Ghost looked up steadfastly and heaven saw the glory of God in Jesus standing on the right hand of God and said behold I see heavens open and the Son of Man is standing on the right hand and then they cried out with a loud voice stopped their ears and ran upon him with one Accord right there they took the mark of the beast in the presence what of the holy ghost of a man of the Holy Ghost Ananias and Sapphira brought someone falls before Peters feet he said you're a dead man you're a dead woman what they took the mark of the beast right in front of the oil amen but to reject the truth then the devil seal seals the ear faith cometh by what hearing and if your ear is sealed sealed you don't hear it anymore Oh nonsense I don't believe that stuff your pastor he never told us that he's got four college degrees he's better than these holy rollers go on your ears are sealed there's many times I've done spiritual scriptural batters battles with people and God will allow things naturally to happen one time I was in going toe-to-toe on baptism this and that and and I was dealing with an older man and this and however and it was in a darker room and I started I think we were hitting baptism or Godhead or something and he grabbed his Bible he said I can't see hold on and he went to the corner where there was a light he tried to check what I was reading was right but he said I can't see I said that's and I and at that time I just kind of quit the argument I said that's okay all's well just let him be because I knew exactly what he was saying he could not it doesn't saints of God I'm learning - you hid the gospel one time I just let's see what God does if you try to talk anyone into it trust me you can talk him out of it I've been there done that God had mercy now Pope Leo great he reigned from 440 to 461 oh he thought exact he thought he was doing exactly what was right coming to the church before him was Victor and he was a rat too he's dealing with these Pope's and come in there and how he put the Christians to death and everything else so all these Pope's come and started murdering all the Christians and look at the prophet and then he started all this and then who he says started all this putting it legalized murder you who was seen Augustine of Hippo that's exactly who did it well what's it so important st. Augustine had a great opportunity once so says the history to become a great man and be filled with the Holy Ghost he sat in the back of the yard there in Lyons France at that grace course Iranians had taught he was right in the messengers school learning about the Holy Ghost learning about the mysteries of God learned the truth sounds like today yes and them and same Arnie sit in the schoolyard and the Holy Ghost come to him but he refused to accept it Holy Ghost comes refused takes the mark of the beast and the what the prophets say he become true child twofold the child of Hell then he was to begin with when he come right down the hippo Africa where he said in school or is the market which take place when the Holy Ghost comes down or the present somehow comes to an individual Hebrews 10:26 if we sin willfully after they received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins have not we received the truth we have not received anything more actually we received actually more than what Paul had revelation we have the fullness of the truth and if we were to reject this knowledge after we come to it he says there remaineth no more sin sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful looking for of a judgment of firing a nation which shall devour the adversaries he that despised Moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses of how much sorer punishment shall ye which shall be thought worthy who have trodden under the foot of the Son of God and hath counted the blood of the Covenant oh ma where he was sanctified an unholy thing into this and has done despite unto the spirit of grace what you've come to encountered no good you've actually done to the Holy Ghost the blood of the Covenant communion we must come worthily unto the communion drink that wine in that unleavened bread with sincerity fully repented and say Lord keep me I do this in remembrance of what you did on Calvary when he accepted Jesus Christ accepted his destiny to die for our sins you know the Holy Ghost would have never been sent if he would not have denied we would not have eternal life unless he would have died if that death would have never taken place you could have never been Queen of Heaven you'd never been the bride but it took one man he had all of it within him and he said I must release this there God has a plan and I've got to release what's in me because this is what my children need a man I want to start a new race say man I want someone not just you and not just man but someone with God join with God in man hey man somewhat of a new creature a man this is if you ever received the Holy Ghost you are not who you were hey man you better we better realize and wake up who we are you are a cold and predestinated bride amen yes every time the devil comes to you you have the right and authority to put him in his place you tough you don't feel if you feel sick and body said I rebuke this I don't have a time for this and I'm moving on I meant to do it to myself many times get a plane here pain there and I'm working shoveling and I'm just about can't shovel anymore because the pain hurts and I just laid my hands on us and I rebuke this devil in the name of Jesus Christ I don't have time I have to get this job done and I have to pay my bills and I kept on going on within the day it was gone because you have to do what you got to do I don't have time to sit in and go to a hospital and do this this I have to get healed right now and I believe it's going to happen whether I feel it or not I am healed you have to purpose it determines in your heart we let the God raise up that faith that's that I am healed amen I was healed back then and I'll receive it now hey man praise God oh I love that anyhow okay we'll keep you much longer here borderline believers where did the majority of Israel take the mark of the beast' Kennish Bernina God said go Moses said Oh out at the spies was a 12 spies went out there to brought forth good reports 10 brought back false and because the police the people believed the 10 false reports even though they were true it was false music as against the scripture it absolutely looked true to the natural life but if you take the Word of God and understand what the Word of God is greater than what you see if you had a faith and understanding to say hey that what God promised in his word is more real than what I see that giant right there was gonna die just like the rest of them cuz the Word of God said so this land is ours the only way we could take the land is him to go so he's got to go somehow and God would do it yes but when they received that false report they died right there natural spiritually yes Jesus Christ said what they're dead eternally from there on out amen now going back to what I taught on a couple weeks ago why is this so powerful I taught on the days the open book I shared this with your pastor earlier and brother Jesse I and all administers and whoever is to witness whatever and they we've used these scriptures for years and years and years but I've never understood why they were an easy therefore say the seed Lord God I will even gather you from the people and assembly out of the countries where you have scattered and now give you the land of Israel and they shall come thither and they will take away all the detestable things where of and all the abominations are from thence and I will give them one heart and I'll put a new spirit within you and we'll take the stony heart out of their flesh and we'll give them a new heart of flesh is this the baptism of the Holy Ghost no see q18 therefore I will judge you out o house of Israel out everyone out according to his ways saith the Lord God repent and turn yourselves from all your transgressions so a nikka we will not be your ruin cast away from you all your transgressions whereby you have transgressed and make you a new heart and a new spirit why we without die o house of Israel if I have no pleasure in the death of him that diet saith the Lord God wherefore turn yourselves and you shall live is this the map to the Holy Ghost no this is now the baptism the Holy Ghost this is the full work of God I would take you from among the heathen and gather you of all countries and bring them into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you what was that rockbox vision by that sister of dream there was a strong man dressed like a farmer whoever he's pouring water into the rock box and it cleaned the mountain off all the dust and debris all the filth was and the I believe real answer that was him pouring it in their clean water what clean Word of God showing what pure sanctification and from your all your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you a new heart will I give you in a new spirit will I put within you is that new spirit the Holy Ghost no and I'll take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I'll put a new heart of flesh and I'll put my spirit within you that there is the baptism of the Holy Ghost but why is it so important why is this brought in the days the open book because in the days of the open book when all the mysteries open it shows the true baptism of the Holy Ghost it shows you that you must be born again it shows you we must have a I was like this not a dry eyed confession but something where you died out at the altar not just a nice not look what he says he says now watch his spirit was different from your new spirit and many people get the new spirit and they think they got the Holy Spirit they get a feeling happy and jump around and maybe they do a couple of things religiously and they think they got the Holy Spirit though oh no the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit makes you act different the Holy Spirit makes you think different the Holy Spirit was put right in the middle of your new spirit building it's the work he's building building building you were to out the new image he says and your spirit was put right in the middle of your new heart the new heart the new spirit in the middle of the new heart God said I'll put my spirit in you but he's breaking the difference down between the new spirit and his spirit that is a very very important revelation that's a very important understanding he says a new a new heart will I take he says there's three of it a new heart I'll take away the stony old sterner stony heart away that's the old different heart you have and I'll give you a new spirit now many times there's been a terrible mistake the people has thought sometimes that that new spirit was the Holy Spirit but it isn't it's a new spirit God gives you a new why you couldn't even get along with yourself with your old spirit how are you going to get along with the Holy Ghost God had to give you a new spirit so he could get along with his spirit I was working downtown Toledo to high-rise and I come up to meet the maintenance guys because they're gonna show me around all these things and I shook on my hands and I said hello and he said hello and I thought he's a Christian turns out he was a Christian but he was a Baptist but he had such a sweet spirit around him and I shared the word and he's a gone all that now you know this man but he had a new spirit but many people would say oh my goodness he's full the Holy Ghost just feel the head thing around him feel the way he treats you and how he looks at you and listen Ed and how he cares about every single thing must be right brother Simon okay okay we tackle this toilet up this business and he was just really particular on how he wanted to help me in every kind of way he had a real Christian spirit about him but you did not have the Holy Ghost because I gave him the word test I hid baptism I said brother oh no you know let's just die you know it's okay and but he turned down the word absolutely now in closing I don't probably been long I want to read you something I know the snake this is mark of the beast has been kind of negative I'm not trying to I'm just there's things coming we are really the next elections coming up what if Trump doesn't get re-elected we have what we look at what we had before Antichrist Antichrist what will be the next one what if I heard there's almost sexual runnings and I'm a democratic I hope there's there's a there's a lot of crazy things out there I want to read this to you to encourage you at the end here this is a testimony of earnest family called the high calling of God given by brother Brant given by for the RAM to Ernest brother Ernest family the RAM told her and family to write a book of his life story which you can now read below in his exhortation ok this is just a this is just a couple paragraphs here but I want to I want you to read this I want you to soak this in this is beautiful if God has called you this is his testimony if God has called you to be really like Jesus in in all your spirit he will draw you into a life of crucifixion and humility he will put you on such demands of obedience that he will not allow you to follow other Christians and in many ways he will seem to let other good people do things which he will not let you do can you identify who praise God other Christians and ministers who seem very religious and useful may push themselves pull wires and work schemes to carry out their plans but you cannot do it if you attempt it you will meet you will meet with such failure and rebuke from the Lord as it will make you make you sorely penitent others can brag about themselves ministries in their work their success or their writings but the Holy Spirit will not allow you to do any such thing if you begin to he will leading you into such deep mortification that will make you despair it despise yourself and all your good works man this is encouraging I'm a complete failure thank God I am so thankful for the blood of Jesus Christ I am so thankful for him dying and coming him down and raising again and filling us with the Holy Ghost that is the only thing I can glory in it's what he did others will be allowed to succeed and making great sums of money or having a legacy left to them or in having luxuries but God may supply you daily because he wants you to have something far better than gold and that is a helpless dependence on him that he may have the privilege of providing your needs day by day out of the unseen Treasury let me tell you something I am a professional union plumber journeyman and if you would talk in private honestly with my boss and my other form in there and say hey how could a plumber side and if they're honest they will tell you the guy can't remember anything the guy's not that large he works hard but he works hard I am NOT being humble I'm being honest and factual I am NOT putting myself I am being honest and factual I am depending on Jesus Christ to get me through every day of plumbing because I'm just not that smart I'm being honest and that's why I'm telling you this because I can only be transparent but God may supply your daily you daily because he wants you to have something far better than gold and that is a helpless dependence on him that he may have the privilege of providing your needs day by day out of the unseen treasury the Lord may let others be honored and put forward but keeps you hidden away in obscurity because he wants to produce some choice fragrant fruit for his coming glory which can only produced be produced in the shade how many shade dwellers do we have here nothing big nothing famous nothing this is nothing that but you stays out of everything just God keeps him right out of protected God will let others be great but keep you small he will let others do a work for him and get the credit for it but he will make you work and toil without knowing much without much knowing much how much you are doing then to make your work still more precious you will that others get the credit for the work which you have done and this will make your award ten times greater when Jesus comes where the RAM told us me on the right these testimonies be content godliness with contentment is great gain as my as your pastor my old pastor brother Jesse said he said Bo Sai we only have small small parts to play in this lot in life brother if you are here to lead songs and play that guitar you do it with all you got be the best you can Lydia all you brothers sisters if you're here to listen and to support your pastor you listen support your pastor pastor what do you want me to do what can I do for you today I have just kind of just got reorganized back in my old my new home back in Grand Rapids here tiny tiny house I call my pastors but I can't what do you let me do today you're needing me to do it this day you let me do this do that I'm just getting behind the gift the Holy Spirit will put a strict watch on you with a jealous love and rebuke you four little words and feelings or for wasting your time which other Christians seem never seem distressed over keep us in this Lord O Lord if I'm not there bring me to this I want him to get all the glory so make up your mind that God is an infinite Savior I'm sorry it's been a sovereign and has a right to do as he pleases with his own he will not explain to you a thousand things which may puzzle your reason in his dealings with you and the other on your unanswered questions here Lord why is my life like this why Lord why am I going through this he may never even tell you but he wants to magnify himself through that your life he wants to sometimes keep you totally confused and just say keep on going well understanding it farther better by and by cheer up my brother and my sister he will not explain to you a thousand things which may puzzle your reason and his dealings with you God will take you at your word if you absolutely will yourself to be his slave just die out what do you only do today Lord he will wrap you up in a jealous love and let others people say and do many things that you cannot do or say settle it forever that you are to deal directly with the Holy Spirit also that he is to have the privilege of tying your tongue or chaining your hand or closing your eyes in the ways that others are not dealt with God granted now when you are so possessed with the loving God that that you are in your secret heart pleased now when you are so possessed with the loving God that you are in your secret heart pleased and delighted over this particular personal private jealous guardianship and management over the Holy Spirit over your life you will have found the vestibule of heaven if you willfully died out to yourselves and him put him number one he will keep you in such a place you will be his little secret love totally only sold out to him you have eyes for no one else and he will love you just accordingly if you look at a child a father and a father over his child a son or daughter if that father really loves that child I'll say this maybe it's a special child or or however that father will hover over that child and be very militant look very harsh well how come he is this and and and and dad you're making me do this well he gets to do this like I said you do this and you do that accordingly he's my son as well or he's my daughter as well but you are a little I want you to keep you here special from me maybe this great one over here doesn't get as much communion with God as you might get with him maybe this great one isn't giving God any time and maybe says maybe he wants communion with you someone that was willing to spend hours and hours in the prayer closet yes you make Stan saints of God I know I'm a slow teacher and I'm a little how I can't you know how I am I thought many times but I hope this was a defining to you to keep in mind great battles ahead remember if that mark of the beast is going to become a law and the majority of the world will take the mark of the beast at that time remember the Prophet said said that he that that that counsel that image will try to stop the bride what does that say about the bride the fullness of the Holy Ghost will be in her midst it will be God on earth one more time in bride form and only at that time can the mark of the beast come amen you Jesus Christ is not gonna be silent forever he's going to roar and blast and he's going to announce his coming to you no one knows the day that knows the day nor the hour but we will know the season the saints of God we are seeing things coming now some of these stories I shared through Martin have just happened I've experienced them the devil is roaring he is fighting to to nail we can cast them out daily but I'm telling you what he's coming back he is not going to quit I'm telling you right now he's not gonna quit but neither are we the Bible says that we put our face like a flint an adamant stone fearless and if we cast the devil out he don't move we cast it out again and we hold by faith and he will move I don't know when but he will move the devil cannot stop this move of Jesus Christ this next book of Acts is going to be unstoppable God has gone to take her off the scene because she would take over remember if God is in the bride what did Jesus Christ do when he came down he destroyed the devil's kingdom what are those in the book of Acts do they destroy to keep Devils Kingdom and if we produced that same Viet that that if that branch comes out again and we produced another book of Acts it will destroy the devil's kingdom again so Lord will have to swoop down and take us before we produced the Millenium premature let's bow our heads do you believe that you're the bride if there's anything on your heart if you need prayer for anything just raise your hands acknowledge it before the Lord speak to him real quick here anything wrong we've done just say Lord forgive us he's that quick he's he's a long-suffering God if he can put up with 40 years of the Israelites murmuring complaining and they didn't have 200 extra million demons on them didn't have to go out in the world and hear rock and roll every day and cuss words and filth and they didn't have to see billboards and all those things surely God can forgive us let's bow our heads your other father Lord Jesus we just love you and though we just pray Lord you had your way you said everything you wanted to say and Lord Jesus Lord we are going to be patient over there my pastor backhauling been going through the statue of a perfect man when he had patience and he really really reiterated some of the things that the Prophet is through a prophet and said Lord and you know that the if you could sum up patience in one word or two or three words it would be just have patience with Jesus Christ and Lord all we would want your kingdom come now and though we'd want to be the rapture right now and though we want to be have that refilling in that ladder ain't right now Lord we are gonna wait on you but we have full confidence Lord and your being we know that you are in full control we know that you know everything is going to happen and Lord we take full consolation God the Lord you have something good plan for each one of their lives here Lord and Lord you have something good and not evil for them nor do you have a perfect way Lord and great blessings at the end of the road know what I pray you you would deal with each one Lord just like Ernest family Lord make each one Lord a little love same of yours got an order set aside just for you boy if we're not given the spotlight or me we just you just keep us happy and joyful Lord for the Holy Ghost in the shade who loved you so much rest of people Lord you know how you know how if she gave me as Lourdes it might not be the the Lord Jesus Lord I believe you spoke today in order might not be the jumper in shower or this Lord I hope you show me one things last week more than I want to convey that fall keep us calm or maybe never be the same we love you so much and the name Jesus Christ let's just sing that song [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
