he'd be here right in the midst of us whenever two or three are gathered in his name and then we respond back and say to him now aren't welcome in this place amen not just in this physical room but to come right into our hearts amen amen we could see that when he you know one day he came into a dark world Amen that was formless without void and I says the Spirit of God brooded over the face of the waters and look what he did with this world amen and he has come to do the exact same thing to your heart amen hey man let's just open our Bibles to the book of second kings chapter four I want to speak a message called making room for the word Amen making room for the word I thought that song was perfect for the message this morning amen second Kings chapter 4 we'll start with the eighth verse and we'll go all the way on down to the 17th 17th verse sir amen and it says and it fell on a day that Elijah passed to shoot him where was a great woman and she constrained him to eat bread and so it was that as oft as he passed by he turned thither tea bread and she said unto her husband behold now I perceive that this is holy man of God which passeth by us continually let us make a little chamber I pray thee on the wall and let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and a candlestick and it shall be that when he cometh to us that he shall turn in thither and it fell on a day that he came thither and as he turned into the chamber and he laid there and he said to get haze' his servant call this shunammite woman and when he had called her she stood before him and he said unto him talking to a haze of there and he said unto him say now unto her behold thou has been careful for us with all of this care what is to be done for thee would sow be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the host as she answered I dwell among my Norman people she was content amen amen and and he said what then is to be done for her and go hazy answered and said verily she hath no child and her husband is old and he said call her and when he had called her she stood in the door and he said about this season according to the time of life thou shalt embrace a son and she said nay my lord staff in thy hand and go thy way if it's Nate or she said nay my lord thou man of God do not lie unto thy handmaid and the woman conceived and bare a son at that season that Elijah has said unto her according to the time of life just about a year later she bore a child just like the Prophet had set a man let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father thy word is great and mighty and true Lord Lord we just thank you for how how rich it is every little every little bit of it Lord we love Lord and we just love your word father so Lord we just pray father as you have come into this room father we've opened up our hearts unto you father that the Lord let not that I would come and preach your word Lord but that you would come and preach your word through me father and surely we know that we will be blessed Lord by everything that you say to us Lord so we just pray Lord that you'd have the preeminence here this morning take the highest place Lord if there be anything you desire Lord we just want to make room for you in our hearts in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen hey man god bless you you can be seated Amen you know if you're if you remember I know it's been preached here several times about how the Bible says over in Amos 3:7 that sure surely the Lord will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets amen and so the servant his servant Elijah here was a prophet of the Most High God a mana you know prophets are about their father's business amen there our prophet is going you know he a prophet never really knows exactly what he's gonna be doing from day to day but he just goes as the spirit leads him that's how prophets are special built men of God that can hear especially from God and they go and they're always about their father's business and they go and they do whatever their father tells them to do amen so the prophet Elijah here as he was traveling from where he lived continually going about his father's business it always happened that as he was walking down the path that he just happened to walk by this shoot and I might woman's house Amen as she watched him go by constantly back and forth back and forth as she began to realize that this is a man of God amen this is a man of God as she told to her husband and she read to first you know first they say well let's just give make sure he has food upon the journey you know and so they stopped him you know if you if you want anything sire thing we'll give you bread here we gave you a little bit of water and and and then that you can be about on your way amen but after so much time began to pass and they really began to cherish this man of God and began to love this man of God that's the woman said to her husband you know let's just make a little room so that as he's going about his father's business whatever is that the Lord is leading him to do that if he be tired at all or weary at all that he'd have a room here right on her house he could just stop right in here and rest for a while amen and so they they built this little room amen and and what amazes me is okay so they made room for the Prophet amen they built a little place they added on they tore down the wall and they and they and they added on their you know off to the side there of their house and and as they added on there they made it up they fixed up the place just right you know and they put in a little bed in there made it nice and comfortable and we stuffed it with something nice and soft you know and then they put a little stool in there and a table so we could sit there and a little lamp and meditate on the Word of God maybe if you had in the writings of David or the songs or whatever he might have had maybe even something for Moses I don't know if he carried you that with him but but if he did he could have a little lamp sanika laid out on the table there meditate and speak to us his Lord and Savior yell amen and and just a place where the word could be comfortable amen because the word comes to the prophets and now the Prophet had come to their house and they made a place inside their house to where the the prophet of the Most High God could be comfortable could be at home a man could have rest amen what a blessing amen what a blessing the owners Elijah so sure enough it came it fell upon a day that Elijah was walking down the path and and they stopped him they said look we've made this room here just for you a man has been sanctified just for you to to lay here to rest here to have a little bit of rest upon your journey and and so it was that he was a little weary so he he just went right on into the room there and he laid down the Bible says amen and I just think about as the Prophet is laying there he's comfortable he's been fed he's been welcomed amen everything's been set up just right for him and as he is laying there something comes on his mind that maybe this woman has an eat a mint and he wants to be a blessing to this woman that has been so kind to him amen so as he so as he is thinking as he as he as he's laying there and that was in verse 11 of second Kings 4 he says and it fell on a day they came thither and he turned into the chamber and he laid there now as he laid there that thought came upon his mind this woman I haven't eat now I don't believe that thought just came from his own natural beat that thought came from the Most High God himself amen the word came to the Prophet amen and as the word was beginning to have mercy on the Shunammite woman amen what does this woman have she might have an eat what let's let's find out whatever she needs and also the prophets beginning to realize that whatever this woman had need of God was willing to fulfill that need all he had to do was find out what the need was and he knew that his God would fulfill that need that's a powerful thing that woman is in a good place you know when she built that little room I don't think she necessarily knew that all of her needs we met just by building that room she wasn't expecting that type of a payoff for building that room but nevertheless even though she wasn't expecting that payoff that was the payoff that she received amen amen amen pays to make room for the word of God amen so as he's laying there he speaks to a sermon get haze' and tells the sermon get haze' go and call the woman and when the woman and when the woman comes to the door of the room that she had built for him and he's coming there and he starts find out what is to be done free what can I do for you can I can I speak to the king for you can I can I do this or can I do that or or what can we do to make you better and the lady says well I'm content I have everything I have need up just happy to hear to dwell amongst my own people and get hazel and Gaye haze' turns to us to his master the Prophet and says but she has no son amen her husband is growing old they're growing old and she desires a child in her innermost heart and and and and she just wants a child so k Hazen knew what her need was and so he spoke that to the prophet and the Prophet immediately turns to the woman and he says about a year from now in this season you shall bear a son Amen right according to the time of life what a blessing amen and sure enough a year after that when it came on that she bore the son all this because she made room for the Word of God she made room for the prophet of the Most High God Amen that carrier of the word amen they made him comfortable and think about as he was laying there they first say made room for the word the word entered into the chamber and it laid there not before the word the Prophet was the word would have come by he'd eat and then he'd keep on going amen amen but now the Prophet with the word of God has come and doesn't just keep going but he enters into the chamber and stays what a blessing the word has now come to stay has come to live come to dwell come to be there amen and now we're seeing the fruits of the indwelling word of in the lie in the in the chamber that they had built for him the fruits of the word in the chamber what a blessing amen a throne of John chapter one a familiar story but John chapter 1 verse 29 speaking about a John the Baptist here I know John the Baptist was a special man he had a special job he had been called to identify God's gift to the earth amen God was sending his gift to the earth which was God's own spirit dwelling in a body of flesh upon the earth and John the Baptist was sent to identify that body of flesh to identify that spirit amen and to make known unto all men that the spirit was coming back to the earth again in a body of flesh the Most High God was coming his son and the body of flesh and to identify him and to prepare a way so that people might recognize him when he came amen so John chapter 1 verse 29 it says the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto Him and saith behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world look John's identifying him amen this is he of whom I said after me come with a man which is preferred before me for he was before me now look John is now identifying this is the same one I've been preaching about this is the same one I've been talking about all this time look I've talked about him I've preached about him I spoken about him but look now he's here amen now he's here verse 31 and I knew him not but that he should be made manifest to Israel therefore am i come to baptizing with water so at one there was a point in time where John Baptist said no Meah didn't know who he was but he was just baptizing with water making and preparing a way for him to come and then verse 32 says and John bare record saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him verse 33 and I knew him not but he now watch this he's gonna say here he that sent me to baptize with water okay the same one that sent John way back the same one that's talked to John that spoke to John and said go and baptize us water go and prepare the way that same one look way looking with that same what voice is gonna say now verse 33 us read that again and I knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom now shall see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost and I saw and bear record that this is the son of God amen so John the Baptist had received a word where there is an audible voice I don't know or just in his my I don't know how was but son of God have been talking to his prophet John the Baptist and spoke to him and said that the Holy Ghost is gonna come to the earth amen I've sinned I've sit I've sinned a man and when you in this is how you're gonna identify him is that the Holy Ghost is gonna descend down from God out of heaven like a dove amen and and you that you're gonna identify him because you'll see the spirit descending upon him and it's the one that the spirit comes on and remains there that will be the sign unto you that this is the son of God the Lamb of God that has come to take away the sins of the world that was the sign that when the Holy Ghost not just the Holy Ghost came and then kept on going but that the Holy Ghost was gonna come and stay on someone was gonna stay and remain and so John the Baptist he's walking along there and all sudden he sees Jesus Christ for the first time there a men and as he sees Jesus Christ all son he sees the Spirit coming down from God out of heaven he's watching us he's like oh my that's just what the voice told me to watch for let me see let me see if is he is the Holy Spirit gonna stay he's watching that dove come down and and it's lands upon the Lord Jesus and he and all sudden goes right into him and he remains there I was like I know that's him that's him the Lamb of God that it was gonna take away all the sins of the world that's the son of the Most High God that's the one that the Holy Spirit is gonna do well in amen now remember now what's the history of this this mysterious Holy Spirit of God I think about you know a lot of people think that the Holy Spirit is this mysterious you know mystery that we don't know anything about or you know uh you know if like like if the folks that believe the Trinity doctrine you're they they take God they split them up into three pieces you know and they and they take here's Jesus that loves you and here's the father they're not sure you know because judgment comes you know from there and then there's the Holy Spirit and they're just not quite sure you know do you pray unto the Father you know but the Holy Spirit is not quite so mysterious as some might think amen because God is a spirit amen and he is holy amen and remember that Jesus was born of the Holy Ghost of the Holy Spirit now but if you go back to the book of Genesis the Bible says now the earth was theirs one of the first times we hear about the Holy Spirit of God it says the earth was without form it was void yes it was dark there was no land just darkness and water covering the whole earth and the Holy Spirit comes he starts brooding over the face of the waters there is nowhere for him to land right there's nowhere for him to go there's no one for him to dwell in a meant there's nothing he can do there the earth is just useless its form there's no life in it there's nothing as the Holy Spirit is brooding over the earth there in the book of Genesis what begins to happen God the Spirit begins to speaking he says let there be let there be let there be let there be and things start you know landmasses start coming up out of the water and and trees and plants and and I was everything and all sudden and he takes a little garden and he creates it over and eat and you know and all sudden the world is a beautiful place now I was now when the Holy Spirit first came it wasn't like that he first came it wasn't producing anything nothing was alive Amen but God made himself a room on the earth a place to dwell the holy spirit came to the Earth's first it was dark as formless as void and there was no place for him to land so he had to create a place he created a garden called Eden where he can and people that he could commune with they meant and God the spirit God came and communed with his people they meant amen why so now there was room for the people so that's the history of the Holy Ghost amen and now now now think about it because when we read here in John chapter 1 there the the same thing that happened to the earth back in the beginning where the earth had become void and formless now the religion of the Jews had done the same thing they become dark without form without void there was no spirit in their religion amen amen there was no room for the Holy Spirit boys spirit could come and brood over the the religion of the Jews but there was no room for the Holy Ghost there there was no room for the spirit there they turned the religion of Jehovah into a dry dead religion and it just forms and and traditions and and all those things and there was no room for the Holy Spirit amen but there had to be a reappearance of the Holy Ghost on the earth amen and there had to be a place for that Holy Spirit to land a man so God God no actually let's let's take let's let's now listen God what'd he do he identified a woman by the name of Mary amen now what why why what was so special about this is there was one place that he could come and he knew a woman that would say be it unto me according to thy word let's turn over to Luke chapter one making room for the Word of God Luke chapter 1 will read from the 26th verse it says and in the sixth month the angel angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David and the Virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou were highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast into her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou hast found favor with God and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name Jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end amen now if there's no end of his kingdom that means his kingdom still has to be here somewhere amen amen now verse 34 and then then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seen I know not a man and angels answer to send or the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore shall that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God so now the Holy Spirit the same Holy Spirit that brooded over the earth in the beginning is now coming and is brooding over Mary amen and what's he gonna do he's gonna create in there a body and so what did Mary have to do first she had to take the audible words of the angel they entered into her ear they went across the field of her mind and as she thought about the word of the angel and thought about it she said that's just right that's just the truth that's just according to the Word of God and she accepted it and she said Lord let it be unto me just like what your word said and right that moment the Word of God fell from her mind down into her heart and fell down into her womb and began to create the body of the Lord Jesus Christ why because a woman made room for the Word of God amen she made room for the Word of God and then the word became manifest in her womb amen as she brought forth a son and named him Jesus and that son was the son of God amen born of the Holy Ghost the Bible says amen now why did the angel leave when he did in verse 38 there it says and Mary said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her at that moment the angel left because he knew his work was done as soon as the word was received his work was done amen it was one thing to speak the word the angel spoke the word but then when he watched Mary responded and he knew that she had received the word and as soon as she received the word he knew that's it there we go the words has been received the work is done and the angel left there was nothing more for him to do his goal was to come and bring the word and to make sure that the word was received the word was received so he left amen and now we know what the fruit of that word was amen amen amen alleluia alleluia now let's turn again over to Matthew chapter 23 now remember Jesus said I come that you might have life and have it more abundantly a mint and God has life to give amen so Matthew chapter 23 let's go further into the life of this Lord Jesus the Holy Spirit still dwelling in him still living it in the same Holy Spirit descend upon him like a dove a Holy Spirit that that couldn't find a place to rest and the religion of the Jews now has found a place to rest in the body of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Matthew chapter 23 oops I turned to the wrong book yeah Matthew chapter 23 will read the thirty seventh to the 39th verse sir Oh Denson I'm sorry let's turn to mark 11 I meant to go to mark 11 I wrote it down long I apologize there we go mark 11 will read the first verse there then will quote down to the seventh verse mark 11:1 says now when they came nigh to Jerusalem unto Bethpage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives he sent forth two of his disciples now if you remember this story Jesus is coming back into Jerusalem he sends his disciples ahead of him and tells him there will be a little donkey that they are tied up over here you go up and grab that donkey Amen if anybody asks you why are you taking him remember the Lord Jesus said you just tell them that the Lord has need of him and bring that donkey to me Amen so the disciples go and they go into Jerusalem and they do exactly what the Lord Jesus asks them to do now let's go down to verse 5 amen or verse 7 and they brought the colt that's a donkey and they brought the Colt to Jesus they cast their garments on him and he said on him and many spread their garments in the way and others cut down branches off the trees and threw them in the way what's what's happening here Jesus is entering into Jerusalem amen the Holy Spirit is returning to Jerusalem amen now remember the temple when the Temple of Solomon was dedicated the Holy Spirit came down upon the temple remember amen now we're in that same geographical location and here's Jesus with the Holy Ghost residing inside of him amen entering back into Jerusalem amen and many verse a and many spread their garments in the way and others cut down branches off the trees and strew them in the way and they that went before and they that follow cry saying Hosanna Hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord blessed be the kingdom of our Father David and that cometh in the name of the Lord hosanna in the highest and Jesus entered into Jerusalem and into the temple and when he had looked around about upon all things and now the evening tide was come and he went out unto Bethany with with the twelve now look what just happened here Jesus the word it's coming back to Jerusalem he enters into Jerusalem he enters into the very heart of Jerusalem which is the temple he looks around at all things the Bible says there verse 11 and when he had looked around about upon all things the evening tyke came and he left he went back out to Jerusalem the word came went into the temple he looked around and he left the word did not stay and went back out now back now now it would have been a blessing unto the people of the temple if the world will come state but instead the word went into the temple he looked around and he left now I remember just two chapters from here the disciples and Jesus are walking through the temple and they're leaving the temple and the disciples were whole look at this great building and how wonderful this temple is and how beautiful has been made and and he and Jesus looks at me he says I tell you the truth not one stone will be left upon another what was he doing is pronounced it come he looked at the temple he looked at their worship he looked at no matter how much they worshipped him they waved that palm branches they sung Hosanna Hosanna to the highest Amen he goes in the temple he looks around and he prays his judgment upon that temple saying not one stone will be left upon another the word came and now the word is leaving pronouncing judgment after looking around amen amen now let's now let's go down now to John chapter 20 now remember the Lord does the same thing when he comes to us he comes we invite him into our heart we worship we sing Hosanna Hosanna unto the highest we worship Him we praise Him they comes into our heart and he looks around at all things and to find out if we've made room for the word of God or not amen John chapter 20 verse 19 it says then the same day evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and said unto them peace be unto you and when they when he had so said he showed them his hands and his side and then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord now think about it his disciples you know Jesus had already been crucified he had already died amen and now the disciples they've been sad they had followed this Lord Jesus Christ for three and a half years they knew that he was the son of God they knew that the Holy Spirit was dwelling on the inside of that man they knew that he was the son of God the same one that created the heavens and the earth he could do anything he could speak to this he could speak to the trees he could speak to the waters he could speak to the wind he could speak to the fish they had seen him do so many miracles they seemed raise the dead they knew that this man was the Almighty God in flesh they had no doubt about it in their mind they knew that this man was the Holy Spirit himself in bodily form what a blessing to realize that what a position those disciples had how would you have liked to have been there and to have listened to him preached to listen to Jesus preach to watch him heal the sick wouldn't even love to have been there wouldn't you have loved to have watched him in action watched him there on you know a Mount of Olives or preaching the sermon on the mount you know and and all those things and and just to see him in action to see the love that he had for the people and all those things because the Holy Spirit is what drove him to to behave like that all of his actions all of his love all of his care all of his compassion that he had when he when he raised the dead we restore back you know and and all those things that he did when he had compassion when he loved the people that was all because the Holy Spirit had love Oh a spirit had compassion and now that same depository of the Holy Spirit the body of Lord Jesus Christ had been rejected by man and upon a cross and he hung upon he hung between heaven and earth and there they crucified him and they were sad they've lost it they've lost their their opportunity they've lost their chance they've they that the Holy Spirit returned back to him again but now they lost it but here they see Jesus as they were gathered together in the room Jesus Christ comes back he appears right in the midst of the room he shows them the holes in his hands they show he shows him the hole in his side and they began to realize that death cannot stop him the Holy Spirit is back with us again amen but now think about those now let's keep reading here amen verse 20 says and when he had so said he showed them his hands and his side and then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord and then jesus said to them and this said Jesus to them again peace be unto you even as my father has sent me so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost think about that people these were not priests these were just fisherman laborers techmakers and now there they grew up in Judaism they've seen all the traditions and all the things and all the things that God but now the Holy Spirit that they always heard about now this God in flesh is breathing upon them and telling them now I want you to receive the Holy Ghost the same way I receive the Holy Ghost amen and now what does the Holy Ghost do remember what happened in the book of Acts as they are all gathered in an upper room they shut themselves in and he told them wait here until you be endued with power on high and they go into the upper room and they're waiting in there they're praying they're repenting they're making all things right they're worshiping their God there they're just rejoicing before the Lord and all of a sudden this thing that Jesus spoke about comes to pass that the Holy Spirit comes into that room like a rushing mighty wind and they are all filled with the Holy Ghost and the same pillar of fire that led the children in the will of the children of Israel back in the wilderness in Moses day that same color of fire reappears again two thousand years fourteen hundred years later in Jesus's day and splits apart into 120 pieces and lands upon their head and the same Holy Ghost is now upon their heads this is the same pillar of fire that they saw upon the temple the same pillar fire there was with the juice on the Tabernacle in the wilderness that same pillar fire that was dwelling inside the Lord Jesus Christ is now upon their heads amen and there were joycie and all sudden what happens the same thing that mary said let it be unto me according to thy word now they are also saying unto them let it be unto us they've rejoiced important about the word and now they're receiving the word and the pillar fire drops right down into their heart and now they have made room for the word of God they've been filled with the Holy Ghost amen now it's no longer just for profits now longer it's no longer just for the ministry but now for every true believer can become a depository of the host the indwelling Holy Spirit amen now the whole same Holy Spirit that brooded over the dark world amen that created a Garden of Eden back then now is Bruton over your heart to do the same thing the same Holy Spirit that brooded over the dark worth in Genesis chapter 1 has now brooding over your heart to see to look upon all things to see if you will make room for him to see if you'd now think about it when that Shunammite woman made room for the Word of God and he went in there and he found that door and he entered into there well he made when that room was made for him what'd he do the word came in to that room that she built for him and he laid down and he rested and as soon as the word found a place to rest inside of there inside that inner chamber the whole sudden the God began speaking to that word began speaking God's voice came right into the inner chamber and said whatever she has need of whatever she desires give it to her and so the same thing happens to us when we when the word comes to our heart he examines all things to see what the condition of our heart is and if we forsake all and we receive him the Lord Jesus Christ amen he says whosoever believeth on me amen the same shall have everlasting life and there is only one form of everlasting life that's the Lord Jesus Christ Himself a man you know when they taught me in Sunday school that Jesus would be in my heart I never realized how how deep of a saying that was but the same Lord Jesus is the same one that created the heavens and the earth back in the beginning the same one that created the heavens on earth and back in the beginning has now come to dwell inside of my heart and Jesus said to his disciples behold all power in heaven and earth is given unto me and now this just like the father has me now I am sending you out into the world and then he came in he looked in their heart and they made all things right and he came and he dwelled in their heart the indwelling of the Holy Ghost now it's like they're back in the Garden of Eden again like it was before the fall communing with their Lord and Savior it's just sometimes I don't know if we realize who is actually trying to get into our hearts amen now think about it when he went when he went into Jerusalem on the donkey he went into the temple where he should have been welcomed and he couldn't find any place to rest amen think about when Noah had the dove on upon the ark he sent the dove out on the Dove went flying over the earth it is just like the Holy Spirit brooding in the beginning the Dove brooded over the the flood waters of Noah's Flood and he could not find a place to rest so he returned back to the ark amen it's a pattern that repeats over and over and over and over again in the scripture and you know that pattern is still repeating over maybe in this room right now this morning at the Holy Spirit right now is brooding over your heart examining all things and tell me you know what is the condition of your heart right now is it as dark as the world was back in Genesis chapter 1 when the Holy Spirit is brooding over it is there is there is there sin there is there anything there have you received the word or not Amen because you know we can't just receive part of the word we have to receive the whole gospel we have to receive every part of it we have to be like Mary and say Lord whatever it is this may seem strange this may seem a little odd I I understand what the preacher is saying sometimes I understand what it is when he says this but do you just spoon the we you see the word in action behind the pulpit you say yes Lord be it unto me according to the Word of God and the Holy Spirit brooding upon your heart waiting to see if you will make a little room for him see if you will make a little chamber and then no longer the word coming by adrià church service and then leaving again afterwards but now once you've made room for the Holy Spirit and he broods over your life he comes to stay he comes to live he comes to dwell he comes to change you he comes to give you power to become a son of God and you're no longer a child of mr. mrs. whoever it is they gave birth to you but now you are a son or a daughter of God amen no longer just of the innate and the natural nature of your parents but now you've been born again of the Living Most High God and he the word has come to you he's come to live inside your heart and he's come to make you a new creature in Christ amen did you know that we're still living in Bible days Bible days are still here on the earth and there are still Bible characters walking on this earth amen and it's no longer just Mary's and Martha's but now it's Troy's Jesse's and Wendy's and veins amen walking on the earth and what is it the same Holy Ghost that brooded in the beginning the same Holy Ghost that brooded over the tabernacle the wilderness the same Holy Ghost that appeared over Saul was tipple when they built it the same Holy Spirit that John the Baptist saw upon the Lord Jesus Christ the same Holy Spirit that appeared in the Upper Room is now in this room right now he created the heavens and the earth he created you and before you know and the Bible says that we would all that we would all that everybody would fall short of the glory of God now what is the glory of God it is His Holy Spirit it is his presence it is him it is the the gravity of his presence is his glory he comes into the room his glory goes out because it's his presence it makes everything humble themselves it makes everything that's this presents amen but he said that all of us would fall short of that glory in Romans three that we would fall short of being able to have that glory dwelling on the inside of us amen why because we were designed our heart was designed to have a room there there will be a depository of the glory of God but we would fall short of that but you know God did two things before the foundation of the world before God created one blade of grass before one minute of time for one tree one animal one plant God did a couple things one thing one thing is that he wrote our names upon the Lamb's Book of Life amen he wrote our names upon Elena's book of life and then you know what he did right after that he went and he slew a lamb the Bible says he's the lairs a lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world a Sulha lamb for those names so it just in case there would be no speck of time where if any one of those names ever fell short of having the glory of God that there would be a blood sacrifice for those names now we have come we've been born on this earth we've manifested the name that God has given us amen but if God has written your name upon the Lamb's Book of Life amen he already has a sacrifice there if you have fallen short of his glory some way somehow which we all have there is a sacrifice there to make all things right so that you can make a room so that the Holy Ghost so you can be like Adam and Eve before the fall walking with God in a perfect garden where he come down in the cool of the day and walk with you and talk with you as you kneel beside your bed and pray amen as as you're in your kitchen doing the dishes that you can talk to him and commune with them why because the glory of God has been restored back to you amen and he's come that you might have life and have it more abundantly he's come to live with you day in day out day in day out not just the word coming by your heart and then disappearing again but now the word has come to dwell and when he comes to dwell and as the word is resting in your heart just like Elijah was resting in that inner chamber as he's resting there amen and as you make room for him amen the Lord says whatsoever you desire let it'll be unto you Amen let's turn or to chapter 15 John 14 sorry John 14:13 listen to what the word says here the word himself spoke the three verses I'm going to read here John 14:13 John 15:7 and John 16:23 three chapters in a row here John 14:13 says and whatsoever let's go to read from verse 12 amen verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever he shall I ask him my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son now let's read 15-7 says if he abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you else read chapter 16 verse 23 it says he that it says and in that day he shall ask me nothing verily verily I say unto you whosoever or whatsoever he shall ask the Father in my name he will give it to you hitherto have you asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy might be full and the same one that said that is here to live in your heart to make that verse come to pass amen amen yo Louis three sister verses to these verses in the book of Esther we won't read them but if you remember in the book of Esther if you were writing down it's Esther five three Esther six why I believe this and Esther 72 and it was worthy saying what's what do you want was where King as Earth is talking to Esther's like what do you want whatever you want you just ask I'll give it to you up to the half of the kingdom there's three verses in Esther three verses in John what do you want what do you whatever you ask it'll be done to you up to the half of the kingdom amen now what what Scott's not saying ask I've opened up my checkbook for you amen now we've come here with claim to be the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ you know when when when my paycheck comes to my bank account my wife has the checkbook the debit card and the credit card amen and you know what I don't have to quiz her ask her how she's gonna spend it because I know that she is my bride and I know that she's faithful with the funds that I have and she goes about if there is a need in my household she goes out and purchases it for the needs of the household and she's been faithful with my checkbook now the Lord Jesus Christ did the same thing right here we are the bride of Lord Jesus Christ and if there be any needs in the kingdom of the Most High God we have the ability to purchase that through prayer and as the word is resting upon our heart and as we begin to have compassion on those the same compassion that the Lord Jesus had and we enter into his compassion and we begin to have compassion upon those who are lost those that are sick those are out of the way those that are depressed depressed and we begin to have compassion on those we open up the checkbook of God we start pleading lord have mercy Lord heal Lord save Lord deliver why because the word is resting upon our hearts amen and we as the Bride of Christ know what is bar about our father's business seeing to the needs of the kingdom a man why because we made room for the Word of God Lord let it be unto me just according to the Word of God amen amen and when Mary had said that that's when the angel departed because he knew the word had left her mind and has sunk down into her heart because she had received every word of God amen we have to be in the same condition we have to be filled with the Holy Ghost you know if you ever thought about how the descriptions of the Holy Ghost of how he fills us about said we'd be filled with the Holy Ghost he said that would be baptized with the Holy Ghost baptism means immersion a meant completely immersed under the power of the water amen because you're immersed in the water amen now to be just like you were baptized with water amen the Bible says repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen so the same the same Baptist just as much as you are immersed in the water you are now to be immersed in all the ills immerse in the Holy Ghost filled with the Holy Ghost completely immersed why so he can have complete control Lord Jesus I have given my heart to you I have forsaken all I have given all unto you lord I pray that you come and fill me with your Holy Ghost that I might be your child that I might be the received the spiritual adoption that I might be about my father's business no longer about the business of my own natural ways but now I've been restored back to the Garden of Eden like it was before the fall now I am your Adam now I am your Eve like I never fell in the first place why because God's had lamb sacrificed just in case we fell short of his glory that we could be restored back to the glory of God amen and now we are the Temple of the Most High God amen when we believe as the father sent me so send I you amen the head of the church is the word amen in whichever way the word says go the church goes with it amen just lure whatever you send your word will be faithful to it amen amen whatever the word says he sent the fivefold ministry to preach the word to bring across the things to our life that is we hear the word coming over the pulpit we say yes the name into it Lord I want to do just what your word says why because we won't be about our father's business we have to be about our father's business amen we're not here to live a lukewarm life we're not here to be a lukewarm Church here to be in the state of revival we're here so that God could come into this room and you know when I when I when someone says Oh what you pray for my brother that's over in California and boa is sick or whatever you know you know what I do I get on my knees I stay Lord somewhere near this man that I'm praying for you have a righteous servant Lord I pray you as sin that righteous servant across this man's path though I pray you would heal man deliver him sins if the man's lost Lord send your righteous server cause his path let him find a church somewhere or something like that so he can find a place where he can be be restored back to where he or right being a little son of God again amen why because God has his righteous servants scattered all over the world he hasn't reserved unto himself and you have an opportunity right now to be 1 of those righteous servants amen they meant you have that opportunity why because you are the depository of the Holy Ghost that you would be the Holy Ghost has been restored back to the earth again and it's you the Holy Ghost in you to do what he ever he has knew if the Holy Spirit has someone in the city that's lost and who s piercing I need to I need to bring this as time time and promise have joined together and it's time for this person here to be restored back to being a son of God again for him to be saved to be filled who kills ready who can I choose who can I send who will go for us and there and as God looks over the city he looks always as oh there's my sister Wendy there's my daughter Wendy a man there's my daughter here a man here's my son here he's ready he's prepared I'm gonna send him to be about my business so this person can be hey they have my checkbook they can purchase anything and and he go and all sudden this person comes across your path and you realize he's sick he needs salvation or he's depressed or whatever it is amen but Jesus Christ came to heal the broken heart amen a man came up to bind up the wounds to set at liberty those that are praised those that are bound amen and so and so when the Holy Spirit is here amen that nothing was he do he sends you and you go in his place why because the Holy Spirit is in you he's resting in you and he can send you you are the righteous servant in this city so if God has something that he needs to be accomplished in the city now he can send you because you are his tool you are the place where the word has come to live in and abide and rest amen from the youngest to the oldest in the room you are the one that he has chosen to live in with if it will make room for the Word of God the Word of God is all-powerful amen and when he comes to live in you that all power and heaven and earth has given unto Him now all power in heaven and earth is given unto you when he comes and lives in your heart that's what he's come to do he's come to dwell in you amen let's just stand hey man if anybody would fall short of the glory of God there is a lamb sacrifice to restore me back to being the Bible character that you were meant to DP we're still living in Bible days God still raises the dead the lame still walk the blind still see amen because of the things that our Lord Jesus Christ has done for us amen let's just bow our heads or word of Prayer Heavenly Father just as much as that shooter might woman made room for you for the word as you the word we're dwelling in your prophet Lord even so we look and we examine our hearts just now father Lauren if we have neglected any way shape or form to make room for you in our hearts we just pray father right now you'd forgive us the Lord that you take some that blood from your own sacrifice from that lamb sacrifice that you made for us that you would cover us with the blood of the light that we might be forgiven of all our sins as we repent of our sins Lord and as we are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord claiming you claiming your name that you have come and fill us with the Holy Ghost or for that's why you paid the price for that we would be restore back to the Garden of Eden like was for the fall although we don't want to be those that worship you the wrong and kneel and praise you but then never make room for you in our hearts amen and we realized that what we were taught in Sunday school about how you come and live in our hearts has such a far deeper vaster more blessed meaning than we could ever imagine that you the most powerful God that created the heavens and the earth is coming by our house come by our heart he's come to live he's come to dwell him we live and move and have our being as long as we like Mary say Lord be done to me according to thy word we've heard what the angel said tonight Lord as an angel is just a messenger we heard what the angel said to this morning Lord we heard the word that you spoke out of your word at Laura we opened up our hearts just now to make room for your word be it unto me Lord we want to be filled with your Holy Ghost and Laura let it be unto us just like it was on the day of Pentecost a man we're 121 number amen and the Holy Ghost came down and descended upon them and the Holy Ghost was living moving breathing on the earth once again and that Holy Spirit has never left it's still here in this room today seeking whom he may end well Laura let it be unto us according to thy word so our brother Jesse comes we just pray follow them if anybody here what is lacking anything whether be in your life or in your heart if you've never given your heart over to Christ if you've never been baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ if you've never had that experience the Holy Spirit filling you to where you now know that all power in heaven and earth has been given unto you and I just pray that then as our brother Jesse comes that you come to the altar we'll pray with you amen and this you can have this experience to where you can be changed for power is given unto you to become a son or daughter of God and you no longer have to live according to the nature of whatever is written on your birth certificate on earth but you'll have a new birth of a child of the Most High King you'll have his attributes his traits you'll have his love his compassion you'll love those that are unlovable amen you could forgive those that are unforgivable amen if those have done wrong for you can look upon and say have mercy upon Lord they don't know what they're doing amen the Lord Jesus Christ as he was dying was crying out and forgiveness to forgive those that did him wrong and even so now we are his sons and daughters are crying out to the lost city that we live in Lord forgive them they don't know what they're doing Lord serum.i Lord send me with your gospel send me to preach your gospel send me to bring them in or the the field is ready but the laborers are few Lord hear my Sydney I've made ruin my heart let's go I want to be about my father's business Lord let it be me for he has chosen you to be the Temple of the Most High God in the city no longer a natural building but now you are to
